okay let's go ahead and get started so
it's pleasure to announce rice a de
Souza who's going to be talking about
statistical physics computer simulation
and probability hi thanks for inviting
me it's a really fun meeting so far and
this talk is going to be quite different
than Dave's and that was beautiful talk
hard to follow up but um I'm going to
talk to you a little bit about it's sort
of more of an overview so I leave half
an hour instead of getting into anything
really specific I'm going to talk sort
of at a high level and show you a couple
models that really illustrate this
intersection between statistical physics
computer simulations and probability
theory which I have this rich interplay
and my own background really comes from
the statistical physics world so that's
been all of my training I've done a lot
of work in computer science as well so
naturally now I'm faculty in a
mechanical engineering department so
this is a new this was as of last
October I joined the faculty at UC Davis
and I'm also in a center called the
Center for computational science and
engineering and so what I'm going to
talk to you today a little bit is about
some models okay and models them can be
really useful on many levels and they
really give us sort of a framework for
thinking about complicated processes so
we might try and simplify the essence
and sort of get a qualitative
understanding of phenomena so models are
really useful for that and sort of
guiding our intuition and giving us some
structured way to think about a problem
and I work a lot with mathematicians so
we're trying to understand phenomena and
get some intuition about what we should
be proving and one of the models that
I'm going to talk to you about was
exactly that a lot of people have worked
hard to try and prove a certain
phenomena and then we found that
phenomena actually wasn't there so it's
not a big surprise that they couldn't
prove it and lately I've been trying to
work a little bit with engineers like
with network engineers and with people
building sensor networks trying to do
some theoretical work before they go and
do any implementation so we've been
doing a lot of modeling in that aspect
as well and really the thing that
unifies all the work that I've done
personally is this concept of self
organization which is when the internal
degrees of freedom of assists
gain some internal organization without
any external control so I've looked a
lot at things like growth of molecular
aggregates and this is a bottle I'm
going to talk to you about today which
is about jamming and pattern formation
okay I really like to point at the slide
so I have to use the microphone and I've
done a lot of work on a network growth
as well as looking at self-organized
networks and and really I want to talk
to you about this intersection between
these fields and I want to think about
probability and statistical physics
which are in the two corners and I
really want to think about computer
science as a discipline distinct from
computer simulation they have overlap
but there are very different things and
this intersection is really rich and has
a lot of interesting shared phenomena
and share techniques and when we go out
from that intersection more along the
computer science line we're unified by
network models so we think a lot about
boolean networks circuit networks
Bayesian networks random networks and
when we go out towards the statistical
physics axis of things we think about
lattice models like the easing model the
pots model diffusion-limited aggregation
and there's common phenomena that unify
all these things basically concepts like
phase transitions and percolation and
there's also tools like computational
complexity theory which unify at their
techniques that we use to study all
these models so even though the
disciplines might be disparate there's a
rich union between them and a lot of
this work when you look at that
intersection and head out towards the
computer science end of thing you find
networks and there's so many concepts
that overlap between the two fields so
there's a lot in statistical physics
we're always trying to deal with
locality so we want to just have to
understand what's going on locally in a
system to predict large-scale behavior
and we want a lot of things to be self
organized and in a network context we
want to have scalable growth so we want
networks to grow indefinitely large
without gaining additional control over
head control and we look a lot at scale
behaviors and we look at how
fluctuations affect the physical models
that we're dealing with and in networks
were very interested in health
fluctuations relate to routing and load
balancing so there's a whole rich world
and that involves the intersection and
an in this network context but today I
really want to focus on lattices so I'm
going to think more about traditional
statistical physics models which are
really rooted in lattice models so so
much of the modern phenomena that we
study in statistical physics is based on
some really fundamental lattice models
so most modern statistical physics the
study is really involving critical
phenomena and phase transitions and the
prototype of a model that shows a phase
transition is the easing model and
extending that is the pots model and
we're really interested in things like
percolation on lattices as well and
different kinds of lattices and there's
also a critical kinetic phenomena that
we study a lot like diffusion limited
aggregation and a model I'm going to
talk to you about today and the bahama
Dalton Levine model and these models are
really highly influential they shape our
thought processes and give us grounding
to move forward so they're really the
cornerstone of modern statistical
physics is thinking about these models
and the interesting thing is that these
same models are studied in probability
theory and so these and a lot of them
are accessible only through computer
simulation so these three fields of
probability statistical physics and
computer simulation are intimately
related by the study of these shared
models and it's very interesting to have
dialogues with people from the disparate
communities because you find that you
can make a lot of progress on your own
work by realizing where your faults were
and so it's it's a it's an area that is
a becoming much more active and there's
been a few workshops at MSR I in the
last couple years I know I've seen
several people in the audience at the
last year's semester that was on
probability statistical physics and
algorithms and so there's there's a lot
of amazing phenomenon going on at that
intersection and what happens with these
models is that they can get very
complicated especially the nonlinear
so I'm interested in dynamical models of
nonlinear phenomena so they can get
incredibly complicated to try and
understand analytically so a lot of what
we have to do is prove through computer
simulation or explore the phenomena
through computer simulation so I think
Dave had a nice example when he was
showing that cock a tool that helps you
prove mathematical theorems so we're
seeing math sort of take on this new
branch of experimental mathematics and
one of the things that's really we have
to keep in mind is that there's
sometimes there's a lot of caveats that
we have to keep in mind when we want to
try and extrapolate between these three
fields and one of the crazy things is
that sometimes we get results from
simulations that contradict theory so
the classic example of this that came
out recently is bootstrap percolation so
people were looking at this model in a
computer implementation and they were
finding that the critical density for
percolation was a particular value and
it had been converging and being over
and over again iterated and the it was
getting to a crisper and sharper value
and then people actually finally managed
to prove the percolation threshold and
the infinite lattice and it had
absolutely nothing to do with the
results from simulation so there were
orders of magnitude separated so what's
going on so that took a couple years to
figure out what's going on and really
one of the cabinets to keep in mind is
what the length and time scales of
interest are and what you your tools
allow you access to so in the world of
simulations we're dealing with really
small length and time scales so it's
whatever is accessible in my computer
clearly even if this is a supercomputer
it's a small length and small time scale
if you look at mathematics almost all
the results are in the asymptotic limit
where we're thinking about infinite time
infinite size systems and physics which
we're really interested in modeling and
kind of lies between these two worlds so
it's not in the finite size of computers
and it's certainly not in the asymptotic
realm either so we really have to keep
in mind what are we trying to explain so
what tools do we need for that
particular phenomena
and keep these caveats in mind and
there's another big caveat when we think
about doing computer simulation and
probabilistic models as well and that is
that a lot of them are discrete time
processes and they rely on synchronous
time updating so you have a game like
checkers where you alternate players and
it's a deterministic process and in a
lot of the models that I study we have
synchronous time and all the dynamics
occur in lockstep and this is makes the
models nice but it sometimes adds
artifacts to the results the phenomena
we that we see in those models so this
is another big caveat that we have to
keep in mind is when is this a
reasonable assumption so there are some
times that things should be synchronous
but it's not true in general and we have
to keep in mind that most of our models
have this this quantity and then there's
also things like lattice effects and
boundary constraints so we have to keep
in mind so I was working on a model and
it's this be ha Middleton Levine traffic
model and I think it's a really nice
illustration of some of these points and
so I'm going to step through this model
and then kind of bring in a few other
models from probability and statistical
physics as we go through this and at the
end sort of give a little bit of an
overview of the lessons that we learn
from these different models so this is a
really simple model it's really
beautiful model and it's a model of cars
moving on a lattice so there's two
species of cars there's red cars and
blue cars and the red cars i'll try to
move to the right and the blue cars try
to move north and they alternate time
steps so on even time steps all the red
cars try and advance one site and on odd
time steps all the blue cars try and
advance one stays one site and they live
on a torus so if you set arow so it's on
a torus it's a 2d torres and what we're
going to do is sprinkle the cars down at
random and let the dynamics run so if we
just had a 1d system like i've drawn
here there's a line of red cars moving
to the right they end up getting spaced
every other one because you move as long
as the site you wish to occupy is empty
so the 1d problem is pretty trivial
as long as the density is less than
one-half all the cars managed to space
out every other car and they all move
with unit velocity at each time step and
as the density gets greater than a half
you'll start getting some cars that are
jammed together and stuck and that Jam
will sort of propagate backwards so in
1d it's a very simple process and what
we're interested in is the 2d model
where we have the right cars and the
blue cars and this was the standard
understanding of the model for since it
was introduced in 1992 so the
understanding was that at low density so
I'm going to point this out to you so at
low density the cars managed to
self-organize onto non-interacting sub
lattices so you get big clumps of red
particles at all move in lockstep so
they're spaced out every other car and
big clumps of blue particles that
likewise move so you can end up with
these stripes that organized through the
dynamics and it's such that all the cars
can now move freely so at low density
the asymptotic state settles down to
this kind of situation where all the
cars move at all time steps and then
when you start at high density you end
up with one big global jam so again this
is on a torus so it's a big Jam okay so
this was the standard understanding and
the thought was that this was a crisp
threshold from free flow to jam so that
it showed a first order phase transition
so this is what people have been trying
to prove for a long time as the
existence of this phase transition and
the critical value of Rho for the phase
transition and so almost all the
progress that has happened has been
numerical and its really funny so the
only things that we can prove our that
if the limit of the density goes to zero
there's no jam and in the limit that the
density goes to one everything jams so
that and but last year during that msri
semester and ander Holroyd and james
martin and do you remember who the third
person is omar angel thank you they did
they extended this proof and in a
beautiful way using some ideas from
subcritical supercritical percolation
theory and they should
that you can now show that thing's Jam
for densities close to one but less than
1 so they extended this proof but it's
still far off in this very high dense
regime so this is what people have been
trying to prove for a long time so I
started out studying this model a couple
of years ago and I wanted to visualize
what was going on and I do a lot of
computer simulations so some probable
asst came to me and said you know can
you help me visualize this so I did and
I started finding the step in the center
so instead of finding these two distinct
behaviors I started finding this sort of
intermediate like structures and they
would last for a long time so I would
leave this running for a week and it
would still be there so I tried to
quantify this so I ran some numerical
experiments and now these are results
for different size of lattices i'm
looking at a square lattice up until now
so it's a torus where the number of
columns and rows are the same and and
the order is at 64 x 64 128 x 128 256 x
256 and 512 squared okay and on those
small lattices of 64 squared I get this
phenomena of that looks like a first
order phase transition so plotted on the
vertical axis is that the average
velocity of all the cars and this is
versus density so for those small
systems up here it really looks like a
first order phase transition everybody
moves with velocity 14 they organized
into those stripes and then at a certain
density right around thirty six percent
they all get jammed but as you start
going to bigger and bigger systems you
see that these sort of intermediate
States emerge and they're not there's
not a broad range of intermediate States
they're all quantized right around the
value of two thirds and as I got to
bigger and bigger systems it became more
crisply quantized and also that window
of phase coexistence broadened so I was
trying to figure out what's going on
here because it really doesn't seem to
fit the standard model so this is what a
intermediate configuration looks like on
a square lattice and there's I don't
know if you can see it but there's like
she's floating around inside the mix so
it's not a perfectly ordered systems
there's all these microscopic
fluctuations and these random chains
that move throughout the system so i was
trying to figure out how to make
progress on this and i was grabbed my
attention was on the honeycomb dimer
model so this was done by kenyan and
wilson and i happen to be working with
David Wilson and the same place at that
time so I was talking with David and he
was telling me about some of the
pathologies of the honeycomb dimer model
and this is a model for looking at
percolation on a honeycomb lattice and
they found that at the critical point of
this phase transition on the honeycomb
lattice for a percolation that there is
a lot of sensitivity to the boundary
conditions so to the shape of the
lattice whether it was a torus or
whether the tourist was even so there
was the same number of rows and columns
or not so he wanted me to think about
this my model not on a lattice where I
had L by L sites but on a lattice were
head L by L prime sites so really simple
tweak you know and he said why don't you
think about a different shape of the
domain and I did that and instead of
getting those disorder change suddenly
everything became very crisp so this is
what a typical intermediate
configuration looked like and in order
to sort of try and make the x coordinate
and the y coordinates of the lattice of
the length and the height as different
from each other's I could I choose I
chose two successive Fibonacci numbers
so this is on a Fibonacci lattice of l
by l prime and and i would do this
repeatedly and I kept finding these
perfectly ordered geometric structures
so let me tell you what's going on here
and the thick bands are fully jammed
particles and then the bands are things
that are spaced every third so the
regions that are less dense here have
been
third and these regions have density one
and they're like a jam interface and it
sort of propagates down through the
space actually i'm going to show you two
things first we're going to take a
close-up so this is a close-up of a
region just passed a jam and it has this
amazing high level of self-organized
behavior so if you can see that region
that's just passed the jam and let's do
this so they're alternating stripes so
there's a stripe of blue red empty blue
red empty blue red empty so the density
of this lattice is two thirds and this
is provably the densest packing that you
can achieve we're all particles move
with velocity one so what's going to
happen is at the next time step these
blue particles are all going to move
north and move into the empty space
leaving an empty row behind them so the
next time step the red particles can
move to the right and occupy that time
step so this is the dynamics all these
particles in here get to move with unit
velocity one the particles here are
jammed and then they end up having
density one-third here because they're
jamming they're leaving the gym in this
well-defined order so there's a lot of
regularity to this structure and I have
a little java simulation that will show
this more or less and i also just as an
aside since i like to do a lot of
computational work i just switched over
to using apple computers and it's
wonderful and it's great except it runs
java incredibly slowly so this is really
painful so i was really sad i hope the
new intel processor is going to help
random aside but this is am NOT going to
be totally clear but what's going on is
here's the jam interface particles
particles and the jam sort of moves with
unit velocity down the space so and i
don't think that this is incredibly
clear but i have a lot of great pictures
on my website if anybody's interested
but let's turn that off for now okay so
let's go back to the pictures so these
are what the jams look like so they have
this base self-organized onto these
kinds of structures they organize onto
the densest packing that you can
provably show support
velocity one which would never happen in
a random configuration and they have
this really well defined orders so
knowing this post Yuri we were able to
formulate some theory about what's going
on here so there's some interactions
here between the local dynamics so
there's this protocol for how the red
particles and blue particles move so
there's local dynamics that's going on
to organize the particles locally and
then they have this global constraint
that comes from the lattice itself and
mainly the constraint is that the number
of times that the blue band wraps around
the lattice has to be an integer because
it lives on a torus so the head and the
tail have to intersect so you have an
integer winding number for the blue
bands and an integer winding number for
the red bands so knowing these things
that we have integer numbers of winding
bands and that all the particles are
conserved we were able to come up with
some small-scale conservation laws that
told us how the particles were going to
move and then we had we added in the
global constraint so the first two lines
there come from the fact that the
particles are conserved so we know that
as we count across rows we get a certain
number of particles and the second
constraints come from the fact that they
live on a finite lattice so we looked at
the slopes of regions that were jammed
in the slopes of regions that were free
flowing and found some way to make sure
that as we added these regions together
they added up to the number of sites and
wide or the number of sites hi so with
this we were able to come up with a
equation that had some constraints
between the winding numbers and the size
of our lattice so L by L prime is the
size of our lattice which is that first
term here and then that's the winding
number for the blue vans and that's a
winding number for the red bands and s
is the slope of the jammed region so we
were able to come up with this equation
that gave us some consistency amongst
all these variables and then we were
looking at what types of lattices would
support these configurations and we
looked at square lattices and then we
also looked at these fibonacci lattices
which are these guys here
physical than me and we know that the
slopes because we observed them in
carefully they were all very close to
one so there were two ways that we can
get injured here whining covers and
slopes close to one so for these
fibonacci lattices from these
constraints we predicted that we should
see two different kinds of
configurations with winding with one red
band and three blues or one red band and
two blues and then when we actually ran
the simulations this is also what we
found we found that we got these two
different configurations and you can see
that there's a now the red points are
from our experiments and the dash blue
lines covering the red points are the
results from this little a posteriori
self-consistency constraint that we came
up with and so we see the predicted
number of winding bands and we got that
our equations that sort of came from
these microscopic constraints
interacting with the global constraints
match well what we see experimentally
and so there's a couple ways to go from
here first of all why is it this is a
model that was introduced in 1992 and
it's been studied extensively both in
the probability community the
statistical physics community and the
engineering community so people have
used this as a model of actual car
traffic in cities so and this is clearly
a pretty big problem to model congestion
and cars so people have been studying
this model extensively and since it was
introduced in 92 they've been about 250
citations in the literature claiming the
existence of this first order phase
transition so it's like a prototypical
model that shows self-organization and
phase transitions so there's a couple
questions to ask now well first of all
how come nobody saw this before when
it's a model that's been cited hundreds
of times and studied extensively so
that's a really good question and part
of my feeling on that and I'm going to
just skip over a little bit so part of
my feeling in that is that there's a lot
of ingrained traditions that come from
doing statistical physics and from doing
probability that you sort of look in
your own space and you don't sort of
question some of the basics and one of
the basic things that we normally think
about in physics is locality so we know
I think that things interact on a local
scale and once you get to a big enough
scale you've washed out any influence
that you had from the underlying
geometry so if you're on a lattice by
the time you get to the full size of the
lattice you should have no more effects
left so people don't really try to look
at different lattice aspect ratios and
it was really interacting with
probability theorists that made us start
thinking in those regions I think the
other thing that helps is visualization
so we've got great visualization tools
now that didn't exist in 92 but I think
that the thing that really prevented
their discovery more was biases so there
are several papers that were sort of
suggesting that there were some
sensitivity to boundary conditions in
this model so of that 250 papers a
couple of them had suggested that there
were sensitivity to boundary conditions
but they actually never investigated it
further they just dismissed it as an
uninteresting phenomena or people also
tended to discard and realizations that
didn't match their beliefs so when they
ran realizations they expected things to
either converge to one of those two
states free flowing or fully jammed so
something ended up in the intermediate
regime oftentimes it got discarded
because it was just dismissed as
something that hadn't yet converged so
what was really good for us which I
forgot to mention is that once we went
to these lattices where we have such
precise order and we saw that this order
was really persistent so we ended up you
know like you'd see one small
fluctuation and it would persist for
days so we ended up taking a snapshot
and comparing all subsequent microscopic
configurations to snapshot in time and
we found that these things are exactly
microscopically periodic and they've
really short periods too so this is like
5,000 particles and the recurrence time
is around 5,000 time steps so these
things converge relatively quickly to a
steady state that has very small
recurrence time so it's absolutely not
that these intermediate States should be
discarded because they hadn't yet
converged to one of the two standard
States we expected because they've
converged and they're in their limit
cycle so they're never going to get
perturbed from that so
that was sort of an interesting lesson
about how to do some of the science and
then the one of the things that I
started playing around with was trying
to think of the role of synchrony so
what if now the red cars and the blue
cars don't move and lockstep every other
time step but we're just going to flip a
coin so at the red phase all the red
cars flip a coin and if they get heads
they move forward if they get tails they
just stop so now after a number teeth
time steps everybody has tried to move a
plus on number of times so it's a plus
on distributed variable how many times
car has moved so we'd call this the plus
on updating model and what's really
interesting is once you get rid of
synchrony we lose a lot of the patterns
that had been there so we lose a huge
amount of that self-organization so this
is what things look like so we no longer
see that self-organized configuration of
our cars having velocity one so that's
just never seen anymore instead we see
sort of a smooth transition from
velocity 12 some critical value where we
now have what looks like a first order
phase transition and and the phase
transitions at a much smaller value and
we see that the velocity decays and it
seems to follow a formula that it's 1
minus the density to the one-half power
so we're trying to figure out why that
is but I think what's really interesting
is to think of this role of synchrony
and there were two models that really
showed this prominently and has any
everybody heard of the prisoner's
dilemma so the prisoner's dilemma is a
beautiful game theory model and about
cooperating or defecting and it's
usually thought of as a small model at
small player model and in 1992 Nowak and
may looked at the prisoner's dilemma on
a lattice so they thought about the
spatial prisoner's dilemma where sites
could now cooperate with neighbouring
sites or they could not cooperate with
neighbouring sites they put it on a
square lattice and they found that it
formed all these beautiful patterns and
they conjecture that this had something
to do with ecology so it had to do with
the food web and ecosystems and how
things get organized into domains so
that animals have territories and
interact
neighboring animals so this appeared as
a paper in nature in 1992 because it
really had these beautiful
self-organized patterns and then a year
later herbermann and glance actually did
the same spatial prisoner's dilemma but
without synchrony and it didn't do
anything at all so so that was really
one of the first papers to point out how
synchrony can really lead to a lot of
self-organization that we see so we have
to think about where that's a valid role
so so there there's several of these
things that we have to think about when
we're modeling you know whether it's
discrete time as valid and the
dependence on aspect ratios and then for
traffic flow in particular there were
several implications that we could draw
and that is everybody thought that
thing's jammed at a density around
thirty percent and we saw we showed that
you could based on the lattice
conditions actually achieve states that
had very high throughput so those
intermediate states have an average
velocity right around two-thirds so this
was in a regime where everybody felt
that there was no throughput at all and
the velocity should be 0 but we saw that
based on your choices of ln l prime you
can actually get high throughput and
flow in this regime and and also the
onset of jamming can be delayed based on
the geometry so those were implications
particular to traffic flow and and a lot
of people have been looking at this BML
model in many different contexts so
mostly in traffic but lately people have
started thinking about it as looking
modeling information flow and
organizations so they want to think
about the red cars moving and the
horizontal as being information flowing
between co-workers and the blue cars is
flow between red and blue interaction as
information flowing up the hierarchy and
an organization and trying to think
about when inferred minus system jam so
when the information in an
organizational organization just totally
jams so this model has been highly
influential and it continues to shape
people slots so it's really interesting
to think that there is this regime that
went undiscovered for a long time and so
I actually I just wrote a review paper
that's appearing in the journal
complexity and it's on this interplay of
statistical physics probability and
computer simulation going through
several of the models that sort
illuminated us on some of these things
the role of synchrony the importance of
the aspect ratio and and what they're
used for what these models are used for
like dynamical jamming transition so you
know these models are all and and
actually this bootstrap percolation
model this is a really interesting one
because it's one of the only ones where
rigorous proofs about its behavior
exists and this is actually the model I
alluded to earlier that the proof shows
the percolation threshold to be very
very different from what the experiments
do and when it first came out nobody
really understood what was going on but
after a few years of working it out and
it's we realize it you have to implement
bootstrap percolation on a lattice
that's like a hundred billion sites by
100 billion sites before you'd even get
close to what the numerical results look
like and now bootstrap percolation is
used often as a model for jamming and
random media so now here's the good
question so if I'm thinking about random
media and in a physical situation so I'm
interested in looking at the gel I'm
looking at some poly electric material
and I want to understand it's jamming
properties which one do I care about
what the computer simulation is going to
tell me or what the asymptotic
mathematics is going to tell me so we
have to figure out which is really the
relevant regime that applies to our
problem and I just want to close by am
talking and I'm talking fast but I want
to close by talking about one final
model which is really beautiful so this
model and the other models that I've
mentioned bootstrap percolation BML and
prisoner's dilemma those all sort of
came the BML and the percolation really
come from the world of statistical
physics and have moved into probability
because they're such beautiful models
but this is a great model because it was
introduced in the world of probability
and I'm trying to find the connection to
statistical physics and what models it's
what it models in reality and this is
called the roto-rooter and it's a model
introduced by Jim crop a couple years
ago and it's basically a deterministic
walk on a lattice so we're going to
start with an empty to d square lattice
and each site is going to be able to
route particles so it has a rotor which
is an arrow and the arrow can point in
any of the four lattice direction
north south east or west and it's going
to be a really simple dynamics i
introduce a particle at the origin and
it's going to follow the signs dictated
by the rotors and whenever it leaves its
site it rotates the rotor by 90 degrees
so the first particle this is what the
system would look like after four
particles have come in so the first
particle comes in at the origin it moves
to the site to the north and it rotates
the router at the origin to the right
the next particle comes in fills the
site to the right rotates the road or
south the next protocol comes in move
south rotates the rotor west etc so now
it gets a little bit more interesting
when you start adding more particles so
the fifth particle comes in and it's
going to move to the north because
that's the direction that the rotors
pointing and it's going to leave this
rotor pointing East and then it moves
into this site and it's going to move to
the north because that's the direction
the rotors pointing but it's going to
leave the site pointing to the right and
then move into the unoccupied site so
it's a deterministic walk on a lattice
and the routers have four states north
south east or west so we're going to
color it according to the state of the
router so this is what the roto-rooter
looks like after two hundred thousand
particles have landed so the colors
correspond to whether the router is
pointing north south east or west and
there's a couple just amazing things
about this model first of all it makes a
perfect circle so perfect circle and the
fact that if you define things as like
the in radius and the out radius so the
in radius being the shortest distance
from the origin to the any boundary and
the out radius being the longest
distance from the origin to the boundary
they differ by one lattice site so it's
as close to a perfect circle as you can
get on a lattice and there's also so
many other interesting things like all
the patterns that it's forming so this
is actually a boolean model it's
commutative so i showed you introducing
one router at a time one particle at a
time but i can actually introduce all
the particles at the same time and
they're going to end up in the same
configuration because i don't care about
the identity of the particles i care
about the state that the rotors are left
in so since i don't care about the
particle identities i don't care which
individual particle ended up in a site
but they're going to leave the routers
unchanged and what's really fascinating
is I get to see if I can zoom in here a
little bit
so if we start I'm zooming in you can
see that there's all this fine structure
and what's really interesting is that as
the multi particle router is executing
its dynamics it realizes many
configurations that we see in the
abelian sand pile model so these are two
models that are completely unrelated to
each other and yet show a lot of the
same phenomena and I just don't want to
get into that since I'm out of time and
so the router Reuters this beautiful
model that just got introduced recently
and I think it illustrates well this
interplay between the computer
simulations and the probability theory
and now we're trying to find out the
statistical physics behind it and I'm
just going to close with giving you some
pointers to some further reading so the
BML model introduced in 1992 by bham
middleton levine the paper on the
existence of these intermediate states
that appeared in phys rev e in 2005 and
then the roto-rooter was introduced by
Jim prop but he never wrote it up
anywhere and there's a great
mathematical intelligencer article by
kleber and where he introduces the
roto-rooter to the more general public
and has great pictures and then lionel
divine and you've all Perez and just
recently we're able to prove some
properties about the router and being
spherical so they could prove some
aspects of it and then here's a pointer
to the review paper highlighting these
models and their interplay that's going
to appear and complexity in a couple
weeks thank
there was that there was the situation
where you had two different places that
you could be or two different flow rates
and we could be um do you know anything
about the proportion
those of you started a random set up
so the question was about looking at how
there are two different intermediate
estates that you can be in so he's from
not two lattices to intermediate States
and it was trying to understand if we
could predict which state we'd end up in
portions are ya so the you know what
they're so little that we understand
about this model I know that as you get
to higher and higher density the
proportion of things in the lower state
increases so the high flow ones are for
low density the low flow ones are for
high-density but what's really
interesting is that this model isn't
monotonic so I can take one of these
systems at jams and I can add more
particles and take it to a non jamming
system because I can put them in just at
the right precise microscopic place that
they keep a jam from forming so adding
more particles doesn't on average makes
a system more likely to jam but it
doesn't make an individual configuration
more likely to jam so that's one of the
hard things of this model in the model
of Canada Wilson
the behavior very much depends on the
aspect ratio and it really depends on
the number theory of the fraction LOL
primary
is there evidence for similar behavior
here so the question is looking at the
model of Kenyan and Wilson where they
looked at the percolation on the
honeycomb lattice and it was they found
what did they find depends on the price
that divided the fractional overall plan
specific weight yeah yeah yeah so that
they found that the that there are a lot
more deep number theory things in there
so it wasn't just having lnl prime be
relatively prime to each other but there
were some more features fine grained
features and I think there probably are
some here too and what's interesting is
if you simulate this on L by L prime
lattice you get this beautiful periodic
structure view simulator so you add one
more lattice site so instead of making
an l by l prime you make it l by l prime
plus one you don't get these periodic
structures you get randomness on top of
the structures so I'm sure that there is
a lot of stuff to study but it I don't
know what to start with
you may have just answered my question
but you apply your analysis there is the
golden ratio
yeah yeah but there are other fractions
that proxima cooperation that are not
the manoj
nearly as clubs that we just said you
spent the day with me chaotic and it's
the
well so what matters is that they're so
the question was that there are other
ratios of numbers that approximate the
golden mean so it's not just the
Fibonacci sequence that which is exactly
the golden mean but there's other ratios
that are very close to it so what would
we expect to happen if instead of having
a food okay fair enough so so so to it
so the Fibonacci is approximate the
golden mean that one ya know so the the
ribbon achis aren't chaotic right there
their periodic and anything that is
close to if they're if they're
relatively prime to each other and they
end up basically forming these periodic
structures but and yeah I don't know
that's that's a good question i gotta
think about that a little more
