is currently at Stanford and you will
make same two more times in the future
so Lima has worked on punctuation
hundreds and win the game theory in
graph theory playing we hear about
strong be raising edges which is some
familial and discrete measures that we
have any dependents so we learn what
that is a little sweet on application
again top of the other one so the top
today is based on some of my joint works
with new yet rivet china with Karen
ereserves I and so very enticing so I
know that strongly rightly measured is
probably a strength work for many of you
to let me try to introduce the topic you
by comparing it with some other measures
which that's more of you are familiar
with so this is a contrast pictures
between two one the continuous world and
the discrete talk today is about
distributions which are discrete but I
want to first talk about the continuous
for because the tribution there are most
familiar to most people
so continue so so I'm working with
distribution so a distribution adjust a
non-negative function on RN which is
integrable so thank their goal is finite
so it gives rise to a probability
distribution so if you know what I spy
the whole integral you get a problem you
Norma and one of the difficult questions
you can ask about the distribution is
whether you can efficient example you
give a real solution at that
computational question can another
perhaps not be question is whether you
can find the mode of this research so
that's the question more for
optimization
yeah function you just want to find the
maximum so in the continuous world
is a classic function are tractable for
both of the questions I asked for
efficient sampling and frothing dish and
though there are cases so a lot of the
function is just a function whose log is
on K or you can you can just see the
division here and of the identity then
you get for a function you get exponents
because the login okay so as I said law
concave functions are tractable and in
terms of both the patients and clean and
optimization was perhaps one of the most
awaited results topic is the result of
higher at all which was later improved
by the agenda ah which is that you can
given an Oracle access to such a
function where the point it gives you
the value I'm seeking something under
the rug but in an Oracle access you can
sample a point at an approximate point
from this distribution using Markov
chain Monte Carlo so these are Markov
chains which are formally known as the
ball mark and the athan Wambach which
she heard of these things and of course
finding the mode of a lock on keys
function is nothing but maximizing
account a function so you can just with
using any convex programming framework
that you rush so these are some examples
of our concave functions so if you have
a convex set the indicator of it is la
concave so actually using this simple
observation you can show that you can
you can maximize the linear function
over a convex set by just sampling from
blocking it there are many of the little
known distribution such as the Gaussian
distribution are la concave and then
there are operations on lock and key
functions which preserve so one of them
is if you do enough I try
formation in this space you still get a
lot active function if you condition on
a variable having it a certain value
like slicing through the unclear
functions
you still get a lock on here function if
you marginalize meaning that you
integrate over one variable you still
get a lot of a function this is not a
bad way to do it if you do a convolution
of two block concave functions you still
get a lot of concave function and if you
take the point twice product that still
a concave function is you still get a
lot of a function they have this old
toolbox are constructed for constructing
new occupation so that's the continuous
world and what I want to talk about is
the discrete world and perhaps measures
that somehow have similarity the lock on
key function so let me let's let's let's
try to formalize this so the measure
that I'm going to be working with I'm
going to represent them with a function
from Z to the M to R which are
non-negative so they have a mass on each
point in people yen right
sometimes I'm going to be working with
just a boolean vector so you want to the
end distributions over the hierarchy and
again they give rise to any such
function gives rise to a distribution
I'm gonna I'm going to assume that my
function is always always has finite
support so the sum is always finite you
can always divide and get a problem and
again you can ask the same question can
you efficient example from such a
distribution or can you find the mode of
it so the real question you wanna answer
is what is the analog of a concavity in
discrete distributions so here is the
wrong attempt if you just if you just
take the log concavity definition I
think it sort of are getting into the
spirit world
well you get something so this is
basically the most general inequality
that we might hope to satisfy so for any
value for any points to capital one from
cation and any values now if I went
through alpha such that these things
have a meaning because everything is
done increase your record this
inequality should be satisfied okay so
these these functions have been studied
actually in the one dimensional case
okay so if you have a sequence of values
their lock on case you can only say that
but this is all of these they have some
nice properties they haven't been but
the problem is that if you are looking
at the traditions from the hypercube
then this inequality says nothing
every distribution on the hypercube
would be captured with right so that's
clearly too large a class for it to be
able to handle so that's the wrong
attempt so the correct event is a
definition known as strongly riley's so
this definition for this definition I
have to define this in culture
generating on your image so you can
encode any given discrete distribution
into a multivariate all the coefficients
are going to be the values of the of the
distribution and then each monomial the
exponent of the monomial are going to
capture the point at which the diffusion
validators and then you just on all of
these model okay so for this
distribution because values 1 2 3 5 I
have four monomials if the coefficients
part three to five and then each point
is too much for some powers equal to 10
power already on one because I have my
distribution supporters on the
two-dimensional hybrids that's the baby
is defined as any formula now the
definition of strong really is there is
no way to go around it excluded damaging
paulownia
so the definition is that if you plug in
complex numbers into the generating
column which has positive imaginary
parts then the form you'll never get
zero
so second so you don't want any roots
which have a positive imaginary part in
all of the components so that's the
definition perhaps I can convince you
that it's a natural definition by
considering the one-dimensional case we
need to say not equal to zero doesn't
matter whether the certain values check
feel nearly enough clearly madam okay I
mean if you're finding complex numbers
you should expect to be complex numbers
but it's never going into gear so so let
me let me have please try to show you
that it's not that unnatural we're not
doing the one-dimensional please okay so
in the one-dimensional case you're
dealing with a univariate pony on right
so the Palmer has new if and only it has
noticed with positive my name right if
and only if all the trees are real the
reason is that when you're dealing with
a univariate song you're not the roots
come in conjugate verbs so if you have
no wreath in the upper half plane you
have miracle or half line therefore the
roots come in the roots must all be real
therefore you can factorize your family
all in this way okay so product comes in
your church I know if you think about it
a little bit this form this guarantee
call me al corresponds to add variables
that need random variable so if we had
one a if you only have one factor in
this accusation then your distribution
would just see a turnaround the way it
can either take value 0 or 1 all right
but it's not hard to see that when you
multiply generating formula you are just
taking the convolution of the
distributions or in other words if you
think you in terms of random variable
you're just summing independent copies
of random right so any power which
factor enters in this way
with the sum of independent gardens so
in the one-dimensional case anything
that is Charlie IV is in some of your
movies and the reverse is also true
Thanks and by well-known fact we know
that somehow Bernoulli's is law concave
so this definition actually satisfies
the longing attempt that we were trying
to do it's actually also ultra lock on
gave it to satisfy something stronger
than blocking geography but that doesn't
matter much to us any questions on this
duration of burning it is a discrete
distribution yeah did you define one
o'clock concavity notes really I thought
the problem was that we didn't have a
good definition for discrete
distribution yeah I mean like for the
one-dimensional case at least we have a
good definition for lung cavity it's
just that the product of any two valve
and this value must be at most the
square of this up so for the
one-dimensional case it makes sense for
higher dimensions it doesn't make that
much
my name is I'm working with Charlie
Rayleigh distribution but I'm just
saying that in the one-dimensional case
at least it satisfies the law concavity
it is easy to see that a sum over nu he
should look so the EVs AI always to the
right operations on the generating
polymer so so basically what you can do
is we can say you have a real turtorial
you can take derivatives of it it will
remain really that okay so you can by
taking derivatives you're killing the
first salary okay and then you can also
do an operation which reverses the
distribution and then you can kill us
the other valve at the end of the day
you will get you can show us all values
except three three consecutive on now
you have a various formula of degree to
which every if you remember in high
school and and the coefficients for
satisfying any ball that
you on that degree to a very formula
must have it has some qualities with the
coefficient each square is bigger than 4
8 X percent but some of some Duncan Kane
is really not O'Connor
not necessarily so that they can't
really get to the second we got you
nothing go to 300 but then maybe follow
some condition the convolution is not
the got to serve a concavity
it has contribution in the district as a
movement you say the type in the
community so in the continuous it does
in the discrete so okay so this example
is if you don't sum up the coin tosses
or if you don't some of the brand new
leaf and bacterium an independent things
we still get a star by writing situation
right so you you flip n coins which have
different biases and then you can see
there a vector which is the result of
your point now the first coin toss will
give you a bit second coin toss if you
don't
and so on you would get a bit vector in
the hypercube and that would be a
distribution that is you strongly Riley
because the Tomeo can be factored in
this way right
I have a get a linear term for each of
my core classes but the variables are
now their friend right not you need to
cs35 talking complex numbers with
positive imaginary parts none of these
factors has become here
so therefore this song is will is still
strongly rising okay
perhaps the most first non-trivial
example of stronger distributions is the
distribution of random signing trees in
a graph so if you have a graph and you
take a spanning tree as fat as time
trialist uniformly at random and
consider the indicator vector of that
time so that leaves in an M dimensional
space where m is the number of edges for
each edge you just of course whether
it's in the spanning tree or one you get
a zero one record this file is going to
be stronger ID and the name Reilly
actually comes from this connection okay
so there is this thing called the
Rayleigh monotonicity property in
electrical networks which says that if
you basically decrease the effect
decrease the resistance of something in
your electrical Network the effective
resistance is never go up okay so with
that we can show is it equal to this
condition that if you from the
distribution from the spanning tree
distribution if you condition on an edge
being in your spanning tree the
probability of any other edge in the
tree whose never goes up basically
either goes down or stays inside okay
so that's that's negative correlation
for any two edges this one being in the
tree by this one is less likely so
strongly implies this but it applies a
lot of other things that's why being
stronger ID is known to be one of the
strongest forms of negative events so
the name is all come from this so the
last day is a polymer here which
includes the previous spanning tree case
is the case of determinant of a species
so let me first give you a subset of
this enhancer distribution so suppose
that we have a bunch of vectors is kind
of high dimensional
you want to select a subset of them but
for every subset the probability you
select a facet is going to be
proportional to the volume and by the
vector square in this case we would be
faced with the follow the proportional
to the volume of this tanks right
or does it there next way eg-6 the size
of those lips so they always live in
some bleeding national space and you
have to pick the vector so figuring I'm
here but this is not the most general
the thing I've got is usually the most
general datura metel distribution is
given by a obvious a definite matrix
right so if you are given a positive
scientific matrix L you pick a subset of
the rows or the columns with probability
proportions to the determinant of the
software given by the SAS office from
Peru and that's why this marginal
community Akram's is about the n matrix
and B becomes was the depositors VI
exactly the same isn't this doesn't give
you the same distribution because the
distribution can have various sizes of
it
those the conditions on the site size be
Denki n then you get the changing
doesn't okay so here is how you can see
that this distribution is a special case
of this one if if you are given a vector
if you have given me record as you can
consider the ground matrix of these
pictures where entry IJ is just a dot
producted in the vector I VI and VJ and
then the salt determinants of defined by
a subset X would just be this volume
right just the determinant of something
kind of transpose suit it's correct
that's it a career so the generating
formula of this distribution is invited
will become type determine
but worry too much about why this is
true but but basically the fact that
these are strongly writing comes from
the fact that we can write this on the
determinant and then you show basically
that this doesn't have any roots in the
upper half-plane
by using the fact that every symmetric
matrix has a real light mount it somehow
but I don't want to go into this enough
but one thing to also note is that the
generating formula this is easily
computable given the matrix R as you can
just compute it is very but giving given
in di is right to know the Gandhian our
decision will come right yet even the
idea can compute this all the loving the
data so let me define with the I Square
this captures the energy dissipation yes
so in the special case needs vector it
would be for each for each as you would
have a vector and it would be one on one
vertex and minus one and the other
vertex and they're everywhere and ensure
that this determinant come our work out
I hate to d3 the example we saw some are
annuities independent movies understand
trees and the periodical distribution
this one actually captures all of the
other ones so perhaps the natural
question is whether whether we should
just consider the chemical distribution
and forget about strongly i nurtured but
there are actually operations which
don't preserve being determinant all
which i will talk about later
there are operations that preserve being
strongly ready but don't preserve
anything that's why you applicants have
internalized so from now on for
simplicity I'm assuming that my
distribution is homogeneous meaning that
if it's if it's supported on the hyper
tube and it has exactly D bit
one this is the 40 or you can think of
it as the generating polyol having
exactly degree D fresh it makes my
notation more simple but the results
what's ugly result I'm going to be
talking about carry for it now motion
also not a stronger conscience because
if you are given any stronger ideal
distribution if you slice it to some
degree B so if you only consider the
terms which have the greedy that's still
going to be strongly and if you were
able to compute the energy formula on
the original one you can also compute
the journey for me love this slice one
basically some algebraic tricks you you
homogenized your formula and then you
compute the degree piece degree D terms
by using formal interpolation I want to
go either
okay so the question we're asking we're
efficient sampling and optimization or
finding them all so the first result
that I'm going to talk about is
efficient standpoint from be huge so
here I'm assuming that you don't have
access to the JT connell
because if you have this access the
genetic formula I think it sounds great
you only have access to an Oracle which
gives you the value of your distribution
as any human they were to the container
so um so for stronger ties distribution
we were able to show that a very natural
Markov chain Monte Carlo method mixes
five so there's Markov chain is defined
by basically considering all point in
your distribution and connecting a two
of them that's occurring exactly to this
because your distribution is homogeneous
they can't be very one bit they can
we can differ in two bits or an even
number of it okay so I'm just I'm just
drawing an edge from each state of my
Markov chain to any space which differs
from as written to a bit and then I'm
doing a Markov chain walk on this graph
with a metropoliz this is a very well
home singing Markov chains that you so
basically from each stage you pick
around the neighbor we go to it if it's
if it's distribution is higher than you
and if it's lower you go to it with some
probability which is the ratio of the
value of the distribution at the
destination is divided by the value of
the distribution at that source so it's
the metropolises there is the diagram
one thing so the result that we have is
that this Markov chain you see an
epsilon approximate sample in time which
is MV squared Morgan optic okay so the
one thing that I want you to get from
this time is that this is almost linear
in the number of in the number n which
is the number of bits so if these much
smaller than n this is a very fast that
it is almost if these content this is
almost like so again what it to me would
be the homogeneity degree so this is
what was final continuing spanning tree
so if you're considering factors this is
not a good n any would be the number of
edges and V will be basically the number
of edges and minus one okay but this is
independent of what the disease you know
it is possible that your distribution
you will be able to solve all say to
like one and a tangy but yet or okay
that's might because from Pretoria is a
determined yet it would mix D will be
constant and yet it's a terrible spot
just down there
the one thing that I also should mention
here is that this Lisa spat from alarm
start but you can get a barn start very
easily while you read younger warm start
system that that you should start from a
point which doesn't have a very very
little distribution about um okay so
what are the applications of this well
um there is this problem of a diverse
topic selection okay so usually I just
try to spell them by example so suppose
that you you are searching for documents
referring to the term Apple right now
you might be referring to the company I
hop over the fruit apple right and your
search engine has to basically give you
a set of documents and it doesn't know
which one you're thinking about so she
just give you this subset or this subset
this stuff that has more diversity and
it's more likely to satisfy your query
so probably return this one right so how
does it captured by our model well
usually people assume that all these
documents are represented by a feature
vector in some space right and the hope
is that these features are in a way that
things that are diverse and the space
will give you a large volume right so if
you return a subset whose probability is
proportional to the volume squared of
that of the vector in that subset then
the hope is that you're you're returning
a diverse obstetric eyebrow it has been
used in many contexts in Machine range
but perhaps the more interesting
application to hear it badly is that of
lower rank of arbitration so here the
problem is you're given a matrix a and
we want to find a
trying T matrix which is as close as
possible to it in a ravine you are so
the result that has been shown when a
small sapling is that if you sample a
subset of the rows of this matrix the
number of roots one sample is just of
the other epsilon but your sampling has
seen cannot be uniform it has to have
rates which are proportional to the
volume of the rows times their
transcripts or the volume of the source
where bit
the paper is tribution the different
criterion if you do this the expectation
you get a 1 plus epsilon approximation
to the best ranked the best rank with
the best rank pH and you're only
selecting from the subtle colors and
then you're just projecting everything
else so this gives you a fast a way to
basically compute such a low rank I
trace under some a lot of adoptions so
this is an actual balls given like you
know there is actually a new result
which would be the change of sample here
right what would be the change the
sample you do we start with us on inside
extending out one degree of s so just
one this one that would really mean to
now you will be general in the size of
the matrix yeah but for me Oh indeed
we do refer but the wire would have the
possibility to look like because it
helped it has been squared okay but how
many a should you be exchanging it at
least just one or just one if it is sex
among them is one holding evil zero so
yeah there is a new result which keeps
this but okay let's go on through
finding the moon so this is the
optimization side of things so here you
can't really hope to get them up get an
exact thing but they're actually hard as
yourself
we said that even for the tyrannical
distributions you can't do better than
world one to the party and we can
actually achieve the same an awkward one
matching that so the problem here is you
want to find a point in your
distribution which maximizes the value
of the distribution so the algorithm we
have for it is very simple you solve the
convex program so the so you have a
polynomial the generator seungyeon you
if you could if you could plug in zero
one where you hoping for the generating
polynomial you would fish out one of the
coefficients right so if you could
optimize over the set up view of one
vectors then you would be able to
optimally solve this problem but
obviously you can't do that so you relax
everything valuable you just a positive
or non-negative real-valued valuable and
then a instantly implies that the
generating palm oil is not concave over
the set of positive real numbers over
the puzzle board I'm not going to prove
that actually two or three pages of
proof so he but but if you're only the
only place you're using firmly is that
this generating formula is locked on
game and you can solve this concave ok
so once you solve this another you ask
which one one point kappa whose
probability is proportional to d wanted
us to the monomial basically defined by
the kappa there's a probabilistic Alaric
and output the Aroostook solution and
the whole point is to prove that the
expectation you're close to the optimal
what is the solution
is 0-1 no easy solutions 11th division
as a global market program is real
valued they give you some v12 CD yeah we
will define some probability
distribution on the capital oh yeah
right and then you ask the chapter with
this level so basically every every
subset with the every 0 on vector would
be up with this probability proportional
to the product of new PR I know what so
that second step is also that second
step you can buy dynamic program let's
say you can basically compute the this
probability distribution you can compute
this generating function by the dynamic
programming and whenever you can monkey
the generating function of well my
determine computed like is the digital
income you can also probably be
fishermen yeah you can also be dynamic
program this is a very simple it may be
can you tell what will this mean for
example most animals and then maybe in a
different range mercilessly so this
would be the whole graph so this would
be like you're trying to sample
basically you're trying to sample just
any subset of n minus 1 into is not
necessarily a spanning tree this
probability which is proportional to the
values on those edges there is no
restriction of being a spanning tree
that's why it's a rock so the whole
point is that if your variable satisfied
justice inequality that say some of the
B's then the generating partner or is a
normalizing factor of this distribution
we have must be bounded by e to the P so
you only have to normalize by a factor
of utility
and that immediately gives you that this
is an e to the F organization because in
expectation you're getting exactly the
value of this calm case program / the
normalizing factor and the normalizing
factor can get want you to be there for
this event and as I said before there
are hardness results which show that you
can't be weather than contracted maybe
you can improve the e but you can't go
below doing what the hell does result
users all right I forgot it's just a
beer extra - wait it's a key now t-ball
game P forgotten keys tree maybe it was
just resize it box I don't know okay so
what is finding the most good for well
there is this a canonical example that I
always use which is that of Center
placement or you can think of it as some
trick collection so say that we have a
bunch of thermometers place at various
points in Google campus okay and then
somebody has to physically walk to them
and reach them to basically gather data
so we don't want to read all of them at
once you just want to select the top set
of K of them to go re this substituting
for X well one of the criteria that
people bacteria is maximizing the
entropy of the information that we can
write so if you can assume that if you
assume that all these thermometers have
a joint caution distribution for their
reading given by the covariance matrix
Sigma then what you want to do is you
want to select a subset of these
thermometers that maximizes the entropy
and the entropy a bunch of Russian
animatable
can be written like this just a constant
multiple of the the log determinant
the covariance matrix plus another car
okay then you want to select the subset
that maximize this a lot of determinant
of Sigma so the distribution that we had
before the determinant of distribution
it's like you're trying to find a mole a
bit and in using this algorithm you can
approximate all that's interesting as
many people configure too because
entropy is a sub-module function many
people always many people consider the
real greedy algorithm for some was your
maximization but pretty doesn't have any
guarantees here because the entropy can
be negative and not even monitor here
but this one gives you the guarantee of
maximizing the entropy between an
additive water alright so let me come
back to the comparison between the
continuous world in the discrete world
so lock and key functions on one side
strongly distributions on the one and
the other side I'm showing this for both
of them we can do a fish example the
continuous mode we can efficiently find
the exact max exact mode in this people
we can find it the platform we but so
these were these two operations that we
wanted but we also we also looked over a
bunch of operations that preserve a
concavity in the calculus all right so
what are their counterparts in the
discrete week the one for the entropy
problem other global for adding it for
the entropy problem yes very site is
like there was some longer tons of
modular position books whatever but he
ran terrific and even this become
negative this already
oh we need a little benefit log of the
determinant there is no he's not hi so
in the car
he has affine transforms because it will
neither be affine transform it's going
to give you B to the M but at least the
basic one of the basic affine transforms
you can do will give you a stronger
light distribution I call it meditation
if you have a stronger Ida distribution
if you just put a phone to it and our
random variables which have a joint P
which have a doing stronger Rayleigh
distribution you can just sum them up I
can still get a start right
that's just explaining what happens to
the polynomial the generating polynomial
is that you're replacing all the
variables by a single one and it varies
from can see from this animation that
not having roots in the upper half plane
with Victor so the second one was
conditioning against conditioning in the
discrete case still whole
so if you condition on one of the
variable being zero it's like you're
plugging in zero for work for that
variable and by some continuity here in
complex analysis you can show that this
oil is attitude yeah Arachne and
therefore you still get a strong life
chrétien a if you condition on a
variable B minuses like you are taking
the partial derivative which is like for
that very so anytime that doesn't have
that valuable researchers and again this
is why your old theorem that this this
formula doesn't have any everything
you're graphing the results economy also
violent so they need all of these
probabilistic operations have an
algebraic singing and you can easily do
easily reason about the occasionally
that's the big point marginalization is
easier so if you have like you should be
positive so if you have a bunch of
variables if you just ignore my on them
the remaining one source is January it's
like selenium one for one of the
variable and again using continuous um
show that the oil doesn't have any clear
pathway convolution is probably the
easiest case if you convolve two
distributions which are strongly related
like we are just multiplying the
generating caramels this one doesn't
have them used in the past at this point
xi equal that policies are at once
the only difference is the point-wise
product in the continuous world point
five product sells law concave
distribution is la concave but in the
discrete process of the gate and I don't
want to begin example because it will be
cumbersome but anyway to see what it
shouldn't be true is because if your if
if electron distributions were close of
the product you could just take the
product on one challenge distribute
strongly Rayleigh distribution which is
called and basically take powers of it
and now because you can do efficient
sampling from a strangulated tribution
once you do enough powers it's like
you're finding the book because after
taking it I the only thing that surmise
is basically default so you would be
able to find the model but you know that
we shouldn't give ok so the product of
stronger images is not currently Riley
but there is no sample what they prove
is that the operations that you can do
for starting a distribution you still
can do some of them for cause for the
distribution resolving from the point
wide product so if you have two
distributions mu and nu and if you have
Oracle access to their generating all
meals then you can conclude that
proclamations to use develop so this
would be basically the integral of the
product distribution and this would be
the mode of the product distribution and
the approximation are still there is
they're very very roughly equally
confidence and any other go along for
this right
are they little bones so that's a that's
very good question um for this one there
are the wrong with this one there are
but there is a so if you can okay so let
me actually make a comment here so the
only types of approximation you can hope
for you types of problems are either one
person or contentedly or once a deficit
because if you have let's say a constant
to this be to the point 99 approximation
there is a very easy trick of listing
that you want to test it so there is no
intermediate apart on a so you can
basically take this joint products as be
following out and then compute the
approximation on that product and then
take group on just I don't I don't want
to bore you with the details but yeah as
soon as people below this your your at
want attachment to their to this column
computing this captures and captures
some cognitive problems for which we
currently don't have any concepts for
our population so you could be a really
surprising thing to get better than that
let them mix this one computing the next
disconnect of a bunch of bodies and
definite matrices is captured by this
but we currently don't have any anything
related attacking me is it a little too
incredible history no so yeah so if you
take a crazy takes more than three even
very trying whether the whole
distribution is zero or not becomes NPR
almost more than the three or more they
ignore again okay you can reduce finding
a PSP tour to um
so what are some of the applications of
this well the canonical one I'm going to
give is counting the number of bipartite
matching so assume that you have a
bipartite graph like this there is
outside making both sides and this table
and so I'm going to find three
distributions the distributions are
going to be on top set up the edges
basically one distribution is like this
you for each vertex on the bottom side
if this one one of its edges and H right
and you do this independently for all
the vertices so you might get something
like an orange thing that we see here
there's no guarantee that say this will
produce matching it's just it just looks
like a matching from the bottom side so
nu is going to do the reverse it's kind
of pick it just from the top side of the
graph and now you can see that the
number of matching would be basically
the integral of the product distribution
because anything that survives here we'd
be imagine with all sides on the outside
so the terms here are exactly the right
like I said there are Morgan there are
generalizations of like perfect matching
like things like mix discriminant which
you can still solve using this method
and for which we don't have multiple
sexual partners for bipartite matching
we do have one so just an approximation
but it's randomized our methods are
deterministic it will match is the best
known degenerate or connection
hey mainly our problem in the interest
of coming so there is there is some
problem in algorithmic game theory
called known as nice social welfare
organization because of its close
connection to bipartite matching you can
use this to you can use this machinery
to solve it
approximately solve it it's an
optimization problem and you still have
so for most of the optimization problems
to solve by the missionaries you have
matching whereabouts for the accounting
problem you usually go again
you match the matching computer ok so I
want to give you a brief sketch out the
ideas involved in the proof of it so we
have some distributions you and you and
you want to compute the integral of the
product that's our goal and we also have
access they're generating all right to
look at the journey song of view okay so
it's at some which has one of the things
that we want the UM right
the other things are phenomenal okay the
mules are occupied by someone else if I
can ensure that these models are exactly
quoted new values then I could just if I
could find v1 through VN such that the
monomial for responding to Kappa is
equal to UF Kappa the dis one was
exactly what I want to compute right so
I can just plug in the values into our
generating on you and fish output so
think the bipartite matching case so
what we have access to gene you okay
yeah so gene you would be a product of
linear terms for each particular linear
term which is the sum of the variables
adjusting to vertex Alta and then you
just multiply all these together here
okay so but it's too much to hope for
it's too much to hope that as we can
find a rebound through the entire set of
the monomial always matched new values
because so what you're going to go after
is at one time in equality so we ensure
that that we take we want to in the end
such that there are always at least as
large as the New Balance okay the reason
we are going on this side is because new
ideas could become deal with using
scanner we have suppose
so if I was able to find v1 to the N
such that this inequality will satisfy
for every point and I could Pauline we
went through the end through my genetic
formula I need to find an upper bound
for the quantity I'm trying to cut in
fact I can search for the minimum size
up around okay that's the usual trick
right so one can upper bound here we try
to find the best upper bound and then
you there's some policy results but
maybe you see the other side so what I
want to do now is I want to find the
best v1 through VN such that an athlete
in equality is always satisfied and for
all their for all such three values I
find the one that minimizes my
generating power okay let's go I don't
like it now two things fitness programs
this guy over first it can be turned
into a comics program actually what's
munis what is no it's actually if we
have known as a geometric program if you
ever if you've ever heard of that time
the idea is that if you replace with the
army lip gloss with a log of it and if
you replace the variables with the log
of the variables and everything becomes
common only penny any harm your with
non-negative coefficients has this power
that is not the concat is convex in the
log of Excel and once you replace V is
with not realize this equality company a
linear people right so so now I'm trying
to basically tell the convex program and
perhaps I can do it the only problem is
that I have potentially an exponential
number of linear so I have potentially a
financially linear inequalities of this
form what do I do with them well what if
I replace
fine which could take arbitrary value to
agree with a stronger thing with an
upper bound for it okay so this is what
we retire any shown that serious looking
for just one single coefficient of one
of these formula there is a videographer
for it uh-huh so we'll forget the
minimum okay so for anybody back for any
Y values I want to say that the
coefficient hit this inequality is that
okay so they chose r01 okay
does two of all number one for now okay
so what am i doing I'm dividing my
generating calling out for you by the
product of my mantra by n okay so this
produces the constant term which is the
coefficients of the monomial y1 to yn
and the other times I don't care about
because they are just conduct this is
this light is always negative cycles for
zero values you can see that those
values those variables would actually be
sensibly or anyways right so it's not
that hard to see that this involved oh
and now instead of instead of satisfying
this inequality I'm just going to make
sure that this is bigger than this and
now the trick is that this function the
right hand side is a concave function in
the castle's was the whole hyperedge
that's just 0 1 variable okay
this again a follows formula concavity
of the polynomial that's and this
relaxation doesn't lucidity this your
activation do this something because for
for intermediate values you might have
you might be satisfying get stronger
recall but at the end of the day we are
still going to meet our apart creation
clinics after after using some duality
and rearranging things you are at this
a convex concave style my problem so
there are enough so you can see that
most of the genetic alleles are present
here and then if you replace the
variables with their logs this thing
would become not contest not convex
invite by eyes and beyond in the log of
Y is Fei and it is also the concave in
the kappa because the denominator is
linear in the gas I love this
denominator we here in the capital and
the log of this genetic formula is also
concave in the cab line so this is a
saddle point photo and you can actually
efficiently solve it I don't have time
and I won't go through the other side
which is actually the more
mathematically involved one but you can
actually use some duality and come
result about real solidity and stronger
ID measure to prove that the result of
this is going to be to be yoga because
this is the separation question here in
our the separation question for area for
the geometry programs economic um for
the X for the X function linear
inequalities I think I have an example
that I don't have so I didn't in
particular if you control this addition
question approximately you could solve
the podium approximation which means you
only need and exponential or sure so
right yes so that's that's true and you
can actually solve the separation
question approximately just this thing
that I showed here it basically tells
you to put there's and data upper bound
for this to the we can solve this are
attractive but yeah but you can solve
this exact this equation thing is not
exactly solvable yeah so let's complete
the picture and so for the product you
still have some caviar but we can say
something about the resulting
- with that I will conclude so the gist
of the talk was that strongly oil majors
have very nice properties that make them
somehow similar or analogues of lock and
key functions in the discrete world so
the open question is whether this can be
this can become an email developed
framework for discrete optimization and
yes I think they have already discussed
whether we can approximate this better
than e to the D is not known you don't
have any lower bound for it
finding the max we have mentioned we're
going to there's no hope there but maybe
for the Sun we can do some work obtained
and the big open question is whether we
can find a larger discrete situation
which are still tractable all that can
be optimization so can this also be done
to take some beats all of this product
sometimes no it's gonna be living the
play to be the summer max oh I haven't
considered that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
