about any escape i also want to talk a
lot about SVG and understanding the SVG
format because that's the basis of what
inkscape works on and i'm going to go
into the SVG so when what are some of
the basic SVG tags are what SVG is
useful for and how people are using SVG
which is also important inkscape uses
SVG this base formats so when we start
looking at the basic tools that are
provided in SVG you can kind of look at
inkscape as how it manipulates those
tools and what it can do for you as an
SVG editor but it's also a drawing
program and I think it's a lot of fun to
play with we get a tablet out you
scribble and all kind of fun stuff and
there'll be time at the end for
questions hopefully but feel free to
raise your hand and ask questions while
we're going I have no problem with that
so SVG in its most basic form is an XML
file format it's written by the w3c
which is the same guys write HTML all
those great standards it's xml-based and
this design for the web here's a kind of
a SVG snippet very small it renders the
small square that's on the right there
and from the top header is the standard
XML header the doctype which firefox
won't render your SVG's unless you put
that in there so you might want to
remember that there's a big argument
about that but it seems to be resolved
that you need the doctype for firefox
trender SVG's then SVG header with the
xml namespace to find which is a lot of
boilerplate stuff just to have the
command ret for drawing a rectangle and
it has a height than a width and x and y
and has a style string which is a CSS
style with the font size which isn't
being used here but the fill fill
opacity fill rule which is when things
overlap in a path how what part of it
gets filled and i don't think i actually
have sliding that later but you can look
in the spec if you want to know about
where about the fill roles and then the
stroke and stroke width so international
SVG is pretty simple i mean you're just
so you're saying okay rectangle width
height x y you've defined a rectangle
it's not very exciting there but with
this these simple tools that will go
through provide you a way to create very
complex graphics you can build on them
to create something a lot bigger SVG
also is defined is several profiles
there's the SVG main profile there's SVG
basic and SVG tiny and what these are is
they're smaller subsets of the SPG
standard that are designed for pdas and
cell phones they remove some of the more
advanced features of SVG and make it
easier for those low CPU low memory
devices to render the SVG content now
they were defined back I think it was
2001 when they started these and now
cell phones are more powerful than my
laptop so I don't know if they're really
has practical as they work once were but
what it does is it provides a nice
subset of functionality to say hey for
targeting a mobile phone it doesn't it
might be a little crazy to do this
feature and so there's still implemented
actually opera eight implements SVG tiny
opera 9 does the full SVG standard so
it's kind of a good benchmark for SVG
renderers also all the phones here
shipped with SVG on them all the PA DA's
didn't but it's much easier to implement
SVG on a PDA because most of us through
the web browser anyway so if you
download an opera or something of that
nature to your PDA you can run it cell
phones are usually a little bit more
closed so you have to give get whatever
the cell phone manufacturer gives to you
the availability of SVG has increased
significantly in the last year or two
now if you have Firefox 1.5 or greater
you've got SVG you've got Opera 8 or
greater you've got SVG there's a adobe
plugin for internet explorer that gives
us PG support which sounds bad because
plugins are hard to distribute but most
of those plugins have been distributed
with adobe acrobat and other adobe
software so a lot of people actually
have the adobe plugin but if you ask
them they don't know that they do so
don't be surprised if you look and i
already have the plugin there are later
versions with actually security fixes so
i'd recommend downloading the newer
version but a lot of people have more
people have the adobe plugin than they
think video currently it's in the beta
WebKit which is what Apple uses for
Safari and what's really cool about this
is that the way they're implementing
it actually puts SVG into the entire OS
so you'll be able to do SVG icons and
SVG will be first-class graphics in Mac
OS 10 hopefully in 10 5 but they haven't
committed to that yet and all vectors
all major drought drawing tools like
illustrator coreldraw zara they very
much support SVG output as a real format
in cs2 for illustrator they support SVG
round-tripping so you can pretty much
use it as the default format you don't
have to use illustrator format if that's
not what you want you can save and edit
and save and edit in SVG so as we Jews
are very real format on graphics editing
yes Jim doesn't use SVG directly like it
doesn't you know you don't edit in SVG
but you can load SVG's and it will make
it the paths in the GIMP based on those
SVG's and you can export the paths based
on as SVG's and we've worked with again
folks actually a bit and making sure
that they were more compliant and
figuring out you know who's bug was it
on a lot of the import problems but they
do will also render the svgs they render
it and then also make it a path so you
can open up SVG in GIMP and get
reasonable results you're still turning
it into a bitmap though oh the other I
can you probably notice up here describe
us or scribus that's a open-source
desktop publishing program where we've
also worked a lot with on get improving
their SVG support they have really
really good printing support they do
spot color and they have a really good
PDF engine so we've worked with them a
lot on getting SVG into scribus
subscribe us whatever it is scribus yeah
scribe us it's scribus they can import
SVG and then you can get really nice
pdfs with spot colors if you need to
publish your svgs or send them to a
printer it's a good way to go obviously
the one of the big things SVG was
designed for was interactive websites
it's the w3c right so some examples are
out there here's a couple that I just
pulled to kind of show the features in
the feature set that SVG allows and
brings to a website unlocked as an
example by Adobe
it's a ordering website where for a
theater and you can say hey I want this
seed in that seat yeah you can probably
do that in dynamic HTML but you're it's
going to be a lot harder to get those
seats place the graphics flip them over
then just having the seat as an object
and with a function that's on click and
it switches yellow SVG provides you a
way to do graphics that are interactive
in a way that you can edit them with the
Dom you can use JavaScript all that type
of stuff right in the graphic and it
provides a more rich experience for the
user then because they can use graphics
to interact and people are graphical
there don't really enjoy reading text as
much as they enjoy clicking on a chair
and this was this is a really cool app
because also then it lists the chairs in
the HTML and then you order them and
stuff like that but this is just one
shot of it I think this is another
interesting use of SVG that I think is
going to be much more popular in the
future that's overlays they're using
this as a map graphing data of stds
throughout I think it's just London yeah
London and you can click on the graphic
and say okay show me gonorrhea show me
aids and and it changes the areas based
on the neighborhoods and the statistics
and so it becomes a very visible way of
seeing the data that they've collected
for years and years and years for the
user and they actually targeting a lot
of politicians there because politicians
aren't going to read the report right
they're going to just look at the pretty
graphics and look for red and yellow and
so we can put that on a web page now
with an interactive graphic and you can
see that I actually have the data inside
on a different SVG actually in that case
and so it's actually HTML pulling
together all those SVG's OOP the open
clipart library is also someone who's
using a lot of SVG's basically in the
inscape project we started we had users
generating SVG and they said hey this is
cool can we put the summer we put it on
your website which really didn't match
with the escapes purpose because they
can see its purpose is to make a excuse
me a vector editor so we said hey we
need another project to start collecting
all these clipart that people are
generating and so we created the open
clip art project which has a lot of the
same people in it but it's definitely a
separate project and they're now up to
over
in SVG public domain images that's crazy
that's a lot of content and it's really
exciting because now you can go and take
in your presentation and pull in a
graphic and throw it in and you don't
have to worry about the licensing and
where you got it from and all those
types of issues because it's all public
domain a lot of people criticize the
open clip art project they're like well
why is it public domain shouldn't you
use Creative Commons share like you know
that's more open source but we take the
theory that it's a little bit different
than like GPL encode because G peeling
code puts restrictions are programmers
if they change that program and make
another program but if we said hey we're
going to do CC share alike that means
that any time you do a presentation that
includes open clipart you have to share
that presentation with the world which
really doesn't make sense for business
presentations and it would really hurt
the penetration of open clipart so we've
chosen to go with public domain which is
highly controversial and you can join
the mailing list and hear debate on that
about every three months but that's the
way it is so the reason I was involved
originally an open clipart was because I
was upset that every time you went to a
free software conference the
presentations looked really bad just
text and that that always made me angry
and so I'm like well you know the people
who use Microsoft Office make better
presentations are smarter it's because
they've got all this clip art and I just
click on it and they pull the little guy
in and it looks nice so we need clipart
for us too and so that's one of the
reasons start open clip art library
gnome games this is an example of SVG
where it's not being used on the web
it's being you actually used in real
applications and gnome has the our SVG
engine which is a small library that in
some cases actually renders SVG faster
than it can decompress lid pink and
decompress pings so it's it's designed
for performance for icons and so what
they've done in dome games is a version
I think it's 210 or 212 of Nome is
almost all the graphics are SVG's and
they're currently working to replace all
the ones that aren't svgs and making
SVG's out of them and while you could
say well I really didn't need a scalable
card in solitaire what it allows them to
do is edit them afterward
for some reason clubs become illegal in
France they can change it to some other
thing very easily well if you had pings
you could do it it'd be very difficult
and so the graphics putting kagome SVG
makes them effectively open-source
graphics and so people can edit them
that can change the colors and so that's
all it's one of the good things about
the open clipart library yeah we could
have made an open clipart library of all
pings but if you have that calculator on
there and you wanted it to be read it's
difficult because someone they Lions
anti-aliased and so you have to figure
out where black merged with red and
change all those colors too but if it's
SVG it's vectored you can go change the
color very easily and I believe they're
not doing it that way I believe they're
actually just having every card be an
SVG currently but I imagine they'll
change I think one of the problems there
is inkscape doesn't really support the
nest of pieces very well and most of
them using escape to create the graphics
it's the same thing with the project
tango which is actually working on doing
all the icons for most open source
desktops and try to create a common
commonality basically between all of
them common colors common metaphors the
whole bit and they using scape when we
put in icon rendering and inkscape for
them so they can see the icons and see
what they actually going to render at so
when you zoom in everything looks really
good but when it's an icon sometimes the
anti-aliasing doesn't work so project
tango uses the icon preview in inkscape
for that one laptop per child unless
you've lived under a rock you probably
are familiar with the project the idea
is that they'll be able to produce $150
laptops at 130 so they're coming down to
for all the world's children is the goal
of the project they're specifically
targeting developing economies and it
it's got lots of things designed for
kids in there with the keyboard of mesh
networking all kinds of things for
environments that aren't as wired as the
u.s. one of the things that's cool from
the SPG perspective is they have a chat
client which allows you to draw and you
sell instead of saying hello hey how you
doing you can draw hey how you doing or
draw a little person or whatever you
want
and hit Send and it sends it to the
other person and they've got the SVG
there and that's all done via SVG and
they have it's actually a custom IM
protocol but it's also interesting about
the one laptop per child is the touchpad
is significantly larger than a normal
touchpad and they're trying to implement
tablet like features I mean obviously
it's not like having your own tablet but
so that you can draw effectively and so
that coincides with a chat program where
people can communicate in a graphical
manner maybe you know with symbols that
aren't supportive easily on a standard
ASCII hunter key keyboard this is just a
slide to show some SVG features maybe
you hadn't thought about are things that
you were saying I wonder if SVG supports
that it's just a quick smattering it's
sort of bitmaps markers which are
basically arrowheads most people think
of them they call them markers in SVG
because they can be all different SVG
objects alpha transparency patterns
which is like putting the Polka Dot on
the text gradients you can do all you
want ingredients clones which is
basically taking object and duplicating
it but I more or less a symbolic link so
if you change the original object the
link to it also changes so here I've
used the word clones flipped it but if i
retyped clones and made it clone
singular the shadow would also change
SVG's actually been around since about
99 but it really didn't make a speck
until 2001 then it got a major revision
in SVG 1.1 in 2003 SVG 1.2 is due out I
would say anytime if you would have
asked me last year I would have said it
Oh early two thousand six you'll have
SVG 1.2 we don't have SVG 1.2 today so
it should be out any time they're still
bickering in committee and I try to stay
out of it but some of the features
actually are pretty exciting and flowing
text and graphics which you've actually
implemented ahead of them ratifying the
spec in inkscape which is basically
putting text in arbitrary objects also
have multiple page
which is good for fliers stuff like that
text enhancements basically being able
to have more flexible text objects in
SVG one point 0 1 point 1 you could do
things with multiple text objects but
now you can put them in the same tree
which makes things a little bit easier
streaming and progressive rendering
those are they kind of go hand in hand
but the idea is that you could do it
before and actually our SVG supports
that a little bit but now they're
actually putting it in the spec and
here's how you guarantee the your SVG
stream here's a guarantee the ER SVG's
will progressively render and putting
features in the spec for it vector
effects these are just different things
that we get done to vector objects and
there are standard properties that could
be applied to them and then they're also
putting in audio and video so of course
all of these are conditional in them
actually approving them in the spec so
things may change in the next month but
these are the most of things that I'm
excited about and seem to be relatively
stable and going into the spec I think
probably one of most interesting things
is audio and video because i know of
liking google videos an excellent
example where they've gone and they used
flash because it provides a standard
interface for sending video and if you
could use SVG for that that would
actually be using a browser feature
instead of needing a plug-in so one of
the points I really want to drive home
is that SVG's XML and I'll say it again
and again and again but that's a really
really cool feature because you've
already got tools they've used with XML
you probably have all your key bindings
in your at favorite editor set up for
XML you've got XML features you've used
before XML probably feels okay and you
can use all the same things you use with
XML with SVG I just throw up acronyms up
here in different phrases because these
are some of the things a lot of people
use and they're really really useful
things but now you're just going to use
them with SVG too and so like if you
want to change SVG into a different
format maybe KML you could use xslt to
do that you wanted to use SVG inside an
HTML page you can use XML namespaces and
SVG web edit embed inside the a
tml if you want to progressively load
and background load on a web page you
can use Ajax to background load svgs the
same way as you do HTML if you want to
use javascript in a web page to edit the
structure of the document you can use
dom and if it's embedded in your
document the XML namespaces they're
actually the same Dom as your HTML so
you can edit everything together which
is really interesting unicode it already
supports it it's XML XML supported it
SVG gets it language bindings I think
every programming language has XML
bindings I'd be surprised if there
wasn't what one that didn't maybe
Fortran doesn't but I don't know how
many people are parsing text with
Fortran it's probably limited subset but
probably any language you're using today
has XML language bindings and there are
additional features in an SVG Dom but
99% of the ones you're going to use our
just the XML Dom so you can get a lot of
functionality just by using the XML key
bindings that are already in your
language or not key bindings but
language bindings that already in your
language basically SVG starts with a lot
of primitives and then you can build up
from those to create more complex
graphics some of the basic drawing
primitives are rectangle ellipse polygon
circle polyline line these are pretty
straightforward they pretty much go by
their name rectangle is interesting
because you can do curved line curve two
edges which is great for diagramming
ellipse is just the exposition and raise
height than width polygon I don't think
that needs too much explanation it's of
five points that do it and then it fills
it poly line is it doesn't fill it
circle center and radius line x1 x2 or
x1 y1 y2 0 2 x2 y2 and that can create a
line what's really interesting is when
you start going into paths because paths
allow you to specify arbitrary objects
that can be effectively infinitely
complex and an SPG the way paths work is
there's an attribute on the path element
that is D and then D has a grammar
associated with it that grammar is
basically ascii character and a
specified number of
numbers either integers or floats that
go into that effect that letter and so
the basic ones for drawing straight
lines are move to line two horizontal
line vertical line and you can close the
path also with every one of the letters
I almost forgot to say there is capital
in as lowercase capital means that it's
an absolute lowercase means that it's
relative so if you want to specify your
line starting at a point then all
relative you can do that just use all
lowercase character characters usually
you probably wanna start your first move
to when you create your polygon with a
capital M I guess you could do
relatively be relative from 0 0 but it
makes more sense to be absolute for the
first point but so here's a little
example four points or you just move to
555 and 320 then we did a horizontal
line for 200 so I started here
horizontal line just did a line two down
here to an absolute coordinate capital l
which is 635 475 and we did a negative
vertical line which goes up and then we
close the path and capital doesn't
matter on closed path because there's no
absolute or relative view but both the
lowercase and uppercase work next slide
two of two
so you can also do curves in a variety
of ways part of the most useful is curve
to which is a Bezier curve and I'll get
into those a little bit more if you're
not familiar with them but you can do
move to and then curve two and now what
that does is that takes three additional
points which are point one which is our
move to then one two three which are to
control points and then the second base
point there's also a shorthand notation
where you can skip one of the control
points and it assumes that it's
symmetric with the previous control
point that's a shorthand mode SPD also
supports court occurs in shorthand
quartic I don't think there is useful
because you only get one control point
you can't do as much with them but if
you're trying to compress an SVG
obviously having one control point saves
you a little bit of data there's also
art to which uses ellipses and partial
ellipses and I think it's really overly
complex I'd recommend reading the spec
if you really want to know more about it
but you can do some cool stuff busy a
curves are an interesting interesting
development they're basically two base
points to to control points that could
define any curve so they were
popularized by french engineer named
pierre bezy a who is interested in
automobiles and so he took his
automobiles and he was drawing them and
he wanted to be able to draw the curves
and specify the curves mathematically
and he started using what are now called
Bezier curves excuse me so let's see
this is just the base points the control
points that's all I wanted for the slide
basically what happens is the control
points effect where the curve moves
between the base points I like to think
of it as the line always goes through
the base points and then it's pulled by
the control points in a specific
direction another way to think about it
is that the curve always intersects the
base point in the direction of the line
that connects it so you can see here or
I've got kind of a line here and it
curves in always intersects at that line
so you can think of it as turning how it
has to curve and so then the line kind
of molds based on that
it seems overly complex when I'm sitting
here explaining it to you and you
haven't played with them but I encourage
you to go open up being skatin play with
them a little bit you're like okay
that's not too bad I can kind of make
what I want it's it's not really that
difficult once you get used to them but
they are a little bit complex to explain
what you really need to know is that
there's base points your lines will
always go through the base points you
have control points and those are going
to affect how the curve goes if you pull
the lines out the curves going to be
pulled to there's those control points
more and further away from the base
points for those that like math a little
bit better this is not the standard way
that actually Bezier curves are
explained but I think it's actually a
little more intuitive this way it's just
an algebraic reshuffling of the standard
formula that if you've taken a computer
graphics class you Polly seen what it is
that Bezier curves are defined in a
parametric manner and I've just included
the X up here the Y is exactly the same
if you prefer why replace all the X's
otherwise in your mind and that'll be
why so what we can see is the way I've
to find the formula is in how x0 x1 x2
x3 are impacted and coefficients on
those so x0 is our first control point
x1 or yeah our first base point x1 is
our first control point x2 is our second
control point and x3 is our second base
point this is the same way the SVG spec
was doing it I've kept them consistent
throughout the slides so what would you
see you with these coefficients if we go
from t from 0 to 1 because that's what a
parametric equation does it goes from 0
to 1 and then we look at the influence
of them of how much influence it has on
the total line from 0 to 1 so when we
start the curve m0 is having all of our
influence and m0 is on x 0 so we are
going to intersect X 0 at T equals 0 and
they start moving across you'll see the
m1 has more and more impact eventually
as we get out to the middle we're saying
okay well m0 is dying out we're pretty
much m1 and m2 and then by the time we
get to the end x3 has all the impact so
what ends up happening is you start it
0 or x 0 and used to end up x3 with the
varying influence in the middle but
what's interesting also is that you
notice throughout this curve you don't
end up in a case where m1 or m2
dominates so the the Betsy curve can
intersect the control points but that's
not really part of it that's just
happenstance that if you curves back and
happens to go through one of the control
points it's a question ok so I think
that's a little more intuitive way to
look at busy a curve so you can just see
them as having different impacts you can
see the impact of the different points
as we start to go moving through the
curve on SVG there's a transform a
tribute and a transformer tribute can be
applied to any element it can be applied
to groups it can be applied to the whole
document some of the most useful
transforms our rotates q scale and
translate and this has another pseudo
syntax that's attached to it so you have
an attribute which is transformed and
then you can start attaching these and
you can just put spaces between them but
as many as you'd like if you want to
translate skew then rotate slightly and
then translate again that's totally fine
within the SVG spec the each one's
pretty simple it's just scale XY
translate X Y and but most of these the
Y can be left off if you don't want
translate in the y direction but require
the X because you need the X to feed the
Y and then also there is a matrix
operator so if you really do like doing
the matrix math the old-fashioned way
you don't need to use the shorthand and
you can use the matrix operator to do
anything you'd like in SVG you have fill
and Stroke which are basically how
object gets filled or how the lines get
drawn on the object and one of the
interesting things about SVG is that you
can do all the strokes with everything
you can do in the phils formats like
flash don't support gradient strokes so
if i define a fill and i set the proper
CSS property of phil to be you know read
the phil will be read i said the stroke
to be read struggle
read but I can also set it to be a
another object in the document so let's
say a pattern or a gradient and so i can
set here's my polka dot pattern as a
stroke everywhere where there's a polka
dot and the stroke intersect we see
graphic here here's when polka dot
pattern is a fill and you can see what
happens there is we have effectively a
polka dot object and you can define in
patterns how the intersects so if i
don't like the polka dots here and i
really want the dot over here something
like that i can adjust that and how the
alignment happens between the pattern
and the object the same way that's
stroke we've already seen any support
gradients gradients are pretty simple in
SVG it basically comes down to you have
a gradient which goes across an area
from 0 to 1 and you have a bunch of
gradient stops and so gradient stops can
be any SVG color so it can be the
traditional red or it can be a
hexadecane 500 FF or it can be ICC
colors which are also supported in SVG
so here's a simple gradient it just
starts off and it goes straight position
0 it starts at color black with a nope a
city of 1 a position one quarter it
still says black but we go to alpha 0 so
it becomes transparent which since the
background is white you really can't
tell the difference between out one in
the one the corner I guess I plug
shoulda put a graphic behind it but it
actually becomes transparent at the very
far corner over there you can see what
we did is we made it go all the way to
black and full opacity and then over
here it goes all the way to white so
what ends up happening is you
interpolate between the steps in a
linear manner and so you can create more
complex gradients but you end up having
to do it iteratively so if you want to
do a parametric gradient you have to
specify the points and you get some sort
of almost aliasing I guess will be the
term for that type of gradient but for
most people gradients of linear complex
enough and you can do radial gradients
and lay gradients on top of each other
so you end up having complex gradients
even though you don't have necessarily
all the features
possibly imagine there's a lot more to
SVG and I'm not going to cover today
because it's complex but I just wanted
to highlight just to make sure that
they're on your radar things that hey I
wonder if I can do that with SVG hey
I'll look at the spec you can do
patterns I didn't go into them more than
just saying that they do exist but there
they can be interesting because you can
make a pattern and then refer to it by
multiple objects so if you wanted to say
have a pattern via graphic and then have
views into that graphic you could use
the same graphic once and then have a
bunch of different views into it
animation there's the animation object
in SVG and I think it's more useful for
things like sprites like you want to
have a button that blinks in and out you
can make that an animation object in SVG
and then have JavaScript control whether
it's blinking out or not people do use
it from our complex stuff but I think
that's where it's more useful filter
effects these are things like drop
shadows and gradients we don't currently
support those inning escape so it's
really hard to make slides that showed
out works but that's one of our google
Summer of Code projects clipping and
masking is what you expect to be able to
clip graphics and ask them pull out
different areas when you duplicate
objects and SVG also supports embedding
fonts fonts aren't true type do you
can't put all the hinting and all that
type of stuff inside but it is good
enough for embed all the fonts send this
to my customer or I want to have this
font on my webpage embedded inside the
graphic inkscape SVG is a really neat
format in the fact that it's got a lot
of simple primitives but then to do
something more complex it really starts
to get crazy I know there's a couple you
in the room going hey I can do all that
with emacs and you can I don't recommend
it but you can because when happens
these graphics start to get complex when
your especially when you do have
multiple gradients and even this
presentation slide I have I think it's
six gradients on the screen right now
just two going across the different the
inkscape logo in the corner or the
background gradient the gradient of the
black line there and yeah you can do all
that in a text editor but if you want to
draw them on Alisa and a test text
editor more power to you I'll use
inkscape
it's open source which is a neat thing
because you can download the source code
and actually make it pipe compile on any
platform you like we already do support
windows and linux and OS 10 and their
people have got to compile even on
solaris and I Rick's but I haven't
actually seen it running on those
platforms it's a vector illustration
program which is similar to Adobe
Illustrator or coreldraw or Zara you may
view some of those tools a lot of people
have a fondness for Mac draw if you
really like Mac draw it's exactly like
Mac draw we use SVG is our native format
which means that every document the save
in inkscape in SVG inkscape SVG will
have all the data all everything to come
back and edit it you save where you are
it'll save all the things you configured
all that type of stuff will be in the
file we do that by doing an xml
namespace on top of SVG where we add all
the editor data that people expect to
have in a vector illustrator that
doesn't necessarily in SVG as a just a
vector graphics format so we also
provide a save as plain SVG where you
pull that namespace out if you're
publishing to the web or if you're just
you want to lose that data for something
you can do that in inkscape it's
included in all major linux distros we
called microsoft and asked him to
include in vista but they really haven't
called us back I don't know what the
deal is there maybe we got the wrong
number and ink view can be used for
slides I didn't use it today because it
doesn't do full screen on OS 10 but I do
use it on Linux which I can't do get to
do video out so it does work well for if
you get your laptop to do video out and
in Linux in escape started from a couple
of code bases the original one was Gil
my Ralph 11 Levien and that was back in
99 if you remember back to our SVG time
table that was pretty much when the
first working draft came out ralph was
really on SVG before it really became
popular at all he got tired of the
project basically and so Laura said hey
can I take that and make that into my
own thing and so he took the guilt code
base and made it into Saudi pudding so
do poedu you developed
for quite a while until the inkscape
team decided to fork it and making
escape which was started in November of
2003 and so then we've continued on
indefinitely I don't believe so deep OD
is currently being developed but I'm not
that familiar with their development I'm
not on the mailing list or anything like
that anymore if you look at the
screenshots it's kind of interesting to
see how it's progressed this is the
original Gill which is I'd say barren
it's maybe not what you'd expect when
you've drawn your vector graphics but it
did the job and it had basically the
core of what SVG was and why this video
is going to become so it's important to
note in the history and you can see so
deep OD really really started to get a
lot of the complex shapes you can see
there's a lot of complex drawing that's
already can be done in Saudi pudding
unfortunately lot of that's in the
render and you can't get to it via the
GUI but there's a lot of neat stuff that
can be done in Saudi pudding and then we
think we've really taken it to the next
level with inkscape you can see where
we've done some really complex gradients
in the screenshot and you can see how
the user interface has changed
significantly and that's one of the
things we're proud of we think we have
an intuitive user interface a lot of
people can sit down and start drawing
with inkscape without really
understanding the power that's involved
in inks game we have menus that we've
actually thought about we sit down and
go through the menus and say hey what
really belongs here so we like to say
the menus are well thought out of course
everyone will disagree and when there's
an XML format you can change the menus
if you'd like we have quick access tools
on the left but then as you click these
we get a context-sensitive menu bar so
currently this screenshots in node
editor and so all these tools here on
the second toolbar are things you'd use
while your node editing if you go to the
rectangle tool things will pop up
they're useful while you're using the
rectangle tool I think Microsoft's using
it in ribbons in their new office it's
kind of the same idea the idea is that
when you're working with this particular
tool you've got other toolbars that are
useful and so that switches depending on
which tool you're in we have fast layer
selection down here which I just love
because I work on a lot of layers and
it's real easy just to flip them around
right there in the bottom of the screen
this is my favorite comment on the slide
it's actually useful status bar because
in my experience most people have
stopped using the status bar they've
stopped they ignore it it might as well
not be there because they're not really
useful there's not a lot of useful
information there but uh nice cape we've
really tried to put hey this is what you
need to know right now on the status bar
you can see where i am i'm editing to
nose and it says hey you've got two of
two nodes selected you can drag the
nodes of the node handles if you use alt
drag its well it's cut off because i
shrunk the screen for our taking the
screenshot says hey if you all drag the
notes it's going to adjust all the nodes
around it for you and so that
information is available so you don't
have to really memorize the entire key
map thanks cape which is huge we've got
tons of key codes but most the ones you
want they're right here on the status
bar so you just flip down look for the
bold stuff and you can figure out what
you're doing boolean operations this is
probably you remember these from school
you've done them and seve did and let's
have a things but we can do is we could
do those with graphics and this is
really important when you're creating
graphics because there's a lot of
primary shapes your circles your
rectangles but chances are you're not
publishing circles and rectangles you
want shapes that are a little more
complex than that and boolean operations
make it easy to draw those shapes you
can take a circle and add a square to it
and it kind of looks like a light bulb
those things are a lot easier when you
can just draw circles and squares and
then compose those together so Inc see
it provides a full set of boolean
operations that you can do to all your
paths no matter how complex the path
skip so if you want to add two paths
together cut two paths across each other
that's all supported in inkscape and
this is something that's not in the SVG
spec the SVG spec has nothing about
boolean operations and it doesn't need
to because it defines a path we've got
two paths and make a third path or some
cases one path out of the two paths and
sow SVG provides the basic element that
we can use but then inkscape uses that
to create something better and so that's
why I think if you can get the feel of
why you'd want to use inkscape the
reason is because you can take these
base elements and manipulate them
together
bitmap tracing this is also a really
useful feature because I don't know how
many of you worked with a client they go
hey here's my logo I had it done for
years ago and this guy gave me a JPEG of
it is that useful and you're going no
it's really not we need to put it on
these flyers and it's just going to look
awful and so you could trace it in
inkscape and I wouldn't say the tracings
one hundred percent you're not
necessarily not you're not necessarily
going to have something you want to just
throw on the printer right away but it
gives you the basic format of anything
and then you can start editing it here's
one where we've done a flower and that's
kind of complex is because this photo
realistic you probably wouldnt want to
edit that but you can clean it up we
have smoothing tools and stuff like that
to refine the image after you've traced
it oh and credit goes to PO trace that's
the library we included to get them map
tracing we also have what's called clone
tiles we talked about clones a little
bit either earlier which are basically
some bolic links to another object and
because of the xml nature of SVG it's a
tree and so when you put a style like a
cascading style sheet when we put a
style at the top that cascades down to
all the other objects and so what we can
do is we can say okay we've got one
object this little circle up in the
corner let's make all these symbolic
links let's change how that cascades
down and so what we can do is that we
can say okay this has the properties of
black but it doesn't have the properties
of transparency on it so when I cascaded
I'll put transparency and all the ones
that I cascade from and so it creates
really complex shapes and styles using
only one object you've only got one
object in this entire thing or supply
this one I would guess and then you drip
down and it can do randomness and alpha
and color and position all these types
of things when you edit and create this
clone tile and so you've got a very
simple object you've created a complex
drawing with there's also the ability to
have the color map to another image and
so I saw a demonstration where a guy
took this basically this shape and
napped it to a painting and it looks
like it has brush strokes because it's
kind of different as the colors changed
as it goes over the painting so clone
tiles are very interesting in that you
can create more
flex shapes from something very simple
excuse me extensions extensions are
included in 44 they're actually
available in earlier releases but there
are you have to go the Preferences
enable the experimental feature but in
44 extensions are our effects or their
extensions have always been an inkscape
but one of the goals we had in inkscape
was to create first class extensions
what we mean is we want to be able to
move code out of the core and into
extensions without the users ever
noticing I want to create a small core
with as little as possible so they can
be fast and optimized and all those
extra features are outside so well the
first things we realized is XML is a
text format and there's a lot of tools
out there that work with XML already why
are we going to reinvent our own so
we've got standard in standard out boom
we can use all these tools we can use
all these format converters and so we've
defined a format we call scripts where
you can define a script and use that
script in inkscape and the user doesn't
know there's an illustrator to SVG
converter they go file open click on the
illustrator file and it opens yeah it
was running a script and it used pearl
and all this type of other stuff but the
user doesn't care they open their hunt
OBO illustrator file that's all taken
care of by inkscape behind the scenes
the effects are new in 44 they're
actually not experimental anymore and
this is an example some of the effects
we have we have about 20 or 30 currently
in 44 interpolate paths took edge of
these paths and interpreting them down
to a line you can also interpret late
between arbitrary paths blur edge copies
a particular object and it extends it
out creates the larger offset outset
Nell system plotter if you want to make
trees for a forest or anything else in
it's just kind of a fun thing to play
with in its next screen candy if the
thing I wanted to impress the Muslims
presentation was SPG's XML the second
thing I want to stress in a presentation
is that there's really cool interactive
tutorials in inkscape an inkscape we've
got tutorials that are actually SVG
files which means that instead of going
in there and saying
well you can edit rectangles like this
it goes hey there's a rectangle there
edit they are tangled like this and so
what ends up happening is you can
actually interact and use the tutorials
and use the tools while you're looking
at the tutorial which is really really
great and I don't know why everybody
else doesn't do that but it creates the
way that you can learn without having to
have like two or three monitors so
there's really great interactive
tutorials there's been a lot of time put
into them they're translated into
whatever language you like not whatever
but there's they're translated to i
think four or five languages or maybe
even have ten now we've had a huge
translation push for the last release
there's basic shapes advanced racing
calligraphy is really great it actually
goes into the history of calligraphy so
if you're at all interested in
calligraphy I'd actually recommend just
reading the tutorial because it has
actually is interesting reading there's
two that I think that the engineers
Polly should read which is elements of
design and tips and tricks because the
most the time when I've met engineers
they don't really understand composition
and so if you want it pretty graphics
that's a great way to go do pretty
graphics because you start to learn
about ok what's color here what's what's
what is my layout doing what is it
meaning and elements of design it's
actually written by a guy who teaches
art classes in San Francisco so it's
it's real layers on in AC 844 we added a
layer dialog I showed you the quick
select layer a little bit earlier I
pointed it out but that's just at the
bottom which is very useful actually but
we also have a full layer dialog what's
interesting about layers is they're
actually just implemented as SVG groups
which are just basically simple
containers for other SVG elements but
then we've added as an xml namespace
inkscape group mode and you can set that
to layer and then we pull them out as
groups and we can add names to them and
add them to the GUI which makes it so
you can create more complex graphics and
my favorite feature is actually the lock
because that causes me not to edit
everything at the same time and I can
actually focus on what I'm doing
inkscape also supports putting RTF
metadata inside the SVG file
which is actually a really neat feature
for large art shops where they're saying
okay where did I get this document from
do I have license to use it in Spain
what license that it come with this type
of information is really really useful
for those type of people because when
you put the wrong graphic on a billboard
it's hard to take it down so having that
information inside the file is very very
important for large art shops which have
complex licensing agreements with all
kinds of vendors and of course we have a
good smattering of all the creative
commons licenses that we'd like them to
use just a little encouragement inkscape
also has an xml editor and this is
probably where most of the people in the
room will find themselves in inkscape
because they really want to tweak
something right and you just can't do it
with the detail you want in that editor
you got to go change it number by number
and so you can go into inkscape pop of
the xml editor and actually select
individual tags edit the attribute's hit
ctrl enter in that attribute takes
effect right then your rearrange
elements it takes effect right then it's
a live editor on the inkscape XML tree
internally so this is a very cool
feature for if you need to really tweak
your XML or you want to do specific IDs
on specific objects because you want to
be able to refer to them by get ID in
the Dom you do that in XML editor very
quickly as I'm closing up I wanted to
actually say what we did for our google
Summer of Code projects because I
imagine most of your shareholders and
Google so you know where your money's
going for 2005 we built an open clipart
repository browser which actually allows
you to drag and drop open clipart
repository into inkscape and I think one
of the cooler features is that else it
supports a local repository so if you
download all of open clipart and untie
it on your machine it works but it also
supports a remote repository so if you
don't want to download it all to your
machine you just want to grab specific
graphics it'll do that to import which
is our job or chat feature you can
actually use inkscape over jabber to
work with work groups or
individual users the work group features
and the actual integration of the main
code base was confited finished last
summer the XF format didn't actually
work out big but okay the guy who did it
didn't quite get the spirit of the
project it was I'm really too busy to do
this well it's your job you're kind of
getting paid for it well I guess in the
end he didn't but um yeah it's going to
use 3d studio yeah well the funny part
about it is that like we do have some
dxf for export and there's a community
in the UK of people who do scrapbooking
like the memory books and there's a
cutter that you can cut individual
shapes out of that takes dxf files and
ink escapes created gotten a huge
following in these scrapbooking
community where they're drawing custom
graphics to cut out on this cutter and
so they exported dxf and actually use
the cutter and so I when we started
inkscape I never would have thought
scrapbookers in the UK was a target
market but it's a there's a whole huge
amount of tutorials and everything i'm
using inkscape on the scrap booking
websites which i think is really cool
well we also have connectors for shapes
so you can say okay the shape draw an
arrow to that shape and as you move the
shapes around it redraws the lines for
you that was also done for thanks keep
summer of code project our google summer
of code project and you can also avoid
objects so if you want everybody to
avoid that square it'll route around
different objects 2006 which is just
started actually midterm evaluations are
here in a couple weeks we've got two
people working on SVG filter effects
those are things like drop shadow and
other bitmap effects that are can be
defined in SVG we don't currently
support those in inkscape and I think
it's basically agreed on that's one of
the biggest parts of the SVG spec we
haven't implemented so we're very
excited we had a ton of proposal on it
and two guys were actually interested in
different parts of it so Lisa day work
on it together and we'll hopefully have
by the end of the summer a really
world-class SVG filters implementation
the library we use Frank board
didn't really compile on Windows they
said they support windows nobody really
got it to link correctly and there was a
huge amount of problem so we need to
switch libraries we also need a document
it because the jabber folks want to
standardize on a whiteboard protocol
because there's the thing three
implementations now of SVG / jabber and
we really want one to be right and so to
do that we need to actually document our
protocol which we haven't done so that's
one of the projects lastly memory
optimization unfortunately inkscape is a
memory hog especially if you get large
significant graphics it starts to really
suck up the Moran we're going to
hopefully fix that and we've also got
memory leaks we've actually added
garbage collection to most of our core
objects which has helped that a lot but
it's still over time does League memory
so we're hoping profiling and fixing and
profiling and fixing and profiling
fixing well make inkscape a lot better
lastly which is the one I'm entering as
PDF export via Cairo obviously we can
use other things because Cairo has
backends besides PDF but PDF is the core
format for exchanging graphics really
today if you want to send a graphic to a
customer and you're drawing it in
inkscape PDFs really where you want to
go and so we can get PDF output easily
using cairo but it also allows us to
understand cairo and how it's going to
impact inkscape so we can start to look
at changing inkscape score canvas over
to cairo also the future of inkscape is
further SPG compliance filters is a huge
part of that but there's actually a lot
more of the SVG spec we need to
implement further support of things like
the SVG switch statement which allows
you to do conditional text based on
language and stuff like that is
important for escape to be fully SVG
compliant you want to switch to a chiro
render is a minute mentioned we need
more color management for professional
environments people need things like
spot colors which we can't currently do
we actually in this release we link to
little CMS which is a CMS implementation
that's open source which gives us a lot
of that but we need to actually finish
implementing all those features and
providing them to the user path effects
are another way we're going to go with
the effects to
have it actually interact with a path so
if you want to say okay I'm going to
draw my path and then I want it to look
like it was stroked with a marker well
you can apply path effect but yeah you
can do that once which isn't very
exciting but if you can go back and edit
it as a path and still have the marker
outline or a brush that's really
interesting and so that's what we want
to be able to do with path effects
hopefully after the summer of code will
be able to have ink board compile by
default we haven't don't have it
compiled by default now because it's not
supported on Windows and we want to have
everything supported across platform so
it's an optional compile hopefully at
the end of the summer will be able to
make it compiled by default then every
inkscape user will have ink board
support which unfortunately some jabber
servers don't like because it's too much
data so well everybody'll be upset at us
for crashing jabber servers we also want
to add improved tablet support inkscape
does have tablet support today but it's
mostly pressure tilt which are the
important ones but things like erasers
and advanced features like that so we've
got all the basic tablet support if you
pull out a tablet you can play with it
and use the calligraphy tool and it
looks really nice but we want to be able
to add full tablet support before we
feel we can say that we need to support
all the idiosyncrasies of tablets I told
you I bring it up again SVG's XML you've
got a lot of XML tools the in your in
your pocket already and you can use
those with SVG with very little
retooling Escape is taking our SVG is
taking over the internet I thought I'd
put it in there if I can convince you
that that's great I don't know that it's
taking over the internet yet but i think
it is gaining a lot of momentum
implementations are really supporting it
today you can as a web developer
actually you know most of the time
people do have SVG support and so that
means that necessarily you shouldn't be
changing your website to SVG today beep
I should have a plan for hey how am I
going to use SVG when it comes and
actually becomes very very real in
people's implementations inkscape will
help you create svgs however you want to
do them in escapes really good there you
can also do other cool stuff there's
people use inkscape for art all kinds of
crazy stuff that I never would have
thought you can using escape for like
scrapbooking and it's just it's a good
graphics editor
even though if you don't care about SVG
you can use it as a graphics editor and
use it to print out flyers or make
presentations and also I just want to
say thank you again for google Summer of
Code we're really happy to have the
contributions links pretty one who cares
I put the presentation there yet but i
will spds website in its graphics SVG
inkscape org and SVG org has lots of
good information on SVG if there's a
they've got like a listing of all the
phones that support SVG if there's a new
tool that comes out for SVG it'll be on
SVG org it's just a very specific news
site for SVG related materials and
questions thank you sir
attached
yeah Firefox will I either do that and
you just have the standard is basically
the same as HTML you got icon click on
mouseover onmouseout same type of events
and then you can put yes yep and
supported by Adobe actually Adobe in
their plug-in has their own JavaScript
implementation so you don't have to deal
with the JavaScript implementation nie
so it's even it's even better than that
yes there's a format i have it's a PS
tricks i think is what it is it's a
latex can be used for late tech i
haven't used myself yeah i haven't used
that myself but i know that people use
that for low tech a lot but perfect in
fact ingestion without seriously one
favorite feature of the illustrator see
here
no much gradient there's a rumor that it
was going to be in 1.2 but I haven't
seen anything that I would consider a
yes it's definitely going to be 11.2 for
the most part mesh gradients could be
done with overlapping radio gradients I
mean obviously it's a little bit more
difficult to manage their but yeah mesh
gradient isn't in SVG and we couldn't
figure out a way we thought about how
could we implement these could we use
multiple radial gradients and you know
emulator Ramesh gradient but the math
really doesn't work out you can do it
perfectly and so we couldn't provide an
interface that did a mesh gradient and
implemented in a way that other SVG
renders could see it so and what I did
is I was like oh how does the dobie do
it if adobe did it some way we can just
steal the same way Adobe does it right
well if you export a mesh gradient in
Illustrator to SVG it's a bitmap you
cheat it I was trying to figure out how
they did the math but no they just
cheated they did admit now filter
effects probably the biggest one is the
like blur so you can do an arbitrary
object and say drop a blur behind it and
it will be actually a full gradient full
Gaussian blur and so there's all kinds
of effects this one that comes to mind
mostly I think of filter effects and
that's when we're going to implement
first but what's cool about it is that
you can say okay I've got an entire
layer and it's got fifty thousand
objects and I whatever you can say okay
as add my blur to that and so then it
has a drop shadow of all those objects
which is really cool because then as you
added in layer the drop shadow is all
move around with you it's kind of like
using you know s10 with the drop-down
menus Grady the drop shadows just appear
so it's a really neat feature and I'm
actually our SVG supports it a lot in
Firefox supports a few of them not all
of them and so we're really excited to
get an escape because we saw with a blur
edge effect you kind of get that same
effect but it's effectively rasterizing
it because it's just doing 11 steps
there to create the blur but actually
able even able to do it and having it
correct it's exciting it opens up a lot
of possibilities
he's that kind of crying out for busy
gradients I would say so that I think
that that I mean they were talking about
gradient improvements for 1.2 I I don't
know what the status of those are the
last time I asked though I heard they
were maybe so the fact that s v 1.2
hasn't happened yet I can't really say
either way but I think a buzzy a
gradient would make sense um what we've
done in like our GIMP a gradient
importer as if there's a curved gradient
we just sample it and it looks pretty
good I mean I don't know gradients are
hard to tell specific points on but yep
I'm I'm not saying it wouldn't be better
i think that there would be a really i
think i'd be a significant impact
because you do the gradient meshes you
could do curve too if you did busy eight
gradients you can do anything basically
however you want to curve if you want to
do parametric or whatever you want to do
you could implement it as a bezier curve
but they haven't so until we can figure
out a way to implement that in a way for
other SVG renderers to see it we're not
going to do at an XK
