the organizer the workshop for making me
today so when I talk about today's and
analysis of sparkly
it's the kumbaya so that so that has
been the focus of the great deal of
research over the last decade also and
the main idea behind sparkly flying
model singles as munition of a few
presentations so this term security
apply to number different settings
Langston to neuroscience image
processing completion or duplicity and
so on so people have came up with
different projects that one star study
some of them use convex tools similar
analysis Bayesian methods and with
emphasis and focus on the next equation
population which actually they need to
be one of the most widely used most
common approach was possibly so in this
city we basically consider a set of hand
signals that are developed in space
respect to X and into the signals
represented by any features and we also
consider literary composer P Adams this
matrix because it also the composition
matrix that contains poverty position
for each of the signals it's so this can
be written in matrix form as this
product here X should be equal to G
times a right so one way to obtain the
decomposition matrix a and it really is
to try to solve this formation here
where we originally try to optimize over
the so we don't only want to waste and
if Sigma but I miss everyone on here to
make sure that we ought to use
efficiency so here I will carry out
there with implicit and specific set of
dictionaries which is the diction the
set of dictionary where each additional
relevant each item as so we can actually
equivalently rewrite this formulation as
the optimization of our function of D
Omni and I cannot dysfunction by bang
bang and so basically elements obtained
by realizing out the composition thing
and so basically f of X is defined as
the average over the function f of X
that there are possibly function for a
single signal so in spite of the the
fact that stuff that has led to the
currency in many many tasks there have
only been a few political analysis that
support this evidence base is a blue
line of only one hand some people try to
characterize the generalization probably
off as possibly like you are giving some
Dennis a 20 pounds generalisation pounds
and on the other hand and this is gonna
be the topic of the talk today the
second type of analysis which is known
as the analysis and so in this context
instead of focusing on the very
difficult question of trying to
characterize affirmative global minima
we interested in the /p in a simple
question which is which consists first
in actually gives past all of the
signals where we have some dictionaries
around here Xfinity Cary and some stuffs
to alpha 0 and the question that we ask
is does the function f of n as a move
mini-mart around the speech and so
people biogenesis provide the first
answer to this question in decades and
in the case where dictionary is the
basis this first one has been extended
to the case of a battery but still in
averseness
singing try to do today in this talk is
to once the
and to try to extend this work in the
king of noisy signals also outliers in
the signal models and the Jacob over the
completion rates and so to be really
more specific we will consider some
heuristic level for the signals with
somebody's that is the text then maybe
the signal
exit may be generated as the product Dez
can do for some us random vectors as a
general system
random noise excellent and so they will
be to to try to characterize in an
asymptotic way the probability with
respect to the difference so see the
randomness in the problem of finding the
function f and so for convenience and
just reminding is the definition of the
function and program that's very central
throughout my talk all right so it's
average of this public function for
signal signals so there is an important
film up to make at this stage of the
analysis is that as soon as we consider
this formulation with objective
functions there are basically some
enzymes which is scientists of the
dictionary and a computations that
increasing this formulation and this
result in the fact that we cannot go for
exactly identifying the dictionary be 0
but the best we can do is basically to
consider the equals class of the
confirmation of the teacher it is Rho G
0 with respect to those operations with
incentives and any difference if you
want to do better and this we have
so perhaps of a tradition why should we
care that his problem of disability so
first I consider that this problem where
we consider a very simple scenario is
basically a sanity check who that just
verified as fast Olivia's doing what we
expect it to do to several motivation is
to better understand the world burn
under a minute in spark minute
so for instance I I mentioned here the
other atoms which is irregular which is
in practice difficult to sex is not very
well understood in the case of refugees
complete begins it would also be
interesting to better understand what is
the knowledge and the fraction of the
out levels that can be acceptable in
this context and in the same way in for
us as a guideline for some petitioner it
would be interesting to understand the
simple complexity of possibility in the
sense that it would have to do in
practice or in a similar way need to to
go to our evolutionary musically the
result motivation which consists which
is basically different this time
so as we will see when we see in our
analysis we actually see one of the
contribution of the curvature what are
the contribution and in Y parameter
contribute to be the temperature of the
function and event around some will be
eva and by understanding this this we
trust pave the way for the new
strategies so now a couple of questions
that are raised by our objectives and so
I would like to present a few of them
and basically those creation of
represent the roadmap that was for me in
my talk so interestingly the question
are related to different aspects the
soft aspects are related to geometrical
and optimization in begins so the first
question that our PD to sit in is how
can we characterize the local media over
the specific set of dictionary
especially this dysfunction of F of n
which is a three case in the sentence it
aspires to the realization of a radical
position it is not convex we do know
exactly what this is duty of smoothness
is so this function is quite complicated
there are also some ingredients related
to statistical aspects so I mentioned
probability so what is the reveal
exactly to prevent see more of my people
fear for heads with an exception on
Jimmy's first dictionary and also I
mentioned that the hope will be proteins
of necessity purse also but I'm gonna be
the tool that we need this one best
so let me begin with the durability of
the second dictionary and the
characterization of the loo minima so
the some point although analysis is to
try to exploit the charity of the second
dictionary so remember that the set of
dictionary is basically a conifer sphere
each mission elegance is first with some
unit and so this set of dictionaries
actually
very many folding and tilting platform
and Yankee Beach parrot parrot right
setup dictionary with superfamily of
that we hope that we all go through the
rieflin dictionary easier and so I
introduced this family of curve we
define a scheme and that depends on
three paragraphs wvlt so let me explain
you what those asperity so basically TV
star and can be seen as a radius while
deep at the matrix of value and the
vector V can be seen as parameters
that's defined the directions of the
curve and most typically the bank if W
belongs to the tangent space at the
response dictionary G 0 right so let me
show you some registration of history of
curves of the manifold and we grow some
one of these curve so basically books
the point 0 and if you take the tangent
at this point we obtain this matrix here
so you can easily check that if you take
here the radius equal to 0 because each
one in design disappears and you
basically get back and you can also easy
check that for all set of parameters the
curve is indeed in the center of each
area right so now based on this
characterization of the set of
dictionary will be able to characterize
someone whom is not most typically if we
consider some Rangers - and if I able to
show that the function f of n takes when
to tell you then the function ever LNG
stable for curves
40 straight news - so if I able to show
this then we can include that assumption
element and some local minima in his
fall here which is centered at the
dictionary so just to give you the
intuition of your victims super phytase
in 1d so basically this is so
which we have seen was so much
complicated so the main idea of the I
try to simplify the function f of them
is to use an idea related to traffic
already so what do I do - let's have a
look at the function f of X 1 single
signals so if you ask me that this
function here are some solution and hats
please corresponding support chain if
you was to assume that this matrix here
DJ's will DJ's in vegetable and if we
also control the same vectors of
solution so it quite easy to show that
the function f of X Y exactly's another
function serve a function for we should
have an HPC form so just I mean youngji
is that expression of this circuit
function but it's important to keep in
mind is that as soon as we're able to
control the sign of this solution here
we as we have they have simple
expression for this function so this is
a Magnus's so when are we going to be
able to exploit these facts so we have
just seen that on a servile condition
which actually the function f of X of
interest means that means the surrogate
function so now in the perspective of
having to make some realistic ones who
have to if you want to do this that this
one this sign vector is actually a
rentals
so a natural question that arise is when
can we simplify this this exhibition by
asking to be equal to the site of the
generating clinicians which would mean
that we would get rid of the dependency
with respect to the guys here and so
this region actually exactly is going to
exact perfectly which is regular
research or and when will drive business
problems but here we have to go and you
see that in that particular way it's
important to notice that the signal is
likely from here because we are not into
particle read only at the different here
but we also like to obtain support
recovery for a dictionary from the gun
which is likely which will be which is
next to far away and when this means
that we will have to accept exact
perfect oh really take into account this
dictionary perturbation and so if we
introduce this even see the given
sequence ID where the functional
interests coincide means the circuit
function this timing next time sine beta
decided through general conditions now
it turns as we can show that this even
care about what happens with high
probability
provided activation is no enough
the initial move we had so we might just
remember that we release the local min
adhabi distribution to prove this
inequality for both direction and so
since it is complicated to work directly
on the function f of n well do is to
construct the double bounce and this
difference and show that the lower bound
is itself to be positive and yeah yeah
yeah that is actually always control the
difference of the function f of X and
this relates that before the idea is
that based on the definition of these
two structures
it's quite easy to show that they are
both bounded by the energy of the
signals and so if basically apply the
triangle inequality it's not complicated
to see that's the difference of those
root function is running this way that
is either this motion queenside as we
have seen before in which gave the
difference or if they give up the inside
you have a simpler to graph by the
energy of the signal and so if we sum
over each signal set up a signal in
order to get back to the food should
have event we obtain this conclusion
which is we have the difference of the
function f which is a bounded by our
surrogate function g of m minus a will
to alter our event that basically
measured how far the surrogate and the
function
disagree all right and so now the
objective is to prove that this turbine
here will be strictly positive so let's
just quickly so we mentioned that we
permissive models for the single so that
we detailed et yesterday generative
model so the signal has generated in
this way as I mentioned before the
resolution is gonna be fixed here and we
will assume some we next mass action and
additionally zero and the other section
will be lie on the coherence of
dictionary so just the currents is
basically a measure of the degree of
correlation inside additionally the
spa's random vectors are residual energy
generated in the following way so we
first threw a super cheap size which of
size k then for the coefficient are
outside of the support vectors grown
with sets direction equal to 0 and for
the coefficient inside this reports we
are showing that those coefficients are
generated according to some damn
symmetric distribution and the dance of
is the distribution argument here and
finally the noise is assumed the option
with some times Sigma spawn so let's get
that to objective we have seen that we
wanted to prove that someone here here
is strictly only for both the direction
effect by the unity in fact with some
careful
and so we have this
at the dictionary easier so just give
you the main idea the main trend that
that is a 90 page results so yeah is
that the localized we want a local team
at the small and arranges the more
points the more observation we needs and
this one of the nervous has to be so
this is quite an actual completion
okay so I have put here in include
description father but it's a victory
slot so it's optimal and reduce another
scaling that we would like to improve is
this coherence something which is
questioning at the moment and we will go
to the end of the debate badness respect
to the full size of the dictionary here
so let me now including some people
message because this is so we have shown
that it was possible to prove that fast
agree and it's a local minima in this
specific generative model of the
Baskervilles and other good spirits work
through variable to consider the case of
noisy signals I actually have not have
time to to make sure that we explain how
we can consider outsiders
we can actually extend our generative
model to include some fraction of
outliers and still be able to guarantee
the existence for local minima the idea
that our analysis actually on we dies on
the energy of the bad signals in mind so
we can basically put everything as soon
as potential energy of all those bad
signals I have tried to relate emphasis
on the analysis and I just at once I go
to the zone because I tend to believe
that he is the analysis itself is
interesting and tend to try life some
interesting aspects in the circuit of
fact that it relies on different
consideration of different nature of
each video optimization and statistics
and as future directions it will be
interesting to consider more general and
more realistic signal for those 20 days
on the compressible priors
so did you use these baseball playoffs
which in have practical dictionaries
very very sad signal who never actually
defined the dictionary d0 and use a
little Bazemore support myself like
exact edition for instance to be very
useful for for making some dictionaries
that are very back we all see those
spikes yeah
so it's true that we again we have to
well we need this assumption to be
honest it's actually perfectly but we
assume that's true
Eco grams which is way stronger perhaps
there's some room for improvements and
in this respect and this kind of
assumption or do is not as convenient
method expression based on another way
that we someone consider is to consider
deterministic communis berries exception
with probability Bayes assumption which
would reduce the skating nuts in one of
the k but what over the is also the most
natural and so process may be a way to
reduce the children assumption
