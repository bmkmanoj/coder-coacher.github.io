of days for monthly and a few guys Karen
to wreck the other guys in New York
didn't obviously BCM I don't know with
it alternates later than anyway so I
today I'm totally giving a brief talk on
a project that I that I started with
with about 1000 volunteers in all
important about I would say it started
in june july last year and the effort is
basically and introducing programming to
kids from the very basic fundamentals
they don't know any program they don't
have any programming background before
this before they come there and we
entreat rai and give them an idea of
what programming it is inspire them so
that they can decided they want to study
further when they further when they when
they get them up in any to study at at
school and with sons name this project
ammonia since its growth since is
growing quite big and just just a brief
little brutal thing on ammonia it's it's
the Zulu word for Python which is the
language that we let me teach a little
brief introduction to the scituate if I
key situation in South Africa so some
schools teach programming in the final
three years of school and the number i
ever has been dropping and I just asked
on one of the computer one of our
mailing list this just before the talk
today and I found out that they are out
of about six and a half thousand schools
that go through to find her finally of
school only about 400 actually teach
programming at all and even within this
even a thing the top schools I mean the
number has been dropping quite
drastically I remember when I was in
school we had about 30 people or 36
people in our first and that drop down
to about 25 enough at the end of at the
end of the final year that that's that
same school now only starts out with 10
people sat in a class so and that's out
of 150 kids so there's definitely a loss
of interest in South Africa DS and we're
not entirely sure but we're not entirely
sure why but and other big problem of
that I teen South Africa is that most of
the IT teachers don't come from a
burning back
my itt show was originally a german
teacher he picked up programming while
basic teams arts do you want to teach
programming and he had no idea what it
was he tortured and within a few weeks
he was t he was teaching it and this is
a common problem everywhere it's
electrica and but the one thing is
tertiary education is quite good so I
mean I I've got to I basically started
to start at southern programming 3
through school and I got into tertiary
education and said you computer science
and it was actually pretty decent
compared to what it's like at schools
but the problem is that many students
register for computer science having
absolutely no verte the programming
background whatsoever there even there's
even a small percentage of foreign about
half of a one-half percent to one
percent that haven't even touched a
computer before coming to tailor to
university and they decide to study I
mean getting into getting into this up
into the software industry of into that
Africa is thriving there's an Amazon
office into that in Cape Town South
Africa many people that many people
outside of South Africa aren't aware of
this but they they develop they
developed and still maintain eat there
ec2 cloud computing software and the
remember other healthy stock startups
which have been going on for about two
years or so so that's not a problem at
all so there's a there's a strong need
the programmers even within South Africa
okay a little bit on background of where
our group in particular comes from okay
I'm sorry this we want to we want to
come and come in here and help out of
this problem and what we're doing we are
trying to show show kids what for you is
what we don't want we're not teaching
them we're not spending 35 23 25 years
teaching them everything we can possibly
think I can possibly know about poppy
design that's what I mean that's all I
got our goal is to introduce them get
get it inspire them motivate them to
either teach themselves because it's
quite possible to do that order to do
that nowadays before you me or to also
go back to school when they get when
they get into the greater they can learn
programming they started out or when
they get to university to have a good
idea do they want to actually take this
on as I said give them
good first impression and one inspire
them very important point so of course
we get the kids at universe Eddie at our
University for a single weekend that's
18 hour course plus six optional hours
where we just go to where we go through
with the wicked kids and help them and
help them get back catch back up and
pretty much everyone that comes to our
course has absolutely no programming
background whatsoever there are few the
RF you know don't tell us about this but
they do they have taught something to
talk some about themselves but for all
intensive purposes you can consider this
as no programming no protein background
we cover all sorts of Ages we got we've
had we had someone who's and then eight
years old at this previous courses past
weekend we go all the way up to eight
years old and also we cover all
backgrounds they had about 50 out of we
talked about 100 kids as far as we can
out of that group there were about fifty
five schools so that's an average about
two kids for school and many of them are
disadvantaged make this some of that for
some of them ahah are very well for very
well off it's very very mixed okay the
course the course is very hands-on yeah
we provide one computer per kid which is
which is quite challenging with the side
of the scale that we're dealing with but
the siddhis gets them to to get to get
an experience while while while we
teaching them they get they get to
actually try the stuff out during the
lecture so while we're giving the
lecture they're actually sitting at the
computer trying these things out we also
we also have for a very high number of
tutors so we have this past course I
think we got down to about six and a
half kids put a tutor and I think that's
one of the one of the biggest thing
biggest benefits of what we do of why
our course is so successful okay as I
mentioned before we chose Python number
of reasons easy to teach use an industry
okay not to a great deal but I mean
Google uses it for example it's an it
put a big glass open source which will
get onto lake that we're very open
source heavy some feedback on our own
use
python from the previous course place it
is much easier to use than j grasp they
meant java print hello world so much
simpler programming Java I don't really
like programming python I love is much
easier you don't have to put in
semicolons and curly braces on can't
remember all those nonsense if by some
things are straightforward so I mean
these are coming straight out the kids
we had we had no idea no sense of what
is this Python we learning java at
school by the way this is this is the
one of the rare couple of cases which
have learned some programming
programming themselves so it definitely
definitely comes up we definitely are
getting good very positive feedback from
using Python we find it we find it much
more you much better than teaching java
or Delphie which is which would you now
I'm just walking south africa but I mean
that's available another question that
might come up is why don't we use lamo
why don't we use Toyland whadja such a
scratch we're a bit skeptical of that we
believe that's more for younger age
group I mean that's a whole discussion
on its own I'm not going to get into get
heavy into that okay let's hope the
scope of our course we start off with an
optional maths class or going to demo
remember that remember I said we had
some people some kids going down as
early as like eight nine years old many
the majority are around about 11 12
years old this I'm all the kids many of
them do not understand what haven't had
no education in helping what algebra is
so when we teach in programming and we
try to kind of teach them concept of a
variable they're lost you have to first
teach them what a variable it's much
easier teaching what a variable is Matt
in masses and so that they all at the
SEC they're all in a much a bit more of
an evil the evil level playing field
before you actually start the main part
of the course so as I said this is
optional and for those kids are don't
wonder tenders they can come to and a
broader demo which basically covers a
bit of our open open source nature as
well talk about however by the way I'm I
said our course itself is run on windows
sorry
week we cover lots of programming in I
mean it might sound scary but we are
able to cover variables conditionals
loose less stress function writing all
that in a box as I mentioned 18 hours
and six hours up six option allows
that's a single weekend probably about
probably equivalent to two years at two
years at school Mickey hmm in a weekend
yes some kids struggle but the point is
that we do but the point is that recover
we we're really showing them the true
essence of what programming is about
okay we not getting into object
orientation we're not getting to bits
off their high complicated software that
we're not teaching them out and write
games but we're giving them a real feel
of welcome of what programming is about
we also have some interesting talks of a
large canvases that some of these have
received some exceptional feedback ok
there's offer this the typical studying
computer science at university software
available industry well one of the big
favorites of the rant know that we
actually took some feedback from one of
our recent horses we gave this weekend
is the game development using pi game it
was a little bit over the head I've
heard I heard I wasn't actually there
but apparent but we got we got to rate a
feedback rating of sixty-four percent of
those are forming the forum gave us an
exceptional given an exceptional rating
which is the highest we had and then
networking with Python we've also tried
and also introduced V Python as well for
those a year of don't merit visual
Python it's some more visual stuff yeah
who exactly are we we're mostly computer
science students at the University of
Cape Town we're getting a few years of
fuse from sandwich University which is
about an hour away from Cape Town and
and we're growing in size a minute there
they're an international university but
not but not nearly as big as University
of Cape Town we have 44 members on a
volunteer mailing list pretty much all
of them evolved I've help tutor request
at one at one stage in the last six
months so we've got we've got a lot of a
lot of involvement the one problem we're
all computer scientists we haven't we
have no media relations experts we have
no we have no we have no people
uno de motherhood studied marketing who
deal with all to deal with all gonna
deal with organizing or organizing with
hundreds and hundreds of kids yeah
remember that your computer scientists
we've all put this up at as we as we go
along so we do everything we could
rewrite the course notes we designed the
t-shirts we organize transport
accommodation catering we have we have
we handle bright yes we had one of them
we had one of them at one of the recent
courses that apparently install the book
try to install ubuntu on one of the
computers even though it was security
lockdown he managed to dirt then we
ended up taking off the computer and he
was writing writing code on paper but
then of course yes and obviously we also
teach okay some one question i said we
have 40 we're 44 people on our mate on
ax men why so many I think that explains
it number of kids that we've had two
recent courses that's around about 100
kids per shot but the cause the course
of the course of the top was University
of Cape Town about a month ago close to
the bottom of stellenbosch university
just this past weekend okay as you can
see by the way just on a point out we
have it we have a bit of a higher than
usual rate of females we are at low on
our discipline are disadvantaged kids
unfortunately i'll guarantee that Layton
we want to we want to improve that
situation but yeah one big thing we plan
to go if you dig 100 as big we plan to
draw a lot bigger so there's some more
feet some more feedback from the course
um question asked it does your perp and
we ask does your does your understanding
a program in the Phenom after the course
yes it has changed quite a bit and I
would like to explore further and get
into more detail on the taluk I came to
the course to find out how program in
years and I and my desire to head to do
has definitely changed answer and in the
same and in the scent in the sense that
I'll be Kyle continue doing it as a
hobby and may even study it it differs a
bit the course make programming seem as
if it's a giant me great
yes so he gets a bit feedback you get
some negative feedback then it's in some
ways it's good that they say it's good
that they find this out before getting
into what we're getting too seriously
program and maybe left it will still get
into programming if you you
know if you get them a lot between you
delayed oh we don't know some more
feedback in our latest course forty-six
percent said the lectures were excellent
for sixty-six percent so that users said
the same that users very very few said
negative things about them to get to get
on to expand shipper the first part the
first part of how we got to got on to
the point of expanding this project
google recently promise order us a
computer science high school ground of
thirty thousand dollars not that
something something even might sound
like a lot to some of you than might
sound like such a little but the thing
is do you want to go to a thousand kids
that's an average of the off 30 bubble
as a kid and considering considering
that other that there are a lot there
are a lot of foundations through this
the fundamental cost initial outset two
power-play costs like with beginning i
highly arrange it we have to rent a lot
of equipment for this course we have to
rewrite the course modes we have to come
up with delight narrative little to
other stuff that or why are basically
wants off expenses or at least long long
long term make the long term one thought
I mean equipment doesn't last forever
after all so listen a is an evening has
to go in two ways first of all we're
getting more kids per course we're
aiming for 250 kids at each course we
want to take a money around South Africa
week currently we've only been to Cape
Town and settle wash and we have tried
going to Johannesburg but we don't
actually journalist blink by the way is
to other two hour flight away just to
put into perspective we didn't actually
travel to set up to Johannesburg we ran
a week we ran a will run as a value of a
people live video stream to Johannesburg
and they watch her directly there and
die cows in the audience in Zurich he
was one of the people and people in
charge of running like
and if you want to sleep them off to as
you can hear but there were some serious
problems with that didn't really work
out so well and they hand it up the
amulet giving their own lectures on the
spot well he gives that course material
but basically the streaming failed a
problem so that the problem is that
forget bad word okay so we're going to
fort the two so we going to four
different SAT there for different cities
around the country where else we're also
doing more things we were we we want to
keep we want to teach the teacher
teacher dinh tomb on South Africa how to
run remember your cause so right now
what we've been doing we've been trying
to was out with some of us this past
weekend I wasn't well first of all I
wasn't there yet I've been here all the
time so I didn't run the course but the
most the people running the course were
from santosh universe in themselves I
mean the left the lecturers from the
word from Cape Town but most of the
tutors but main organizers any
everything else was from Santa Bosch and
they did all the selection order to the
stuff we want to we want to basically
keep go around one of the main incentive
is that in the medium term may be only
the long term we don't know how long it
will take but we want we want to inspire
them to be able to run their own course
with a little simpler with less and less
support from us so we don't have to fly
as many people up as we are currently
planning to do we want to also write new
course notes and exercises so far we've
means so far we what we did is we swiped
course notes from another cost of open
source of cosmic deal and and we can
reuse them unfortunately it's targeted
at a university level not its high
school kids and the emphasis is not on
computer in emphasis on of the roads is
not a computer lab invite iching
environment so we want to write the note
the right to note such that are more
targeted towards what we need some of
the exercises wait the way too high
level for these kids that cannot
possibly fit possibly just get to them
in a weekend so we need to write new
simpler ones we also want to reach out
to disadvantaged schools very important
point that I me power on meeting some
people are soon as i get backs left for
the next month to trying to try and work
out a plan to advertise
more to this abundance find out why
there why not enough of them are playing
but often em transfer transport grants
are swinging out that give them give
them some incentive to to get the num we
get the number up I mean so that figures
got a population of more than ninety
percent ninety percent non-white yet
we've probably only getting a
back-to-back twenty twenty-five percent
non-white at our course we need to
change this the other thing is we want
to develop a long-term post course plan
currently we're doing a weekend they go
home and if they want to carry them
further they were there on their own
we've we've dropped we've tried we've
tried a system link where they came in
we let them come in every week for an
hour course at the universities they
were interested we had about we had
about it as thirty percent two people
thirty percent of the kids coming to
that but the thing is every time we
finished a new course we got a new
supply of kids coming in all of a sudden
the took the two groups couldn't mix
together because there were different
levels and even within even for even
within the same group from the same
course the same weekend course you get
different you get you get them some of
the kids running ahead some of the kids
lagging behind so we so we want to we
want to try and work on a method that
actually is a formal is far more
scalable first of all and far more
long-term long-term than just rely
entirely rely on the nuts how do we run
a course for 250 kids if it might sound
easy but there are a lot of problems
with it so as I said Miss right we're
striving to teach 250 kids and stranded
50 computers 31 tutors over there
how do we find somebody gets first of
all well to give you an idea I think
that they are as I mentioned earlier I'm
there abouts there about eight thousand
nine schools in South Africa but in cape
town alone that probably we we we each
time advertise up to about 150 other
screens obviously not all those eight
nine thousand fine Cape Town and and and
I mean think about it hundred 5650
schools if if safe example to earth
thirty percent of those replied that's
50 schools which is parenting the ratio
that they only need very need to send
five and five kids each and if we do a
better marketing strategy we can
hopefully really lift up that thirty
percent get through get through against
other sources and lift up this number
and we believe that we will be able to I
mean to put it to put into a bird to
give you a book to give another context
the this recent course were last week
last month a cheap at universal captain
and we had when we accepted 100 kids we
had about 220 uptick applications
applying now some of them some for some
of them we get a school for example
submitting 30 applications we're not
going to accept all of them incentive is
not to go teach a school we teach in the
region so that's that's why that's why
this is a little bit more problematic
than it might sound yeah yes how do you
eat we send out we send out an email to
the maneuver the two it to the teachers
or principals we send out a little
flyers and posters and after the
supplies mail no and yes and now Matt
this look the best thing in South Africa
and they're a bunch of meaningless
there's remaining this with 500 with
about 500 itt Chism's that Africa and
obviously not all those I'm taped on but
but yeah you get those and they can
advertise up in financial what we
planning on doing because we're going to
get more people and going to get then
we're going to go out to around the
country we're going to go out and there
are there are mass digests that gets
sent out to about 2,000 schools in the
country we going to be going to put it
we gonna put a fly in that there are
there are other made there are the mass
meeting this remember general e the mass
of the the mass choir and staff to what
we doing there there were much way to
reach I mean they've been going on since
like the 1980s or something like but
serious bro a serious training program
so they're much further ahead in terms
of that and we're just eating off them
and I mean math teachers know kids who
are might be interested in brownie I
mean it makes sense doesn't I'm not
suggesting then that simple that we
require mast to be good at maths to
defer to me but the math teachers under
contract okay how do you find a big
enough computer lab we don't you scream
video to moulton multiple apps this adds
a rip a very big level of complication
but we have a some have a couple of very
very very very good students at that
doing excellent job of this they
basically take take over control this
entirely but of course that costs money
so that's what the Google part comes in
partly yeah obviously we can't get
expensive equipment that cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars but we do with
what we would do before we've got and
and you might you might wonder does
those video streaming drop the degree
that degrade the experience and virtual
Isis at the last course on eighty-six
percent said that like watching the
stream made no difference I think that's
quite impressive I mean watching
recording for little kids the thing is
the thing the reason I think that they
said that is because the fact that
tutors are still got the tutors are
still going around to all the tabs so
the lecture might be presented for one
point and be strained but the tutors are
still present and all that across all
the apps okay so long laughs and course
plan what happens when the kids are
leave well I briefly touched on it
before not much at the moment we want to
change that what do you want to do is we
want I'm think of doing that but I'm
meeting people again when i get back to
South Africa
about this we want to try and create a
minute to create some sort of resource
pack if you want to call it or like
assistance got assistance force before
kit for kids that come to this course
and the teachers to help set up a
computer club Computer Society at their
school many of these many such societies
already exist right we'll just assist
them as well make it better make us from
there the problem is some kids are going
to go back and not care enough not care
enough and not be able to put in enough
effort to just set it up so that's why
we need to work very closely with the
teachers and so I'm meeting a number of
teachers next next month but the problem
is if we just give them given resources
and teach it as a moni programming and
day and all the kids at the society you
don't know don't don't understand a
certain topic but school you've lost
they get it they're gonna lose interest
very quickly so what we want to do is we
want to have periodic sessions where
they can either either they come to the
University or week up or we go to the
universe there we go to their schools we
haven't decided which it which works out
better remember going to schools is
obviously of my class but then coming to
then coming to us a lot of a lot of kids
if for example of disadvantaged areas
they can't do this it's something about
maybe we'll do something with the
teachers and get rather trying to teach
teachers we haven't worked this arc it
restore work okay and the one big thing
is Rascal that we're lookin tinuous Lee
learning we have never taught hard to
teach before we've never we've never
organized like such large events before
none of us we're all computer science
students and this is a big learning
experience for us and we're continuously
taking feedback I mean we've been
running this project for about 15 months
now and it's all of the fundamentals
have stayed the same a lot of a lot of
work a lot of how we do certain things
have changed drastically and with what
the funding we're going to be
interchanging war we started with ten
volunteers in 2009 now we have 20 22 23
cause i want to send 22 just because I
mean that's number of people actually
helping out
we can not then they're not going to be
20 people at each point in time the
roughly more about 450 no sir who you
three of them like three of them a
little Aboriginal otherwise they are
dead at the end trust me i mentioned
earlier we started poaching approaching
notes we saw the right coaching those
the pre-course nerds now we're right in
their own and with the very first course
last year we started one lab at the
University of Cape Town now we're
streaming and going around South Africa
so again leave your problem for bigger
problems more stuff to pick up and the
earth future plans so in 2011 with
groovey with Google support ammonia will
be growing bigger and Traveller
traveling around South Africa as I've
already mentioned in 2012 we want to
reach reach more isolated regions in
South Africa so current it for next year
durban's johannesburg k plants and wash
their all their form of the biggest
region before the biggest citizens
leftovers some are not so much but they
close by so easy to reach but there for
the biggest things what what about what
about out in the middle of nowhere in
which a group which is maybe maybe
gotten maybe got a university there like
that like a typical can you put it into
perspective from from as you guys will
mostly come from Europe but but then
tomorrow here we very we're very visible
but there's large farming area Afari
regions there's large mountainous
regions which which are no people in so
if example you'll get a regional I can
believe for example that that has the
closest possible the closest region the
closest city that's of a reasonable size
is probably about a half an hour to 45
minutes flight away ok so you're not
you're not going to be able to you're
not going to be able to get them those
kids to come out with your hands both
example or that we're going to have to
go to them and there's not as much
infrastructure there and there's
certainly not properly is certainly
knows me an evil local local volunteers
that would be able to help us out to the
level that we
to let us discover that we need to learn
this was so it's going to be a number of
challenges but we're going to try it
again that's the costs more money
unfortunately beyond that our big dream
is expanding beyond the borders is that
I forget we want to help Africa I've
already been speaking to some people
yeah we there's goodness that could
count with good discussion of people in
Nigeria and Ghana can you might be a
possible what possible region to go to
Senegal hello there are a lot of places
a lot of places that have quickly quite
decent infrastructure but the thing is
they're far away so we're going to act
so we're gonna have to work on the
strategy each other to help how we can
assist them oh how we can take few again
fear of us take them to the local take
them to the local kind of the local
region to that country and basically we
be the support infrastructure rather
than us running the running the whole
entire thing because I mean if we to run
to run this course as I set as you've
seen already requires it requires a lot
of man a lot of manpower one skilled
manpower and we can't possibly fire up
all those 20 people to 20 g romana it's
going to cost way too much well the less
Google a very generous but I don't get
their actions exactly um question if
you're interested how can you help we're
very open community we're constantly
looking for more hands we might have 44
people but you know with the problems we
facing yeah there's a lot there's a lot
of work still to be done children and
the course of finding local tutors
obviously if you're not into that frog a
very difficult but I know they're two
people here that are better off it to
fly down to South Africa too so he
subjugated is help out and observe and
maybe running in our country making some
aspects most most capable as I said
removing from 100 to 250 kids a number
of problems how did what happened
what happens if all of a sudden we get
we start marketing this heaven n me at a
thousand applications working through a
thousand applications to find 250 kids
to take what easy trust me when we
didn't it with turn return a lot
applications we have to select a hammer
it's difficult enough how do you do go
when you were turning 50 kids come in
and you and you give them you can just
just Nick main tasks it sounds simple
enough but they're they're the little
problems that's not that that meeting me
mad a bit more scalable how do you how
do you deal with all the queries that
got the query said comment I mean we're
all volunteering our time this isn't a
spare time we don't necessarily have
time to answer inquiries a day if we're
going to get that so we need to get we
need to get we need to consider in the
future maybe hiring a sec your sign out
that I'm serious this is sort of things
and also the other thing is if we're get
the food and run this earth that we're
going to run this and other and other
regions and expect I think other people
look at those local people to run the
course in the future we need to we need
to somehow right come up with a full
package of comeback package the package
of the course act into a kids of course
here's how you run it all the oil all
instructional hakuna but make it simple
enough so that so that you know they can
run in with our load without support
coming leonis it to a small extent but
afterwards being able to run over being
able to run alone there's writing a new
application review system as i said i'm
reviewing these applications is takes up
so much time we want to make we want to
make this easier there's a lot but
there's a lot of ideas we have there we
were going to be helped by writing a new
horse notes and exercises that's easy to
help remotely if you want to if you want
to get involved just let me know turning
the course notes into a complete package
to enforce intercompany package i'm
entering that developing a solution for
this and watch screens i mentioned that
earlier on some it's it's a very
difficult problem and especially those
especially those of you but don't use
from
quicker kill you have a new guys have a
better idea of how to deal with this
problem I mean we try our best but those
people that come from those that come
from those backgrounds you know you have
a much better idea as how hard kids are
going to take take just for example if
we're going to for example if we're not
offer them a transport serpent are
legally don't sound like you don't want
this money you know we don't want to get
we don't want to take from from rich
kids or whatever I don't know you know
then there's other aspect of catering
them on your cost to to new environments
we take this to garner what happens it
what happens if they don't have enough
computers what happens if what happens
are the kids go go there's I don't know
what the situation was gonna hear that
much what happens is they go home and
they don't have access to computers you
know are we going to have to find out a
solution to get them computers what
happens is that what happens if we go to
a country which doesn't happen which
share as electricity electricity
problems and you have to let me run it
Vienna run a weekend course there with a
with a good chance of it I'll your
chances of power being off for half the
time what do you do we're going to
tailor it also the other thing is we we
cover a lot and we expect we expect a
decent education coming you coming into
the course do we probably need to dumb
it down if we're going to go to Africa I
don't mean to I don't mean to offend
anyone but I mean this ending is if the
education if the education that that
their game coming into the course is not
good enough we have we have to fill in
for those things protect our attack down
on how much we cover and spend more time
we but in a more timely basis you know
is that sort of thing that we need local
HUD we need local assistance with okay
well and I think this a little bit more
time so I'll cover foolish ones I
mentioned early on that we promote
promote open source software notes
everything we use okay except for
windows of cough hate that unfortunately
by the way the reason we use what does
that mean is quite sensible if we can if
we going to teach programming and we're
going to teach it lie next to them and a
weekend that's a lot second of all
getting access to the linux lab is a lot
more difficult
window slams but other than that all our
course notes of enemy open source one
hundred percent Eastern with proper was
as mobilizing all our exercises same
thing we will use our software for this
video streaming if you've heard of
devious give you switch we use that it's
a guy that's what the Devon guys used we
teach Python well I'll show you it and
obviously as I said me given a bunch of
demonstration in every course we handled
a bunch of CDs we're very we're very
proud it's awesome if there's another
way we can be more more more MORE
advocates of open source software and
that sort of stuff where I put ideas we
take we take loan and tutor few dragons
very seriously I mean to give you an
idea I mean I mentioned earlier on that
we gave a we gave a game's development
talk of a lunch that was purely from
feedback from a course through weeks
three weeks earlier they were about half
we asked what was what what do you want
to covered in the course half the people
mentioned something around something
around game development gooey stuff
anything visual so we gave this we asked
the same we asked the same question
again this at this course there were out
of out of 70 people that fold an
application I think we had one request
for Greece okay yes and having volunteer
tutors he changes things a few
interesting ways first of all you have
you're not going to have you're not
going to have you generally want these
small experience even have the more
competent people confident people
applying tapa they're the ones that have
a little bit of time they the ones that
are actually that they're there they're
inspired themselves already so they're
going to inspire the kids if you're not
inspire if your people it generally
tutors at least in our university if
you've been if you've been paid to tutor
as an official the course tutor
generally those those you know those
tutors are less inspiring then some of
them are some of them are more more than
the money orders for the experience in
the CV they they don't have this there's
a very year there's a very step distinct
I mean take the idea to put into
perspective I think out of out of the 40
people that have helped to your turn in
this course I think either then with
tutored for courses University before
they still do an excellent job and we
get some of our best feedback for now I
mean I think about I think about seventy
percent of the kids say that users are
exceptional okay and the other thing is
also in terms of on volunteering here
you it also be kept that you also need
something you need someone you need to
learn to manage them in a way that is
not you you're not you can't expect
things from volunteers you know you have
to kind of go with the flow yeah is that
if they want to do if I'm if volunteers
don't have time to do do do something
you put a very quickly adapt to what you
can what you can reasonably expect from
them and other thing is as even within
with 20 volunteers again brings it over
it he brings its own problems I mean I
you know you're going to get you can
organize that 20 tutors come there and
they are their fee for example the
course last month we had one of our
church is that one of our tutors of a
supposed to get the electorate some of
the stuff had a prop had a pot of
personal problem he came to come through
we haven't we had to put a foot
relationship plan but we managed yeah
i'm at a big question why do we do this
i think most of you here probably
probably I've got a good idea why we
would do this sort of thing I mean
otherwise you wouldn't be here to find
to find out what we do what we're doing
I I don't do I need to answer that
question do I need to didn't think so
and I already covered how to me envision
expect an expansion into Africa but what
but one thing i want to touch on the
touch on that in a bit more detail is is
if we're gonna if we're going to go to
Africa okay
we need to know first we need to have
locals but that marketing and marketing
the constants of Africa we know we have
we have a car we have a contract we I I
used to run IE used to be quite involved
in the computer in the South Africa of
you together we have contacts also with
the school dresses we interact with our
mass with the colon maths maths programs
we we have no problem getting school
context we know how to get into the
newspaper to advertise we not against
the radio well now we know we know what
the what the teachers the local the
local teachers what they might what they
might explain I'd react to us sending
this sort of thing up we know this is
now a mile actually arise that this
arrived of the schools what happens in
Africa what offends in what happens if
we if we expect us to work and we send
our poet to send out a post from so that
focused in Nigeria for example and
someone skills folks you're still as
opposed I don't know some of the things
listen this is simple things this
fundamental we need local supportive and
I'm finding a finding a computer loud
sound the samplers sounds like a sample
for them finding University what happens
at the university doesn't want to offer
optica bleeder you know we have to pay
for it do we have to do we have to cut
do we have to pay for computer lab usage
and you have to rent computers that
becomes a very expensive and it's in
computers for a weekend little further
for even just tiny kid starts getting
Frankie expensive and it's things like
that any questions yeah you're
mentioning that you wanted to be able to
scale the project to other countries and
to other parts and South Asia and you
also said that you mean focus or you
mean I said is the volunteers does it
that's contradicting um okay in South
Africa so what we're doing for next year
is
with what the Google funding we're
taking we have at least discretion as
the numbers is we're taking 12 we're
flying 12 volunteers from our from Cape
Town to each other sites okay and who
are accommodating them it and them and
everything those talk to you tues will
be full time to UTA's all week and they
won't take a break okay I said we need
about 30 that means we need 80 local
volunteers it's this is for 250 kids at
least if we're going to hit 30 volunteer
18-volt developer volunteers humanely I
mean we very easily got 10 in the first
course I kept down in cape town without
much without much effort we believe we
believe at least we hope and I mean it
all depends how it turns out we have to
be flexible yeah as I said we hope we're
hoping that we'll be able to get enough
levels but it does appear that we will
be able to get enough people at decent
johannesburg end in derby from what from
our initial initial research and and we
were kind we pretty much secure the
secured labs and everything and
everything from for the site and its
size that we need and we've got we've
also got the support from Quetta font
support from the head of the bottom of
both in a bit of both computer science
the farmers it easy at each respective
university there other there are other
are they in technical institute integers
nearby in this in the same cities that
are also helping us out there there's
there's the local local of bunch of
communities and all our money
communities that are helping myself i'm
pretty sure that we won't have a too
much of a problem anja there the problem
becomes when we want to go to the more
remote areas like as i said kimberly
which is an hour away from behind the
scope a smaller community that doesn't
have that many cousin that doesn't
really have a focus on computer science
if that's going to be difficult and we
may end up having to fly most the verify
even more people are you might have to
fly 12 people up to on a smaller course
we don't know we haven't we haven't in
this it hold it's more of a we would
like to do this we will worry about once
we've once you've seen once we once
we've got once we've seen what it's like
going into these other you basically
want to take stakes that take well
take steps at the time we don't we don't
want to think ahead to completely solve
in Africa before we've even gone outside
of cape town but if you said it what do
you think you should focus if you want
to scale it you should at least start
considering on volunteers for longer
uses penguin inches that is eight people
the haiti booked full time part time at
the moment at the moment we've got a
very negative attitude towards paying
people we rather triumph you rather give
up any company we take we take much we
feed them very well he isn't give them
my swag t-shirts and that sort of stuff
we've been giving your last course we
gave up flashes it's more small
contribution but the thing is at the
moment it's enough and if you start
mixing volunteers with people that are
paid you start introducing problems or
look up all the existing volunteers
going to aid decipher decide decide that
they in order someday want to get paid
now are the existing volunteers going to
say we out set this up while we getting
paid why do we only pay for what we did
to get this up and running then then
other thing that comes if you go to if
you're going to suddenly pay people you
all over something going to get you can
you know get people's hand i'm going to
come into i want to come into you i want
to come into you too but you're all of a
sudden full did I'm enough space but why
are you taking that post I'm not me you
know we don't want to we want to try to
fight those problems if possible I mean
obviously if it comes to the stage where
we have to start to consider in doing
this we will make a plan but right now
on Chloe I could get and pulling it in
that situation where we need to to do
that and pull me desperate where you
going to try and apply that you'll also
remember flying up on a flying up a
volunteer from Cape dungeon and general
info across the runabout hundred dollars
accommodation for a week and is probably
in a cost less than less than that so
say for example at nine fifty dollars
pay a painting of on a chair for a
weekend if you're thinking about a
thought this is a full 18 18 our weekend
18 18 hours out of the 50 that's less
than ten dollars now what would you
rather do okay so
pay someone to fly up that's going to
let's get the veggie note that you know
is going to do a good job okay the same
picked up or pay some local person that
you have no idea what he's like to do
this which would you prefer and it's a
pretty much approach to the same amount
as I said ten dollars and hours roughly
watching a nice or diffused up paint and
if you start paying professionals you
didn't have to pay even more you see
what I mean it becomes we thought about
this and we'll definitely a lot of
people have raised this question I mean
when we go to Africa as I said there we
put the day we might have to consider
doing it because then flying up a person
from Cape done to for example I someone
from Cape Town to to garner costs about
a thousand dollars and it's going to
watch him for getting a painter person
loved it then in thousand dollars
anything else footjob project Isaac risk
it was left it's a good question we
haven't contacted them but we have front
of the other other company stock is to
see if they could sponsor that this
one's a laptops this one's a netbooks in
particular because we feel that's much
much more appropriate I mean cost level
that sort of thing generally the
response we get is we're only open to
we're only allowed just want to donate
to NGOs when not an NGO will not
registered an NGO yet NGO non-government
organization the problem with that is it
just it just adds another level of
complication and right now we've got a
lot of other things to worry about and
we drug we'd rather focus on we'd rather
focus on developing the course first and
then worry then once you've got
everything once we once we've got all of
the current problems on it up then worry
about that you'll always be taken
otherwise we're taking a look too way
too many things and without solving what
we come
you know name but that's a good point
and by the way yeah another thing going
for nothing that i forgot to mention it
back to the idea about now oh sorry oh
yeah on the whole idea of laptop as a
person in ghana the one person one local
person there whose work nor my team has
possibly going to be able to secure
laptops for some of the kids I mean
that's obviously depend on how things
turn out if we even go to Ghana
obviously but they will I mean they rock
enabled off everyone but I think he
mentioned something about five or six
laptop which i think is a decent number
to give up you know to kind of it
emotive small I mean that's getting much
bigger prizes but it's not that
motivation there that the tile I as long
as it's not I don't know whether I don't
know if that's going to be too big too
big a motivation is going to increase
competition negative and negative
negative units things on a whole but
small prizes do work to stimulate them
just under view anything else yeah okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
