think it needs a long introduction edify
is here again is becoming a regular
visitor he had Google and specifically
in Santa Monica helping us with our work
I'm applying his adiabatic algorithm to
problems in machine learning but Eddy
will talk today about a new passion of
his which is quantum money I'm looking
forward to this okay thank you can
everybody hear me we're okay remotely
okay thank you so I'm going to be
talking about quantum money and this is
a project that I've worked on with my
students David Gossett and Andrew Luda
Mirsky and postdoc avi Newton has sedum
and Peter shor who is a not a student
he's a very well-known guy in the world
of quantum information and let's see if
we begin I guess I don't know how to
admit I guess I have to go here to
advance okay so I this talk is about
quantum money and therefore I'm going to
just have to help you a little bit with
the some very basic notions in quantum
mechanics so we're all on the same page
I assume that people know like what a
vector is and know a little bit about
linear algebra maybe I don't know that
much about quantum mechanics so I'm
gonna start by reviewing just a few
points in quantum mechanics and for
those of you who know it it'll be very
boring and few those of you don't
hopefully you'll learn a couple of
things so also there's an issue of
notation which I wish to establish in
quantum mechanics quantum states of
vectors in a d dimensional vector space
the quantum state is something that
describes the quantum system and that is
used and that self is is ad dimensional
vector in it happens that in quantum
mechanics these are vector spaces over
the complex numbers so you can add
vectors with complex coefficients
an important thing about the note 8 so
we have a vector space age and vectors
are written in this notation which are
called cats that little thing there
that's half of a bracket it's pulled the
cat and the thing inside the cat is the
name of the vector so you can write
anything in there that describes the
vector so that's the vector SCI you
could write dog you could write my
favorite vector whatever you want inside
the cat it's not an argument of a
function it's the name of the vector
okay
and so SCI is an element to the hilbert
space which and that's what we mean by
vectors and a very simple example is if
I had D equals to two dimensional vector
space I could have two basis vectors for
the space which I call up and down those
are just two different vectors are
orthogonal and then sigh a general
vector could be a linear combination of
the two basis vectors where alpha and
beta are complex numbers and if and if
if these up and down have norm one and
they're orthogonal then if alpha squared
plus beta squared equals 1 then sy would
be a normalized vector so just this is
old-fashioned linear algebra over the
complex numbers but you just have to be
sure that the cat you remember is a
vector
ok now just a couple more words about
quantum mechanical notation stuff before
we get into it Sekou
now the quantum mechanics is the
description of nature at its most
fundamental level you know you should
remember that Kwan there has never been
a violation of quantum mechanics ever
seen quantum mechanics describes the
theory of elementary particles the
strong the weak the electromagnetic
force I'll describe quantum mechanically
everything that's going to happen at the
LHC is going to be presumably described
by quantum mechanics well I should say
everything if ever bins have seen at any
existing accelerator has been described
by quantum mechanics all of chemistry is
described by quantum mechanics the
entire periodic
Abell the properties of materials like
superconductors are described by quantum
mechanics so for the sake of this talk
we are going to assume that quantum
mechanics is true and it is the
fundamental theory that base which
describes the world around us it is the
god-given theory and we're not going to
get into a discussion about whether
quantum mechanics you don't like it
because of whatever problem you might
have with the other Einstein didn't like
it we're not going to go there we're
just going to accept finer mechanics as
true okay and now what are the basic
principles of quantum mechanics that we
need to know well there were not too
many basic principles the first is that
states quantum systems are described by
states in the hilbert space and
hopefully I have helped you a little bit
with that notation on my previous slide
the other thing that's important in
quantum mechanics is that states evolve
in time and the evolution of states is
determined by that equation I've written
there which is called the Schrodinger
equation and what it tells you is that
if you know at the time derivative of
the state first of all I is the square
root of minus 1 we're dealing with
complex numbers here so the square root
of minus 1 times the time derivative of
the state is a particular operator or
matrix called the Hamiltonian times the
state so this is the evolution equation
it's a it's a first order differential
equation that tells you that if you know
the state at one time you can integrate
that differential equation and know the
state at later times in that sense
quantum mechanics is deterministic if
you know the state of a quantum system
at an early time it evolves
deterministically according to the
Schrodinger equation what's different
this is like F equals MA whether you say
the acceleration you could write it as
acceleration is force over mass so it
tells you the time derivative is
something and in different problems you
have different Hamiltonians
so if you're describing the theory of
the weak interactions you have a
relativistic Hamiltonian if you describe
the hydrogen atom you have a different
Hamiltonian but that's specific to the
situation and part of the job in physics
obviously is to discover which
Hamiltonians govern the evolution of
systems but the basic picture that that
time evolution is how things occur is
what we call the Schrodinger equation
and there's never been a violation of
that equation
ever seen okay that is consistent with
every observation that systems evolve
according to the Schrodinger equation
any questions please it's a small group
so if you have any questions go ahead
and ask me
okay we're comfy with this so far okay
yes it could be it could be a
time-dependent Hamiltonian we just like
just in general it could be it might be
time independent but you could have it
the Hamiltonian determines the dynamics
and it could be changing right for
example suppose you know you have two
nuclei and they're bouncing back and
forth like this and you want to describe
an electron going around well that
electron sees a time-dependent
Hamiltonian can you repeat questions for
the VC please oh the question is was
curious about why the Hamiltonian could
be time-dependent it's like in Newtonian
mechanics you could have a
time-dependent force
the question is are there limits on what
type of hamiltonians you can have well
that really depends on the physical
situation you know whether the
hamiltonian if it's from the point of
view of this I'm going to say no but yes
I mean that's a question about nature
you know if you say are there limits on
the form of the Hamiltonian that's a
question about what does Mother Nature
choose and why you know we only see
Hamiltonian is consistent with the
theory of relativity you know we you
know why the Hamiltonians that we have
that's a question of what are the actual
specific laws of nature this is sort of
the framework yeah
he the question is for Hummel for let's
say quantum electrodynamics yes there's
a Hamiltonian yes I mean if you have a
relativistic quantum field theory there
is a Hamiltonian it's not simple and you
can't very hard to find its ground state
but yes there is a Hamiltonian in
relativistic quantum electrodynamics in
quantum electrodynamics okay now the
other thing is that when you when you
want to determine a property of a system
what you do is you measure things and
everything you measure corresponds to
something called a hermitian operator
hermitian just means that well just a
special little property means its
eigenvalues are real and one of the
features of quantum mechanics is that
when you measure a system you measure
what you can only ever get is an
eigenvalue of the associated operator
that's all that ever comes out of a
measurement if you measure energy of a
system you only get an eigenvalue that's
when we learn remember that energy is
quantized because if you look at the
Hamiltonian describes the hydrogen atom
the levels are quantized and that means
that not only the energy is allowed
there are certain eigenvalues and those
are the only things you ever get when
you make a measurement and that's that's
also very basic to quantum mechanics I
can't really explain why that is I don't
really know why that is that's just the
way it is okay
so let's I want to now like to get a
couple of consequences of this there's
the Schrodinger equation again I wrote
it but what that tells you since it's a
linear equation the time derivative is a
linear thing i its that tells you that
if you integrate that equation up the
state you get at a late time T relative
to the state at time 0 is obtained by a
unit of a unitary operator unitary is a
special type of linear operator but what
it says is that the the if you know the
state at an initial time and you would
like to know the state
at a later time after you have
integrated the Schrodinger equation you
discover that the state at a later time
is simply a matrix or a linear operator
acting on the initial state now so
quantum mechanics is linear well
measurements are not so let's get back
to that we're just talking about the
Schrodinger evolution what does that
mean what does that mean that means that
if you know the state suppose you know
that you have a system which at time 0
is sy 1 and at time T becomes sy 1 of T
or your system at time 0 is side 2 which
evolves to site 2 of T then if your
initial state was a linear superposition
of sy 1 at 0 inside 2 of 0 the outcome
is the linear combination alpha sy 1 of
T plus beta site 2 of T at the later
time that's what linear means okay if I
have two inputs if my if I have an input
and it goes here and I have another
input and it goes there if I take a
linear combination of the inputs I get
the same linear combination of the
outputs okay that's what I mean by
linear and quantum mechanics is linear
alright we with me that's very
fundamental to quantum mechanics you
never been a violation of quantum of
linearity seen now we're going to use
this to prove a theorem ok we're now
going to prove we're going to ask a
following question can I copy
an unknown quantum state can I take a
state which is unknown to me as a
quantum system and make an identical
copy of it without destroying the
original state and the answer to that is
no and I'm going to prove that to you
right now suppose I would like to build
what's called a quantum cloner a quantum
cloner is something that would take an
unknown quantum state and replace that's
and a blank register so I'm writing
black I have an unknown quantum state
and a blank register or blank state I
mean a black like I have two states I
and an another state called B and I want
that to evolve according to quantum law
into size I I want to copy sy into the
space held by B okay so I would like
that's what would be called a quantum
cloner well that's impossible
because it's not a linear transformation
that's like taking X to x squared if I
double sy I make I multiply the output
by four okay that's just not linear if
you do that that's quite you know that's
like a quadratic function so the fact is
is that this is not a linear
transformation
and in fact this means that this is
called the quantum no-cloning theorem
and it says that the quantum operations
do not allow you to take an unknown
quantum state and make a copy of it and
I really just proved this because of the
lack of because that's alit it's not a
linear transformation I've argued that
quantum mechanics is linear okay so this
is called the quantum no-cloning theorem
and this has huge implications for
information security which I'm now going
to address because there's no such thing
classically there's no possibility of me
being able to tell you that if I have a
bit string I can't make a copy of it
that's just there's no such thing that
prevents that classically and quantum
mechanically it is not possible now this
actually means since quantum
mechanically you cannot copy an unknown
state this means quanta this is called
the quantum no-cloning theorem and this
property allows you to send secure
messages by secure I don't mean that
they're encrypted but what I mean is
that if they're you can be guaranteed
that there's no eavesdropping so let me
show you how that works because this is
gonna be the prelude to quantum money I
have not forgotten that my talk is about
quantum money I'm just building you up
to it
okay I haven't forgotten so let's see
how this works let's see how we're going
to use the quantum no-cloning to say to
send your messages so Alice wants to
send Bob a message and we're nervous
that there's an inter that there's EEP
sits between Alice and Bob and she might
read the message write it down and then
send it on to Bob and what we're now
gonna show is that that cannot happen
with the proper quantum protocol okay so
and in fact classically what I mean with
in the absence of quantum case there's
no way based on there's absolutely no
way to guarantee the security of a
message going from here to there there's
nothing I can do the guarantees that
someone can't intercept a classical bit
string write it down and then send it on
but let's see how to do that quantum
mechanically so Rick I need to do one
more little aside on a quantum
measurement which is the following thing
I already told you about this states I
which can be alpha up plus beta down
where alpha squared plus beta squared
that's a general state now we can think
in this little two-dimensional Hilbert
space of up being the vector 1 0 and
down being the vector 0 1 and these are
eigenstates of that little diagonal
operator Sigma Z which is 1 0 0 minus 1
can you all see that if you multiply
Sigma Z times 1 0 you get it back and if
you multiply 0 1 by that you get it back
a minus 1 times the state now but there
are other vectors I can look at which
I'm going to call plus and minus plus is
1 over root 2 1 1 and note it's an
eigenstate of that little off diagonal
operator Sigma X 0 1 1 0 you can just
check that multiply Sigma X times 1 1
and you're going to get back 1 1
multiply Sigma X times 1 minus 1 you get
minus the vector ok now
if you're in the Upstate and you measure
Sigma Z what you're gonna find is you're
gonna get back the number one I remember
I told you early on that when you
measure an operator you only get the
eigenvalue well if you're in this state
which is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 1
and you measure it you're going to get
up 1 and the state up undamaged if you
measure - if you take the state - and
you measure Sigma ax you're gonna get a
minus 1 and the state - undamaged but
now if I'm in the state plus and a
measure Sigma Z plus is not an
eigenstate of Sigma Z plus is 1 over
root 2 up plus 1 over root 2 down and
what quantum law says is that if you
measure Sigma Z on the + state what
you're gonna get is with 50 percent
probability you're going to get a 1 and
return the state up which is the
eigenstate of Sigma Z and with 50
percent probability you're going to get
down and the eigenstate they're going to
get minus 1 and the state down so what
happens here if you make a measurement
is that these measurements destroy the
state because this measurement of Sigma
Z took the state plus but what came out
was - state up or a state down because I
measured something when I make the
measurement I always get an eigenstate
of the operator after the measurement
now let's see how we're going to use
that so now I want to send now I'm going
to show you how Alice can send Bob now
now Alice is gonna send a secure message
to Bob let me show you how Alice does
that Alice sends the state plus - up
plus down down plus okay now Allison
publicly announces X X Z X Z Z X so she
announces that publicly Alice Bob has
the state and Alice announces that
strength publicly well after she
announces that Bob measures Sigma X
Sigma
Sigma Z Sigma X Sigma Z Sigma Z Sigma X
and since these are eigenstates of those
operators outcomes 1 minus 1 1 1 minus 1
minus 1 1 because those are the
eigenvalues of those things those are
all eigenstates of these things and
that's the message ok the message is the
eigenvalues that she measures now why is
this secure because suppose Eve
intercepts the message she intercepts
the message first of all she cannot copy
the state because there's no cloning
theorem she can't make a copy of it so
what might she tempt to do she might say
well I'm gonna try to measure the
different components I'm gonna see what
they are but she bought the announcement
of what the directions are has not yet
been made because it's not announced
until Bob gets the state so she cannot
copy the state she only has it if she
could copy it she'd be very well off but
she can't so she's stuck with it she's
gonna do something to it and then send
it on so but she doesn't know what
direction to measure and so if she so
the first member remember the first
thing she gets to school plus so if she
measures Sigma X the state plus is
undamaged but if she measures Sigma Z
she gets up or down remember that from
the previous page so now and then so
that she has this thing and she sends it
the Bob okay now Bob it Bob gets the sig
the first bit which is now upload down
he's supposed to measure Sigma X so when
he administers Sigma max he gets plus or
minus 1 each with 50% probability so
there's a 50% chance he gets the wrong
answer so what Alice does is after the
she says hey vog certain of those bits
would test bits like the first bit was
really just test bit and you better have
obtained what was it plus one when you
measured it but there's a 50% chance he
got a minus one okay
and is it 25% probability of error then
if you have if I 100 out of my zillion
vets or 100 out of my million bits of
test bets and there's a 50% chance of
there being an error you have only a one
in two to the hundred chance that the
error is undetected so this this means
that the Alice M after Alice sends the
message and announces which of the test
bits Bob can be sure that in fact the
message was not read so that's huge
yes yes I didn't hear it oh yeah 25%
yeah yeah he's right there was only 50%
conditioned on it was conditioned on
something I think he's right it is 25%
mine was 50 conditioned on something yes
it was 25% good is paying attention good
all right so that's right so so so this
makes because and this is one of the big
things in quantum information that we
have a secure communication so now we're
going to use this idea to make quantum
money okay so let's just follow the same
and this was introduced by this guy
named Stephen Wiesner this is one of the
first ideas for making secure using
quantum information he didn't really
even have all these terms but this is
one of the first ideas for using the
ideas of quantum mechanics for security
and so Weasley's idea was a quantum
money state is just going to be a
product plus up/down - - - and if you
have a state like that so now the
quantum money I'm going to give you is a
quantum state I hand
the quantum state now this thing has the
great virtue that it cannot be copied
because of the quantum no-cloning
theorem and measuring it will not allow
you to copy it and obviously when we
talk about money one virtue what do we
want money to have and we talked about
virtues of money but one clear virtual
we would like a bill to have is the
inability for it to be copy if I can
guarantee you that a bill cannot be
copied based on laws of physics well
then I'm really offering you something
which is incredibly secure and in fact
let me just show you an example see this
bill here this is a classical bill and
my nine-year-old son this is a
counterfeit bill that my nine-year-old
son made and it looks very good if I
pass it around you'll see so it's very
easy to counterfeit money this would
this would make it through a soda
machine without any problem and my kid
made it so there is no security against
okay so this shows that you know
counterfeiting is easy anybody wants to
see the bill I'll show it okay so now
what's the problem with this money so
the problem with this money is as a
secure form of money is that if you want
to the mint I give you this money which
is just a bunch of quantum state it's
just quantum a product state it's just a
bunch of spins pointing in different
directions now they're no-cloning
theorem which we've discussed prevents
you from copying the bill that's a good
thing
now the mint that made the money knows
that the first spin is a plus eigenstate
of the Sigma X operator and the second
of the second excuse me spin is an up of
relative to the Sigma Z operator etc so
if you send them money back to the mint
the mint can determine that it's still
an unaltered money State
because the mid can check that that
first step really is an eigenstate of
the Sigma X operator so if the money is
been sent back to the mint the mint
can't verify that it's good money
so there's only that's a picture of the
bill I forgot to show the quantum bill
with all the spin states in it which you
can pass along okay but this bill you
have to send it can't be duplicated but
now you send this bill but the problem
with this money is the following thing
you want the merchant to be able to
verify the money without sending it back
to the men now you could say tell the
merchant you can say well let's let the
merchant know which axes those spins are
pointing along so if the merchant knows
that the first is a plot is the plot
Sigma acts and the next is Sigma Z the
merchant could measure the state and
verify it but as soon as the ID that you
let the merchant do that you've given
the merchant the power to make another
copy because if the merchant knows that
the first spin is a plus eigenstate of
Sigma acts the merchant just can make
into plus eigenstate of Sigma X and the
next spin is what would we say an up
eigenstate of Sigma Z the merchant makes
one of those so the problem here is that
if the merchant knows the quantization
axis in the eigen value of each qubit
then the merchant can verify the money
so we would we would like we would like
so you could make another Bell that's
just what the said so what we see is a
quantum money scheme with a verification
procedure that doesn't not allow the
merchant to make fresh bills okay that's
what we want we want the merchant to be
able to hold the money up to the light
and say this is a good bill the merchant
and still the merchant shouldn't be able
to copy the money because there's no
cloning but the power of verification
should not allow the merchant to make
the new bill and that's the tricky part
in a quantum money scheme that's what
hard to achieve so what would quantum
money consist of quantum money could
each bill has a serial number and an
Associated quantum state that's
associated the serial number and the min
should be able to produce bills that is
to say serial numbers and quantum states
and if a merchant is handed a bill the
merchant should be able to verify have a
verification algorithm that takes the
quantum money outputs good money if it's
good without destroying the state you
want to be able to should be sure that
when you put the money into the verifier
the verifies is good but outputs the
money doesn't eat it which is very
tricky kind of mechanically to not
destroy the state and we also want this
to have the property that if I give you
the serial number and the money it is
hard to make to state science i prime
each of which passes the verification so
we want it to be difficult to make a
copy of even though you have a verifier
if I didn't have the verifier you
couldn't make a copy but then you just
know you have this thing and you don't
know what properties it has so we're
gonna have a little blueprint for
quantum money and then I'm gonna talk
about not very money first up imagine I
have a big set like the integers from 1
to 2 to the thousand just some discrete
set which is very big and I want to have
some function which is easy to compute
and it takes everything in the big set
into some target set and the target set
is also big but not as big as B so for
example if B is thighs 2 to the thousand
maybe the target set is 2 to the 500
still very thick I want you think about
you know 2 to the something is a big
number and and I want this function as
many to 1 for many things mapped each
target value and I want F it'd be easy
to compute so this is going to be the
beginning of my blueprint so what how
what's the the blueprint here the
mint is gonna make an initial state and
the initial quantum state has two parts
the first register contains a uniform
superposition over all things in the big
set quantum mechanically it's very easy
to make that it's very easy to make like
the uniform superposition of a state
which consists of all the integers from
1 to 2 mm you can actually do that and
the next register is a black register
now which I'm going to use in a second
the mint has a quantum computer and the
quantum computers can do anything
classical computers can do so the mint
can compute the value of the function
into the next register so now my
superposition over all values of B come
with an additional label which is the
value of the function so now with the
mint does is it measures the second
register and whatever the mint when it
measures the second register the mint
gets a value I'm going to call that P
and so what the state is after this
measurement is the sum over all values
little all little B such that F of
little B is pay so what this money state
is actually going to consist of is a
superposition over all things
B which have the function value behave
that's what the money states going to be
it's going to be a superposition over
all things B with the value P ok so now
we're going to talk about knot theory I
guess I have to end at four o'clock
right there's Google runs like no I can
go on for another minute if I need okay
I'll try to indur well that's my
screensaver with nothing embarrassing
right why did it do that hold it escape
why is it doing that oh there it goes
sorry oh that's why dashboard okay it's
always nerve-racking when that happens
you've ever done whether you're showing
you the world you know I can try to keep
my computers very clean but sometimes
you never know okay so now we're going
to talk about knots links and grid
diagrams so now we're going to do a
little bit of knot theory okay not too
much so what's an odd a knot is a loop
of string in three dimensions so just
think of having a loop of string in
three dimensions so it's it's a map from
the circle s1 into our array and a link
is a bunch of intertwined knots so I
could have a bunch of knots which are
intertwined and if you have a bunch of
knots which make a link in three
dimensions you can depict it by
projecting it into two dimensions so if
I project this three dimensional object
into two dimensions I get a picture like
that and what's important about this
picture is that there are arcs where you
see the the segments of the thing
projected down and then you have to
distinguish whether a strand is crossing
over or under another strand so when you
make the projection you have to remember
whether if something is going over or
under and that's easily depicted in this
picture here where you see clearly that
um you know the over what the broken
piece is these is the over one so that's
a picture of a link and it's a diagram
which depicts the lake
now the two links are said to be
equivalent if one can be smoothly
morphed into the other without cutting
the strength so if I have I just I just
want to distort the the strands the
string but I never cut it I never push
one strand through another we could get
more mathematical here in the definition
but it's just this it's just there's no
more content to the fit you know talking
about continuous and homeomorphisms or
anything it's not going to help you it's
just smooth in this very elementary
sense okay now if two links l1 and l2
are equivalent it turns out they are
equivalent if and only if their
associated diagrams D 1 and D 2 can be
transformed one into the other using a
set of moves called Radha Meister rules
so let's see what these moves are the
first move over there I'm not supposed
to use the laser pointer so the first
move takes the green strand and shoves
it under the red strand and you can see
that that doesn't change the that
doesn't really change the the link
itself it's just pushing a little piece
on there without cutting the next thing
you can do is you can take a little
strand the green strand and you can put
a little twist in it well that doesn't
change it because I could under the
third thing I can do is I could take
three strands the red one the black one
and the green one and note the way the
green is underneath both the red and the
black on the bottom part of the page
well I can just slide it up the green
one so it's above it's below the red and
the black but above the cross now I hope
it's clear that if you make these moves
on to Lake diagrams that you do not
change
when you make these moves you're making
moves that keep you in your equivalence
class because it doesn't change the
equivalence classes all things that are
can be smoothly more one to the other
and these moves respect the equivalence
class does that seem clear but the
theorem here is it goes the other way
which is that if two knots are
equivalent then the associative link
diagrams can be connected by a sequence
of such moves okay so these moves allow
you to connect any two equivalent
lengths so the point here is that if two
lit yes
they're in the same equivalence class
what I mean is that the two the two
diagrams represent links which can be in
three dimensions distorted one to the
other the equivalence classes under
smooth defamations which do not cut the
strands does that seem okay it's pretty
I'm sorry
well I guess connected yeah in that
sense I guess so they're connected by
the sequence of moves okay now so let's
take a look at that's the first let's
look at that red circle that's a link
diagram for what's called the unknot
because it's just the most simple not
it's just the circle map to the circle
is called the unknot but if I make a
rata mice to move on it I can turn it
into that figure eight but that's the
same knot and then I could make it more
complicated make it look more like a
pretzel
well I could keep making these moves on
it until it looked like a huge mess okay
I just made a couple of moves but if I
kept making errata mice to move so the
kind I showed you before I can end up
with something which would look like a
huge mass but was still the unknot okay
now so giving too late diagrams there is
no known procedure for determining that
The Associated links are equivalent
there's no known procedure in fact it's
worse than that
for finding the rotten Meister moves
that take one diagram to the other and
in fact this problem is not even known
to be in NP for the computer scientists
out there okay it's not known to be an
NP so that means that this problem is
hard it doesn't mean that it is hard and
thinks that it's believed to be hard
because no one knows how to do these
things so it's very what I'm telling you
here the lesson of this is if I give you
two very complicated link diagrams and I
ask you do they represent equivalent
with knots you can't figure it out and
even if I give you two from equivalent
knots and I say find the moves to take
one to the other there's no way to do
that I mean there's no known way to do
that efficiently and that is gonna be
the basis of the security of a quantum
money scheme because you see are quite a
money scheme since it involves something
well let me try to I can I said when you
if you have security if you cannot have
provable security then you need to base
your security on the presumed hardness
of a problem like for example the
security of RSA is based on the presumed
difficulty of factoring yes
well no the first says that no the first
says I can't tell if they're equivalent
and the second says if they are
equivalent I can't find the moves to
take one to the other
those are slightly different yes but
it's not known that the list is short I
mean for example if you want to get into
the question of NP it's not known
whether it's not known there's notes a
short witness I mean it may be an
exponential number of moves to take one
to the other there's no there's no known
short with this could be exponential
okay now there's another thing here
called a not invariant so there are
properties of knots which are invariant
under the moves and an example of this
is called the Alexander polynomial this
is a function of you take it not and you
look at the diagram that represents it
and given that there's an algorithm that
allows you to compute a function which
happens to be a polynomial but that's
what it really is is it's just a set of
numbers which are the coefficients of
this polynomial which characterized the
knot so there are if I give you a knot
you can compute a particular property it
has it's called the Alexander polynomial
we're not going to use the fact that it
is a polynomial we're just going to
think of it as a list of numbers the
coefficients that make up the polynomial
but it's called the Alexander polynomial
now if too late diagrams come from two
equivalent knots they have the same
Alexander polynomial that's one of the
reasons mathematicians like the
Alexander polynomial because two
equivalent knots have the same Alexander
polynomial but the converse is not true
it is not true that if to the link
diagrams have this Oh two knots have the
same Alexander polynomial that they are
equivalent otherwise I could solve the
problem on the other page I would just
measure the Alexander polynomial
so you can find different you can find
in equivalent lengths with the same
Alexander polynomial and of course if
someone found of a polynomial or a
function of the diagram that was you
know one to one with the equivalents
that they'll be huge they'll be a huge
result not theory so let me just say one
more thing I need something called a
grid diagram see we work in a finite
dimensional hilbert space and I need
some discrete way of representing link
diagrams so that I can code them as bit
strings because I too work in a discrete
space i I need to think of things as bit
strings and those pictures that I drew
with those arcs the curves it's not so
obvious why those are represented by
dead strings but you can represent all
these diagrams by bit strings it's kind
of easy to see why because all you need
to do is kind of take the the arcs and
sort of make them horizontal and
vertical and put them on a grid and then
it won't change the diagram and in fact
if you look at this one here look at
that little too green
two knots interlinked I can represent
that as a grid diagram like that where
are putting things on definite locations
on a grid and I have the encode the
diagram by the location of the X's and
O's on the grid I've put arrows on this
because these are oriented oriented
means that each strand has a direction
that I do cuz of the Alexander
polynomial that's a triviality
unnecessary detail the point of this
picture is to show you that I can I can
make a discrete representation of the
length diagram so that I can encode it
oh what why did I do that again let me
make that go away go away I'm sorry
that's it what
sorry so great diagrams are discrete
representations of links Radha Meister
moves those moves can be formulated as
grid moves and but Radha Meister moves
can change the number of crossings
remember that when I introduced a little
twist when I took two things that would
disconnect them and I crossed them so if
you make randomized to moves on grid
diagrams you can change the dimension of
the grid diagram so for example if I
have a set of grid moves by grid moves I
mean Radha Meister moves encoded on grid
diagrams if I have a finite list of grid
moves they can they could change the
dimension of the grid diagram they could
either leave it alone or they can make
it bigger or smaller by adding crosses
they can make it bigger or smaller but
if you start at it in an arbitrary grid
diagram ji twiddle and I apply a
sequence of randomly selected Radha
Meister moves I will end up with a
random grid diagram equivalent to G
twiddle
so now let me get to the quantum money
what's the quantum money the quantum
money we start in an initial state which
is the sum of all grid diagrams G by G M
units and it's a it's a some kind of
discrete encoding of the grid diagram
which I said I could do and then I have
an extra register now I need to put a
little weight function in there because
the set of all grid diagrams is infinite
and then I really want it to be infinite
so I need to cut this off in some way
and we have kind of a smooth way of
cutting it all so there's a row function
which I need for technical details so
Rho of G is a weight which depends only
a dimension of G and the number of grid
diagrams of dimension D grows like D
factorial squared so I want to cut this
off and then what we do with our Dement
that takes the initial stain and
computes the Alexander polynomial of the
grid diagram into the next register
and then the mint measures the second
register and gets the result pay so now
the quantum money is actually the
uniform superposition overall grid
diagrams with some kind of waiting with
the same Alexander polynomial so that
fits my scheme okay now this is a
massive samel
grid diagrams with the same Alexander
polynomial now how does the merchant
verify the money so first of all
remember that I can make a move on a
grid diagram and get another one
so for each possible grid moves I can
take one of these state vectors G and
get another one G Prime it may be the
same if the grid move doesn't do
anything to it but it may change it now
this is now a quantum operator so I took
this classical R atomize to move and I
turned it into a one thing now for
simplicity let's just take Rho to be one
my weight function to be one otherwise
life is too complicated so I put a
little twiddle on my money state because
I want any the Kate that I've made the
untrue assumption that Rho is 1 for the
sake of my little discussion so the
money is this uniform supposition of all
grid diagrams with Alexander polynomial
P and it's not normalized now because
it's an infinite sum because I got rid
of my cutoff so but the thing here is
that if I act with errata meister move I
have all grid diagrams with this
Alexander polynomial but if I make a
move I get back that every state goes to
somewhere else in a one-to-one fashion
so this uniform superposition of all
possible grid diagrams is invariant
under the move because it has every
possible grid diagram in it and the
moves just take it to the it just takes
each one to another or leaves it alone
so my
is invariant on all the grid moves and
that's the course contains all grid
diagrams with the Alexander polynomial
and the grid moves don't change the
Alexander polynomial so the merchant
verifies the quantum state by checking
that as invariant unto all the grid
moves and in fact this may be I'll skip
this slide the merchant can check all
grid moves at once I won't show you how
you do this this may be too technical a
lot of mechanically so the the the
merchant can check all the grid moves at
once using cart of the miracles of
quantum mechanics
so I he can or she can actually make a
check where he looks at every
conceivable grid move at one time and so
the the the quantum money state is
invariant under all grid moves and F
walk with a cloud computer the merchant
can verify that tendered money is
invariant and that means that we we oh
man every time I touch it I get the same
thing go away so so what this so this is
our money scheme the mint can produce
pairs P and the state dollar P H serial
number is different because I don't know
when you make a measurement what
Alexander polynomial are you gonna get
an enrollment cannot produce the same
serial number the reason is is because
you see the the Alexander polynomial
that comes out as a random number it's a
random looks like a random string and
there's no way that a rogue mint can
give in that serial number make the
superposition what we excuse me I should
said we don't know how we don't know how
and nobody seems to be able to figure
out how given an Alexander polynomial
value you could find make the
superposition overall grid diagrams with
that Alexander polynomial and if the
mint tries to counterfeit the money by
making its own it's Alexander
polynomials will be different yeah
because we start in the uniform
superposition of every imaginable grid
diagram we then compute the Alexander
polynomial to the next register and then
so now we have a superposition of all
grid diagrams and each one has its
associated Alexander polynomial we then
measure the second register and when you
make a measurement to get one value of
the Alexander polynomial and the
register just to the left of it stays
the sum of all the grid diagrams with
that value that I'm sorry yes
superposition superposition yes
superpositions made sense of
superposition so our mummy has certain
features or augment cannot produce the
same serial numbers tended money can be
verified we do not know how to
counterfeit the bills and our security
is based on the inability to tell us to
make diagrams represent equivalent
lengths yeah I meant cannot produce two
builds with the same serial number a
mint can only the mint can only produce
it when it meant as a production run it
gets a series of serial numbers which
you cannot determine in advance no two
are the same and in fact in order for
the money to be truly secure the mint
has to publish a list of valid serial
numbers because otherwise a rogue mint
could simply redo what the first mint
did so they have so the merchant has to
have a list of valid serial numbers but
the point is of this money scheme is
that the merchant never has to make
contact with the mint again the merchant
is real is is independent to the men no
individual bills have to go back to the
mint you don't have to send your credit
card number back to to the credit card
company in order to verify it the
merchant can just take care of it on the
spot and that
we made quantum money so that's my talk
I'm sorry profit gee I don't know hook
them up that's what my my family says
you know what's the good of this yeah
well that's right but it could be that
there's a quantum Internet and you know
photons come down the quantum internet
and they appear on your you know down
fiber-optic cables because there is
remember I didn't the reason I did that
little introduction about secure
communication is because people do send
photons down quantum fibers be sure that
there's no eavesdropping and quantum
states are sent down fiber optic APIs so
if you had a quantum internet you could
communicate we we're very easy but that
you know it's very easy for you to
destroy money right you had if you take
your wallet I can reduce its value to
zero
this is not any great power I have I
could easily do it yeah yeah no it's
really a measurement process I was a
little bit there really is a measurement
well no it doesn't change the state at
all in fact what happens is when the
money comes in and it comes out and it
says good money the money's not damaged
at all the money is an eigenstate of the
operator of the verification operator
which I didn't really show and it's
completely undamaged you don't want the
money to be damaged by the verification
so there's no damage to the money
assuming everything works so yeah
well I don't know about that that would
be interesting whether you know you
could say I have you know I want to
convince you that I have valid money but
I don't hand it to you I don't know
no I'm sorry
I see it's just saying we should be able
to verify the money before I hand it to
you I could have a player I could have
an escrow account record there could be
a quantum yeah there could be trusted
parties you know I could set up a
business maybe this is how I'll make
money you had me your quantum money and
I will verify that it's fun of money and
you pay me to verify that because you
don't have a quantum computer and then I
pass it back to you and if it's no good
I can say don't deal with that guy
that's a money-making scheme got a data
payload oh yeah but it's not that big
right because you know suppose I have a
zillion bills and I each one has the
serial number that's you know a 10,000
bits long it's no pretty small I think
the database of all bills with their
associated security numbers is quite
small we could also use some kind of
public digital I'm sorry I lost the mic
okay well okay could you still hear me
remotely yeah legally they left yeah
okay guy
all right now there any other questions
huge superposition that's what makes it
hard to make if it was a small city see
if I gave you if I give you an Alexander
polynomial I can find a graph excuse me
a grid diagram that represents a a link
with that Alexander polynomial which is
very hard to make is the huge
superposition I mean making huge
positions over things is if a people who
know a little bit more about quantum
information that's a very desirable
thing to be able to do like for example
if I give you a people know what the
graph isomorphism problem is the graph
isomorphism problem is the following
problem I give you two graphs and I ask
you whether there's a permutation of the
vertices of one graph that makes it
turns it into the other now that problem
is actually easier on average but
there's no known algorithm that will
solve it in the worst case there is a
very simple quantum way to do it and the
simple quantum way to do it is if I gave
you a graph oh let me excuse me I don't
mean to actually do it there's a simple
idea which if you could implement would
do it suppose I gave you a graph and I
gave you and I could turn the graph into
the superposition over all permutations
of the graph well if I give you another
graph and I turn it into the
superposition of all permutations of the
grooc of that graph if those two graphs
are isomorphic then those two super
positions are the same because it's all
permutations of the graph so to Isis so
two graphs which are isomorphic map to
the same two super positions and you
could always check if two vectors are
the same so if you could make a mass of
superposition over all permutations of a
graph you would solve graph isomorphism
and nobody knows how to do that making
massive super positions is difficult now
you could ask why didn't we do make all
money using graph I said the inability
to make
superposition for graph isomorphism and
that's because graph isomorphism is
easier on average</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
