to this session of the Google coaches
speaker series the name of my business
is career crossings and today I'm here
to talk with you about the topic of
advancing toward your dreams and goals
through exercises and practices coaching
is all about helping people accomplish
and rather move forward toward their
dreams and goals and i express this in
the in my business through the name of
career crossings and on the back of my
business card which i'll show you later
which shows a picture of a little person
crossing from one island to another
going to a happy place and the little
person is in a boat of course so I there
are three key points that I would hope
that you would walk away with today in
the topic of advancing toward your
dreams and goals and those three points
number one is first of all to dream with
awe and the wonder of a child and the
next point is write down your dreams and
seek clarification for those dreams and
the next point is readiness in terms of
readiness do a reality check on what you
are ready for what RIT what you're ready
to take action for and there is
tremendous hope on getting ready to
achieve your goals and take action
toward achieving your goals before I get
into my session I'm going to tell you a
little story and the story is about
ducks did you know that ducks advance
forward toward their dreams and goals
they do before I tell you about that I'm
going to tell you about how I know about
that and about how I developed my
expertise on ducks it happened many
years ago when i was a child at about
eight years old I was on a farm I lived
on a farm as a matter of fact all of my
choice
hood life up until I went away to
college and on that farm we had all
kinds of farm animals we had cattle
Angus cattle as a matter of fact we had
goats and we had pigs we had sheep and
we had chickens but we didn't have any
ducks so on that farm I decided I wanted
to have ducks so the neighbor had ducks
and I talked to the neighbor and they
said you know what you can do is you can
put duck eggs under those chickens and
those chickens will hatch the Ducks I
said really you're kidding this seems a
little odd to me so they gave me the
duck eggs and I put those ducts those
eggs under those chickens and sure
enough four weeks later little baby
ducklings popped out and that chicken
thought those were her babies I guess
they were her babies at that point right
so that's how i got my expertise in
ducks now back to the story of how ducks
accomplish their dreams and goals move
forward toward their dreams and goals so
ducks two ducks keep in mind my
expertise on ducks and I am going to
take a few liberties with the science
here so keep in mind that you notice
that when ducks are in the water they're
swimming on right you've probably
noticed this they're swimming along and
suddenly you see their heads go down
heads down tails up you know what
they're doing they're eating yes and i
like to say what they're doing is that
they are not only eating in a bigger
picture in today's context of this
workshop they're accomplishing their
goals and they're accomplishing their
goal of eating it's important isn't it
they kind of have to eat don't they to
survive and you can also notice ducks
and they also do this other thing that
seems a little odd in the moment it does
anyway so they're swimming along and
suddenly the whole flock of ducks will
fly off and fly to someplace else in the
water on the pond and fly to a new spot
and we all know about migration dub wait
they fly south for the winter and they
fly back north for the summer when
they're doing this when they're flying I
like to think that they're flying up and
getting the big picture they're dreaming
so in the context of today's workshop
what is important for dogs is essential
absolutely essential for ducks is that
they accomplish goals and in order for
their survival for their long-term
survival they must do that dream thing
flying up to new places otherwise they
will not survive unless they do both of
those same goes for humans we have to
accomplish goals we have to do that
otherwise we don't keep our jobs right
and we have to dream in the long run
otherwise in the long run we don't grow
in advance and we're not as much value
to the company unless we do that what I
find is that dreaming gets short changed
and we pay a lot of attention two goals
but we don't pay quite as much attention
individually and corporately to the
dreaming aspect so the workshop the
session today it's more of a
presentation than a workshop there will
be some questions and a brief exercise
but today it's more about the dreaming
aspect and a little bit focused on goals
I would like to have presented more on
goal goals but one hour does it provide
enough time for that so now this is the
session is about coaching and how you
work toward dreams and goals through
coaching I want to tell you a little
more about how that fits how the
coaching process works clients would
come to me for a variety of reasons and
five in particular one of the reasons
that a client might come to me would be
first of all let's just say this there
is a source of pain somewhere and the
pain may be minor very very minor just a
minor irritation or very severe so you
can keep that in mind so the the issue
or the thing that they might come to me
for might have to do
with leadership development if any of
you are managers or aspiring to be
managers some of you might come to
someone like me for leadership
development or if you're aspiring to me
to go to the next level of leadership
that might be another reason to use a
coach what we would do is we would turn
what your interest is there into what we
would call a coaching objective that we
would work on for the three months that
we were engaged together in working
toward your objective and then we would
as much as possible attempt to fit that
up within your goals here at Google and
your dreams your overall dreams not only
for Google but also for your life and
when we do that it becomes much more
successful so goes the other four types
of coaching that I would do one of those
another one of those is career
development and career development the
idea behind that is that it can come in
various levels and various extremes it
could be a situation where you're simply
wanting to think about what's next for
you you're very happy in your current
job and you're now wanting to think
about what's at the next level another
in the opposite end of that could be
someone who's just really frustrated in
their job and they're seeking their
struggling and they're willing to find
something much better they're performing
well but they're willing to find a
different situation so there's degrees
of that another type of coaching might
be transitioned coaching transition
coaching could be a variety of
situations as well it could be a new
person to googler to Google a noogler
and in that situation a person is has
transitioned in and they're now looking
for ways to get familiar with the
culture and all the rest of the kinds of
things that go along with transitioning
in another thing another situation of
their transition sort of situation that
a person might seek my help for would be
perhaps transitioning from another
country as an international coming to
this country or in a situation where
they
be an expatriate coming back that would
possibly be a situation as well in some
situations I've worked with clients who
have transitioned to other countries
such as back to their previous country
where they came from another type of
coaching that I do is called episodic
coaching this means that there is an
episode going on and usually it's a
crisis situation something they
desperately need to work on perhaps
something like there it's a manager who
is about to lose a valuable employee and
we that manager does not want to lose
that employee so we work toward saving
the employee that might be that episode
the final of the five types of coaching
would be a performance improvement and
that is a situation where the person's
performance isn't in trouble they're in
trouble and they either notice it or
their manager notices it and they're
seeking my help to get themselves back
on track normally what happens is we
have a combination of those types of
coaching coaching and we work through
the realm of those in and out and
combine a lot of them not necessarily
all of them so then as I said we match
that back up to their overall dreams and
goals here at Google now I want to tell
you just a bit about my background and
we'll get more into the content of what
we're talking about here today my
background as it relates to the five
types of coaching on an education level
I have a PhD in vocational education and
I have an MBA professionally I have been
performed both in the academic
environment and in the corporate
environment I worked at golden gate
university as an associate professor of
management leadership and organizational
behavior and it was also the director of
the Executive MBA program they're
stationed out of Los Altos in the
Silicon Valley campus in business I
to hewlett-packard for several years and
at hewlett-packard I was working in with
employees on career development and I
worked with their managers at coaching
their managers helping them to help
their employees I also worked with
technical people to help them be better
technical instructors and I provide in
doing that I provided a variety of
training programs to help technical
people both develop and deliver training
the name of my business is career
crossings and I focus on coaching
consulting and education I am an
associate of two other organizations
right excuse me I was formerly
associated with right management
consultants currently with career
systems international and lash
associates focusing on leadership
development career systems international
focusing on career development I want to
move now into writing dreams which gets
us in more into the meat of the material
today so in writing dreams I now want to
talk about the categories of life which
are important to think about when you
think about writing dreams because in
reality we have dreams for all
categories of our lives we may not write
them down but in reality we do have
dreams and we think about those dreams
even though they may not be as clear as
they need to be and as clear as I think
they should be so I'm now going to give
you a variety of life categories for you
to consider keep in mind that these are
the categories that I came up with over
time and I've invested quite a bit of
time in it but even with that please
when you think of your life categories
which I do suggest you write dreams but
when you think of your categories you
may want to change the wording and feel
perfectly free that when you do that
when you write your dreams to change the
categories according to the wording
that's more comfortable for you
here are the categories that I've used
so we have up here on the chart
profession or vocation this is your work
and you out you know what that is right
that's pretty clear i'm going to explain
some of the ones that are not quite as
clear that may not be as clear we have
finances we have fitness and health
mental emotional and spiritual what
we're talking about there would be the
things that you would do 24 well-being
in order to promote more well-being for
some it's meditation for some it's quiet
time and for some it's spirituality in
various forms including meditation and
quiet time all the way to religious
practices so choose the wording that's
best for you that fits best for you
other would be if in case i blessed
something out the other category then
relationships has to do with all of the
relationships in your life wow that's a
big category isn't it we could almost
have several circles in a different
model for that in entirely in itself
then we have play leisure and
entertainment that's the fun category
don't leave that one out and then we
have your home and surroundings this
would have to do with anything to do
with your where you live what do you
want for what where you live do you want
to live in a place that's closer to work
do you want to live in a woodsy area do
you want to live in San Francisco do you
want to not live in the Bay Area do you
want to live outside the bay area where
some of you are joining us remotely
right now and welcome to you by the way
I'm glad you're here today so that
covers home and surroundings so there
you have the different categories of
life and I being the way I am I do like
to change things so I respect that you
might want to do that yourself now I
want to talk with you about dreams and
I'm going to set you up for a little
exercise that I'm going to do with you
and before I talk about dreams I'm going
to ask you to start thinking about
something I believe that when you dream
it's important to get in touch with the
child energy and what I mean by the
child energy is the NS
it's the openness and the if you think
about a child that there they've been
here or they were there before all the
dolt adult rules came into the picture
so what I want to ask you to do is just
like that story that I told you about my
ducks while ago when you started sort of
get in mind something that you did as a
child I'm not going to ask you to share
this story but a time or a little
situation where you were when you were
child when you were on a mission the way
I was on a mission with my ducks I was
so excited with those ducks I was
thrilled so I want you to think about
right now or over the next few minutes
that childhood experience that you had
and just sort of bring that feeling into
the room right now so I use the word
dreams when I'm talking about writing
what you want in your life some people
use the word vision and I'm telling you
this so that if you happen to work with
a coach and they use the word vision
know that we're probably talking about
the same thing personally I prefer to
use the word dream because it for me it
brings in the passion acts aspect of it
after all Martin Luther King did say I
have a dream and how could what could be
more passionate than that so I believe
that it brings the passion aspect of it
into the picture why dream why dream
pardon me to grow yes what else freedom
from practical constraints takes you out
to that next thing doesn't it what else
how could you not I like that what else
yeah we're always dreaming aren't we
it's just a matter of focusing that and
doing something with it why else dream
it's where you want to be it takes you
where you want to go doesn't it great
it's fun absolutely fun wonderful so I
think you've captured all the points
that I wanted to get out but I'll read
you what I have following dreams leads
to satisfaction and life balance dreams
help us to define our future dreaming
helps us to begin moving into the future
dreams provide hope motivation and
excitement getting clearer can impact
readiness for action that's key to what
I'm going to talk about in a few moments
getting clear about your dreams can
impact readiness for action I want to
talk about now some key points regarding
dreams and then in a few moments I'm
going to allow you to sit and write some
of your dreams just shortly just in a
brief exercise key points regarding
dreams it's natural for Fears to come up
when we're writing dreams did you know
that I have a feeling they may not come
up so much for you based on what you've
been saying but we coaches have this
term that we use to describe those fears
it's basically described describing what
we call the negative voice but we
coaches use this term called the gremlin
and the gremlin do you know what it does
it holds you back it keeps you from
accomplishing your dreams it's usually
that negative and sometimes the adult
voice say no you can't do that and it's
preventing you from moving forward so
it's the negative voice in my pictorial
representation
I actually used the word the term shark
it's the shark biting at you and it fits
in with the picture that's on the back
of my business card and that's why I use
that it fits in with my analogies better
but it is the negative voice and it does
keep us from moving forward there is
something to be heard and listened to in
the negative voice because sometimes it
protects us so we have to know how to
distinguish between the reality of the
negative voice the part that's going to
protect us and the gremlin that's going
to hold us back but it's their dreams
become clearer as next steps are
followed dreams are fuzzy aren't they
especially when you go out into the
future sometimes we don't know exactly
what the dream is we might just know
that we want to please customers or we
want to do presentations we might just
generally know what the dream is so as
we move into the future as we start to
follow our dreams they become clearer
and clearer and clearer just by
following the dreams but they're fuzzy
at first and the point that i want to
make to you is that maybe you're
negative voice will tell you well you
don't know what the dream is you don't
even follow it how ridiculous you're
following something you don't even know
what the dream is or people may tell you
that don't listen to them what I suggest
to you is you go ahead and have the
dream and then just work to get clearer
on it but start the dream and don't like
the fact that it's not clear tell you to
not have the dream writing down dreams
helps to add clarity just by writing
down the dreams helps to add clarity in
my teaching of course is at golden gate
university we used a lot of Harvard
articles and case studies and one of the
articles was called clear writing means
clear thinking means clear writing means
clear thinking and on and on and on and
what I take from that is just the
writing process of dreaming will help
you to get clear about what your dreams
are dreams are about creation and
creation is messy are any of you artists
do any of you do art as a sideline
activity your work is your art right so
dreams are messy and they're about the
creation process
and creation is messy I do sculpture as
my art and talk about a mess it's messy
and sometimes i'll be doing a piece and
i'll be half right in the middle of it
and i don't like the way something looks
maybe the arms not ripe and I just rip
it off and start all over again and
dreams are that way to you can change
courses you can move in different
directions it can be messy dreams are a
natural part of life sometimes people
say won't I ever be happy or they might
say the other thing I'll be happy when
what I suggest is that you get
comfortable with the not knowing get
comfortable with the process that's
what's the the exciting part is the
whole process of getting there isn't it
it's scary sometimes it's a lot at work
but if you look back on it you think wow
wasn't that fun wasn't that exciting
just the process of getting there so
that I think that's what dreams are all
about and that's what the excitement is
is the process of getting and realizing
those dreams so right in a moment I'm
going to give you some samples some
examples of dreams and then I'm going to
ask you to write some dreams yourself or
yours are those little children here in
the room you got your image of your
child when you were a child and on a
mission the way I was with my ducks
because I'm going to invite them in in
just a few moments examples of dream
first cut so we have here the first cut
of dreams and some people will say oh
well it's not clear so that's okay that
it's not clear get it clear you know
it's something you work toward but the
fact that the first time you write it
down is not clear that's not a problem
at all so the idea is that you work
toward gaining clarity toward your
dreams and that comes over time it does
take a little bit of time to get clear
about your dreams the idea is to write
down the very first draft and then sleep
on it and then write it down again and
change the wording sleep on it some more
maybe ask a few people for feedback what
do you think about this and get some
other ideas the point is that the most
important part is it's coming out of you
and when everybody when people give you
feedback make sure that the feedback
feels right for you that's the key
that's why I say bring the child in
because they know what the answer
they know what's important and they're
the ones that they are were here before
any adult rules came into their lives so
here are some examples and this by the
way I got permission from a googler on
Monday to give this as a dream it's a
very general dream isn't it it could
apply to any company and this person
says to be recognized as an outstanding
manager that was his dream to be trusted
as a leader based on my technical skills
and to be and to lead through example as
a manager who likes to get his hands
dirty doing technical work that was our
first cut dream that we drafted in about
five minutes and I did take some
liberties with it I edited a few things
and added a few words and hopefully it
still represents the sentiment of what
his dream was is I would imagine
finances this is not his dream this is
another one that I brought into the
picture so finances then would be to
have my profession provide for me
abundantly and this just is saying that
I want to have enough money to pay my
bills and and to have enough maybe left
over and there might be other words that
you could say you might even have a
dream there you can have as mediums as
you like right there your dreams you
could have a dream about owning a home
have enough money to buy a home have
enough money to pay my current mortgage
might be a dream and whatever 3ms health
and fitness and this is an example of a
dream that is already in place and in
this situation the person is pleased
with their health and fitness and what
they want to do there now dreaming to
keep it in place so the reason I'm
giving that example for you is don't
forget the things that are already in
place in your lives and keep dreaming
about those in terms of maintaining
those dreams I've only given three
categories here and I've given those
simply for examples but for your to
remind you of the other categories i'm
going to show you the others mental
emotional spiritual relationships
significant other children parents
siblings and friends
and play leisure entertainment home
surroundings so I'm now going to ask you
to write some dreams for yourselves and
what I want you to do is invite that
little child in the little child that
you knew long ago who's still with you
the little child who was open who was
not afraid who was willing to play and
just set that little child right down
beside you let's set that little child
in your lap perhaps and let the little
child tell you what your dreams are this
person there it's a little person there
with you I see a lot of children here
little boys and girls and so now what I
want to ask you to do is begin the
process of writing some dreams and for
those of you who are at the other
locations what we're going to do here
for two minutes is we're going to go
away and you will not be able to hear me
on video and people are going to be
writing their dreams I'm going to be
asking you to do that as well please
don't go away though please come back in
two minutes because we will be back in
two minutes I'm going to give people
just plenty enough just enough time to
begin to craft some dreams try to write
down a dream at each of the seven
categories just one at least can you
tell me or at rather are there any
questions do you have any questions
about this exercise about what to do any
questions at all very good so we're
going to go away now for two minutes and
this picture will be up here on the
projector and you'll be able to see it
and we'll be right back did you write
some dreams good and did you get a dream
in each category needed more time okay
are you going to do that when you go
home good so any questions about that
any questions at all so I do encourage
you to keep going with this I hope I've
intrigued you enough and tempted you
enough with this little activity that
you will now go home or go back to your
desk
and continue the process using these
categories or categories that are
comfortable for you in order to get a
little clearer and what you might
consider doing is something like this is
what i do is i will type them out and
then i print to print them off and then
I take the page with me and keep them by
my bedside or take them with me to lunch
and maybe jot them down I keep them
private though because I don't want
anyone to judge them or criticize them
right away so you have to decide your
comfort level on how much you share of
your dreams in this very early stage
okay so now we'll move on into your
Google dream how might you get clear
about your google dream how do you get
clear about your google dream might be
the question
by writing it down okay how else how do
you get clear about your google dream I
beg your pardon brainstorm with other
people or with yourself both okay how
else okay networking may be embedded in
what you're saying and that's what I
want to talk about right now and that is
networking to get clear about your
google dream because it's important that
your dream matches up with your
company's dream right so by networking
what you can do is venture out and talk
about the kinds of things that you are
dreaming about and then asking others
picking their brains and that way that
fuzzy dream that you have can become
more into focus the fuzziness that I was
talking about earlier comes more into
focus just by networking so I'm going to
give you some suggestions and some
thoughts about how to go forward using
the idea of networking to get clear on
your dreams you probably use networking
and I understand Googlers do a lot of
networking and you may already do this
so what I am suggesting is that if you
already do it that you certainly
continue doing that it may be so obvious
to do that that you didn't think to say
that one so exercise here's an exercise
and by the way when I talk to clients I
will sometimes talk about exercises and
I will sometimes talk about the idea of
practices and I distinguish those
between in this way and exercise is
something that you do once and a
practice is something that you do it if
you that you continue doing it whether
it's once a year once a month or maybe
once a day it's a practice that becomes
habit it's a more of a habit so this is
an exercise to set you up for networking
so the instructions then would be right
down your initial thoughts of what your
dreams might be connected to Google yeah
you've done that you did it today right
so you started that process and you
might want to perfect that a little more
go back and get a little bit clearer
about what that dream is or what those
dreams are
then write down the names of the people
with whom you want to have network meet
Network meetings to identify your dreams
in doing this what I suggest is that you
start with people that you're
comfortable with that's what i do and i
start with people that I trust that I
feel happy around that I feel like
they're not going to criticize me and
then I start to reveal what my thoughts
are my dreams are and I pick their brain
and say how could you add to this help
me with this so that's the way I do it
and then venture out a little more and a
little more and a little more until you
talk with a lot of different people
right questions and information to help
you be focused in the meeting what this
will do will help you to get much
clearer much focused and have a much
more productive meeting write down what
you can do or share to help them so
there will be a lot that you can do in
the typical rule of networking is that
you don't make it one sided that you
offer something back to that person so
there's a lot that you will be able to
do to help them you may have in mind
already something that you can do with a
particular person or it may become
obvious when you meet with them for
example I was in a networking mode not
long ago and I when I met with the
person i discovered in the meeting that
he was interested in a particular topic
in a particular writing and I i went
back and went on amazon and bought a
book for him by that author so that's
another way that you can do that too
maybe give them a gift and that way it
could be by lunch or could be other
kinds of things or share some technology
or some knowledge that you have oh yeah
lunch is free so you know that's really
easy isn't it I'll buy you lunch okay so
the practice would be then to network
regularly to get clear about your dreams
and to make that a habit and to keep
going with that because your dreams need
to grow they do grow they change all
the time so this is just a habit to
honor what is actually naturally
happening does that fit could you see
yourself doing that I'm seeing some
heads nod would there be anything that
you would add to that to make it easier
more effective more efficient for you
good
I now want to talk about the concept of
readiness for dreams so you've got a
first cut and you've done a little bit
of thinking about how ready you are or
rather about the dreams that you want to
have and now what this thought is that I
want to plant in your head is what are
you ready for right now in terms of
taking action I want to give you a few
examples of this the first one is my
example and it is when i was at you
lacquered i think we need more light is
that what we're needing I'm seeing
camera people walking around so my first
example is of readiness has to do with
when I was a hewlett-packard and this
was in a situation where I became
unready and I i came into
hewlett-packard with all bright-eyed and
really excited to be there that was a
happening place when I was a
hewlett-packard when I went for my
interview is such a creative place and I
remember when I went in to that
interview I was walking through the
foyer and I looked over and there was a
woman tap dancing and the person taking
me through the foyer just didn't even
look I'm he was like nothing was
happening I said there's a woman over
there tap dancing and she said oh yeah
we do it's creative here we're creative
kind of place and so wow what a
wonderful place to be working what a
what a dream I had about that place and
so I got the job and you know within a
few weeks a few months little by little
I started looking around and saying gosh
I don't know about this i don't know
this is not feeling too good i'm not
sure if I like this or not I was in a
cubicle and I could hear people talking
I come from the university environment I
had an office people were so loud and I
couldn't focus I couldn't think and what
I came to realize is I really did not
like my job I didn't like it at all so I
suddenly I was not ready for that job
anymore my I fell out of readiness you
might say I am I was ready at one time
and my dream was still there but I was
feeling like that
job was not meeting my needs so I was on
the phone can you I know I'm not going
to ask anybody to admit this but maybe
you can think to yourself do you relate
to what I'm talking about you ever been
in a situation like this I was on the
phone whispering in the cubicle talking
trying to get another job within
hewlett-packard talking to other
companies and it just wasn't happening
it was not happening I was frustrated I
was so frustrated so a little by little
I came to acknowledge my frustration
came to acknowledge what i thought i
needed to do at that time and i thought
i needed to quit and so I went out and
got an equity line of credit on my house
Bay Area lucky us we have real estate
got an equity line on my house and got
enough money that I could quit so a
funny thing happened when I had enough
money when I realized I could quit I
didn't have to quit anymore and I got a
lot of courage so I walked in one day
and I said to my manager it took a
little bit of courage to get up to this
I said to my manager I don't like my job
I don't recommend this always I can't
recommend that you would try this at
home but I went in I think I'd have a
little better more of a plan what i had
so i walked into this manager i said i
really don't like my job this is a
wonderful company but it's not working
for me and she said well Bev was her
name she said let's change it that's it
really you want we can change my job and
so we set out and changed my job we
turned it into something that I like and
she said evolved by all means she said
we're a new department and we can do
many things we can do this job in your
job in many many ways so I suddenly
started thinking well how can I do this
mmm what can I do differently I had seen
some courses on training trainers and I
said you know I think I might like doing
that I have some expertise in teaching
and I might be able to do that and I
said I think I'd like to do that and she
said well let's get you certified so she
got me certified in that course called
teaching technical topics she got me
certified in another one called an
instructional design process that was
the beginning of the turnaround in my
job I started loving my job it went from
hating to be in that cubicle hating to
be in the bullpen to loving being there
being so excited to be there I
I got in what I call readiness now I'm
ready to be here I'm ready to start
taking action i was taking action every
day on my dream moving forward and you
know it that change right there that
little action that i took to walk into
her office and say out like this turned
me around and it actually was the
foundation for my consulting practice to
this very day it got me going in that
direction so i can say to you readiness
is critical and determining what you're
ready for is critical and taking action
to make yourself ready is critical and
that's why i'm talking to you about this
topic so let's talk about some factors
that impact readiness so readiness can
can be impacted by a whole variety of
things other things going on in your
life for example so let's say you've got
health issues are you let's say you come
you have cancer let's hope not but you
get cancer when you have cancer are you
really ready to work that kind of
changes the readiness picture doesn't it
so other things going on in your life
affect affect readiness in different
categories of life it can be temporarily
affected or it can be affected in a
long-range way many many different
things can impact readiness peer
pressure can impact readiness so we
might be in our minds be ready for a
change but yet around people are peers
who are not supportive of us so they're
not they're not pushing us forward
allowing us to go forward to what we
really really want to do peer pressure
peer pressure can also cause us to move
into readiness I had a funny situation
the other day at the gym I was talking
to this man and he said his he was in
good physical condition excellent
physical condition as a matter of fact
and he said the other day I got together
with some of my oh and he said yeah I've
got myself in a good fit condition here
and I felt like that I didn't have to
work quite as hard he said but something
happened the other day that changed my
mind he said he got with some of his
friends and they were all look
buff and suddenly he decided he was
ready to go back to the gym and work a
little harder so his peer pressure
caused him it was a little bit of
competition there caused him to get back
into readiness to being more active
toward his workouts background and
experience can impact readiness as well
so your background when you let's say
you get into a position your dream was
to be a manager for example that is your
dream and or let's say that is your
dream to be a manager and then you start
thinking about what is my background and
do I have the background and experience
so the action that maybe you that you
are ready for maybe to gain the
background and experience to go into
that position that may be the act that
pulls you into that next mode belief in
the pot and the possibility will impact
readiness I have so many clients that
don't take action because they don't
think it's possible and what we have to
do there is work on their belief and the
possibility that that can actually
happen so the belief in the possibility
there can impact their readiness so this
some of these things having to do with
readiness are some things that we can
help you on in coaching we can actually
impact your readiness we can help help
you get ready we can help you identify
the skills that you need in order to do
certain things we can infect and impact
your mental processes you're thinking
about your belief about whether or not
you're ready to get yourself ready
another readiness issue it might be I'm
not sure if I want it or I changed my
mind so I have worked with clients
before who are working towards something
and for example maybe working toward a
vice president level and they think they
want it and then as we start to go
through and they start working toward it
it becomes clear to them that they don't
really want it so they changed their
mind and that's okay too at least they
worked toward it I've heard it said that
even if you don't accomplish a goal the
act of working toward accomplishing a
gold is a good thing in itself so that's
an important aspect fear can impact
readiness can take you out of readiness
level of desire can impact readiness can
impact and make you more ready or less
ready if you don't have the desire there
and the clarity of a dream can also
impact your readiness for action so here
we have readiness for action and I have
a model for you so what I suggest you do
is go back to your dreams or actually go
back to the categories and ask yourself
how ready am I for action for activity
in that dream category look at each one
for your profession and vocation for
your finances for your health and
fitness mental emotional spiritual etc
what are you really wanting to focus on
right now and that's a very important
question and it's a hard question too we
struggle with it so what if your heart
and soul tells you that you need to
focus on something else other than work
right now how do you handle that what do
you do because works very demanding
isn't it I was talking to a gentleman
the other day he was not a client so I
was talking with him and it was obvious
from our conversation that he was doing
some very valuable work around mental
emotional and spiritual and he was
working on some issues from child
childhood and these issues had impacted
him in relationships in the past and he
was absolutely needing to work on this
and he was achieving great success in
ironing them out the reality is is the
work that he's doing now we'll make him
much more successful at work later so
what we were talking about it was in the
conversation was whether or not he's
ready to take on some next steps at work
so what he was telling me is that he was
indeed very successful at work already
even though he was doing a lot of work
on himself outside of work what he was
telling me is that he is perceived as
other by other people as being
successful but yet right now he's
feeling just to himself like he's a
little bit stagnant but his dilemma was
do I go for
what I think I might need to do is the
time now so it was a big dilemma a big
discussion that we had and he's now
going to go away and think about that
but I think an important thing for him
to think about whether or not he wants
to go for the next step which may take
him away from his work on himself so
he's going to be thinking about that and
it may be that he can take little steps
little action steps toward getting him
to that next level at work but I
certainly support him in guarding his
time and knowing the reality of what he
needs to do right now there may be other
situations where you've gotten some
other things in your life kind of taken
care of and you are ready to go for it
you're ready for some action i would say
in my life right now that is where i am
i've gotten the rest of my life in
really good shape and the focus right
now for me is profession i'm in a place
right now where I'm in tremendous
readiness for that and achieving some
good things and maybe some of you are in
that stage 2 some of you may be in this
stage of readiness you may be ready for
work and you may have hit some snags
along the way and those snags may be
taking you now to a place where you are
struggling maybe you have advanced
you've been successful all of your lives
and maybe you've hit a few snags that
are making you say am I really sure that
this new dream that I have is the right
dream for me and you may be having some
doubts and you may be feeling some
stuckness and you may be thinking am i
indeed ready for what I'm doing right
now and just your stuckness is keeping
you in place so there's a lot of work
that can be done to get clear about your
capabilities to learn and to move
forward to get you unstuck just as I did
at hewlett-packard in my example any
questions about this model that I have
up there is that clear to you about how
you might use it in your lives
ok any questions at all good i highly
encourage you to spend some time on this
and to value what you think you need to
do right now value what you think you
need to do where do you need to spend
your time and it will pay off
before I close I want to talk about
downtime in connection to dreams have a
few more things actually before I close
down time in connection to dreams so I
believe that when you are dreaming
especially during that stage it's
critical to give yourself down time down
times hard to work into our lives isn't
it let's face it we are busy people so
we can find little snippets of down
times and you may have your own
techniques for doing that there there
are different ways of doing it but there
are different degrees of doing it too
there's a temporary momentary downtime
to give yourself rest and renewal and
then there's the longer weekend retreats
and then there's the vacations so in
terms of the momentary kinds of downtime
you could think of doing things like
when you're sitting at your desk getting
up and walking around this beautiful
building walking around in the foyer or
walking outside certainly that downtime
is important I'm saying these things
they're quite obvious aren't they but
I'm also saying them in terms of the
this period when you're writing dreams
when you're thinking about dreaming that
the downtime is critical to help you
help your dreams come out of your mind
and psyche so down momentary downtime is
important downtime after work things
like going getting a massage anything
that can relax you might be an important
thing to do now going on week weekend
retreats going on hikes to let your mind
comes to the surface to let your
thoughts come to the surface would be
important vacations as I mentioned
earlier there's a wonderful book and it
has a religious sounding name but it is
not a religious book this book is filled
packed full of exercises to give you
down time and the book is called Sabbath
Sabbath by Wayne Muller it is an
excellent book and you can get that book
on Amazon it's an older book for two
dollars for like two dollars you can buy
this book because it's such an old book
and it's packed full of exercises that
are so sweet and so wonderful and so
provide such peace during this period
which I highly recommend going on and
now talking about I want to talk with
you about some more practices that you
can do that might impact readiness that
might help you in your readiness phase
help you move into readiness more so
when you're trying to accomplish some
goals some of them will just be related
more to dreams exercises and practices
to support you in progressing toward
your dreams so these the first one I
call this practice the harry potter
practice did you see the movie harry
potter did you read the book harry
potter maybe it's read the first one so
it's called Harry Potter's closet
actually I misspoke the where did Harry
Potter sleep when he was living with his
aunt and uncle you remember and the
cupboard under the stairs yes I think of
it as a closet but if you've ever been
into any of these old houses they have
closets under the stairs and that was
where he slept can't you imagine that in
that closet what he was doing was
dreaming about the future his aunt
knuckle weren't very supportive were
they so in his private moments he was
probably dreaming about things to come
and wow did he ever have things to come
he had no idea talk about fuzzy dreams
things to came later didn't they but
can't you imagine that he was not
talking to his aunt knuckle about that
so what I say to you is protect your
dreams the way Harry Potter protected
his dreams there will be times when you
want to talk to people about it but if
you sense that you're not comfortable
talking to people or particular people
then guard your dream the way Harry
Potter did in his closet and eventually
when you get more comfortable with it
you will feel more comfortable talking
to people about your dream right next I
call this the dream storyboard so
creative people technical people you
know about storyboarding right in
training and teaching we know
about storyboarding what the dream
storyboarding about is about is creating
a pictorial representation of your dream
so what I am throwing out the idea for
here is that you think of some of your
dreams that you really want to have you
really want this promotion you really
want to be successful at being a manager
so you write just do yourself a little
storyboard create a PowerPoint
presentation and this is not going to be
the kind of power point presentation
that i'm doing here that you're going to
show to a group of people it's the kind
of power point presentation that's for
you only for your eyes only so oh we're
getting close so that would be a
PowerPoint presentation of your your
dreams so we are out of time I'm getting
the the signal that we are out of time
and I'm going to need to close now and
thank you for your participation thank
you for being here today and i will say
that i do have a gift and i think i have
just about the right number of gifts for
you here these have you seen these oh
I'm supposed to hold it still for the
camera to see it i think i should set it
down over here so you can see it a
little bit better that is a lego toy and
when i did my research on google a few
months ago when I was being selected to
be one of the coaches in the for the
approved coaches I read about Larry Page
and his printer when he made the printer
minute made out of Legos and I said well
I've got to bring my Lego toys because
what I do is I give clients this toy
this Lego all of my clients each of my
clients i give this leg on i've been
doing it for many years and when you see
my business card you will notice that
there's a little man woman in a boat
crossing from one side to another and
this Lego toy looks a lot like that both
so each of you will get one of those i
have 20 so if there's more than 20
people here today you may not get one so
i'm going to give you one of those lego
toys in conclusion I would like to say
thank you for your participation today
and I would love to talk with you if
have any questions about what I have
talked to you about I'll be glad to hang
around and answer those questions or you
can reach me on my website WWE r dash
crossings com if you want to set up a
coaching engagement that would come
through Merrill Blanchard who is here in
