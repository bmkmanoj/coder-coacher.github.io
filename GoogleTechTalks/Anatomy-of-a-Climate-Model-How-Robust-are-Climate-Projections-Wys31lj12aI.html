compute okay situated at different
locations around the globe and they will
pass information from one computer to
the next computer and there's a
conductor in the center who would have a
red and green light and tell and and
slow people down or accelerate people
when when the message is not going the
right speed and those of you who
incubation of fluid dynamics immediately
know what that's talking about okay
we're talking about the CFL criterion
without CFL so what he did the first
numerical weather prediction it's a grid
over Europe and so you predict the
pressure temperature and wind obviously
the temperature changes in temperature
changes the density of the air and
changes in the density of the air
changes in the pressure and if you have
two places with different pressure you
have the pressure gradient force and so
that changes the wind etc etc so a very
simple idea you can you know the
equations from long time ago so
unfortunately the first prediction was
us was a really bad failure
okay the predicted surface temperature
trend predicted was a hundred fifty
forty five millibar per six hours and
the real change was much smaller so
since 1922 nothing much happened until
1950 so the first successful numerical
weather forecast was done in March 1950
and it was done on the ENIAC computer in
the in the never testing grounds in
Aberdeen Maryland the lead was this guy
who is my thesis adviser and so there
are several steps that I will talk to
you about one is what they did
obviously this is a u.s. calculation
it's the grid over the US and they made
several forecasts 24 hour forecast and
48 for 48 hour forecast and it took them
33 days to debug the code this is one
layer of
okay and to do the forecast and and this
is the computer the ENIAC with fewer
than ten words readwrite memory and so
this is a function table okay this is
the memory here okay and these are the
these are people who help manage the
cards and so to advance one time step
what is more interesting to me here
inside it's a marvelous story that you
have punch cards and to advance each
time step you calculate parameters that
you know ok the change in it you know
the Coriolis force you know where you
are the gravity their function tables
this is the storage this is the memory
and then you have any air operations so
these are actually using the 10 word
memory and so your advance you do that
you do the difference thing you do the
addition you do this all the operations
are done here and then it outputs the
deck of punch cards and then you take
the punch cards and then you figure out
where the next set of operations are
okay and then you put it putting it
through the ten word memory so it takes
it takes 16 of these operations to
advance one time step which is 15
minutes ok so this is a story they tell
is that they punch cards Bogota to tell
and they would go at Jake and then we go
dance while the punch cards are you know
so this is round-the-clock enterprise
but the success of it a success of it
came of that operation that's very that
very first numerical weather forecast
came from several things one is better
observation Second World War I don't
need to tell you there were lots more
meteorological observations and so then
what you have weather forecasting is an
initial value problem better
observations mean that you have better
initial conditions that you know good
start second is that it was a faster
computer you know we had the ENIAC ok so
they could make a 24 hour forecast in 24
hours so it's nearly catching up the
real time ok but most important that's
the most important reason for the
success is Chinese rendition and
PhD thesis at the University of at UCLA
that the atmospheric flow is quasi
2-dimensional the radius of the earth is
six thousand six three seven five
kilometers the atmosphere is one is ten
kilometers okay so to lowest order it's
a two dimensional fluid and it's a fast
rotating fluid and those of you who've
gone through that this is a Taylor
problem in Theorem okay so the flow is
quasi two-dimensional it's quasi because
all the action happens in the vertical
the flow now all the energy most of the
energy is in the horizontal velocities
but the action of getting energy getting
storms getting rain getting anything any
any energy conversion happens in the
vertical so recognizing that then you
can do approximations to the equations
of motion so then you can do the
crossing dystrophic vorticity equations
or quasi geostrophic just meaning when
it's advection it is two-dimensional and
then you allow for the vertical motion
the more important thing is to recognize
that there are certain waves in the
atmosphere that are just nuisance okay
the the the correspondence of the time
says who cares about the high notes okay
we care about the low okay so so so
Richardson's failure in that inside he
did not recognize that the gravity waves
you have sound waves in the atmosphere
and so he blew up for all practical
purpose he needed a very very small time
step and he blew up but the other thing
is that with the the worthy initial with
observations then you solve the equation
in pressure and pressure is a scalar and
so it is much more stable you know you
it's it's easier to solve than the then
then the momentum equation so they could
take much larger time steps so that was
the first success and after that there
many you know I can't give you the
history of M aspheric science but here
are the equations
okay momentum equation mass conservation
of angular momentum conservation of mass
P equals Rho RT okay energy conservation
of energy so that you have energy this
the energy the change in temperature
this horizontal advection the wind blows
cold air hot air so we have all the
terms on the right hand side are the
forcing functions we have changes in
energy because the the the atmosphere
absorbs and reflects solar energy
there's a change because we have the
greenhouse effect there's the long wave
energy that's goes in all directions
we have also sensible heat sensible
means the heat that can be felt so think
of it as convection in the classical
physics sense so you have a temperature
gradient there is heat transfer and
latent heat
okay evaporation of water from the
oceans the ocean supplies latent heat
converts the liquid to vapor the vapor
in the atmosphere when it condenses
releases this the heat to the atmosphere
so the heating the source of this is
three-dimensional okay various locally
varies with the composition varies with
the clouds with various with everything
and obviously now we add in water vapor
conservation of water in the atmosphere
so this horizontal advection of water
but also in situ in situ evaporation and
condensation of water so all of that we
thought we think we sort of know but the
Bugaboo comes in here okay what I have
put in is convective mixing so this is
think about it as clouds I look at
clouds their poles their poetry there's
lots of poetry about clouds for you I
have to write an equation about the
clouds so so the clouds when the clouds
when you see plumes when you bump around
on the plane okay I'm thinking about
where that where how the cloud is formed
okay you have you have a shearing flow
you have a convective plume and a
shearing flow and the plume is going to
entrain stuff okay it's going to
entering dry air and how high it goes
depending on the entrainment and
you can see the cirrus clouds of the
Trainmen and in all that clouds what am
I saying I'm seeing Layton heating
there's condensation okay so it's
heating the atmosphere but not only that
it is mixing the momentum in the
vertical it is mixing the temperature it
is mixing the humidity okay so a lot of
it a lot of the story of the climate
modeling is in the it's in the subgrade
scale this and turbulent mixing even
though we're looking at the whole
climate in the ocean we have a similar
set of equations so I put two because
the ocean is incompressible so we can
look at the momentum equation in the
same way the advection the Coriolis
pressure gradient friction and so then
the equation so conservation of mass and
pressure gradient so we in the ocean we
can assume the hydrostatic approximation
unfortunately for us the ocean there is
no nice thing P equals Rho RT okay so
the the equation of State for seawater
is a mass of a polynomial that nonlinear
that you have to worry about the
temperature the changes the the the the
distribution of temperature salinity the
pressure but also the sodium the
chloride the everything else okay so the
composition of seawater all enter into
the this this polynomial that describes
the equation of State so ocean
unlike the atmosphere which has internal
heat and sources and sinks of heat and
water vapour the ocean is conservative
in the interior of the ocean so there's
no internal sources of heat there's no
internal sources of salt or momentum so
everything it happens for the ocean
happens at the boundaries so this
momentum input at the top of the ocean
the wind dragging the ocean there's 40
city input to the ocean at the top of
the atmosphere and so you have heat
input obviously and then precipitation
is adding salt water is adding
precipitation is adding fresh water
evaporation is removing fresh water so
there's a change in the salinity due to
precipitation
evaporation at the at the top of the
atmosphere the ocean the challenge is
the tapa the bathymetry okay coastline
shelves and so it is very red so it is a
real challenge when we talk about
climate models we do not have a nice
bathtub of an ocean so all the friction
or the dissipation everything along the
irregular coastlines is a mere a real
problem here so when we talk about
numerical weather prediction you're all
familiar you know I just talked about we
have initial value so we take the the
observed state of the atmosphere now
what we take what we do is we have the
raw observations the temperature the
humidity the pressure the wind and
everything then it goes through a super
data large assimilation exercise and
then using either some variation of an
example Kalman filter or using 40
variational methods but anyway you have
the UB atmosphere and so you make
predictions of six hours 12 hours 18
hours etc so you are know that the error
grows with time so the in the initial
conditions are not perfect because
nobody observes at middle of my grit box
averaging over the okay so you have
whatever instantaneous observation so
there is the translation of the
instantaneous observation to the to the
to the state variable of the of the
model there are portions of the of the
world for example over the southern
ocean where we have very little
observation okay so then you have the
initial conditions are not perfect the
models are not perfect and so the errors
will grow in time and all of you know
the limit to a forecasts we don't look
past five days okay two weeks is a bit
of a stretch okay so Seoul here is the
weather forecast it is an initial value
problem in the last several decades what
we have done is started to look at a
seasonal climate prediction El Nino
predictions for example and
they're the models the equations may
look similar to the weather equations
but then we look at the problem in a
slightly different way we don't think
about it is sort of an initial condition
so now we have an in Samba love initial
conditions and so then we make an in
Samba love forecasts and the forecasts
even though we are cranking along at
five minute or fifteen minute time steps
we're looking at the statistics it is
very important the climate problem
whether it is a seasonal climate problem
or a longer-term climate problem we are
not looking at the day by day every
realization of the state of the state
we're looking at the statistics with
forecasts the mean and the variance
we're asking we'll next month what is
the probability that next month will be
wetter than typical March okay what is
the probability that the next March will
be colder than a typical March so it is
not it is no longer an initial value
problem even though when we crank turn
the crank it looks like an initial value
problem okay so there in the in the
climate problem then it becomes sort of
I'm saying sort of we can argue the
technical term but it's a boundary value
problem so for climate prediction what
we need to know is the for for seasonal
for El Nino forecasts we need to know
the sea surface temperature the
evolution of the sea surface temperature
that's the boundary the boundary
condition changing and so then we can
use the changes in the boundary
condition slowly changing condition and
the boundary condition and then do the
forecasts and then look at the
statistics okay so that's that's a
difference in how we use the model so
obviously since the 1950s we've got
better observations faster computers and
improved physics soak modern climate
models we look at the whole problem in a
you know you get you get these are web
pictures
so typical pictures we divide the world
and a huge number of grids and then we
specify the solar irradiance at the top
of the atmosphere we have volcanic
aerosols greenhouse gas we specify the
composition of the atmosphere that's the
last decade so we predict the state
variables temperature pressure wind
cloud cover cloud height means 3d
distribution of cloud cover water vapor
now we also predict liquid water in the
atmosphere so much you know etc so we
predict the entire climate system at
very high resolution the last decade we
were going for finer than 1 degree
latitude by 1 degree longitude
resolution and now the next generation
we're going for 25 kilometer resolution
horizontal resolution just so you have
the number in your head the surface area
of the globe is 5 times 10 to the 14
meters squared so you can count how many
great boxes so then come going with a
high spatial resolution we have high
vertical resolution so we've gone from I
don't know where we're now 50 you know
typically 50 layers in the lowest 10 or
15 kilometers and then the ocean 30
layers in the ocean and then the soil
and then the soil maybe 10 layers maybe
more so with with a high resolution you
know CFL comes back in your we and
Richardson we need to pass information
faster to the next guy so so we take
verify very small time steps now and so
we calculate our multiple experiments so
it's a humongous enterprise when I did
the calculation for the last IPCC I did
a very coarse residence I added co2 into
the climate model so I wash my I put in
vegetation I watch the Leafs grow and
okay and they decompose in the
circulation the carbon in the ocean and
the fire
the whole bit and it was a first
calculation and I did it a very coarse
resolution and that I did a
thousand-year control run and it was I
was a nervous wreck it took I don't know
how many months on the computer and
because they were gonna retire the
computer and I had the petition and I
said I cannot move the car new computer
please don't retire it until I'm done
but these are these have huge
calculations so the code at the time at
this time I'm guessing because I read
the code it's so between half a million
to a lot a million lines of physics so
it's not talking about all the
housekeeping and stuff like that so the
variations on the theme you know
obviously I showed you the equations or
how you implement it you know the
typical picture is a finite difference
you carve you know divided into grids so
but we've also done spectral versus
finite difference but then the spectral
methods obviously we have mountains and
so we have negative mountains and we
have the pressure
Gibbs effect going around like that so
it's a pressure it's a headache and so
also variations for example in saucer
solving for you horizontal wind as I
said the circulation is quasi
2-dimensional so knowing that the
horizontal wind you have to calculate
the divergence D U DX DV dy okay so it's
better to just formulate rewrite your
equations in in the divergence and the
vorticity okay and then solve those
directly rather than calculate the
direct because that's where all the
action is a new new approach is not to
have a grid regular grid because we have
what we call the polar singularity okay
as the latitudes well as you go to the
pole the longitudes get smaller and
smaller so you have a singularity at the
pole and so they're mountable in many
many different ways of dealing with
and this is an example of the geodesic
grid that Dave Randall at Colorado State
University has done and so so the the
other thing is the vertical coordinate
and this has always been a problem
because when you have a mountain your
boundary condition the windows okay go
like this you're gonna shoot you know
unless you put in a boundary layer and
slow the window and it's it's gonna fly
up if the if the window flies up like
this I'm gonna have problems with my
clouds I'm gonna have problems with
everything so tradition historically the
first thing is we define a normalized
pressure coordinating the coordinate so
so the surface pressure is always one at
the bottom and top and zero at the top
but then it you know then horizontal is
not exactly horizontal and so there's
also all sorts of transformation that
you have to do for the ocean is
particularly difficult because the the
density line again the ocean is maximal
typically four kilometers thick okay so
when we have slight slopes in the
density so these are constant density
lines and this slope there's a lot of
exchange along the along identity line
but very little bit Stapley stratified
okay so very little exchange across
diagonally
very little and if your coordinate is
horizontal and can't deal with that then
you're gonna have computational problems
and you have an artifact of very large
diffusion in the vertical when you
shouldn't have that so there's a lot of
problems of implementing these but even
at 25 kilometers the important processes
are smaller than that okay so we can
release at higher resolution we can
resolve the POG refer we can resolve the
large scale flow but a large scale flow
is to a significant order driven by
small scale processes okay so here we
have the
the the problem of resolving clouds and
rain and aerosols but also at high
resolution the way the old models are
formulated is that when your grid is
this big okay and the vertical is that
big you can assume turbulence is 2d and
when it comes back to you know a cube
you know the same same dimensions then
you have to look at the turbulence
formulation totally the spectrum is
totally the the energy cascade spectrum
is totally different what I want to go
is here so these are these are really
important challenges but what I want to
spend my time on is the energy what goes
into the physics of the model and this
is a very brief summary of the Earth's
energy balance and I don't know if
you've seen it so I apologize if I'm
repeating something you know the Sun is
has 6,000 Kelvin the earth is at 300
Kelvin so the sun's the emission
spectrum of the Sun Peaks as you know in
the visible part at 0.5 microns the
earth at the earth emission spectrum the
earth is at 300 Kelvin the earth earth
emission spectrum Peaks around 10
microns so that it is very convenient
for us to separate into solar and
terrestrial radiation or short wave and
long wave radiation or visible or
infrared radiation we're saying the same
thing so it's very convenient the
temperature allows us to separate the
energy from the Sun versus the energy
from the earth so if we just put the
energy of the Sun here into a hundred
units then there are aerosols and gases
and hub in the atmosphere that really
absorb 20% of it and then they're clouds
ok the clouds reflect sunlight and then
also at the surface the albedo the
whiteness the reflectivity of the
surface the reflectivity of the ocean is
6% the reflectivity of snow and ice is
60 to 80% ok forest is about 10 to 15
deserts about 20
twenty-five percent so then all together
they reflect about thirty percent of the
energy so about of order fifty-one
percent of the sun's energy is absorbed
by the surface so that in turns gives
Sigma T fourth you know this is a law
blackbody radiation you have Sigma T
fourth so so there's long wave radiation
some of the radiation in the window
spectrum until recently there are no
gases in the atmosphere they absorb in
that part of the spectrum so it is just
going straight out to space but they are
co2 this co2 water vapor and methane and
nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere and so those go into
excited States
okay co2 into excited States and so they
absorb the energy and so then they
radiate both up and down okay and it is
this downward energy which keeps our
earth warm without the greenhouse gases
without water vapour in the air without
co2 the earth would be 30 Kelvin colder
than we are now
okay so so when we look at climate
change then the climate change happens
when the changes in the incoming solar
radiation changes and the cloud changes
in the composition of the atmosphere
changes in the surface albedo etc etc
etc so anything that we do that change
any one of those of these arrows
everything changes
okay this is this is the whole thing
about the climate system so you're
familiar with this figure if manalo
Observatory Dave Keeling went up to the
observatory and it's a really tough
place to get to I mean it's a marvelous
place to be one of them but it's tough
to get to I got I tried to go there and
I got lost in the lava even though there
was a line that says follow the white
line to the observatory I got lost so so
you can see very clearly the increase in
co2 in the atmosphere the unit is parts
per million by volume ie if I grab a
million molecules of air
I guess 780,000 and nitrogen I get two
hundred ten thousand oxygen etc so out
of the million molecules of air I have
now three hundred ninety molecules of
co2 so minut amount of co2 in the
atmosphere so we have we have
observations of these and the ice core
from the ice core the the air bubbles
trapped in the ice we can get analyze
the the composition and we can we can
back out the co2 the important for my
conversation is not the Vostok and
you've seen a lot of of those graphs the
Australians have a very nice we call a
high deposition site okay so a lot of
snowfall so that you can see and your
layers so you can read you can get
really high resolution information out
of the Australia with a from the high
deposition sites so we can have that the
the co2 the atmospheric composition back
to 1800 so once you have the atmospheric
composition you have to do what is the
called radiative forcing you have to
translate how much the energy absorbed
okay so you have to calculate the
excited States and this is an example
from this is Bill Collins gave me this
figure he's at LBL and at Berkeley so
now we define forcing okay we have the
background we have the we have the
pre-industrial let's just use the
pre-industrial as our control state and
so now we're perturbing it by increasing
co2 and other gases then we what we can
do here is the spectrum okay so this is
wavelength here so and this is the
forcing so you can say when co2 goes
from 180 to 270 parts per million I get
the blue line so you can see where there
is where there is a lot of forcing okay
that means excited States
and so you can see as we slowly increase
these are stepping
okay since we slowly increase as the
color goes from blue to yellow
these bands saturate okay these bands
saturate because you don't see the
yellow anymore but the wings come up
okay the sphere is spreading so there is
even though this has been talked about a
lot that that oh there's no no
greenhouse problem because the band
saturate and that's true in this
particular band okay but there's a lot
of absorption in the wings okay so so
what we have is a logarithmic Li Inc you
know increasing it's a monotonic
increase the forcing as a function of
co2 but it's increasing logarithmically
so you can take the observations of co2
of increases of up co2 nitrous oxide
methane etc etcetera all the greenhouse
gases and you do the radiative transfer
calculation for each one you take into
account the overlapping lines between
all the various gases you take into
account where the gases in the
atmosphere the vertical distribution and
the pressure broadening and all that
sort of stuff okay so now you have the
forcing and so this is a summary sorry
this is a summary of the forcing here so
you can see co2 so these are positive
forcing and you can see here the spatial
scales global you know whether we are
confident scientific understanding or
not so since the 1752 now there's also
change in surface albedo because the
snow got darker because of all the or
the soot the dirty snow but also less
conversion of forests to agriculture and
that changes the reflectivity that the
the surface got lighter but there's a
too big blue blobs here one is aerosols
and one is called direct effect and the
second is cloud El albedo effect
aerosols are suspended liquids and
solids in the atmosphere so you know
when there's a hazy day you know when
you go to Beijing or Shanghai its
aerosol loading you have but how much
aerosols reflect and you know they
reflect someone but how much aerosols
reflect sunlight depending on the size
of the aerosol so you can just do a very
simple calculation given a certain mass
smaller aerosols would have a larger
surface area and therefore would be more
reflective than larger aerosols so
there's a large uncertainty here because
we didn't know the size that we didn't
know about the aerosols and the 50s or
the 40s or you know the historical
record we do not have historical records
of aerosols and so and also we don't
know the size distribution but the other
thing that happens with with aerosols is
an aerosols influence the cloud
formation process if you have gone
through Gibbs free energy calculation
homogeneous nucleation is very difficult
so the presence of a condensation
nucleus in the atmosphere okay
helps the helpless the formation the
condensation so what you see very this
is off the coast of California from
Modi's satellite you can see these very
linear features and so we have ship
tracks ok the ship's emit gunk okay and
and the water condense condenses on the
gunk and so what we have are brighter
clouds and you can see very clearly the
change in the cloud albedo so the clouds
get brighter because we have smaller we
have smaller particles in the atmosphere
now this is a major uncertainty you know
we don't know the aerosols we don't know
the size distribution we don't know the
hygroscopic properties we don't know the
chemical properties you know there's a
lots of things we don't know but also
even when we see something like this in
the models which we can capture we can
try to capture all of these we don't
know the lot about the lifetime of
clouds so if I have now smaller cloud
drops the clouds may hang out for a
longer time I don't know okay they may
not so there's all sorts of things that
we are working on so now I go to climate
forcing so summarizing those bars then
what we have here is
the forcing so this is the - line is the
sum of all the red bars okay the blue
dashed line is eros although all the
blue bars okay and the filled in red
here is the total okay this is a Monte
Carlo calculation I won't go through all
of that what I want you to remember to
several numbers the cumulative the
forcing the greenhouse gases we have put
into the atmosphere since the 1800s have
given us a forcing of three watts per
meter squared okay that has been
countered we think by the aerosols
and so that's minus one point four and
the net so far that we have gotten from
the forcing is 1.6 watts per meter
squared and I want you to remember those
numbers okay so now we have clicked the
system okay the next thing we do you are
engineers you know the feedback and for
Earth the feedback is water so when we
have an initial warming then you know
the we're melting Isis a tree so they're
melting okay we're darkening the surface
reducing the albedo from sixty to eighty
percent to about thirty twenty thirty
percent so that's increased absorption
of solar energy so that accelerates the
warming and more warming we have more
evaporation from the ocean and so that
increases the water vapor in the
atmosphere water vapor is a greenhouse
gas okay so that also enhances the
warming and so where the dial could be
is increasing cloud cover and cloud
cover would reflect sunlight okay and if
there's an increase in cloud cover then
there could be an decrease in this
option of solar energy and that would be
the negative feedback so the dial a
major dial of the climate system is in
water okay and the negative dial the
damping dial is in the clouds about
which we can write poetry so I'm gonna
go to this familiar figure you guys have
seen this figure before from Vostok we
have weight from the ice from the air
bubble in the ice and from the deuterium
in the in this the air bubble and the
deuterium in the ice we get the co2
record and the temperature record
showing very clearly the the hundred
thousand years you know different cycles
of the Milankovitch of the Earth's orbit
around the Sun so they'll saw they look
lockstep what Jim Henson has done is to
be used to convert the co2 let me just
back up you can convert the co2 like
what I showed you into a forcing the
methane into a watts per meters and
you're forcing per meter squared and so
then what you have the temperature is
the response and you can you know we can
extra estimate what the global mean
temperature is from the Antarctic
temperature and so what you get and so I
won't go through the the regression and
etc but you get a feedback factor from
the ice core of about three quarters of
a degree Kelvin three Porter Kelvin per
watt per meter square for forcing okay
this is derive this is empirically
derived from the ice core data okay
that over the last 400,000 years the
lowest order if we kick it if the if the
system changes by 1 watt we get 0.75
Kelvin okay so this is now you come back
and so the way it is done is that you
can now estimate something called
climate sensitivities climate
sensitivity everyone uses you it's just
partial derivatives okay you have the
total temperature and you say what is
the total temperature as a function of
water vapor changes in water vapor cloud
cover cloud height you know etc etc so
so then you can do this calculation and
when we did this this is 1984 we did it
on an armed all the back
Smith so what you do I mean this is a
really tedious calculation you have to
you have to run the model and us figure
out what is the total change you have to
know what is the total change in water
vapor and then you plug it back into the
model okay holding everything else
constant the only thing you change and
you figure out what what of what the
forcing is so what we have then from the
calculation is that the first thing the
major feedback is in the water vapor
increase okay so this is the co2 to give
the major forcing is in the in the water
vapor and not only in the amount of
water vapor where the water vapor is
water vapor in the upper upper
atmosphere upper troposphere would trap
the energy and so there's less energy
going out to space so a we contribute to
warming and so this change also lapse
rate in the temperature gradient DT DZ
and so that is a negative change sorry
so albedo we melt ice okay change
vegetation and so that would be a
positive forcing and cloud height I'll
come back to cloud height so when we
have higher clouds okay more you it's
more energetic warmer that's more
conviction it's more energetic higher
clouds then the cloud top would radiate
to space at a colder temperature okay so
there's less heat loss to space
therefore warming so if we come back
here so the two things are the same for
two times they were two forcing you can
calculate a forcing of four watt per
meter squared using the feedback factor
I just showed you then the climate
sensitivity okay which is just defined
just a convenient term is three Kelvin
okay so you get the idea of what we have
to do so now we come back to the
greenhouse gases remember I said
remember three numbers okay two numbers
one is if only greenhouse gases we
already have three watts per meter
squared
forcing since the 1800s okay I apply
this climate the feet the the feedback
factor we have
two over two degree warming in the pipe
okay this is equilibrium this is very
serious stuff okay when you ask me why
we feel urgent urgent urgent this is the
reason okay we have already committed to
two Kelvin okay at when the system comes
to equilibrium but when we added
aerosols aerosols counter some of the
warming some of the forcing sold Seoul's
only have 1.6 watts per meter squared so
then we now at equilibrium if we keep
aerosols if we can keep bitching if we
keep you know all the cruddy atmosphere
around then we will have a lower lower
temperature increase about 1.2 Kelvin so
those are equilibrium calculations you
know so you have infinite time for the
system but the ocean is stable
stratified okay so then any heat
anything that we put in the ocean it
takes a long time to diffuse okay but
when do any where ever you warm the
ocean then there's more evaporation
there's more water vapor that
contributes the more warming that warms
the ocean some more etcetera etcetera
etc so it's not just the thermal inertia
it's that feedback coupled with the
thermal inertia of the ocean that gives
us a time scale of at least a hundred
years so what we have then is what we
realize the warming we have since the
1800 is about the last two years warmed
a lot so I'm trying to update my head
about 0.6 to 0.8 and don't put me on
that I have to check ok but the what we
have realized is less than what is in
the pipeline
okay so we have pipeline because we
haven't come into equilibrium yet so
that's basically you know all the pieces
you need to know about climate warming
that there is the forcing and then
there's the feedback and the feedback is
the climate that the feedback is
controlled by the by them by the water
cycle so when we look at
the different models now so this is IPCC
a lot of models each thought is a model
but different I just won't go through in
the color but but this is the opposite
so this is we plot things differently so
this is the same okay this is at 0.75
here they just flipped it is the
reciprocal here so we're looking at the
same thing okay water vapor is a
positive feedback the largest feedback
positive feedback from all the models is
in water vapor cloud okay I said even
though I said if I had increase in cloud
cover
I would have a negative feedback it
turns out that I mean it's not it turns
out you know from classes clapeyron from
me from the from the equation from water
the phase diagram of water that when
when it is warmer the atmosphere can
hold more vapor Ocasek alee 7% per
kelvin so the atmosphere reservoir has
increased with every increase in
temperature and so this actually
decrease in cloud cover when we in all
the model I'm not saying in real life
involve and all the model calculations
we all have a decrease in cloud cover we
all have higher cloud cover so we all
have a positive feedback from clouds and
so albedo obviously we're melting snow
and ice everyone has a positive feedback
we all have a change in the lapse rate
in the same way but anyway so you can
see that all of them together we have a
feedback I mean so we have a in some
general sense of agreement or
disagreement depending on your own your
viewpoint
this okay that positive feedback so the
IPCC you've seen this figure before the
observations you know if we run let's
start with this one the black line is
the observed temperature change globally
averaged and the blue the swarm of blue
line this is the United Nations effort
every model contributing model gets gets
gets a spot okay so we do not throw out
anything that is less sophisticated or
less reliable so the blue line is
then everybody's average and so you can
see that the observations you know when
we include all the greenhouse forcing
order then we have a better agreement
with you with the observed and I won't
go into this but what I want to go into
is what what where is the action why is
it so difficult imagine again this is
this is you know this is the the face
diagram for water so this is temperature
suppose you start here okay and you go
to this position to from A to B then you
add more water vapour in the air there's
more MORE
long wave absorption and so this is
going to be a runaway greenhouse ok
runaway warming but if I go from here to
C then when I cross the line then I have
condensation so before I cross the line
it's warming if I cross the line and I
get nice flat maritime stratus clouds
that rain on us then I have cooling ok
so half a degree of temperature who
cares about except when you have to
change face and then it's a zero one
okay and so how far so this is the
challenge is how far am i lofting the
clouds i mean the water vapor where do
they condense and then when they
condense what kind of clouds they form
ok so that's that's that's one of the
challenges is how do we predict clouds
how do we write the rules for clouds and
so here you can see from satellite from
the observations this is the shortwave
this is a solar part of the spectrum
this is long way for the infrared part
of the spectrum bright clouds obviously
reflects sunlight and that's why you see
it in the solar part of the spectrum
high clouds as I said less emission to
space and so they enhanced warming and
then we have some low bright clouds ok
that cool the surface ok so low so they
reflect sunlight and the cool the
surface so precipitation we Society
doesn't care about half a degree change
in temperature doesn't care about one
degree change in temperature we care
about changes in precipitation
especially changes
in precipitation extremes so when I look
at precipitation I can go through you
know we went through you know
condensation you across the line but
when I think about modeling
precipitation it's the second derivative
of temperature first I have temperature
which is pressure and then I have
convergence the wind
okay the wind is the pressure gradient
for so that's the first derivative of
temperature then I have convergence to
get the lofting and so I'm looking at
the second derivative of temperature
okay to start okay it's one thing to say
temperature second thing to say I can
get the sixth the second derivative of
temperature and then just to get it up
to the right altitude and condense so
this is a figure from the IPCC report so
you can see the dotted areas are where
we agree in the sign not the magnitude
in the sign so some obvious things which
is here you know in the tropics it gets
warmer there's more evaporation there's
more precipitation but here the where
there are no dots but is showing drying
the decrease in precipitation and we
have the Hadley circulation in the
atmosphere that the air rises at the
equator and then sinks okay around 20
around 30 degrees north and south that's
the Hadley circulation that's the
location of the Sahara Desert and a lot
of the deserts now what we're saying is
that that's the the the thinking branch
of the Hadley circulation is moving if
the Hadley cell is expanding okay so it
is the singing branch is moving forward
towards us okay so this is what a reason
for concern and so yes you know there
isn't there is an agreement because some
of our models have a little little bit
of expansion some other models have a
lot of expansion and so there's not
agreement at high latitudes where
there's where the hemisphere holds a
little so little vapor so any addition
of the vapor will air will come down as
precipitation so I want to come back and
now end very quickly here when you look
at the other figures accompanying this
is that we saw we looked at
precipitation evaporation of
sleep when it's warmer that's more of a
person but look at this figure soil
moisture this is the parameter important
for the albedo darker wetter soils are
darker okay this is important for all
the ecosystem dynamics obviously it is
important you know for the boundary
layer turbulence how high the how high
the boundary layer is and they are very
few dots okay this is one of the major
challenges of the climate of the climate
modelling is how do we represent the
water under our feet we cannot because
what we have is very heterogeneous
heterogeneous composition under our feet
and there's no motion that you know we
anyway so you get the idea what I want
to end with is several things one is I
asked the question how can we predict
the weather okay so many of you know the
equations that it means when we went
hiking anyway so you know the chaos
equation so so chaos the first chaos was
you have a heated from the Rayleigh so
you have a fluid heated from below and
the Rayleigh number tells you that's the
strength of the heating the B is the
parameter the crucial parameter is the
Prandtl number here the the ratio
between the facility and viscosity so
when you heat from below when you have
when you have it have enough heating
just to initiate convection then the
heating the viscosity tells you how fast
things would go around and the
diffusivity tells you how fast you're
losing heat as you're moving around so
then if you rise somewhere when you get
to the other side and you know whether
you have the temperature gradient that
may allow you to fall or the other guys
will come up okay so this is where the
this is so you can do then this is just
the X the stream function so you you
know you guys have played this is
everyone has played with that but this
is where I come back to the issue of why
should we be able to predict the weather
so this is multiple so I
the simple equation multiplied the tens
this is real ten calculations and you
can see they were they sort of follow
one another at the beginning and then
they diverged
okay so again I remind you whether it's
the event okay whereas and so in this in
this case the it is unpredictable
whether it's not unpredictable after
five time steps whereas climate is the
average of the weather so when I take
this and then I average then we have
them we have the the mean and then we
have the PDF okay so here even using the
chaos model and this is Lorenz you know
that the the reason he he he the three
equations is to show that whether
predict there's a limit to weather
prediction okay so now what we what we
are using is to look at the climate in
terms of the same equations and saying
we're looking at the statistics of the
climate and even with with the chaos
model we can we can have a sense of
predictability so I'll finish very
quickly so you can see with with very
simple Lorenz three the chaos model what
I did was I ramped up the heating
linearly okay that's you know in the in
the classic one it's it's a constant now
I ramped it up and so here's the mean so
this is a mean climate okay so it is
increasing this is I just plotted X
which is a function so it's going faster
and faster but this is the standard
deviation okay and I look at that as the
weather okay so you can see the weather
getting more violent okay we're gonna
have extreme heat and extreme cold
extreme whatever weather
okay floods and droughts okay so the
variance is increasing in a very simple
model and this is also what we get in
the big models so I'll stop here and
I'll just talk about observations
challenges you know observations
observations okay so we're talking about
multi scale modeling there are all sorts
of things I have not a time to talk
about data assimilation you know
dynamical systems or there are a lot of
things going on in here
I have been working on ecosystem models
putting ecosystem models into the
climate model and it's a big challenge
so what I have done I just talked about
something I'm doing now because I went
in a very Anna fit of arrogance I went
to my friends and I said you guys are
measuring the wrong things so we have a
new program where we go out in Northern
California and we have a site where we
have instrumented very small site and we
have instrumented the atmosphere we
drilled now about 15 wells all the way
down and we've we have put sap flow in
the tree so we know where the tree well
whether the tree is putting water up or
down you know roots are putting water
down and we have brought in Neutron
probes and together to get the profile
of water and so this is a new approach
to trying to understand you know I
identify what we don't know in the
climate model and trying to go out and
look at the data okay and gather new
data and figure out what to do about it
okay so I'll stop right there this is
one this is another marvelous challenge
for me so I'll leave it up here this is
satellite this is satellite image again
of opinel convection and closed cell
convection sometimes when you fly
I flew back Saturday and I said pancakes
okay so you know but not really been out
conviction you see the hexagons so
sometimes we see pancakes filled
hexagons
sometimes we see lacy open okay open
cells so it's the edges so what we are
now looking at is that you know if you
just do convection if you have plus
Delta t minus delta T you get symmetric
cells but if you change that to a flux
boundary condition it makes a difference
whether you're heating from below or
cooling from the top
so heating from below you have the lacy
patterns if you cool from the top then
you have closed patterns okay
and so now with the new observations I
say where do you think it is raining not
in the pancakes okay at the corners okay
so now there's just new observations
that's coming in I find that they can
oscillate and it's just marvelous so
this is one thing you know we're trying
to write the beautiful pictures but
we're trying to write the equations
we're trying to understand the dynamics
of what is going on with these cloud
structure and what is the subgrade you
know what is the level of detail we need
to represent in a climate model so I'll
stop here thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
