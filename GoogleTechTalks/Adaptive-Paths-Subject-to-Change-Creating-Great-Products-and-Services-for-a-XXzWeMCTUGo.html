brandon schauer who are going to talk
about their their new book that's just
out and we have some copies for everyone
here they come from adaptive path which
was in a way a competitor of the company
I used to work for I do and I was always
just astonished at the productivity of
this small firm of about 35 people
they've been in business just just seven
years in that time they've written five
books now starting with the elements of
user experience by jesse james garrett
and this is in their spare time when
they're not designing stuff for clients
right they also you could argue like did
Al Gore invent the internet but you
could really say that the folks at
adaptive path had a lot to do with kind
of the birth of Ajax and they coined
that term Ajax I think that was Jesse
James Garrett as well they wrote a
observing user experience by mikuni
offski they wrote designing for
interaction by dan staffer and they've
done to spin outs of which one was
acquired by google measure map and we
have some alumni from that organization
here and get satisfaction a a really
interesting sort of web two point O
interpretation of how customer service
works has recently launched so it's it's
it's really an impressive kind of IP
generation and community-building
consulting firm and I'm thrilled to have
you guys here with us so I'm going to
leave it at that and let's get started
thank you thank you very much good intro
um quick sound check is my mic working
cool ok so I'm Brandon this is David and
just to check on time we should keep it
at what 30 40 minutes what you think ok
so we're going to step it up just a
little bit but we're here to talk about
subjects change a new book is coming out
of adaptive path
what is it all about we named it this
because we believe there's certainly a
lot of change going on a need to deal
with and find a way to deal with it and
so what we took is the time to say what
are some processes or techniques that
can deal with all that's going on so
wanting to show you stuff we all know
but just to sort of set the tone of the
background so think of media for example
it's certainly a mess if you're a
newspaper craigslist certainly has taken
away all your classified ad money so you
have no revenue there everyone including
all present or taking away the ad
revenue and blogs are taking away the
readers so what do you do if your
newspaper it's really tough and
difficult not change really really fast
music as well is changing very very fast
itunes last month of course became the
number one retailer beating out walmart
that's kind of weird folks like live
nation who are concert promoters have
started signing artists so jay-z Madonna
worked with a concert promoter to
release their records not a label also
banned to releasing debuting albums via
rock band so that's really really weird
and really on so that's that scene is
changing as well travel also very odd
because last month the top-rated
carriers in terms of service the quality
of service think about this the quality
of service top rated were low fare
airlines so when the world does that
mean when we're getting you know lower
prices but higher quality from newer
airlines rather than the old traditional
ones so thanks for changing kind of
quickly we can keep on going and talk
about industry after industry where
these weird kind of fluctuations are
happening so the big theme here is that
a lot of changes happening it's really
hard to predict what's going to happen
five years three years one year out so
how do we do that because predicting the
future has always been hard but now it's
even harder so if predicting the future
is not going to be something that works
if we can't be that accurate about it
how do we deal with that
traditional organizational methods let's
meet about it that's not going to work
obviously either our traditional ways of
handling problems through bureaucracy
and other means doesn't work so what
this book is really about is how are we
going to find approaches that work no
matter which of our theories on how
things are going to change which what
approaches are going to work in any
circumstance and so what we tried to put
together in the book is some ideas about
what those approaches are so that we can
sort of talk about it and really think
about that and put that in the dialogue
that's out there and so we're going to
go into that the Wayback Machine and
start with a history lesson that kind of
points to the importance of experience
as a goal so in 1886 scientific american
release this special supplement about a
new photographic apparatus there was
deserving of a special supplement
because it was so advanced in terms of
ease of use for for photographers
especially photographers in the field
they called it the most practical of
systems for the itinerant for
photographer and it was the most
practical but like i said because it was
far easier than anything that came
before but there's easy and then there's
easy so if you look at instructions that
came with this device it's a full page
of relatively dense documentation starts
with the letter A goes up to the letter
s there's 19 distinct elements the
photographer had to keep track of and in
addition to this of course there's all
the kind of extraneous related stuff
around film developing film doing prints
kind of everything associated with
making photography a kind of a
complicated a hobby or profession to be
involved in interestingly enough right
about the same time George Eastman was
around this is the slogan for the
company that he launched and his role as
he was an inventor and he invented kind
of new medium for film roll film as
opposed to having the motion on plates
or sheets and he could have taken his
his invention and he could have invented
a new camera and he did and this is the
camera he invented the first Kodak and
instructions for for the use of a Kodak
are these you pull a string you twist
the knob and you push a button you push
the button
and Kodak does the rest so what he did
was he actually realized that he could
take advantage of his new technology and
he could have just built another camera
that was in the same line as the
previous camera he could have made it
smaller and could have made it more
portable but what he did is he said I'm
actually going to take away the
complexity so the customers don't have
to deal with the complexity i'm going to
set up a plant that's going to take care
of all that stuff and what the customer
would do is they would buy one of these
cameras it would have a role with a
hundred hundred photographs in a roll
film for one hundred photographs they
would take hundred photographs they
would ship it off the factory the
factory would remove the film from the
camera develop it make their prints
reload the camera ship the whole thing
back to the customer all of a sudden
photography was accessible to everyday
consumers because the vision that that
Kodak had was he focused on the customer
experience he realized that his goal as
a businessman was not to create the on
the basis of his technology a more
perfect technically perfect camera but
his goal was to make it easy for
customers to take photographs and while
that distinction seems minor as it
played out obviously it had tremendous
impact in a tremendous difference in how
that unfolded over time customer
experience what does that mean well this
is one of the sort of very abstract
traditional models we think of when we
think of developing products and
services maybe you start with data at
the core layer logic on that business
rules those types of things and then
build out the user experience that the
customer actually touches this is a good
traditional model for thinking about the
full system interesting thing is that of
course customers don't think of it this
way they think of it as this way there's
a user experience and then everything
else is just magic so I know we in this
room very much think of the prior model
because we have to make it work but from
their point of view this is how the
people we build products for actually
think of our products this why we say
the experience actually is the product
they're receiving this is the only thing
that matters
to a customer it doesn't matter how it
works under the layers it doesn't matter
how how things were put together it
matters what the experience is and
that's what they're actually buying so
for go back to this model oftentimes the
the approach is to think outward from
the data building out to the experience
because that's the method we have to
probably take in terms of building out a
solution but inversely we can start as
well from the outside in and talk with
customer expectations think about what
the experience is we're trying to create
and work backwards and think about okay
what's the alignment we need between
data logic and the user experience to
pull that kind of experience off to
think from the product that the customer
is buying the experience and work
backwards from that so again the
experience is the product this is the
core of the message we want to talk
about to get today and we want to lay it
out in a couple of ways we're going to
talk through these four sections the
idea that how do you focus on experience
how do you focus on the lives of
customers embrace the complexity of
change and learn to live with it and
then engage in design as an activity
that can help you deal with
unpredictable futures so if you want to
focus on on experience one thing that's
really helpful is to actually have an
explicit stated experience strategy or
have some internal understanding within
your organization of what are you
actually really really trying to
accomplish what are your goals and an
experience strategy has to accomplish
several things I'm an experienced
tragedy is not necessarily a horribly
complex document it doesn't have to be
like 100 pages of fine type that sits in
a binder in your archive of document
doom but what it is is it's something
simple that you can use as a guideline
and as a guide as you're developing a
product for example palm they had a
simple idea that they had their their
prototype which was a block of wood and
anything that fit on that block of wood
could fit in the product and if they had
to remove something to fit something
else on the proton the block of wood
that was more important that's what they
did the newton by example tried to be
everything to everybody and and actually
kind of failed in the market partially
because of that so George Eastman you
know he had you press the duck you press
the button we do the rest I was kind of
a marketing slogan but once again it was
something that he could use the guide
the development of his product and the
service that he was offering an example
from from here is the google calendar
before Google Calendar was launched
there was certainly a lot of calendars
on the market and on the web that could
be used Google obviously didn't want to
launch something that sucked so their
team came up with a list of vision of
what they wanted it to be this vision is
actually a really great example of what
you can use as a as an experience
strategy it has things like they wanted
to be fast visually appealing and joyous
to use Joy's to use is not a specific
description of a feature you're not
going to have a functional spec that has
item 12 B is joyous to use however it's
still a guideline to what you can do
right if you're designing a camera that
has 19 distinct elements that you have
to use before you can take a picture
that's probably not joyous to use so
trying to strike this balance between
being not so specific that you're
talking about specific features and yet
specific enough that it gives you a
guideline a ruler for making decisions
or something that you can use as a
generative guide to coming up with ideas
of new features and that you may want
your product to actually do drop dead
simple to get information of the
calendar drop dead is not exactly a
formal development term right but it's
clearly understood by the team what you
mean by that and it's clearly you can
use that when you decide what you're
going to try and and do what your what
your calendar is actually going to what
features is going to have how it's going
to behave all those kind of things are
really important to have something like
this behind you obviously when the
google calendar launch it had tremendous
uptake you know arguably some of this
was google kid get a lot of eyes on a
calendar but it would not have had this
up cake if it had not fulfilled at least
in a major part this vision that they
had behind it another great example of
this kind of strategy is is
liquor on their about page this is an
even older example we want to help
people make their content available to
the people who matter to them we want to
enable new ways of organizing photos and
videos these are kind of very clear
statements of the experience that
flicker wants their customers to have
with their service and because they're
very clear it allows them to to not get
lost in the details of what exactly
they're doing but it allows them to
figure out oh we need to have an API so
it's easy to get stuff in and out of
here we want to make it really easy for
people to get photos in and out and
share it with their friends it really
guided the development of their service
so one thing you can ask yourself if
you're developing a product or you're
launching a new services does your
experience have a North Star do you have
a common understanding within your
organization and across your
organization of what you're actually
trying to accomplish and it should be
focused on the experience not on
specific features but on the experience
that you're trying to provide to your
customers is it is it specific enough
that you can use it as guidelines to
make decisions across multiple layers
because the decisions you may make from
this are may affect the visual design
layer it may affect the interaction
design layer it may affect our features
that make it into the product or are
emitted from the product you want to be
able to use it as a guideline for for
all the multitude of decisions you're
going to have to make as the product is
developed over the course of time so
next step talking about focusing on the
lives of customers and from our
perspective this is about understanding
them as actual people understanding
people as people because we have a lot
of ways as is organizations for
understanding our customers oops they
look forward one of the ways as we go
out into the world to understand them
it's very much this steve zissou kind of
experience of going out into another
world and looking on them at them from
the other side of the one-way glass the
one-way mirror and seeing them and
treating them like creatures to be
studied foreigners okay and that's not
necessarily the right approach to it
because we separate ourselves from them
we assume they are unlike us in many
ways
is we don't necessarily understand them
as deeply as we possibly could and
that's that sense of depth is what's
really missing the companies often
oversimplify how they understand
customers especially when you're in the
early stages of coming up with things
like an experience strategy early stage
of product development or service
development where you're really trying
to get at what our needs that are very
may be tacit or unspeakable from a
customer's point of view but or
something that can make a really really
great product later on of course you
need simple definitions of demographics
and other things to track what's
happening on but those kind of very
simple definitions aren't very useful to
you when you're trying to figure out
what's a product that people are going
to love so let's go first through for
the ways old ways of companies and
organizations use for understanding
their customers one way the worst way
possible we now know in depth here does
it is taken from the clue train
manifesto which talks about
organizations that treat customers is
gullets whose only purpose in life is to
gulp products and crap cash but we've
all probably been treated by an
organization like this and felt that way
and we probably left them very quickly
if that was possible in other cases
there are telcos another approach that
organizations used for understanding
people is the term homo economicus it's
people who are very rational and how
they behave that these are the
organizations who think very much about
price and demand kind of charts that if
something's more expensive here the
customer will go over there to get a
cheaper version of it that we measure
everything and are thoughtful in our
choices and how we interact with
products and services to maybe on a
macro scale this could be a little bit
true but if it really was true we would
all just be a planet of Vulcans and in
reality we pay you know lots of money
for coffee at one place when we could
get it much cheaper somewhere else we
make all sorts of irrational decisions
based on things much larger
than the rational quantitative figures
we have in front of us another way
organizations think of customers is an
approach that that was born greatly out
of the HCI movement of understanding
people and understanding how to make
products usable for them so what are the
goals they have where do they come to
the experience with and how are they
going what tasks are they going to use
to actually accommodate those goals and
while that's very helpful for usability
studies perhaps it also treats everyone
sort of like a type a personality like
you're here your robot you're going to
get it done get out be done in fact you
know we we behave irrationally a lot of
times with products there there's
messiness and how we sometimes Jesus
spent a lot of time with them sometimes
want to use them in bizarre ways and so
this isn't a completely realistic way of
understanding people it's still very
shallow finally one of the ones that I
think adaptive path we get the most
aggregate aggravated about is this
approach where we feel an organization
feels their customers or our people to
be preached to to be shown the way to
give them the right message that's going
to hook them on and keep them as a
customer but customers aren't sheep they
have free wills they are going to leave
you if they want to and it's not purely
about messaging and getting that right
idea in front of you there's countless
number of bud advertisements at the
Super Bowls that never follow through
and they never saw an uptick in any of
their sales even though people thought
they were hilarious and they were great
messaging they didn't actually connect
with people people aren't sheep so none
of these are necessarily completely
wrong there's all appropriate ways to to
think about them except for maybe the
first one from the clue training
manifesto but none of them are
completely right what what's happening
is over all the approaches are being
involved we have new ways of
understanding people and we know kind of
what's missing from that formula things
like the messiness of human life there
are a lot of bizarre things that go
on and in that messiness are great ideas
about how we can serve people based on
how they're behaving and what they're
messy kind of needs are just to take a
couple examples people use products to
fit their needs so they combine them
often in weird and unusual ways whether
it's things like putting your remote
control car and your swiffer together
that's an extreme or whether it's
dunking your your doughnut and a
Guinness also a little bit of extreme
but people cobble together solutions to
fit their own lives and in bed is a lot
of richness of new ideas and new
opportunities another thing is people
blending old and new crossing boundaries
that aren't usually cross so the bizarre
world of monks using cell phones as an
extreme but this is actually an
interesting story this was an overpass
near the adaptive path office in San
Francisco someone had actually spelled
this out and I believe his duct tape on
a highway overpass this is a weird
mixing of public and private what do you
yes it was not mine is not my message I
actually can spell is one of the big
differences but you kind of wonder did
he did she actually agree because he
can't spell he obviously has a strange
sense of Romanticism yeah he can run out
if he's into efficiency very much so so
people do weird things crossing strange
borders that especially are coming
around public and private especially
these days so how do we actually
understand people as people that's the
real goal here is how to helping break
down these shallow definitions to start
getting it the deeper needs people have
to drive product and service development
one of the key ways is empathy that they
are not truly bad unlike ourselves and
that we can go a great deal to spend
time with them and understand what is
going on their lives that we bring that
understanding back to our own work that
we build empathy for what they're trying
to achieve what their needs are and from
the prospective of what's been missing
what are their emotions will go a little
bit deeper on the
a minute what's their context we
recently are doing a some service design
with a group that does online payroll
and they saw metrics where there's a
media drop off at certain points in the
experience usually you think okay that's
a usability problem there's something
wrong with the interface that wasn't it
at all people were going away to get
other documents or if they're doing
payroll they're probably the boss and
other things are interrupting their
lives so that's the larger context of
what's really going on and we just look
at it from the thin straw whole
perspective of maybe usability or
interaction with this one product you
lose that bigger context meaning as well
what is the relationship I have with
this product with this service has it
connect me to other people and what role
does that fill in my life it starts to
attach meaning to the products and
services we use so from the emotional
standpoint this is a quote from Don
Norman who's done a lot of thinking in
terms of emotions and human factors and
this is what he writes I'm going to do
the bad thing and read my slide because
of new scientific advances in our
understanding of the brain and how
emotion and cognition are thoroughly
intertwined we scientists now understand
how important emotion is to everyday
life how valuable so that's his official
explanation but in other works he goes
on and explains a different story which
is when he was at Apple computer is
there human factors expert he did a
study because he has really confused why
they were thinking about moving to color
monitors away from just gray scale so he
brought down a color monitor to his lab
did a lot of testing to see if people
could accomplish those tasks and goals
that he set out there's absolutely no
difference between how well someone did
something with a color monitor versus
how well someone did with a gray scale
so he did the test publish the results
great very happy with it week's went on
and then the operations department said
hey can we get that color monitor back
he said I didn't really want to give it
up
so there's something there and it's not
the official explanation but I think
it's a lot more meaningful in terms of
yeah you may not be able to rationally
say it cheves people's goals more
quickly are this more efficient but
there's a layer of engagement that
happens through a motion that we often
don't design for and we don't take time
to stop and go okay what are the motion
someone should feel through this
experience what things should we try to
engenders air their interactions so
we're going hopefully from a world of
thinking about tasks and goals and
preferences to a world that's thinking
much more about what are the motions we
want to engender what's the context
someone's actually working in so that we
can design for that context especially
especially true in the world of mobile
for example and what kind of meaning can
we build of this this product and
service in their lives so the big
question this comes to really is do you
understand your customer as a person are
they just a demographic or are they just
a persona so the next thing to talk
about is is embracing the complexion
using systems to support service
experiences you know as we seen that the
products and services we're trying to
liver or often complex eastman I around
photography there was a lot of
complexity and he took that in to take
it away from the customers the customers
themselves are complex but there's
there's other things that that
complicate the picture even further
largely internal things that experiences
don't often match the internal structure
of the organization so this is a
government website it's actually really
great because they can actually split
the customers into those that need hey
and those that have hey it's easy to
envision a business that fulfill the
needs of these customers that had the
hey acquisition department in the hay
disbursement department right that's a
relatively simple case but what's more
often the case is you end up with
something like this so adaptive path did
some work with this large financial firm
and they had an issue that every month
there their customers would receive
these really dense financial statements
about how their investments were doing
and these statements were oftentimes
hard to decipher they would summarize
things in odd ways and if the customer
looked at the looked for supplemental
information on the web the web
properties were all from an entirely
different Department out of the IT
department which meant that they would
use different language things would be
summarized in different ways and if they
called somebody on the phone the call
center was an entirely different
Department there was no congruence
between how these three departments
thought about the financial even the
numbers that they had access to so from
the customer point of view the company
was really unable to give them a
cohesive whole whole experience and we
see this all the time that if you want
to provide this experience to your
customers oftentimes internally you're
going to have to really play explicit
attention to how are you going to work
internally within your organization to
cross those boundaries that cross those
silos because that's the only way you're
going to deliver something and
experience the customer that actually
makes sense so it's complex the
customers are complex the products that
complex our implementation environment
is complex there's a couple ways to deal
with this one is to kind of put your
head in the sand and hope that
everything will turn out okay one is to
try to plan the hell out of it get 50
people in a room at the beginning that
our domain experts and try and plot out
the development of your product of the
course of the next five years and hope
that nothing changes there's no changes
in the marketplace new new competitors
and everything stays the same those
aren't likely approaches to work you
really have to understand that we're
working in a complex field you want to
take approaches that really take
advantage of the complexity one of the
principles of agile development is is
not only do they want to be able to
allow for change during the course of
development but they want to be able to
harness that change to end up with the
products that's even better than than
the one that was originally intended you
know likewise if we adopt approaches
that allow for this complexity and allow
us to respond to complexity and change
over the course of product development
or in a much better situation so there's
certain things that that tend to be
really useful to do approaches that have
a fair bit of iteration in them whether
that's you know time boxing for for a
physical product or some sort of agile
approach where
you know you get to a release and then
you iterate on that release one of the
things that allows you to do is it
allows you to make decisions the
appropriate decisions at the appropriate
point in time when you have not only the
most information but kind of the most
appropriate information about what to do
it allows you to fold in over the course
of the product development allows you to
fold in new information that you find
from customers using early versions of
your product new technology that may
arrive on the scene kind of any number
of things and being able to do decisions
in this kind of just in time of method
is is really really useful in delivering
a more valuable end product the other
thing that tends to be really useful is
as things like prototypes once again
we're dealing with complex issues it's
really hard to get 50 people in a room
and figure out the entire complexity and
how all the pieces are going to fit
together without actually starting to
build something to see other pieces are
going to fit together and whether that's
you know sketches on a white board as a
really low fidelity thing but but
building software prototypes that to
make sure things are going to work to
put software prototypes in front of
potential clients to see if they're
going to enjoy using it or not to build
functional hardware prototypes to feel
what it's going to be like you know if
you have an insulin pump you're not
going to know what it's going to feel
like to walk around for a week with
insulin pump strapped to your body and
to build something that has the same
form factors that insulin pump shovel
needle and your gut and walk around with
it for a week that provides really
valuable information right so the other
thing that you have to think about is
collaboration oftentimes the best
approaches or the purchase that there
are going to be most successful are
approaches that cross normal
organizational boundaries and really
spending some explicit time figuring out
how are you going to cross this normal
internal boundaries so that your IT
department talks to design team talks to
your marketing folks talks to product
leads getting all those people in the
same room and communicating is
tremendously important now there's some
things that actually make this a little
bit easier we're going to see this
example again shortly in the next
section but you know here we've got two
pedometers we've got you know one on the
left it's this standalone device full of
features well you got the nike ipod
system on the left which also has a
physical device but it has this software
web component and where that means is
after six months the perp the device on
the left on the left is still the same
device that you bought right but the one
on the right there may be software
updates it may be an entirely different
different beast by that point it has new
features it has new functions with the
growth of embedded processors and
network devices mobile devices products
that have some sort of software
component it's a lot easier to find
yourself in a situation when you're
developing not just a standalone device
that you're going to sell to your
customers but something that's more like
a platform tivo is a great example of
this as well if you you know a VCR which
probably there's not too many of those
anymore a DVD player perhaps compared to
a TiVo the tivo you bought two years ago
is not the same tebow that sits in your
living room today because there's been
software updates over time and just even
things like physical prototyping is a
lot easier 3d printing and a whole bunch
of other technologies make fairly
complex physical prototyping a lot
cheaper and a lot more accessible to
pretty much anybody that wants to pursue
that as a regular line of business we're
going to go to story time now because
this is a story about clear rx which
kind of illustrates a couple of these a
couple points in 1999 Deb Adler was a
graduate student at the School of Visual
Arts in New York City she was looking
for a topic for a thesis project when
she heard about an accident in her
family her grandmother had by accident
taken her grandfather's medication
looking into their medicine cabinet she
wasn't surprised at all by the error
they had the same medication but at
different doses their bottles looked
identical except for the first name
printed on the side of the bottle she
did some deep research on the problem
and discovered that sixty percent of
Americans don't take their medication
properly at home Deborah uncovered many
frightening stories of people miss
reading or missing critical information
on their pill bottles and dying because
of it one man died because he thought
the bottle said take every morning when
in fact had said take every Monday so
what wasn't obvious to others became
obvious to her the design of the pill
bottle was a serious problem
further inspection showed that the
problem wasn't just a graphic design
problem or an industrial design problem
but a systemic problem the pharmacy the
pharmacists and computer systems all had
to be involved in a proper solution so
in school should create a detailed
prototypes of the solution then after
graduation Deborah went to work with
Milton Glaser gave her the confidence to
take the idea to target while state
regulators could have helped Deb slowly
implement the solution she knew a
national pharmacy could have much more
impact more quickly target saw the
promise of the new drug delivery system
embodied in the new pill bottle design
and took the risk to implement it target
saw fit between the superior and safer
design for drug delivery and realized
how well it fit within their stores
their brand and their sense of how
design can add value the final design
included a clear visual hierarchy of
information a flat front for easy to
read labels a different colored ring for
each member of the family and numerous
other improvements here's Deb talking
about the huge collaborative and
systemic effort it took to implement
what target called the clear rx system
it was an enormous undertaking and I
should stress that I did not work in a
tunnel at all it was a huge
collaborative effort i worked with
pharmacy team pharmacy operations the
target technology team to build the
software to accommodate the new labeling
system the marketing team there are
major training sessions to train all the
pharmacists on how to use this new
system because there are the most
important people best they were the
frontline they had to explain how to use
this new system and they had to learn
how to use it there was a bit of a
learning curve involved targets drug
sales increased by an estimated
14-percent the first year after the
debut of the clear rx system people
regularly drive out of their way to get
to target to use the clear RX drug
delivery system business magazines and
network news have covered the solution
and the Surgeon General has thanked her
and target for their contribution to the
health of all Americans
okay shut that up um so but what I love
about that example that was a little bit
long but it illustrates so many things
one is this is a really complex system I
mean the idea on one hand is really
simple but to actually implement it
there was a lot of different pieces that
had to be touched it is not the kind of
thing that a group of people in the room
could have sat down at the very
beginning and figured it out and if
nothing else when you hear talk about it
she had to go to each individual state
and each individual state has all these
complex labeling regulations that you
have to follow that are all different
prototypes really important to this kind
of an iterative approach to get there
and and a real emphasis on collaboration
across internal boundaries on this is
the environment in which we're trying to
deliver products to it to our customers
so one thing you can ask yourself once
again is what are you doing the harness
change your you're in an environment
that's complex if there's probably
changes over the life cycle of your
product what are you doing explicitly to
be able to respond to that change and
really use it to your advantage thanks
so last point engaging in design and
activity I think this is one of the key
aspects that can help for example that
iteration the ability to be nimble the
ability to think of things from a
customer's world and understand them
much deeper and this is actually my
favorite section to present so we're
going to talk about design as a way to
to accommodate all that and really bring
it in as part of an organization's real
competency of what it does well and what
does it take so there's five ways to
think of design that that we have come
up with one is design aesthetics it's
that very superficial layer at the end
of the the experience that people have
don't really like that one although it's
partly true design as a distinct role
it's that guy down the hall with spiky
hair great shoes that no one likes to
work with because he's a prima donna
don't like that definition design is a
thing so it's it's the result it's what
you have at the end but i think that
ignores all the work up to date is
necessary to produce that
a result and then finally design is a
rock star there's certainly been a lot
of press lately on the power of design
and design thinking and puts it a level
I think that's a bit beyond what
everyday people want to engage with
within an organization I'm not really
happy with that definition either so of
course I'm going to come up with my
personal definition I like which is
designed as an activity something that
anyone can engage and the idea of
looking at a set of components thinking
about how you can arrange them in an
elegant way that can create more value
than they had independently that's
something anybody can engage in that's
something anyone can do you may not have
the design you know finishing skills to
create the aesthetics but we all have
the experiences we all have the the
ability to go out and see people in the
world and have empathy in generate good
solutions for them so I think of design
as an activity that an organization can
embrace everyone can get involved in no
matter what their background is that we
can all work on iterating on new ideas
and pushing it further and further
forward so design is an activity
actually in the book we cover three
different ways that you can think of
about a competency within an
organization building a competency in
design ideas sort of a designs an idea
fabricator testing them out vetting them
out very quickly trying to reframe you
know some of the uncertainty and how can
design be a part of coming up with that
but what I'm going to spend some time on
is one of my favorite which is the idea
at the long Wow creating a long while
customer experience so let's jump into
that this came from the experience of
going out into the world and seeing
people who were part of some loyalty
program and they really weren't turned
on to it we did this with a financial
services company they thought they had a
great customer where everyone had an ID
they were assigned to one of three you
know gold silver medallion sort of
levels and actually when I talk to
people they had no idea there in a
loyalty program they didn't know what
the benefits are and they really didn't
care they just wanted the great products
and services that they were trying to
pay for in the first place so this is
actually a real hard place to work in if
your knee-jerk reaction is hey we have a
loyalty problem with customers we're
gonna build a better relationship
with them let's just build a loyalty
program and have some loyalty cards
let's assign them IDs and put them on
different levels and and have them
behave as we want them to but it's a
crowded space there's lots of people who
are already doing this and interacting
with customers this way and in fact I
think of this quote from CMO of orbits
that if you want loyalty get a dog
because no one's just going to behave
loyalty loyal to you because they gave
them a card and some special status you
have to go a lot deeper to really form a
long-term relationship with people so
I'm going to turn to this sage advice
about loyalty it's sort of akin to what
we're talking about the grinch who say
Christmas isn't something you buy from a
store Christmas perhaps means a little
bit more I think loyalty is the same way
you can just replace replace Christmas
here with loyalty that loyalty isn't
just something you can assign to someone
or formalize a relationship over you
have to nurture that kind of
relationship if you really want people
to come back to you again and again so
what is meaning more mean so I'm going
to read my slide again meaning more
means creating notably great experiences
so true loyalty the kind that's not
fabricated evolves from evolved
naturally from the great experiences you
have with a company over time and over x
a real keyword how do you continuously
please people over the long time frame
so notably great experiences are
punctuated by moments of wow when people
are delighted by the products or
services when you're able to anticipate
their needs in unexpected ways and
pleasantly surprised them I can't tell
you how many conversations I've had
recently where people are like that
really wasn't expected from them and I
really loved it and you can probably
think back through your own experiences
if times where that has happened is made
a difference to you with an organization
whose done done something unexpected for
you so this isn't just random theory
this actually comes a little bit from
the world of science peak and rule which
was developed by Daniel Kinman who is a
Nobel scientist he actually run
when his ward for working I think risk
theory but this is another one of his
works imagine these are two different
experiences you're having with two
different organizations over time that
is the time is from left to right and is
the curve goes higher or lower that's
your experience getting better or worse
so if you want to say like how do people
think about their experiences you'd
usually go well let's just think about
the area underneath these curves when
they think about back to this experience
that's what they're having so these two
experiences might be relatively similar
in the total volume of the quality of
the experience you had with them but
actually in doing research they found
out that's not at all true how we think
about experiences when we think back to
an experience we remember the peak point
whatever was the strongest whether it be
a positive or even if it's a negative we
remember that and we remember where the
experience ended so on the bottom one
maybe even though it has the same area
underneath the curve the peak experience
might be much taller even though the two
experiences in depth the same and so
what we remember is an average of these
two so this has some interesting
questions for example it doesn't really
believe you to have an experience that
is continuously even across the entire
relationship you have with someone it
might make more sense to make sure you
have no negative experiences of course
because someone's going to remember
something that's sharply negative but it
also might make sense to pick points in
time where you can really stand out it's
something that your organization does
really well and better than anyone else
and deliver that as a WoW moment
something that maybe someone didn't
expect and went out of the wait for them
for you two to deliver so long Wow we
broke down into a few core things that
we saw people who are doing this really
well and people we worked with on these
kinds of problems had to put together to
create this this platform from
delivering wow moments so first is
knowing what your touch points are
managing that is a platform for delivery
so when you have a WoW moment you know
which parts of the touch points to bring
together to go here's what we're
delivering and here's how we're telling
you that it's great second is drop
drawing from a wide area of unmet needs
What's in on that
neither you can go back to again and
again and again and find new things like
ox oh good grips goes back again and
again to the world of cooking and the
need for simple things that are easy to
hold and easy to use and that's never
going to end for them they're going to
continuously find you thanks to develop
in that world evolved a repeatable
process look inside your organization
find what it does well and does well
repeatedly and integrate design
capabilities along with that so that you
can deliver these Wow moves again and
again and actually thinking through and
planning the WoW experience we're going
to talk about staging and how that's
done so planning out a while moment how
do you do it there's a lot of pipeline
thinking actually in terms of what are
we going to do now what are we going to
do later and further on a lot of times
there's that desire to have one big
release where you put throughout all the
features all at once and have a big
overwhelming experience but one of the
really interesting strategies is how can
we maybe paste things out over time so
individual customer can enjoy and
appreciate the different new experiences
that we're allowing for them over time
and as you can build that kind of
relationship where they start to expect
enjoy these kinds of moments of surprise
from you so David presented these two
different pedometers one that's going to
be the same one every time you use it
but another one that's going to unfold
in new experiences over time so let's
dive into that a little bit the nike+
pedometer no interface on the actual
device but when you get home and you
sync it up with your computer all sorts
of interesting things happen so suddenly
able to visualize your run and see where
you slowed and where your pace got
faster and this is something that's
never possible for is something that
that old pedometer could certainly not
do and this is features that they rolled
out with the the product initially the
ability to look at your run over time
and then eventually they added the
ability to start mapping your run as
well to see what distances you want to
go for and plan out your route so that's
kind of cool and small wild moment in
terms of being able to synchronize your
tracking with the device and visualize
your run but then there's other cool
things so you're on run okay
and you're jogging through and based on
your chart you know you slow down a
certain point you start to feel winded
it's kind of tough so with one-touch you
just go God thing is this is actually
the number one downloaded power song
from the iTunes site so I don't know
what people are thinking they just need
to get the rocky on but power song
another little wow moment something that
other pop pedometer certainly can't do
but they've also built in other things
over time that have new abilities that
you just can't do any other way the idea
of collaborative running that you can
run somewhere in one geography you can
buddy up with other people who are
running you can compete or try to build
mileage together and we're collaborative
collaboratively whatever it happens to
be but certainly you're running buddy
doesn't have to be in the same space
anymore another interesting thing is
event run it runners love to go events
you feel very emotional along with other
people it's a great thrill usually had
to be in the right physical location but
now Mackey said hey actually that's not
such a big deal we can actually extend
and make network running events and so
they've added on these new kind of
features over time where for example you
don't have to be co-located to actually
take part in an altruistic pleasure of
running for a cause so the Nike solution
has all these little touch points that
they've introduced over time and through
those touch points they've been able to
stage and release new things the
customers aren't expecting over time and
have delightful little experiences all
along the way and they've even added on
you touch points like that's desktop
widget or Nike started producing a
sports fan that gives you a digital
readout that you can see while you're
running so all sorts of interesting
things can come out of this so that's
the long Wow the idea of having these
things together so that you can
continuously start to deliver those
little moments of wow as you're working
with customers into the big question
here
it's are you building a platform that
can actually create these wow moments
over the long time of your relationship
with a customer because I think that's
where true loyalty actually lies so the
goals we had writing this book were this
sounds a little bit like marketing speak
but but there's some authentic feeling
behind it to articulate a new approach
to creating products and services in an
uncertain world you know and address a
gaping hole and how companies serve
people this is something certainly we've
seen within within adaptive path that
there's actually a tremendous
opportunity here and so there was a
survey that was done I believe was done
last year right um actually is around
2003 ok done some time ago 362 firms
they asked them ninety-five percent say
they are all customer focused and of
course everybody says for customer focus
nobody's going to say we hate our
customers and I'm sure they all take
your complaints very seriously however
of these ninety-five percent eighty
percent say they deliver a superior
experience you actually get the feeling
that these these firms actually really
do believe that they deliver a superior
experience but then the survey went to
the actual customers and ask the
customers of the firms that that say
they deliver superior experience how
many of them actually deliver that
experience and can you guess at the
number its low close eight eight percent
so that's you know in one sense that's
kind of a scathing indictment of
companies understanding of the customers
but another hand it's actually a really
tremendous opportunity there that
there's a lot more that we can do in
terms of the products we create the
services that we provide to our
customers there's a lot more we can do
to actually match match our customers
needs to provide value and valuable
experiences to our customers so that's
it that's the book there's copies up
here which I believe are free for you
guys at this point so I'm stop by and
pick one up and I maybe we have a 75
seconds for questions
yeah yeah how do you quantify wow that's
that's an interesting problem i think
that the iterative approaches david was
talking through can help you actually
pilot and test whether things were
really unexpected or not i mean i think
you can pretty quickly tell from a real
customers reaction whether it was wow
that's really interesting or no it
wasn't bank of america was testing out
new ATM machines in my neighborhood and
so I went up tried out the the
depositing of checks where they show the
actual you you don't use an envelope you
just stick the check in it scans it
shows the image back to you on the
screen and says we think this check is
for you know fifty dollars because they
used OCR to read the value and all you
have to do is say yes great done the
woman who net was next to me was also
doing the same future functionality
using the the check deposit and she
actually went oh cool and started to get
bring me into to look at what was
happening and then she realized that
might not be a bad idea because it is
personal information but that was a
clear like you could you could evaluate
that and go okay that wild her it was it
was unexpected it was delightful and if
it's not doing those sorts of things
it's now a WoW moment could they have
scaled that back I think that's a tough
question I think that's a heart like
that was a single interaction with a
customer I think that's probably the the
unit of interest is a single interaction
you don't want to break it down finer
than that yeah I would actually say you
know that's where having a platform
rather than a specific kind of
feature-laden product is important if
you have a platform you can continue to
innovate you can innovate in the wrong
way to I mean Facebook obviously
released some features lately that were
less than optimal for for their
customers right but you can also
those kind of moments are really hard to
have in theory there there you can't ask
your customers sometimes what they want
you have to kind of deliver it and see
what the reaction is and I'm sure I you
know I've read a lot of descriptions of
features that never get me excited until
I actually use the feature and then you
say that really is cool sometimes it's
really hard to judge the WoW until you
actually see it in in real life well
moments aren't always hard to achieve I
got a mail from ing the other day where
they had the privacy statement written
in plain English in about three
paragraphs it's like cool I like to work
with you because I actually understand
what your privacy stance is that's cool
didn't take much some good copywriting
in just a sense of what might be
important to people cool well thank you
