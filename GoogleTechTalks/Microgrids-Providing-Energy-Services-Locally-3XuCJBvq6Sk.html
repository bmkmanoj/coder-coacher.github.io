and our speaker today is dr. Chris
marnay from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
who's going to speak about micro grids
and local energy generation and I will
turn it over to him thank you okay
thanks first and then thank you for
inviting me here to Google it's pretty
exciting and an honor to be here I'm
going to talk about micro grids today
I'm a shameless microgrids promoter so
if you want fair and balanced go to Fox
News you're in the wrong place I'm
definitely going to give you the the Pro
micro grids story here I've got a lot of
slides far more than we can get through
in an hour so I'm gonna go pretty fast
here I'll try and keep a few minutes at
the end for questions but feel free to
blurt them out if you have any questions
as we go as I said I'll go very fast the
second part of the talk here we'll be
talking about some of the sort of
philosophical basis for micro grids and
particularly the notion of heterogeneous
power quality and reliability I'm
assuming that power quality and
reliability is going to be the most
interesting aspect to this particular
audience and so I'll go pretty slowly
through this part here don't get
discouraged I'll speed up after that but
before I get into that I'm going to just
give you a definition of what a micro
grid is and show you a few pictures of
my favorite demonstration which is one
in Sendai Japan and then I'll talk about
our own work which is related to this
tall distributed energy resources
customer adoption model and talk about
various applications of that model but
particularly results that came out of a
recent study we did called the certs
micro grid business case the certs micro
grid certs is consortium for electric
reliability technology solutions and
it's a resource research consortium
that's managed out of the Berkeley Lab
but involves a lot of other camp
campuses and other research
establishment in the micro grids area
particularly important is the University
of Wisconsin so certs micro grid is a
particular micro grid paradigm that
we've developed through this Pro
so if I talk about cm or certs microgrid
it just means one particular micro grid
technology and in this business case
work that I'm going to report here we
were particularly interested in the
business opportunities for that
particular technology and it's being
marketed by a company called T Co gen
which is in Massachusetts and it's
embodied in a product they have the CM
100 which refers to a 100 kilowatt
generator with certs micro grid
technologies so a CM 100 if I use that
term it just means a 100 kilowatt
generator with certs capability and now
just go through various other results
from that and as time allows here I'll
talk about some other micro grid
examples give you more details on the
certs micro grid paradigm and talk about
a very interesting demonstration that
was done in Uganda which very interested
in remote application okay
so first of all everybody in my business
has got to have a favorite outage or
blackout a story so here's my favorite
took place in Tokyo 14th of August 2006
and the reason that it's my favorite is
somewhat malicious because I've worked a
lot in Japan and this was shortly after
I'd left the country and I was really
tiring of Japanese power engineers
telling me how great their system was
and they didn't need micro grids or
local generation thank you very much and
so it was just very satisfying that they
had a major outage short shortly after I
left it started east of downtown Tokyo
and a barge on a canal there brought
down to power lines so this graphic here
is really telling because it shows you
classic utility thinking which is n
minus-1 planning meaning the system has
to survive the failure of any one major
element in the system and fortunately
this barge had the very bad manners to
bring down two lines which were actually
on the same towers here and so resulted
in a several hour blackout in Tokyo I'm
sure everybody here realizes that it's
one of the most complex transportation
systems on the planet and all
electrically powered there just aren't
enough buses taxis or feet to get
everybody home from Tokyo so it was
complete chaos mostly caused by failure
the transportation system
linemen worked heroically and power was
restored okay so moving right on what's
my definition of a micro grid control
grouping of energy and when you're
talking about micro grid you're always
talking you're usually talking about an
energy system that involves some energy
conversion to electricity sources and
syncs connected to the macro grid and
I'm using this jargon macro grid to
describe the traditional grid that we're
all familiar with large Central Station
remote sources long-distance
transmission and then radial
distribution to households and so on but
can function independently of it and as
you can see by the coloring they're
controlled is the key distinguishing
feature of a micro grid as opposed to
other kinds of local generation or
backup generation or so on the key issue
here is control that there's some ways
there are some capability that makes
this grouping semi autonomous from the
grid
so people have talked about many kinds
of benefits of micro grids a key one is
related to combined heat and power
opportunities if you can generate power
closer to the load using thermal
generation and use the waste heat rather
than sending it up a cooling tower or
into a river or whatever you can
obviously increase overall efficiency
lower carbon footprint heterogeneous
power quality I'll move right on here
because I'm going to talk a lot about
that today and this third bullet there
sort of the philosophical point which is
if we had more centralized
decision-making in a local sense but
decentralized in a macro sense namely
one grouping or one decision-maker is
actually choosing the sources of energy
the sources of fuel the kinds of end use
equipment etc we might get some better
decision-making in terms of trade-offs
between efficiency renewable
opportunities and so on and then many
other benefits that have been mentioned
and I won't go into right here these two
that are in in purple here protecting
the grid and load leveling or a
different color because in Japan I've
noticed they have a somewhat different
philosophy and rather than the
philosophy which I just described which
is one where we believe that some kind
of local decision-making may give us
better outcomes in Japan they tend to
think much more about micro
as a way in which you could connect
renewables and other grid hostile
sources would have some kind of a buffer
between them and the traditional grid
and they're very interested in load
leveling for the same reason it's very
beneficial to traditional utility
systems ok so here's this example it's
in Sendai Japan it's on two sides of a
street and on one side is a college
campus this is the Tohoku for Kushi
University Tohoku is the prefecture and
Fukushima is welfare and this is a
campus where they train caregivers
particularly for geriatric care so
there's some Hospital facilities and so
on on this campus which is a classic
sensitive load situation on the other
side of the road are some city buildings
which is a high school and water
treatment plan so in the on the campus
side of the street they install this
energy center and you know micro grid
can be a grouping of sources like this
it could also be dispersed as I said its
characteristic is control not really
location this is their official picture
in which you can see the Sakura the
cherry blossoms so this is their
official promotional picture they're
very proud of the fact that waste heat
from a lot of this equipment means that
the cherry blossoms actually come out
slightly earlier at this site than
elsewhere in Sendai was very important
in Japan this less pretty but more
informative picture shows you what they
actually have there there's various
kinds of dynamic voltage regulation and
other power conditioning there's some
small-scale gas-fired generation
obviously a lot of PV and a fuel cell
here this is a fuel cell energy molten
carbonate fuel cell and yeah us one but
what's most interesting at this
particular site is this building here
which is all DC and what does that mean
in this schematic you can see the way
that they have wired this particular
micro grid so coming back to
heterogeneous power quality starting at
the bottom here you can see they have
various circuits supplying these two
facilities the campus and the city
buildings providing different qualities
of power so power getting to the loads
here really is actually different and
they have just some
it's normally getting just getting
normal grid quality power some with grid
quality power bit with some sort of
enhancement some are getting DC and this
is really shows where that building is
which is all DC one way that you can
control power quality very carefully is
to go through a DC bus and then either
supply DC which is much more robust than
AC or condition the power back to AC
afterwards and then you've got very
heightened strong control over the
quality of the power so here they're
providing DC to some loads mostly in
that building but then they're also
supplying AC to other loads and then
Xavier you can see where the various
sources are the engines the fuel cell PV
directly DC connected so here's a few
more pictures this is one of the gas
engines only in Japan too oily engines
sit in clean white buildings that are
actually spotless and must be cleaned
hourly this is inside that DC building
these are some of my colleagues clowning
around here but everything in this
building is actually DC including the
fans lighting and so on this is very
interesting from a regulatory point of
view we're on the campus side of the
street here the school and the and the
water treatment plant are over here and
just here in the road you can actually
see the trench where the feeder was put
in across the road so anybody that's
familiar with utility regulation would
realize that if you're crossing a public
thoroughfare like this that makes you a
utility and ordinarily subject to public
utility regulation in this particular
instance the city was involved and they
were able to get around some of the
complications that that would have
caused that's the school you can see the
water treatment there in the background
okay so moving onto this philosophical
part where I said I would
dollie somewhat so this is the my
representation of the history of the of
the power system as we know it today
obviously time here on the x-axis and
then some sort of indicator of power
quality and reliability here on the
y-axis well power quality is very
multifaceted and we don't have much data
on it anyway most of the information we
have on power quality is pretty
localized people only really look at it
where they're very worried about it so
here I'm just showing a veil
ability of power in terms of nines so
and I've also translated that into
expected time of outage duration for a
year so one nine would mean your power's
out for about a month a year obviously
and so on for data center applications
and so on we're probably looking for
power quality up in this kind of range
so you can see the expected outage
durations here get infinitesimally
milliseconds per year so historically in
the early days of the industry systems
were isolated from one another obviously
equipment was very poor so you had very
poor reliability and what characterized
the big broad history of the industry
has been interconnection over wider and
wider regions obviously slowly improving
equipment and methods and so on so power
quality and reliability slowly increased
but it has tailed off or at least
leveled off since the 1960s and we may
actually be starting to see some
deterioration and if not actual
deterioration certainly a lot of concern
about him during the 1970s when we had
the Northeast blackouts then there was
some sort of return to a dispersed
outlook because backup generation was
required at certain kinds of facilities
particularly hospitals and so on so
where do we go from here
well a traditional kind of answer is
what I call super grids here which is if
we want to get to much higher power
quality and reliability we need to go
through a whole new technological
revolution here and improve everything
from beginning to end
better power plants better transmission
better distribution etc etc although
most of the problems really happen in
distribution most of the failures tend
to be fairly localized weather truck its
power pole etc etc so the main
technological breakthrough really needs
to be in local distribution but
nonetheless this view is we've got to do
better across the board so you know why
do I not believe that I mean I just do
not find this a credible scenario and
this is just my laundry list of
complaints here one is it does nothing
about this heat loss problem from
centralized generation which we really
have to do something about because of
climate change there
the kinds of environmental constraints
water sources being a key one some are
they you may know during the during the
drought that happened in France about
five years ago they did actually have to
curtail some of their nuclear I put
because there simply wasn't enough
cooling water available infrastructure
inter dependency and this is a really
key one which is the more reliable the
power system has become increasingly we
make all our other infrastructures
designed around the assumption that
power will always be there with some
catastrophic consequences occasionally
as I showed you in the Tokyo example but
telephone communications systems that
require on power depend on perfect power
transportation systems a sewage
treatment etc etc the big problem here
is that power outage power outage per se
is not necessarily a problem but all the
infrastructure that depends on it can
have failing has catastrophic
consequences increasing reliability is
pretty costly I'll come back to that
even if you're a big believer in the
centralized system we're reaching a
point now whether it's we're expanding
it further is subject to a lot of
restrictions difficulty siting new plant
difficulty siting transmission lines etc
fundamentally the whole system is
insecure if you study any military
strategy you'll know when you're
invading in a country the first thing
you do is take down the power system
because it's massively disruptive and
very easy to pull off you know common
method is just to throw big balls of
wire wool from aircraft and grind out
the lines and the system is designed to
shut itself down so everything's working
in your favor but sort of the key issue
here is here which is that to the extent
that we're it's some kind of a turning
point now we're facing some conflicting
critical policy objectives that are
really antithetical to having a much
more reliable power system one is
related to the desire to have a much
more competitive system particularly
competitive wholesale markets which
means essentially stressing equipment
much more having very volatile markets
company failures and so on and so forth
all of this tends to work against an a
reliable grid the other big one here is
the connection of intermittent
renewables and I already mentioned this
with respect to Japan but a lot of the
new sources that we really want to see
penetrating our energy supply in in big
numbers are fairly grid hostile and
large-scale intermittent renewables are
the classic example and then we face low
growth so by and large this is not an
either/or proposition because
electricity loads tend to always grow in
the US over the current quarter century
it's about a 50% increase in the total
electricity consumption so everywhere we
have a plant now we need one and a half
of all the transmission capacities got
to be increased by 50% etc one of the
big unknowns for us in the developed
countries is to the extent to which
transportation might be electrified
which could be the source of another big
spurt in load growth okay so here's the
vision that I like a lot better can't
change history so let's just say we're
starting off somewhere here but in terms
of trying to improve power quality and
reliability locally rather than sticking
to this centralized paradigm let's try
to do it in a much more decentralized
way as I already mentioned most of the
problems tend to be fairly localized in
terms of power quality and reliability
so a lot of new technology is definitely
applicable in the distribution system
and maybe embedding some generation
locally to the loads also makes a lot of
sense there's but two very common
definitions of micro grid the one I'm
sort of using here is a customer-focused
one so you can think of it as something
like a traditional customer something
going on downstream of a meter another
very common use of the term is to have
segments of the traditional grid that
can continue to function and serve load
even if the high voltage grid the mesh
grid fails and that's very often called
embedded generation so these are in fact
very good ideas because as I said most
of the problems tend to be in
distribution but then up here much
closer to load you get
the kind of micro grid that I'm talking
about which is closer to load can we
serve the requirements of the load in
ways much closer to their actual
requirements and in ways that are free
the centralized grid to some extent so
that we can meet some of the other
policy objectives that I mentioned ok so
moving on to the issue of the Universal
Service quality so right now we're
completely under this tyranny of
Universal power quality and reliability
which you know day to day not a tyranny
that you probably think a lot about but
universally over huge regions the
quality of power that reaches every
socket in every house and in every
office is in theory exactly the same
quality of power it's a totally
socialized system we have no choice
really in the quality of power at least
very limited you know to some extent you
may be able to select an interrupt Abul
tariff if you're a large industrial
customer or something like that but by
and large we have Universal power
quality and reliability and we have very
little say and from a public policy
point of view there's been very little
analysis of how we set those standards
and that's what I'm talking about here
how would you set that standard for
universal power quality and reliability
which even in a dispersed system you
still have to have at the high voltage
level so this graph shows reliability on
the x-axis in a similar kind of log you
know in a similar shown by a similar
variable on a semi-log stale very poor
reliability in the world today might be
ninety percent availability us we're out
in this range three to four nines
perfection would be out here obviously
at a hundred percent so obviously
there's a cost of having unreliability
and I'm you know Google's completely
aware of this if you're functioning in a
country like India then you've got to be
very sure that you have your own power
supply backup fuel etc and that pervades
the whole economy there so obviously
that provides very high costs as the
grid power becomes more and more
reliable societally that cost is lower
and lower and eventually could be you
know could be zero at some point if we
had absolutely perfect power I tend to
draw it falling off a little bit over
here
in countries like Singapore Japan and so
on which have very very reliable power
systems it is true that they're
investing less in backup equipment and
so on so you know this would start to
tail off but then there's a cost of
supplying reliability so we don't know
much about what this looks like and I'll
just make two points about what this
cost curve looks like number one is we
can't be perfect so we now we're out
here at some asymptotic point so we're
at a very dangerous area of this curve
right now if we want to push PQR further
and further to the right the second
point is that the cost here really have
two parts to them there's a visible part
and an invisible part the visible part
is something we know a bit about which
is the added cost of actually physically
making the grid more reliable so if you
underground wires it becomes much more
reliable but it's more expensive than
having overhead wires obviously you can
have more redundancy you can have better
quality equipment etc etc and we're not
very familiar with those costs and we
don't think much about them but at least
they're visible and we can tell the
invisible part is conservatism we'd run
the grid very very conservatively
because we want very very high power
quality and reliability so the more
conservatively we run the grid it means
we get lower utilization of equipment it
means that potentially beneficial trades
and movements of energy through the grid
is foregone and so we end up with a less
performance from the grid and we'd like
to have so everybody here is taken one
economics class so whenever you see two
nice curves like that you add them up
which is the blue curve and then
obviously the societal minimum cost
point is where you'd like to be from a
public policy point of view and to try
and be as provocative as possible I've
drawn it with lower power quality and
reliability than we have in the u.s.
today so what about micro grids small
scale generation and so on what's the
effect here
well basically it means that this purple
curve the cost of having an unreliable
system is diminished because if you have
your own local power supply system then
while you let's dependent on the grid
you can live with a lower performing
grid so it lowers this curve
you know sure enough that means that you
know from a societal point of view the
optimal performance of the centralized
grid could therefore be lower so key
point here to note is from a public
policy point of view the big benefit of
micro grids and decentralized generation
may not necessarily be the benefits that
it provides to the members of the micro
grid it might be that it frees up the
centralized grid to be much less costly
and and so on than it is now yeah
sorry I didn't completely catch you can
you try again yeah so the question is
what's the most unreliable component in
the supply chain and it is the local
distribution network so it's the it's
the power poles on your Street because
they get turned shot down by fire and
bad weather and trucks hit them and
transformers burn and so on in the US
about 90% of the total outages it's the
result of some kind of distribution
failure okay moving on so that's the one
last point here from a public policy
point of view the only number we ever
pay any attention to is this one which
is basically you know what's the cost of
the level of reliability that we have
today and this number right here you
know in most estimates comes out between
about 80 and 120 billion a year for the
u.s. okay so this is thinking a bit more
about heterogeneity at the end-use level
this is just my own personal view of
this and it's inspired by the food
pyramid and the food pyramid tells you
that all the stuff that you don't want
to eat you should have lots of and it's
down here at the bottom and the nasty
stuff you'd really like to eat is all up
here at the top and you should restrict
it and you can think about power in the
same way which is there are some very
very high value-added loads data centers
classic example right that you'd like to
keep fairly small overall and that's a
very strong argument for providing that
very high quality service locally so
that the quality of service that
everybody else gets down here is much
lower a classic example of a very low
quality of service is water pumping
because it can be rescheduled it's just
a simple engine you can actually pump
the water up the hill at one time and
let it come back down at another and get
the energy back and so on so you might
even think of it as being being negative
but the key points here really are just
two one is we don't segregate the loads
at all as I said we suffer under the
tyranny of providing the same
power quality to all the loads
irrespective of what they require and
from an economic point of view we just
know you're not going to get a very good
outcome that way and secondly if we were
being smart we would push as many of the
loads as we can down to the bottom here
which means not only segregating the
loads as I've got them described here it
also could potentially mean supplying a
different quality of power to different
parts of a device or different parts of
a building very often in industrial
applications where they think they have
a very sensitive load it could well be
that it's just something in volatile
memory it's keeping a chemical from
congealing something like that that
really suffers if power is lost and a
lot of the process and certainly a lot
of the other loads in the facility could
be sacrificed ok so that's it on the
philosophical part and I'm going to
really speed up now and I'm going to
talk next about some of our own work
mostly related to this distributed
energy resources customer adoption model
order camp so this is the basis of Dirk
ham this is a Sankey diagram that shows
the flow of energies in a building over
here at the right hand side you have the
end-use requirements that we're trying
to meet electricity only obviously we
all know lighting computing and so on in
that category cooling applications
building heating hot water domestic hot
water and then there's some loads for
which you know you'd really could only
supply with some kind of liquid or
gaseous fuel typically cooking some
other kind of processes
so the key philosophical point with Dirk
ham is that to try and start with these
end uses here to try and think about
what we're actually trying to achieve in
the building what are the services that
we need to deliver and then work
backwards from the services to try and
figure out how we supply them in the
best way well very often the best way is
some sort of passive means right we make
the building shell better etc so passive
measures are obviously one of the key
ways - one of the key early things to
think about in terms of supplying
building energy services and you can
think about passive measures in a way as
lowering the requirements for the active
systems in a building so if we have a
better building envelope we
less heating if we daylight the building
to some extent we need less electrical
lighting and so on and then over here on
the left is all the sort of traditional
energy supply systems that were
relatively familiar with buying
commercial fuels maybe using some other
non-commercial local opportunities like
PV from the top of this building for
example solar thermal supplying
electricity directly maybe storing in it
and using it lately maybe generating
power on-site recovering some of the
waste heat
maybe storing that heat then supplying
the heat later etc so there's two two
parts of this to solving this problem
that are particularly complex one is
cooling and there's a number of reasons
for that one is there's multiple
technologies for supplying cooling needs
in buildings and they're very different
from one another another is that cooling
is a particularly expensive load because
it occurs on peak so it's supplied by
expensive power and so minimum
minimizing the use of that on peak power
is particularly important a third one
which really speaks very directly to the
approach we're using here is there's a
simultaneous effect where all of the
electrical systems in the building are
designed around the peak load and the
peak load is going to be driven by
cooling so if you drive down the cooling
load then it means a downsizing of all
the other building systems so what we're
trying to do here speaks very much to
that kind of issue which want to solve
this whole system in one stroke so we're
abstracting from lots of engineering
detail but we're trying to solve this
systemic lis so we get a picture of how
do we supply these building energy
services at minimum cost at minimum
carbon footprint whatever the objective
is but the key point is to solve this
all systemically and to take care of
those simul t simultaneous effects the
second thing I was going to note was a
big uncertainty year as I already
mentioned was related to vehicles which
could be a load at some time when
they're being charged they could be a
source of energy under some
circumstances if it's a hydrogen vehicle
and they certainly could provide some
storage to a building if a vehicle with
a lot of batteries which temporarily can
did to a building okay this just shows
you the data flow in der cam basically
we have hourly information on those
energy services a lot of background
information on the status of the market
and what's very very important it turns
out is actually utility tariffs and the
structure of the tariffs and then down
here in the bottom left an arbitrary
menu of different technologies for all
kinds of different points in that Sankey
diagram from which we can pick to meet
the requirements of the building and to
pick the optimal choice of Technology
and what drops out of the solution here
since it's a pure optimization is also
an optimal operating schedule for all
that equipment and in various other
outputs in terms of emissions and so on
so I'm not going to go through the
technical details here and I think I
would just move right on it's a mixed
integer linear program written in this
gams environment mostly we look at
buildings from size from a few hundred
kilowatts to a few megawatts so this
building would be a great example so now
I'm moving on to showing you the results
from this business case study that we
did and I mentioned we're particularly
interested in one technology here which
is a reciprocating engine that has the
certs micro grid technology the cm100
and I'm going to show you two key
examples one was a Silicon Valley data
center and another one is a nursing home
in Oakland so to sort of very typical
applications so the goal here was to
look at the added value that the cm100
would provide in terms of recovered he
power quality were also adding some
various kinds of storage here this
engine has a 100 kilowatt peak load but
he can surge to 125 so this is a summary
of that kind of equipment so in this
particular analysis it's a very short
menu of different kinds of equipment
that we're choosing amongst so that's a
key thing to note here on sort of
traditional supply sides we just have
two one is that engine and the other is
a 200 kilowatt phosphoric acid fuel cell
and there's a key distinction here
technically between the
different kinds of equipment the ones
that you have to treat as discreet
alternative so you can only walk by one
engine or two engines or three engines
in integer values and those where you
have a bit of variability in terms of
the sizing of the system and all these
other technologies that we have
available in this particular example
including PV we're all treating as
continuous variables the reason this is
so important is it's much easier to
solve for continuous variables so in
terms of the computation you need you
want as few of these as possible on as
many as these down here there was some
discussion earlier over lunch about flow
batteries and we did a flow batteries in
this particular case but they were much
too expensive they never got into the
solution basically what gets into the
solution here are the engines PV solar
thermal absorption chillers for anybody
doesn't know an absorption chiller is a
device that's able to cool a building
using waste heat it's a chemical process
of cooling rather than a compression
compression process for the familiar air
conditioner thermal storage lead acid
batteries these are the tariffs I'm not
going to go through this in detail but I
did mention a very very key dry key
driver of the results is always the
tariff it can make a huge difference and
part of the motivation for this study
was to compare California where we have
a pretty stiff demand charge compared to
New York where they have time-of-use
rates meaning different times prices a
day during the day and at night but they
don't have a demand charge and for
anybody that doesn't know a demand
charge means in any one month the peak
kilowatts that's recorded so the peak
power use of your recorded on your meter
during the month gets charged at this
rate of fifteen dollars per kilowatt per
month so this is a key motivator to
lower the peak load in the building and
it's very important in terms of on peak
on-site power because if you self
generate your power with PV or any other
kind of generation it lowers the energy
component of your bill and therefore
this demand component gets to be more
and more important and that's another
example of kind of a simultaneous Immelt
aeneas problem if you want to find the
optimal
of the PV system you've got to take that
into account that as you start to
displace your electricity purchases then
this is because the demand charge is
going to becoming a more important part
of your bill so in the nursing home this
particular site it had an annual energy
bill it's on a standard PG&amp;amp;E tariff like
you just saw about a million dollars a
year the optimal investment here which
was just a pure minimum cost with no
subsidy analysis was three of the cm100
kilowatt engines a 48 kilowatt chiller
and this means 48 kilowatts in terms of
displaced electricity use means it
displaces a 48 kilowatt electrical load
for a compression chiller quite a lot of
solar thermal collection and this is a
pretty common result we get that solar
thermal addition support or ancillary
solar thermal supply to heat driven
cooling is actually turns out to be a
pretty attractive technology and that's
something we don't very often see in the
field cost savings here we're not
exciting about 4 percent on cost and the
carbon footprint of the building was
down by about 13 percent and again these
are fairly typical results for a
straightforward system like this not
usually very compelling numbers overall
but I'm going to show you these
particular results this next example in
which we put a big subsidy on storage of
about a 70% write down and 60% on PV
this is not totally unrealistic on PV in
a California context but you know I
don't think we're ever going to see this
kind of subsidy on storage as a result
of that you've got a very big PV system
500 kilowatts you've got some thermal
storage 47 kilowatt hours and you got a
lot of batteries in this particular
example so about 2 megawatt hours of
battery and I'm also going to show you
various other ways other solution
objectives here so this is a key a slide
right here this shows you those hourly
results that fall out of the solution I
said there were three engines chosen so
that's about 300 kilowatts
on this particular day which is a
typical July weekday those engines
pretty much run flat out earlier in the
day
during the actual peak load of the
building you do use that surge
capability so great we got the right
answer there you know you you wouldn't
be seeing these results if we didn't get
the right answer this blue line shows
you what the electrical load of the
building would be if there were no on
site
so this is a very typical sort of load
shape for a building of this type in our
climate also note a lot of power is
still bought from the grid which is this
military green area here so even if you
have a lot of on-site generation even if
you have invested a lot of money in it
still pays to buy a lot from the grid
and in the PG&amp;amp;E service territory the
peak hours are noon to 18 and you can
see here from a solution as I said the
structure of the tariffs is really
critical and everything here is being
driven by the fact that 12 to 18 is
really expensive and so what happens is
a lot of grip power is purchased from
the grid off-peak the batteries are
charged during the morning hours during
the afternoon hours you do three things
number one you get power from the PV
number two you take that energy back out
of the batteries again and there's a
very key point here which is you very
often see simple-minded analyses that
would say if you have PV in a building
you're going to save that electricity
and use it off-peak wrong answer
completely wrong answer the storage and
the PV are in competition here because
the PV provides power during the day
time when it's valuable and that's great
but the batteries have access to this
cheap off-peak power so they're going to
try and displace PV from the solution
here and that's a very important outcome
to think about and then the third thing
that happens is the absorption cooling
here lowers the overall electrical
requirement and notice here a third very
important result which is the net effect
on the electrical load of the absorption
cooling looks like it's tiny it's just
this slither of sky blue here
appropriately at the top but remember
what I said that displaced energy is
really valuable
because you're lowering the peak load of
the building you're displacing expensive
on peak power and so on and getting the
size of that slither right is just
really a challenge here okay moving on
so a second way to think about the
objective for this building would be to
think about trying to lower its carbon
footprint or try to think about some
kind of a combination of lowering costs
and lowering its carbon footprint so
this graphic came out very poorly so I'm
gonna explain to you what it is it's two
curbs it's a blue curb and it's a red
curve here and these curves show you
trade-off between increasing the cost
and at the same time lowering the carbon
footprint of the building and I'm a big
believer that this is the most useful
information you can ever have because
you know knowing what the minimum carbon
footprint of a building without knowing
what the cost is going to be is not very
helpful and vice versa just knowing the
minimum cost and not knowing the
environmental consequences or not is not
very useful and really the decisions
that we need to make or how we sort of
move along this curve and how much it's
going to cost us so in this blue curve
it's just the same equipment choices
that I mentioned before and so out here
is where the building is now its carbon
footprint is oh sorry here is doing
nothing buying everything from the grid
the optimal solution that I just showed
you is something like this so it gets
down below about a thousand tons of
carbon per year and the costs are right
here as I told you at about a million
dollars if you went all the way up to
here which was a sixty percent weight on
carbon and a forty percent weight on
cost then cost should have gone up by
one hundred and fifty percent so this
negative is incorrect here cost should
have gone up by one hundred fifty
percent but the carbon footprint
dramatically down by a seventy two
percent so key point is any point on
this curve it's going to tell you what
it's cost you to get to a lower carbon
footprint the other red curve here is
very similar but in the red case we've
added a lot of demand response within
the building rather than just the list
of technologies that you saw and a key
thing to note about this kind of problem
is we know a lot about what the world
looks like out here what
minimum cost building would look like we
don't know much about what a minimum
carbon building would look like and so
as you move ad on this curve well you
really have to think about sort of the
technologies that you're making
available and considering and so on
and certainly I wouldn't I wouldn't
invest my retirement money what's left
of it in these kind of numbers out here
because we just don't know enough about
low carbon low carbon buildings and
particularly since I got the sign wrong
then that really would undermine your
confidence in my investment account ok
moving on so how many people here have
heard about zero net energy buildings a
smattering okay not many so zero net
energy building is very important to us
because it's sort of a semi-official
objective of federal building energy
efficiency research it's in it's in the
ice allegis Latian which requires the
building of zero net energy commercial
buildings by 2020 for 50 percent of
commercial buildings to be zero net
energy by 2030 and sorry for new
buildings by 2030 50 percent of
buildings by 2040 in all buildings by
2050 so in this particular approach
creating a zero net energy building is
actually pretty easy because we can just
add zero net energy as a constraint here
to the optimization but there's a lot of
other things that you have to worry
about one is you know what's the
exchange rate between energy that you
produce on-site maybe by PV or whatever
and you know energy that you purchase
from the grid and you know very often
one is heat and one is electricity you
know one is fuel when it's not so you
have to worry about all of those details
but I won't go into that in much detail
here but rerunning this case and making
it a zero net energy building
mase basically meaning it buys as much
energy as it feeds back into the grid
resulted in a very different kind of
system here so what happened was we got
a huge amount of heat storage we got a
lot more heat driven cooling we got a
huge PV system here huge PVC
and quite a lot of solar thermal
collection too so you know when you get
these kind of results then you have to
worry well does this make any rational
sense given the footprint of the
building and so on this building is very
big it's about 30,000 square meters and
we usually put a footprint constraint of
some kind in this particular instance we
said the footprint of all the solar and
everything couldn't exceed the floor
space of the building so you know in a
two-story building with a lot of parking
lots like this this might be believable
but this particular building is a
five-story building so that's definitely
pushing it a little bit and this
particular result ended up in a
footprint of about 26,000 square meters
so we were definitely getting close to
that limit so this is what the energy
balances start to look like when you get
to zero net energy so okay now you've
got a huge amount of PV generation
during the day and this curve shows that
you're selling to the grid there's some
demand response here and you only again
use it you're in mostly during the
daytime and evening hours and you'd
still purchase power from the grid but
only off-peak and then there's a much
bigger cooling offset in this particular
case and then the heat balance similar
stuff is going on here where you're
collecting heat from solar during the
day this black line shows that you're
charging heat storage and then during
night the night time to heat the
building you're recovering that heat
from the thermal storage and you could
see that the demand response now does
appear at night on the cooling on the
heating side so again we did get the
right answer that's great so just talk
briefly about this data center since
it's you know relevant to this
particular audience this is a very
ordinary data center in Sunnyvale
control room this particular company has
a lot of sites around the world these
were their different time zones they
were operating in they have backup
generation just standard diesel
generation and they have quite a lot of
flywheels at this particular site so
it's a three year old building pretty
small data center 600 square meters 1.8
mega watt peak 800 kilowatts of that is
the computing load pretty big cooling
low
here even though they do do some
economizer cooling and there are there's
some occupied space in this building too
it's on a standard PG&amp;amp;E tariff and in
terms of the carbon emissions I'm
assuming a carbon emission rate for PG&amp;amp;E
of 140 grams of carbon per kilowatt hour
so what we try reason I'm showing you
this example is it's a case we're
starting to think about power quality
and reliability really starts to make a
big difference well if you have on-site
generation and it means you can ride
through failures in the grid well that's
worth something but you know we just
don't have very good ways of valuing
that the way that we tend to value it
and I'm sure you're in the you know data
center business you're completely
familiar with this which is it's a kind
of visceral response you know we we
cannot go down no matter what and really
we don't have very good objective ways
of dealing with it so one way that you
can go about it within this approach is
to think about how much is it going to
cost you to get this service and then
you can think about whether that cost
sounds reasonable given the other costs
of the center so that's what we did in
this particular example so we assumed
that the cost of the certs micro grid
technology is about twenty-five dollars
a kilowatt in terms of power electronics
and you also need in this in this
technology a very fast switch that
allows you to disconnect from the grid
and create no kind of local disturbance
at all and that turns out to be a pretty
expensive piece of electronics and we're
assuming about $100 a kilowatt here and
then you have to think about on the
other side given the different resources
that you have how they're likely to
contribute should you need them in an
emergency an outage and so on I won't go
through the details here but I'll just
show you that obviously reciprocating
engines fuel cells are very attractive
from this perspective because we know a
lot about how they're likely to perform
as compared to you know will the Sun be
shining when you have a blackout you
know you don't know and that's for a lot
of technical reasons I won't go into
here the traditional methods that you
use for evaluating reliability and
centralized power systems are quite hard
to apply in micro grid
and so this curve shows you why I think
you know data centers are particularly
interesting in this particular example
this shows you the three different
buildings that we looked at here the
nursing home the school which I haven't
really talked about and the data center
these are those different technologies
that were available and this is the
change in install capacity when we did
the power quality and reliability case
versus the minimum cost case so these
are differences and so well you can see
in nothing happens with the nursing home
the school did install a few batteries
and lowered the size of its chiller but
look at the data center as soon as you
brought power quality into the picture
you got a radically different result and
in fact you get about 1600 kilowatts 1.6
megawatts of those cm100 engines so you
know here we found a great market for
this Hertz micro grid technology right
and note one other thing 1.6 megawatts
getting installed here so it's almost
the peak load of the building so far
more than you would ever need you know
on a day-to-day basis to supply this
building so this really shows that the
probability of availability of the
sources is actually getting taken into
account and this is what generation
looks like at that particular site you
go to all 1.6 megawatt in this
particular day you bet 1.2 megawatts of
it gets used big cooling offset but even
here with all that capacity in place
note you still buy a lot from the grid
still economic to buy from the grid
off-peak so I'm running out of time here
so I'll say a couple of words about the
certs micro grid technology and then
I'll I'll quit give a few minutes for
questions so I won't go through the
technical details of the certs micro
grid technology I'll just show you this
diagram which is a schematic of it so
this shows you grid power coming in here
here's that static switch that I
mentioned if grid power is too expensive
too bad equality or we have an actual
blackout this switch is going to open
and these two circuits here are going to
function independently so the certs
micro grid technology is one in which
the
generating sources are highly dispersed
throughout this facility and one of the
main reasons for that is where there's
waste heat the actual power generation
can be located where you have a heat
sink because very important point right
much easier to use the move electricity
around than it is to move heat around
and that's one of the big motivations
here for having a highly dispersed
approach and then the other part of the
search technology other than the static
switch is to have some smart power
electronics here so that these dispersed
devices can still function still provide
high quality power maintain the energy
balance and there's other issues too
which is you know you may have to
maintain some kind of environmental
restrictions or whatever so the nature
of the certs micro grid this switch
opens these circuits become isolated
because of the electronics here these
generators manage to meet the load
maintain energy balance and so on
effectively so you'd obviously want to
put all your sensitive loads here where
you've got the very high reliable power
you'd want to put some controllable
loads here too because that's going to
help you maintain the energy balance but
then all the other stuff you're going to
put on this sacrificial circuit down
here and if you have an unreliable
source fuel cell vehicle you know and
this guy often over sleeps you just want
to put that down here too and I'll just
show you this is a one more slide here
this is sort of the proof of the pudding
it was a test that was done at the
University of Wisconsin these are three
second traces where a big load was added
to a two generator certs micro-grid very
similar to the engines I described and
the proof of the pudding here is in the
wok is in the voltage which through this
disturbance was maintained very stable
you know other than a blackout some kind
of SAG in the voltage is the biggest
single problem so I'll just go quickly
through this this is a four wire 480
volt AC system and this is what those
cm100 engines look like and you might
think well it's pretty weird notion that
you're gonna have this kind of a hi-tech
system with a reciprocating engine it
just doesn't seem to quite add up it
adds up because these engines have a lot
of power electronics because
their ordinary vehicle and marine
engines but they're designed to function
in power applications with variable
speed and so they do have actually have
a lot of on-board electronics this is
what various parts of the site look like
and I'm gonna skip through this this is
a remote site in Uganda and I'll just
blue oh no I lost confidence there so
good great I am forced to stop
everybody's relieved
okay so you can't deny me at least the
opportunity to put the conclusions on
the board even if I don't have time to
go through them so key points are the
key technology change that's going on
here is the ability to have sort of semi
autonomous operation and the kind of
electronics that you saw there in the
certs micro grid and so on
and it creates this new idea here that
we can think about controlling power
quality locally and providing something
that's much more suitable to the loads I
showed you various kinds of examples
here one key point I didn't get into the
Uganda example but where there's a
non-existent legacy grid or at least
it's a very weak grid this kind of
technology really might mean that we
would develop in a different direction
and that's where sort of the cell phone
in Africa analogy comes into play
obviously in plenty of places they will
never ever have a land-based
communication system same way with a
grid our our model Derk am basically
technology neutral try tries to pick
optimal systems given the energy service
requirements in buildings some of the
applications we're starting to
increasingly look at power quality and
reliability multiple multiple objective
optimization Net Zero buildings etc and
you know we are making some efforts to
commercialize this technology several
different directions one of them is with
a large enterprise software company
they're trying to add this capability to
some of their enterprise software and I
will stop there and five minutes for
questions yeah
yeah it's a great question
it's a I said you don't see storage very
often or in buildings one of the places
you see it is you see a big diesel tank
with the backup generator right and so
that's one thought you know you got to
think about how much fuel you need
on-site and that does you can make that
a part of optimization we're not doing
it in this particular example but that
is something that not that difficult to
incorporate blackouts is very difficult
because in California you know typically
if you have a natural gas-fired
generation system which most of these
engines we're assuming would be you know
this doesn't sound great in California
right we have an earthquake you know do
you want to send depend on a generator
that's now using you know the natural
gas grid and that does create some real
sort of reliability issues that that's
not an area we've addressed but it's a
very sort of critical one to think about
go ahead
yes the question is what about the
difference between the opportunities
that you have in a retrofit situation
versus a Greenfield situation
yeah no it's it's a huge huge question
we mostly focused on retrofits and you
know very often we we assume something
like this building it's already got a
cooling system in place you know it's
already buying power from the grid etc
and you know you're gonna try and come
in and supplement that system somehow by
on-site generation by heat recovery by
various kinds of energy efficiency
investments but the reason that we
focused on that application really is
not a an analytic reason it's just a
practical one that most of the on-site
generation that you see that there is
actually a retrofit you know certainly
there are some you know model buildings
that you see being built now you know to
very high standards but that's pretty
rare most of the places where PV is
being installed or on-site generation
usually it's a retrofit and in fact you
know this building again a classic
example right all the PV was put on the
roof and various other energy efficiency
efforts have been made so we focused on
that kind of retrofit application but
that's just a practical matter and in
terms of gas-fired on-site generation
personally I only know of one Greenfield
installation at all and that's a kaiser
building near Sacramento so it's pretty
rare in new buildings and again you've
got a decision making issue here where
the person making the decisions about
how the building is built there's
usually not the one who's paying the
utility bill so you know unlikely to be
interested in a lot of these
opportunities yeah
cost you something to quit or matter
plus those losses
give me an 80% outward
yeah you're right with lead-acid
batteries there's all kinds of
constraints that you have to worry about
in this particular example we did in a
fairly simplistic way which is we limit
the depth of discharge to about 20
percent but this is an area that I think
is a you know prime area for future
research and you know we're discussing
this at lunch this is one of the areas
where I think there's going to be a lot
more federal research activity which is
improving batteries is one aspect of it
new chemistry's and so on finding
multiple uses for batteries is another
with transportation and building use but
another one in our area is related to
sort of the economic trade off between
trashing your batteries and actually
getting power when you really need it
you know if you're in this data center
visceral mode and I'm not gonna let my
system go down no matter what well you
may well trust the batteries you may
live with it
yeah so you know the question is just in
terms of day to day operation do we try
to trade off using the battery heavily
and cycling it a lot day to day versus
shortening the life of the battery and
the answer is no in this application we
didn't it certainly wouldn't be that
difficult to sort of have some kind of a
simple trade-off where you know or you
just made the life of the battery a
number of cycles versus a life in this
example we didn't in this example we
just had a limit on the depth of
discharge and we had a fixed life on the
battery as I said I think this is a very
rich area research Wow
two o'clock straight up I'll take one
more okay
yeah we have done nothing with selling
with selling heat and again this is a
pretty this is a promising area research
is to think about how you might cluster
building somehow to get that kind of
synergy you know there's many buildings
data centers again a great examples
right where there's way too much heat in
the data center could you collect that
heat and sell it to a neighbor or
somehow I mean I think thinking about
the way in which loads are clustered is
a pretty interesting area research in
terms of you know thinking about
recovering the waste heat from thermal
generation well yes you know and that's
sort of at the heart of what we do and
also as I mentioned solar thermal as an
auxilary source of heat is a stirrer
often very promising so if you install a
CHP system in a building you're likely
to run it during the day because
electricity is valuable during the day
but it often makes sense to also have
solar thermal and get some added
assistance in the in the absorption
cooling by using some thermal solar
thermal heat as well as the waste of
recovered wastage and that that we do
take care of here another area that
we're working on right now is to really
think much more carefully about
different qualities of heat temperatures
of ways you know exhaust heat recovery
versus jacket recovery and engines and
again you very quickly get to some
pretty complicated engineering and our
philosophy philosophy philosophy here is
to try and you know abstract from a lot
of the engineering complications just to
get this sort of global picture of what
an optimal system would look like and
then you could put it in the hands of
some people that actually would know how
to engineer it and start to consider
some of these much more practical issues
two minutes over time I have to stop now
