in-depth knowledge of the human soul I'd
like to welcome Miss villa doctor
let me welcome all of you yes
it's wonderful to be with you all this
afternoon and I would like to really
welcome you to participate interact and
to ask questions and absolutely benefit
from this session so first of all I'd
like to bow to each and every one of you
and my gratitude to all of you for being
here for creating your time and space in
your busy schedules to be around to
Google search on stress management and
beer
to look at stress men and management is
to look at life first we are all
actually in the process of realizing
that very frequently our lives
go through a kind of oscillation which
we are not able to manage it becomes
sometimes so inundated with pressures
and stresses that we feel that I wish I
had a technique I wish I had a quick fix
on it so that I could really manage
things better more effectively now there
is actually a technology that is
available and I say it is a technology
because it can be used as a very simple
tool for enhancing your nervous energy
and make that therefore effective so
that it could be used optimally to
realize your complete potential now if
you have to view ourselves as human
beings we have a mind a body and a soul
which is the normal perception and
paradigm within which stress management
takes you through but I'm trying to ask
you today to shift this paradigm for a
mile and to really look at ourselves in
terms of energy systems that we our
energy bodies and that within us is
located a powerful energy system which
lies in a dormant state and needs to be
awakened and this is the paradigm that I
want you to really look at today and
within this
rainwork we develop a technology which
scientifically helps you to make this
breakthrough in your levels of stress
management so let's look at it and try
and understand where we're coming from
and what we can really do to apply this
technology to ourselves so the first
part of it I will just take you through
the basics of our nervous system which
has this inbuilt understanding and then
we will actually do the process which is
the technique which you can use anytime
anyplace anywhere to truly empower
yourself and to let go the feeling of
stress and don't think I need to really
go through water stress and the
reactions to stress because I think we
are all too familiar with those aren't
we yes we all feel it we all experience
it all the time in our nervous system we
feel it in our bodies we feel it in our
emotional system and we react to it just
that stress levels differ and our
reactions to stress differ so right at
the very first stage when we are
stressed there is like an alarm that
buzzes for you and you realize that hey
I need to do something about it I am
undergoing some strong pressures so
that's the first stage of encountering
stress the alarm and I'm sure a number
of people have either moved through that
stage and advanced or are still at that
level then comes the point where we
start resisting stress and there is the
stage
of resistance where we go on you know
procrastinating trying to manage we get
a few symptoms because some of our organ
systems have already collapsed from time
to time a tension headache a
hypertension high blood pressure
sometimes your stomach gives way to
ulcers and respiratory tract problems
all those psychosomatic problems creep
up at the stage so that's the stage of
resistance and finally comes the stage
of breakdown there's a breakdown there
is a collapse because the stress levels
are at this point totally unmanageable
and as a result of that you encounter
chronic problems in your bio systems
your energy is of course weakened there
is a chronic problem any psychosomatic
problem even a cardiac problem a
respiratory problem a problem related to
sometimes brain damage and so on so
there are reactions to stress which move
in these three stages and psychosomatic
problems which crop up alongside now let
us look at the paradigm which I was
putting forth before you to encounter
these stages of stress and in fact no
matter at what point you are in the
movement towards handling stress you can
use this technique very effectively
because I found that this technique
works for very severe stress
as well and patients who've had chronic
problems like cancer card it blocks
diabetes all these problems have healed
because this is the process of
self-healing as well so to really look
at the technique first we need to look
at our subtle nervous system and how it
works for us to really become an energy
system can we look at the diagram yeah
yes our subtle system which is the
system which brings about the energy
ascent for you
which raises your energy levels is
composed of three channels the left
sympathetic the right sympathetic and
the central channel so energy flows
along these three channels it is your
nervous energy the neural impulses that
we are talking about so that is one
component of the system the second
component is a primordial energy which
is located at the base of the spine and
which in the classical terminology you
might have heard this term is called
Kundalini or the primordial energy now
this energy which is placed in the
triangular the inverted triangular
shaped bone which is your sacrum bone at
the base of the spine okay now this is
your powerhouse of energy and this
energy actually
is in a coiled format and three and a
half coils ape format it's almost like
an extension plug you've seen the
extension plug have you pull it out and
the energy flows and then you have to
connect it to the mains and the energy
circuit is then complete so it works out
that this energy in normal human beings
as I said is in a dormant state is in a
sleeping State and this energy then gets
to slowly move up along the spinal
column and it passes through the third
element of the subtle nervous system
which are the three which are the seven
important nerve centers these seven
nerve centers are called in the
classical terminology again chakras
chakras because the energy moves in a
circular pattern around those regions so
these are the seven important junctions
ones located in the perineum region
right at the base of the spine near the
rectum
that's your chakra number one the second
nerve center is located slightly below
the navel point about two and a half
inches below the navel point the third
one is directly in front of the navel
point the fourth one is the center heart
over here in the chest region and the
fifth one which is connected with your
communication is in the throat region
the forehead region the sixth one and
the seventh one is on top of the head in
this bone which is your soft bone called
the Fontana
Buon region okay you need not remember
everything except that these seven
important nerve centers are critical in
conducting energy and the energy from
the base of the spine that is from the
sacrum bone where it is positioned and
located slowly starts rising it starts
rising when systematically all the
blocks that are there at the nerve
centers open up now what happens is in
the process of life there is a lot of
you know I call it garbage which we
collect a lot of negative vibrations
which we collect and because of that
with the tensions and anxieties the
nerve centers begin to close down and as
they close down the nerve centers begin
to conduct less and less energy so we
need to really open up these nerve
centers and the process of really
opening up these no centers makes the
energy then slowly rise go along the
spinal column is the spinal cord and
then come up to the top of the head over
here in this soft bone region and when
the energy really comes up at this point
it's interesting to know that actually
in our skull
there is a very tiny opening and it is
through this opening that the energy
begins to flow out and then your
individual energy begins to flow out in
this manner
it connects with the universal energy
all around us and it is with this
connection which takes place that you
become a complete circuit and so the
universal energy gets connected to you
and everything then in the cosmic energy
system starts flowing through you and
you experience that oneness that peace
and that integration which is for a long
time missing and truly stress is
encountered when you as an individual
system get disconnected from this
universal energy and once that
connection is regenerated and attained
through the process which we are going
to do today
it transforms you completely because
this energy the universal energy it
nourishes you it nurtures you and pause
you and it creates for you a process of
realization of all the potentialities
which you are born with
so the gifts that you have the
creativity the problem-solving skills
the ability to communicate with people
share your knowledge the ability to also
be able to create new shifts and
paradigms in the world all these things
happen once your potentialities begin to
blossom and of course along with it your
psychosomatic problems which are related
to different organ systems in your body
all those also clear out so
it is a process that makes you attain
health makes you shift from the stress
that you encountering in life it
empowers you with a kind of mind space
and brain space and neural space which
is totally healthy and therefore it
leaves you free to really be productive
and function optimally in one's legs and
to experience therefore what is normally
the state that one enjoys as a human
being which is love for everybody peace
joy laughter and being spontaneous in
life see we lose these things as we
become more and more intellectual or
isolated in our works fears and those
qualities of life actually really lead
us to our happiness to a state of
well-being and to recreate that each day
for ourselves is through meditation now
I come to the understanding was what is
meditation
Steven very frequently we say oh please
don't disturb me I'm meditating and that
we say because we are thinking very
deeply about something but thinking
deeply about something is not meditation
that is truly the cognitive process the
thinking process again sometimes we say
oh please don't disturb me I'm
meditating
which means you focusing
all your attention on to one single
stimulus so you may be working very hard
and you focus all your energies on that
problem and you say I'm meditating but
let me tell you that that is also not
meditation so then what is meditation
what happens is when this energy the
primordial energy the Kundalini as I
called it starts rising and when it
crosses the sixth nerve center the sixth
nerve center which you can see in your
handout which is located in the forehead
region it is at this point that your
thoughts begin to dissolve thoughts
begin to clear out completely and your
consciousness reaches a state of zero
thoughts so there are no thoughts at all
and when there are no thoughts you know
that there is complete inner peace at
that point of time and so as I said from
this empty space that is the state of
pure consciousness and pure attention
and that is the state of meditation like
so
where there are no thoughts at all and
that state truly is empowering and
wonderful because that state creates a
connection of the energy the universal
energy then and allows that energy to
work out everything for you whether it
is health whether it is problem-solving
whether it is your ability to have very
fulfilling relationships with people or
also your ability to enjoy life itself
be productive so this is actually the
process that we're going to master today
the process is simple it takes about 15
to 20 minutes to do the process and
master it so that actually is a state of
meditation now suppose I tell you that
you know or you tell yourself I'm not
going to think at all
I'm not going to have any thoughts is
that possible at all no what will happen
immediately the moment you tell yourself
I'm not gonna have any thoughts more and
more thoughts will start coming to you
and so you cannot control thoughts is
the realization it is only spontaneously
when this energy is awakened and that
this energy then moves along the spinal
column to create that connection
and you are in this complete circuit
that the thoughts will leave you and
once the thoughts leave you all the
tension leaves you all the stresses
you and it gives the nervous system the
time to recover to regenerate and to
then really become effective so that's
the way meditation works in our energy
systems that's the basic that I would
like to leave you with it's very basic
since we have just about an R today to
realize this technique if you have any
questions later on about this you could
come and ask me or email or whatever
okay and we can interact and begin to
know this in greater depth so now from
the principles let's move to the
technique and see how we can actually
this in our life all right
are you understanding me am i clear yes
okay all right
is this something that you would like to
do I'm sure because you yeah you would
okay so let's begin then with the
process itself and master it it needs
repeated of course practice daily to
master it but I've made it very complete
for you so that you could practice it
daily and progress systematically now
what we really need to do is if you're
sitting on the chair the first thing we
need to do to earn ourselves is to
remove our slippers or shoes or socks or
whatever be wearing in our feet
all right the second thing is if you
could please have your cell phones off
so that we don't get disturbed or you
don't disturb others
thank you
so the first variable is that your spine
should be straight it should be erect
your feet both your feet should be flat
on mother earth or her ground level next
your palms are like the conductors and
receptors of energy so your palms to be
opened and face upwards and they could
remain open like this in your lap yes
try and keep your spine straight all
right and your head in a position where
you do not feel its weight so if you're
moving it you will feel that at a point
you feel your head weight disappears all
right
so these are the three variables if
there's anything of course that's tight
or constricting just release it you know
if there's a tie or a or a belt that's
very very restricting please just open
it up and as we do the process but
before we begin with the process we need
to understand that we will be mastering
first the positions of these seven nerve
centers okay so we will be working first
on the left channel so our left channel
which is the left palm will be open and
faced upwards like this whereas the
right palm will be actually be played
along the point where your chakra is or
where your nerve Junction nerve center
is all right so the first position is
this in the pelvic region on the left
side place your right palm almost at the
hip joint okay and it is this part of
your palm because that is the
corresponding seventh nerve center has
to be touching it got it okay Jay and
Shiraz are looking around to check if
everyone's doing it correctly
so if you have a problem just ask second
position of the second nerve center the
chakra is directly below the ribcage in
the stomach region on the left side yes
and you place your palm there that's
perfect good
moving upwards you then go to the heart
chakra slightly lower directly in front
of your yes big bump there okay
wonderful
slowly you move then to the chakra which
is located in the throat region but the
way you do it is you take your palm and
between the left shoulder and the neck
region you turn your head slightly to
the right
holding the nape of the neck you know
the bone that is protruding the nape of
the neck and turning your head slightly
to the right side yes just turn your
head slightly to the right perfect
yes that is the position of your center
of communications then you move to the
next that is the sixth point which is in
the forehead region at all points keep
the left palm open and drawing energy
yes you then move to the forehead region
and looking downward slightly you cup
your palms so that on the left side
you're holding the left side of your
forehead with your fingers and the back
of the palm is holding the right side of
your forehead good that's the position
of the sixth nerve center and finally
you go up to the seventh point
try and locate that soft bone button
most of us it is hardened because of two
forces which compel us in life that's a
ego and our super-ego which reside right
there ok so you can need to look
downward slightly and while we're really
working on this nerve center we will be
rotating the energy at this point in a
clockwise direction from left to right
ok and pressuring a little so that that
little tiny opening which has been
blocked at the center of the skull opens
up to allow the energy to move out yes
got it so seven times in a clockwise
direction you will be rotating the palm
on top of the head as we are doing the
process ok it's slightly in front eeeh
yes slightly yes yeah
have you got the positions can we
quickly recap and review them so that we
because our eyes will be closed when
you're doing the actual process so when
you're doing the process there will be a
few affirmations which you will be sub
vocally say and each nerve center has as
you know different number of nerve
endings so you will be repeating those
affirmations the number of times to eat
do each to open up each of those nerve
endings is that clear
alright if you have a question at this
point do ask yes yes if you have to
place the clock this way on top of your
head this would be the direction from
left to right okay
yes the energy is rotating this way okay
out there if the energy rotates in the
opposite direction
it creates a lot of negative events to
happen therefore the position is
important and there's this whole thing
about a lot of research done on that
which you can google and find out about
okay all right so let's begin now I'll
be ready you can stretch out a bit if
you're feeling sleepy you can just
stretch out stretch your spine maybe
move your shoulders a little because I
know you've been working all day neck
positions to release the tension
physically while we do this
yes sometimes I do a body scan and we go
through all the muscles in the body and
relax them before we do this but since
we have just an hour I don't think we
can manage all that so we'll just let go
all the tensions in the body but they'll
clear up automatically once you reach
the level of the seventh nerve center so
don't worry too much about it okay
now those are wearing specs all right if
you could put them aside because we
don't need them your eyes will be closed
all right
so you can adjust yourself to see that
your spine is aligned and vertical
palms are open as I said they're the
receptors and transmitters of energy and
they give you all the information on
your nervous system so to be open and
placed upwards your head in a position
that's the third variable you need to
check head in a position where you do
not feel its weight
and now gently close your eyes
please don't try to open your eyes this
is a journey that is inwards
you're looking at your own nervous
system you don't have to worry about
others therefore just focus with it
let us begin first just take your right
palm place it in the pelvic region on
the left side and over here to open up
this nerve center you have to address
this to mother Kundalini and you can
just say mother please give me the light
of pure knowledge
and you repeated six times sub vocally
to open up the six nerve endings of this
nerve Junction
once you finish just move up to the next
nerve center below the ribcage in the
stomach region on the left side pressure
it slightly
and now over here again the affirmation
is mother Kundalini or bandha I am my
own master with the light of the pure
knowledge you become your own master
your own guru so ten times you repeat
mother I am my own master
again let's take our right palm to the
chest region in front of the heart
chakra place your right palm on the left
side here the affirmation which you
repeat 12 times to open up all the nerve
endings and you say mother Oh mother
Kundalini I am my own spirit or I am my
own true self whatever you choose to say
begin
mother I am my own spirit
having completed that very peacefully
take your right thumb between the left
shoulder and the neck in that region
from the front and place it so that your
fingers are pressuring the nape of your
neck and tilting your head slightly to
the right over here you use the
affirmation mother I am NOT GUILTY and
release all the things that you make
you've made yourself wrong about let go
that past you repeat it 16 times because
this is a complex nerve center just say
mother I am NOT GUILTY 16 depths
beginning
all right now take your right palm place
it along the forehead region cupping
your palms slightly holding the forehead
on either side and looking downwards at
this juncture you say mother I forgive
everyone and you need to let go and
forgive each and every one from your
heart
and so you repeat this till you really
let go I know it's the most difficult no
Center to cross and open up it's
difficult to let go and forgive someone
but let's do it try not to think of
specific individuals just in general let
go and forgive everyone just say mother
I forgive everyone
once you've done that finally move to
the seventh nerve center on top of the
head
place your palm in such a way that you
fan your fingers out as you pressure it
slightly and looking downwards
seven times as you rotate in a clockwise
direction from left to right you just
say mother please give me
self-realization so you have to ask your
primordial energy mother Kundalini to
grant the self-realization to you this
connection seven times you repeat mother
please give me self-realization begin
once you've done that you can place both
your palms back on your left
and now with your left palm just check
on top of the head without touching the
head if you can feel hotter cool
vibrations you know they're like tiny
atoms moving or sometimes like a strong
breeze without touching the head move it
up and down sometimes it's very high
times it could be low
sometimes it's very hot to check it out
and now place the left bomb back on your
lap and check with the other part see
how high it goes the point at which you
do not feel it that's the point at which
the connection is
all right now place both the palms back
on your left and see if you can feel
tiny particles like energy moving around
in the palms of your hand
sometimes it's very strong sometimes
it's extremely subtle depending on your
energy level and become aware of that
and now for a few minutes let us sit
peacefully in silence which is the state
of meditation that spontaneously occurs
and I will not be instructing you for a
while so let us enjoy that silence
all right so now very slowly draw your
attention to the outer environment
become aware of it and end the
meditation and the process by
acknowledging yourself for having given
yourself this precious gift to be able
to manage stress and to become empowered
it's about - your own self in
recognition of this process where you
awakened this energy today and got
yourself realization
and I wish you all the very best on this
journey how do you feel we have very few
minutes so I just ask a few questions if
you wouldn't like to share some things
yes there's the mic so if you could just
just access it we have two minutes yes
yes well you just begin with the process
you work on the left channel and the
left channel therefore draws energy from
the universe and the other palm then hmm
is used to express that chakra and
release the block okay the left channel
is the channel of pure desire the right
channel is the channel of action
therefore you use the right arm you
activate it okay yes I know everybody's
now moving out for the next yes
just went through there are flyers in
the back that show the positions and the
accusations that she say each point
thank you so much thank you and I wish
you will really practice this and make
it a part of your life so that we can
all benefit from it
okay and believe me it'll really create
a 360-degree shift in your life truly so
wish you all the best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
