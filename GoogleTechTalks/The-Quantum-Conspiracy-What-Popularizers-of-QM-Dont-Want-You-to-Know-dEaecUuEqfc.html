happy to introduce dr. Ron Garrett here
who is going to be speaking about
quantum mechanics today
he's a former Googler from the very
early days of the company around 2000 he
was the lead engineer on the first
release of AdWords and the original
author of the Google Translation console
he also wrote the first billing system
that Google used also for many years he
worked at the NASA Jet Propulsion lab in
Pasadena specializing in AI and robotics
I'm hoping to convince him to come back
and talk about his experiences debugging
spacecraft 250 million miles from Earth
here's Ron thanks so I'm told that my
abstract caused a little bit of a
kerfuffle so let me start out with a
couple of disclaimers up front to kind
of manage expectations the title of the
talk was was intended to be
tongue-in-cheek there is no actual
conspiracy at least as far as I know but
there is a fairly big disconnect between
what you read about quantum mechanics in
the popular press and what the actual
underlying truth is and that's what this
talk is about I am NOT a physicist do we
have any actual physicists in the crowd
oh boy okay well you can make sure you
keep me honest I'm a software engineer I
came upon this about actually 20 years
ago when I read an article in Scientific
American and I thought this can't
possibly be right
and it took me 10 years to finally find
a physicist at Caltech who could explain
to me why in fact it wasn't right and at
that point everything just kind of
clicked in quantum mechanics made a lot
more sense to me than it did before and
that's what this talk is about is about
it's about a different way to think
about QM that hasn't gotten very much
attention and dispels this idea that
quantum mechanics has sort of
intractably weird somebody said has said
to me once that quantum mechanics obeys
the law of conservation of weirdness and
to a certain extent that is true there
is a certain amount of quantum mechanics
extracts a toll on your intuition and
some of that will never go
Way but I don't think the quantum
mechanics needs to be fundamentally any
more incomprehensible than say
relativity which most technical people
seem to have no trouble wrapping their
brains around nowadays so with that sort
of expectation management out of the way
I want to start out by inviting you to
think about the question what does it
mean to measure something so imagine
that we're sitting here doing some
experiment 'm let me grab a pointer that
that we want to measure some property
oven so we have some you know sensor
here like a camera and it gathers some
data and we feed it to a computer and
that data shop pops up on the screen and
we look at that with our eyes and we
form some mental image in our head and
how do we know that this mental image
that we form in our head actually
corresponds to underlying physical
reality well one indication that we have
of this is that we can do experiments
more than once and observe that we get
consistent results so for example what
color is this green yes so we can
observe through through our common
everyday experience that the results of
measurements are consistent across space
and time and and this is really a very
reliable aspect of our universe but it's
actually a very deep mystery why this is
so and Einstein famously said that the
most incomprehensible thing about the
universe is that it is comprehensible we
can actually do experiments and get
results that are consistent across space
and time and we don't really know why
that what any inherent reason why that
should be the case now there's one very
plausible sounding explanation of why
this is the case and that is that the
results of these measurements are
actually an accurate reflection of some
underlying metaphysical reality that
reality that there really is a universe
out there and when we measure it we're
getting back actual information about
that underlying physical reality and
that is the reason why these
measurements are consistent because
reality
sees to it that that's the case well it
turns out that we can demonstrate that
that's
not true now I've got to lead you down a
rabbit hole but my purpose in leading
you down this rabbit hole is to do it in
such a way that you can find your way
back out again so I'm going to do it
very carefully step by step and tell you
in advance where we're going I'm going
to start out by reviewing the usual QM
story what you will read if you go to a
popular account of quantum mechanics
that you read you know pick up at Amazon
or a book store or read about in Wired
or whatever I don't then show you how
that story can't possibly be true
because if that story were true it would
lead to a violation of relativity and
particularly would lead to faster than
light communication and it doesn't do
this in the usual way that most people
think that it leads to faster the light
communication it does it in a more
subtle way that really hasn't gotten a
lot of attention so you physicists in
the room bare with me then I'm going to
walk you through some of the actual
underlying mathematics of quantum
mechanics in a way that is accessible to
anyone who knows can do basic algebra
knows what a logarithm is and finally
tell a new story based on our
understanding of what the underlying
mathematics actually says about what's
really going on and hopefully we'll
achieve an Enlightenment um so is there
anybody here who has not heard of the
two-slit experiment
all right good I will just blast through
this very quickly so we have a this is
you have a laser that shines through two
slits and you get an interference
pattern that shows that light is a wave
and can interfere with itself like any
other wave and there are two strange
things about this if you if you look at
the results of this experiment with very
low intensity light what you find is and
this isn't showing up very well but this
top image here shows just some dots
scattered randomly and the dots get
denser and denser and denser until down
here at the bottom you have a dense
enough pattern of dots that you can
start to see this interference pattern
start to emerge
and this is an actual photograph of
laser light going through a single slit
and going through two slits and you can
see this interference pattern here this
is actual an actual photograph of the
same experiment this particular one
happened to be done with electrons but
the underlying physics is the same and
yeah the thing to notice here is that
the total amount of light that you get
in this pattern when there are two slits
is brighter than the overall amount of
light that you get with one slit which
is what you would expect but that there
are some places here where you have
these dark bands that were bright up
here when you only had one slit and this
is the interesting part that you want to
kind of focus your attention on because
what this means is that there's a spot
here where light was shining and then
you open up an extra path to get to this
screen and that spot goes dark and that
is the manifestation of interference but
the strange thing about it is that this
is not a continuous phenomenon it's an
accumulation of all these particles now
I can actually I used to think that this
was a fairly subtle experiment that you
needed specialized equipment to conduct
this experiment turns out it's not sure
you can actually do this experiment
yourself these are some pencil leads
that I've taped together with scotch
tape and this is an ordinary laser
pointer and if I pass these and there's
a very narrow gaps between these LEDs so
you can actually see this happen if I
pass the LEDs in front of this pointer
you can see the light start to spread
out and if you're close enough you can
actually see the interference bands I
don't think you can see in the back but
if if you're interested after the talk
come up I'll give you a closer look at
it you actually see the interference
pattern the point here is that this is
not a subtle phenomenon and it's not
something that you need expensive
equipment to reproduce this is an
everyday experience for modern humans at
least
okay so this is not yet intractably
weird because there all kinds of
explanations that we can postulate about
how this might be happening for example
photons electrons might be real
particles that have real locations and
velocities like our intuitions about
particles that might be pushed around by
some kind of underlying wave and oh I
forgot to mention whoops
the location where these particles
accumulate is random this is no known
way to predict other than statistically
where these particles are going to end
up on the screen so the randomness might
just be due to some underlying real
physical property that we just don't
know how to measure by the turn of that
we can eliminate this possibility as
well and the way we do that is by asking
by trying to track the path of a
particle and ask with on its way to the
screen on its way to producing this
interference pattern which of these two
slits did it go through and we can do
that we can add detectors to the slits
and we can measure which of the two
slits a particle went through but it
turns out that when we do that the
interference pattern goes away and the
phenomenon that we were trying to get a
better grip on has changed and it turns
out that this is an inherent feature of
quantum mechanics that any modification
that we make to this experiment that
allows us to determine even in principle
which of these slits this particle went
through destroys the interference this
is the famous
wave particle duality any modification
that allows the serving even in
principle yeah so I've been asked to ask
the people on the BC to mute their mics
did I get that right okay um okay
anyway so the conclusion from the
observation is that something has to be
something has to be at both slits in
order to produce interference and the
reason we know that is because we don't
actually need both of these detectors
one of them is enough because
if we have one detector and it fails to
register that we know particle went
through the other slit now the particle
going through the other slit it never
interacted with anything the particle
never interacted with anything but
because it allows us to know where the
particle was even though we didn't
actually measure it that's enough to
destroy the interference and so this
particle that's over here must somehow
have known that we were looking over
here even though the particle itself
wasn't there so something must have been
there to be able to tell that we had a
detector here but we don't know what
that is now it turns out this is again
this is a universal property of quantum
mechanics it holds for any kind of
particle in practice that means photons
and electrons because that's all there
is in this universe unless you start
getting into nuclear physics and any
kind of measurement than any kind of two
slit experiment any experiment where you
provide two different paths for the
particle to potentially go down and
bring it back together without knowing
which way it actually went will will
produce interference and any
modification that you make that lets you
figure out where it went will destroy
that interference now this is still not
entrapment because we can still tell a
reasonable story about why this might
happen so maybe measurement is something
to this system these are after all very
small particles and very delicate
systems and so maybe it's just
physically impossible to make a
measurement without disturbing the
system way that is the cause of the
destruction of this interference maybe
the wavefunction collapses and becomes a
particle somehow this is the famous
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics but it turns out that we can
rule out that possibility as well and
the way we rule out that possibility is
by asking how and when does this
collapse this purported collapse happen
this collapse has a number of features
that ought to make us very suspicious of
it just a priori without even doing any
experiments it's a discontinuous and non
reversible phenomenon but once you know
that a particle has gone through one
slit or the other you can't go roll back
time and undo that and if you look at
the mathematics of quantum
which we'll get to later there's nothing
in the math it's discontinuous and more
than that all of the math is actually
time River so we can make a hypothesize
that this collapse happens but this is
fundamentally at odds with the
mathematics of what quantum mechanics of
how quantum mechanics says that our
universe works so we can actually do
better than that we actually do an
experiment to show that collapse if it
happens is a much subtler phenomenon
than it would at first appear and this
is the famous this is the quantum
mystery number two the famous quantum
eraser now this isn't it this is a
two-slit experiment that I have now
reduced to something more abstract so we
have some particle sources can be
photons or electrons we have some
abstract way of splitting up that
particle so that it has two different
paths to go down and some abstract way
of recombining that particle so that
both of those paths end up in the same
place so that we get interference and
here notionally we have one detector at
one of these dark fringes and another
one at a bright fringe so that if we
introduce a some kind of an abstract
measurement on one of these branches
then the interference pattern fuzz's out
that we now have the half the amount of
light at each detector so then we did we
don't have fringes anymore
we have the spread out pattern that we
saw the single slit version of the
experiment like I said there are lots of
different ways that you can do this so
actually let me go down to the next one
so it turns out that you can erase this
that there are physical ways that if
this measurement certain kinds of proto
measurements that you can do here you
can then go back and erase after the
fact and restore the interference and
here's a concrete example of that if we
polarized light and I'm actually going
to show you this in just a second so
bear with me if you don't understand
what I'm about to say you use polarized
light and you do the measurement by
rotating that light 90 degrees and then
erase it by filtering at 45 degrees that
is an actual concrete exam
love a quantum eraser and I can't show
you the interference part of it but I
can show you the erasure part so what I
have here is some polaroid film this is
the same stuff that you find in
polarized sunglasses and I first want to
convince you has anyone not played with
this stuff before and okay so again real
quick if the if the axes of film are
aligned then you can see through it
everybody see through this and if I
rotate it 90 degrees then you can't see
through it anymore and that effect is
independent of the absolute orientation
of the film so the light that's going
through to your eye starts out
unpolarized over here it gets passes
through this film it becomes polarized
let's say in this direction and I can
demonstrate then that it has become
polarized in that direction by filtering
it out using a filter at 90 degrees and
there's also this cool adjunct to the
experiment that you can do by adding a
filter at 45 degrees if you put it in
front or behind nothing happens which is
pretty much we do what you'd expect but
if you slide this in between and
suddenly you can see through it again
pretty cool huh and the reason for that
is because if you start out with
polarized light and you filter it at 45
degrees then some of it gets through and
it's now polarized in this direction and
that do the same operation in which now
the relative orientation of these 2 or
45 degrees so some of it gets through
again but that's what I want to show you
that's not the cool part cool part this
stuff this is what they didn't tell you
what they didn't show you in high school
this this film is actually a
polarization rotator if I stick this in
here I can actually take this light
that's polarized in this direction I can
rotate a 90 degrees that it's polarized
in the same direction as this film and
the thing to notice here is that the
apparent brightness here in the center
is the same as it is up here
whereas before if you did the high
school version of the experiment whoops
you've got quite a bit of loss
so so I really can take I can take light
and I can polarize it and I can take
that polarized light and I can rotate it
by 90 degrees and so I can create two
different paths that I can tell which
way the light went through I can tell
whether the lights going through here or
whether the lights going through here
actually we back up a step my claim is
without this filter it's a little harder
than hell my claim is that the light
that's coming out of here is different
than the light that's coming out of here
so I can tell which way it went and the
way that I can demonstrate that to you
is with this measurement apparatus that
lets me filter out this light and tell
which way it went so this is a
measurement this should collapse the
wave function according to the
Copenhagen interpretation but I can undo
this and the way I undo it is by
filtering at 45 degrees and now I have
to ask you for a little bit of
suspension of disbelief because this is
not high precision optical equipment and
my angles aren't aligned just right and
if you look very closely you will
actually be able to tell the difference
between these two paths but the
difference is now much less than it was
before
see that
oh I'm sorry didn't realize why people
are right here okay I'll show you all
this at close range afterwards so
there's a measurement there's an erasure
of that measurement of the lights going
this way so the in time the erasure has
to happen after the measurement and if I
actually had a laser to shine through
this I could demonstrate to you that the
interference would go away and would
come back so again these are not subtle
effects and they're not effects that you
necessarily need high-precision
equipment to reproduce its everyday
experice is $30 worth of polarizing film
so this leaves us with or of the the
philosophical conundrum that is embodied
by Schrodinger's cat if there's no
collapse then if we set up a radioactive
source that triggers some kind of a
mechanism
we'll break a bottle of poison that will
kill a cat that's in a sealed box can
this what happened what happens quantum
mechanics says that this cat is in a
quantum superposition of being alive and
dead which is intuitively absurd but as
far as we can tell that's really what
happens so if that's not intractably
weird enough for you this is the the
third quantum mystery entanglement which
is usually described as sort of an
ancillary phenomenon to all these other
mysteries that is sort of oh by the way
has everybody seen this picture has
anybody not seen this picture before
okay this is what what the production of
quantum entangled photons really looks
like you take a this is not it
this is not an actual photograph this is
a drawing but this is an actual
photograph of the output of one of these
gadgets there's an ultraviolet laser
that shines through a crystal of some
material called beta barium borate
details don't matter and this crystal
has this interesting property that it
will absorb photons of ultraviolet light
and re-emit them in to stand and it'll
kick an electron up to an excited state
and then that electron will drop back
down to its ground state and it'll do it
in two steps and in those so it'll kick
up in one step down in two and in the
process of coming back down it will emit
two photons instead of one so what comes
out of this system is visible light and
the photons always come out in pairs and
they come out in matched sets because of
fundamental conservation laws we have
law conservation of energy and momentum
and so and elektra a photon that say
comes out over here is a red photon will
be matched by one that comes out over
here is a blue photon and the same thing
over here and in the middle you get this
band where you get photons that come out
at the same wavelength and I just mash
in position so a photon over here will
be matched by one over here and they'll
also be matched in polarization as it
turns out so this is the way it's
depicted conceptually you have this
ultraviolet laser it's called a Down
convert this crystal is called a down
converter
and you send these photons off to
opposite sides at the universe and what
and then you measure some property of
them let's say we split them according
to polarization or position or Mendut
doesn't matter any quantum state
variable as long as you can filter them
that way and what you find is that
they're perfectly anti-correlated
because of the conservation laws so if
you get a photon up here on the right
side of the experiment at the upper
detector that will always be matched by
a photon over here on the left side of
the experiment at the down detector
unfortunate artifact of the English
language that the word left and lower
both start with the letter L so I'm
going to switch back and forth between
them
this is what the faint what I Stein
famously called spooky action at a
distance if you take this phenomena it's
an controvert oh this is experimental an
undeniable experimental result this
really does happen combine that with the
fact that there is no collapse of the
wavefunction and the inescapable
conclusion seems to be that as it was
put in wired as recently as last June
that when an aspect of one photons
quantum state is measured the other
photon changes in response even when the
two photons are separated by large
distances and this would seem to be
impossible because it would seem to
violate relativity because it's an
instantaneous effect and you know that
we can't communicate information faster
than light because if we could do that
then we could communicate information
backwards in time and that would cause
all kinds of problems with causality and
it'd just be a horrible mess so these
instantaneous effects are supposed to be
impossible but there is one thing that
comes to save us and that is this
quantum randomness we don't actually
have any control over whether the photon
on one side ends up at the upper
detector or the lower detector and so we
can't actually send information failure
to there we know that if we see the
photon up on the upper detector over
here then our counterpart across the
universe must have seen it at their
lower detector over there but we haven't
transmitted any information from A to B
and you can actually prove this
automatically that it's impossible to
transmit information using this
phenomenon but it turns out that the
proof of the impossibility has a
loophole so that is the end of step 1
I'm now going to on to step 2 is show
you why the story that I just told you
can't possibly be true so let's
summarize take stock a split combined
experiment produces interference any
which way measurement destroys that
interference there are some which way
that a proto measurements that we can go
back and erase after the fact and
restore the interference and
measurements on entangled particles are
perfectly anti-correlated so the quantum
Spira see is that all of these things
cannot possibly be true and here's why
so this is a thought experiment this
experiment has not actually been done
that again with tongue slightly in cheek
I've dubbed the einstein-podolsky-rosen
Garrett paradox and it's to to slit
experiments that are fed by quantum
entangled photons produced by one of
these downconverter setups in the middle
and amatuer you consider the question of
if we measure on the left do we destroy
the interference on the right so if the
answer is yes then we have
faster-than-light communication because
this interference is a macroscopic
effect it's really easy to see if you
have interference or not you just look
at it with your eyes you don't need any
kind of delicate detectives or anything
so you just measure over here take
measurement away measure take the
measurement away and over there on the
other side of the universe this
interference pattern will come and go
and you can send Morse code
instantaneously that's obviously
impossible so the answer must be no but
if the answer is no then we know the
position of one particle but we have
interference regardless and that
contradicts the fundamental principle of
quantum mechanics which is that we can't
know the position of the particle and
still have it interfere
now this is not yet an ironclad argument
there is one other possibility that I
have not mentioned here can anybody
think of what it is any of the
physicists in the crowd oh good
so there's one last possibility and that
is that there was no interference to
begin with it might be that entanglement
sort of counts as one of these subtle
proto measurements that destroys the
interference we didn't have any
interference to begin with but it turns
out that doesn't get us out of this
faster the light conundrum because fine
if that's the case that we can still
produce faster than light communications
by putting in a quantum eraser and
destroying the entanglement entanglement
is a very is a very delicate property
physicists worked very hard to produce
it maintain it it's very easy to destroy
so just destroy the entanglement and
produce interference where there was
none before and again we have a
faster-than-light signaling mechanism
now that is a very compelling argument
that the story that I have told you the
usual quantum story is wrong that
argument is in fact correct
the story that I have told you up until
now is in fact wrong and that's why
because because all physicists know what
the outcome will be and about am Ivette
to tell you what the outcome will be and
and by the time I finish telling you you
will be convinced enough that the
outcome is what I tell you that it will
be that you won't need feel the need to
do the experiment either I promise you
oh I'm sorry the the the the question
was why hasn't this experiment been done
yeah polarization which way it goes
through a splitter is that exact
that's right so I'm assuming here like I
said there are lots of different ways
that you could do these split combine
experiments you can use something called
a Mach Zehnder interferometer you can
use something called a stern-gerlach
device you can you know lots of
different ways when I talk about
polarization the way that the splitting
is done is with a device called a
polarizing beam splitter which is
exactly like one of these except instead
of just absorbing half the photons and
letting have the the half of them go
through it reflects them so it looks
like a mirror and a half-silvered mirror
and what comes out this direction is
photons that are polarized one direction
and what gets reflected the other
direction our photons that are polarized
in the opposite direction okay so we are
now in the depths of the rabbit hole and
now time to find our way back out so I'm
going to do some math don't panic it
will not be as bad as you think this is
the mathematics of quantum mechanics
right here this is the famous
Schrodinger wave equation it this is the
the free variable here is this thing
called sy sy is the quantum wave
function and it obeys the dynamics of
this partial differential equation which
those of you who are proficient in
partial differential equations will
recognize as a wave equation like any
other equation that describes waves and
that's why the these particles seem to
propagate like wave because this is the
math that describes how they propagate
the the point here is that this the
dynamics of this thing are continuous
and time reversible all wave equations
have continuous time reversible dynamics
and the second part of quantum mechanics
is that you take this quantum wave
function which is a function of position
and time and is a complex number you
take the norm the magnitude of that
complex number and square it and that
gives you the probability of measuring a
particle at this position X at a time T
that's really all you need to know about
the the mathematics of quantum mechanics
there's some things to note about this
there is this distinction between
underlying amplitudes which are complex
numbers and probabilities which are of
where we find these particles which is
the only thing that we can measure which
are real numbers and the reason that
particles can interfere is because
complex numbers with magnitudes greater
than zero can add to zero you can have a
complex number that points off in this
direction another complex number the
points off in that direction they both
have magnitudes greater than zero but
they can add and destructively interfere
the dynamics are continuous time
symmetric fully deterministic and hence
reversible and so there's no place where
you there's no place you can find
anything that resembles collapse in this
math I had no randomness either by the
way
going from amplitudes to probabilities
by taking this wave function and
squaring it has no physical
justification whatsoever it's purely a
hack
but it's a hack that works really really
well so here's what the actual math
looks like for the two-slit experiment
this is and if you go to actual papers
on quantum physics you won't find this
in the popular press this is what you
will find in in physics journals this or
physics texts this is the state the
amplitude of the photon being at the
upper detector this is the amplitude of
the photon being at the lower detector
and we have to divide by the square root
of two in order to make the total
probability come out to be one so to
figure out the probability we take this
number which is a complex number and
take the modulus and square it the when
we do that it's it's just it's almost
exactly the same as just squaring a plus
B in eighth grade algebra class you get
a squared plus B squared plus a B plus B
a you have to take these complex
conjugates because they're complex
numbers and the square root of negative
one pops in there to do some weird
things those kind of details don't
matter the point is this is a complex
number
siyou as a complex number its magnitude
is a real number and when you square it
it's a positive real number so here we
have a positive real number here we have
another positive real number the sum of
those two
to be a positive real number but over
here we have two different complex
numbers and two different complex
numbers that we're multiplying together
so this sum can be negative so this is
theater if this is where the
interference comes from this is the
mathematical manifestation of
interference and quantum mechanics
that's what it looks like in terms of
Greek symbols so what happens when we
add detects well when we add detectors
the Putt the the amplitude starts to
look like this we have the the amplitude
for the photon to be at the upper
detector times the amplitude for the
detector to be in the state where it
shows that the particle is at the upper
detector and the same thing at the lower
detector so this is just the
mathematical description of that when
you when you when you take the amplitude
of that and square it here's what you
get same thing as before sy u squared
plus IL squared + and this which looks
an awful lot like an interference term
right which is weird because I just got
through telling you that if we have a
detector that we know that tells us
which way the particle went that
destroys the interference well there's
this subtle difference here between what
we have now what we have before and
that's this weird notation here which is
called Dirac braket notation don't need
to concern yourself with it just take my
word for when I tell you that this
quantity here is the amplitude for the
detector to spontaneously switch between
indicating that the particle is at the
upper slit and the lower slope in other
words it's a measure of the reliability
of the detector that just comes out when
you do the math and if the detector is
working properly that value whoops this
this value is this the the amplitude for
to spontaneously switch between UNL and
spontaneously switch between L and you
those are both 0 so this term goes away
that's the math of how measurement
destroys probability and the interesting
thing about this is that measurement is
a continuum it's not a dichotomy the
math tells us that
measure just a little bit or we can
measure mostly but not quite and we have
very it's a varying levels of
interference that we get depending on
whether the measurement that we're
making is reliable or not that's what
the math says so what about entanglement
well this is if you go to a physics
paper that talks about entangled
particles this is what you will see as
the the mathematical description of a
pair of entangled particles what this
means is that you have an amplitude for
the particle on the left to be in the up
state and the particle on the right to
be in the down state superimposed with
an amplitude for the particle on the
left to be in the down state and the
particle on the right to be in the up
state again divided by the square root
of two now this looks a lot like the the
unmeasured to slit description but
there's some notational sleight of hand
going on here because this is shorthand
for this and it's an unfamiliar notation
this vertical bar followed by the
bracket this is a term so you got this
is a quantum wave function here this is
another quantum wave function here this
is the wave function for the upper
particle this is a wave function for the
lower particle and another way to write
that is you don't have to use arrows
that's just a notational convenience so
I could call this the left upper
particle and the right downward particle
and the left downward particle on the
right upper particle and this is just
another way of writing this sigh this
quantum wave function so this and this
are the same thing in different
notations and this should now look
familiar this is exactly the same as
as this the the two-slit experiment with
a detector modulo a few labels and so
that is now the answer to the first part
of the EPR G paradox in fact
entanglement does count as a proto
measurement that destroys interference
but it's actually much deeper than that
according to the math entanglement and
measurement are the exact same
phenomenon the math is exactly the same
and that is why entanglement two-stories
interference because entanglement
is measurement and have a lot more to
say about that later in the talk so okay
so there's no interference but now what
about this last the the idea of creating
the interference using a quantum eraser
so let's take another look at our a
running a little short on time so I was
going to blast through this this is what
the the state equation looks like for
the quantum eraser after the so-called
measurement but before erasure so you
have an upper photon that's horizontally
polarized because we've let's assume we
start with Verte with vertically
polarized light going in here and we
measure by rotating 90 degrees so we
have now the upper photon rotated from
vertical to horizontal and the lower
photon still vertical and this you will
now should recognize as a measured and
therefore non-interfering state and it
turns out that if you filter now 45
degrees this is the state function the
the quantum wave function that you end
up with you now have a photon that's
either in the upper or lower slit and
that's either horizontally or vertically
polarized and this kind of makes sense
because if you take if you think of
these as vectors and you have a
horizontal polarization plus a vertical
polarization that's a 45-degree
polarization which is exactly what you
would expect to see if we're filtering
at 45 degrees right but remember this
square root of two term here that I told
you was there in order to make the total
probability come out to be 1
now that's a to root boo and if you run
the math on this you find out that the
total probability is not 1 it's 1/2 so
either we've made a mistake or half our
photons I've gone missing well in fact
half our photons have gone missing which
is also shouldn't be too surprising
because we filtered we put this
45-degree filter in place this filter is
filtering out half the photons that go
through it if they come in to 45 degrees
then half of them come out polarize this
way and the other half get blocked so it
turns out that the other half the half
that didn't get through have a different
wave function that has a negative sign
over here which again makes intuitive
sense because the filter lets these the
filter is at 45 degrees so it lets this
axis through and this axis which is the
h minus V axis it blocks and these
photons interfere with themselves and
these photons also interfere with
themselves so the photons that pass
through the filter display interference
fringes and the photons that don't pass
also display interference but it turns
out that they're anti fringes they're
exactly lined the bright spots in the
interference fringes for the PO for the
photons like I've filtered out exactly
line up with the dark spots of the
fringes for the photons that were let
through and they sum together to produce
what we perceive when we look at it as
non interference so this quantum eraser
doesn't actually erase anything and it
doesn't produce interference it just
filters out interference that was
actually already there all along and it
turns out that we can actually do this
in the EPR experiment too and the way
that we but in order to do it we have to
transmit classical information from one
side of the other in order to do the
filtering so the way it works is you
make a record of all the photons that
you collected over here and keep an
order so you have this record of first
photon was at the upper detector the
second photon was at the down detector
and so on and so forth and over here you
keep track of which photons ended up
where
on your screen and then you take this
record and you transmit it over here by
some classical's slower than light
channel and you look at all the up
photons and sure enough there's an
interference pattern and you look at all
the down photons and sure enough there's
an interference pattern but the only way
to see that is to take classical
information and move it from here to
here and that is the last nail in the
coffin I was very disappointed when I
learned this ten years ago because I was
really counting on winning a Nobel Prize
and taking over the world but oh well
this is the next best thing so that the
take-home message to to this point is
measurement and entanglement of the same
phenomenon and what you will find in
class in in many many accounts and even
some professional accounts is that
they're completely different that
measurement is this common everyday
thing that we can sort of intuitively
grasp and entanglement is the
quintessential quantum mystery and in
fact they're really the exact same thing
having come to that realization we can
now tell a different story about quantum
mechanics that to my software engineers
mind is much more intuitive ly pleasing
than any of the other competing
alternatives so there Copenhagen is the
most popular but as we've seen it's it's
scientifically untenable this is no
collapse there the next most popular
interpretation is the so-called
many-worlds interpretation where it says
at any time that a particle can go
multiple ways the entire universe splits
and the math actually supports that but
I personally find that that takes a
heavier toll on my intuition than I'm
really willing to concede there's all
the things that nobody's ever heard of
called the transactional interpretation
by a fellow named Kramer at the
University of Washington actually if
you're really interested in the stuff I
encourage you to take a look at because
it it is kind of interesting it
postulates that that the backwards in
time solutions to Maxwell's equations
are physically real and if you make that
assumption then you can explain a lot of
stuff but I don't have time to get into
that but what I want to talk about here
is the quantum information
eery which i have dubbed the zero
world's interpretation of quantum
mechanics it's an extension of classical
information theory with complex numbers
and if you run through that math you get
some very interesting results so here is
a lightning introduction to classical
information theory it's the study of
this quantity called the Shannon entropy
of a system a which can be in any one of
a number of classical States and it's
defined as the sum of the probability
that the system is in some state a times
the log of that probability and then you
take a negative sign and intuitively
it's a measure of the amount of
randomness that's in system a so just to
simplify things for the purpose of this
talk if the system has an equal
probability of being in one of n states
then the entropy is just the log of n so
when n is 1 and the system is definitely
in one state then the entropy is 0 and
if it can be in one of two states with
equal probability and we take this log
base two we measure information content
in bits then it has one bit of
randomness in it you can define all
kinds of other derived quantities like
the joint entropy of multiple systems
and the conditional entropy and this
quantity here which is called the
information entropy which is a measure
of how much information a system a
contains about a system B and the
interesting thing to note about it is
it's the sum of some of these other
quantities that has been defined up here
and the information entropy ranges
between 0 and 1 where 0 means that the
system has no in from system a has no
information about system B they're
completely uncorrelated and one means
that they're perfectly correlated so for
example because their sums we can we can
describe these quantities as Venn
diagrams so this circle here on the left
is a system a and this circle on the
right is the system B and the total
entropy is the is contained inside these
circles the total entropy for each
system and the information entropy is
here in their intersection and that
leaves the conditional entropy out
here because because the information
entropy is the system's individual and
should be - the conditional entropy just
simple addition this is the important
part if we flip two coins so that
they're completely independent of each
other this is what the numbers end up
looking like the conditional entropy
coin a has one bit of randomness and
coin B has one bit of randomness so the
total entropy in the system is two bits
of randomness the system as a whole of
these two coins can be in one of four
states log of four is two and there's no
information that one coin contains about
the other by way of contrast if we have
a coin with a sensor that's looking at
that coin telling us whether it's landed
entered heads or tails then the interim
and the sensor is working properly then
we have one bit of information entropy
because the sensor gives us perfect
information about the coin and vice
versa by the way the coin gives us
perfect information about the sensor
there's no directionality here and the
total entropy in the system is one bit
it will only be in one of two states
heads and sensor says heads or tails and
sensor says tails if we extend do the
same math again except using complex
numbers instead of real numbers then you
end up with something called the von
Neumann entropy which is called s and
this hairy-looking equation over here
which I don't have time to go into but
the intuition is kind of the same as it
was before when we talked about how
interference was produced because we're
now dealing with complex numbers rather
than real numbers the information
entropy is no longer restricted to the
range 0 &amp;amp; 1 and in fact entropy z' are
no longer restricted to be positive real
numbers they can be negative and this
turns out to be if you do the math the
entropy diagram for a pair of entangled
particles you get a negative bit of
entropy over here and the information
entropy the amount of information that
one particle quantum information now
that one particle contain
about the other is two bits so you can
think about two entangled particles the
math is telling us that these particles
are now somehow better than perfectly
correlated they have become super
correlated and the total entropy of this
system sum of all these numbers is zero
there's no randomness that's not yet the
cool part what happens when we take a
measurement well when we take a
measurement we have a particle that
becomes entangled with a macroscopic
system of particles so what happens if
we have three mutually entangled
particles you end up with a Venn diagram
that looks like this and if we assume a
two-state system then the actual numbers
come out looking like this you've got
one bit of information entropy between a
and C one bit between a and B and you've
got these negative these weird negative
entropy s over here and it's all kind of
mind-boggling but let's imagine that
this particle down here is the one that
we're measuring and this is our met
these two particles here are our
measurement apparatus and let's look
just at the measurement apparatus and
ignore the fact that we're actually
measuring a particle here so we're going
to take this particle C we're just going
to throw it out for a minute it turns
out that ignoring C is exactly what is
represented by this trace operator here
that ends up showing up in the math look
what happens
this one bit of information entropy
could we use this boundary so the this
one a negative one cancel out and become
a zero same thing over here and what we
have is that if we ignore this is
exactly the same system from an
information theoretical point of view as
a coin with a sensor we have two
classical particles that are perfectly
correlated with each other in a
classical sense it should remind you of
the experiment that we did at the
beginning of the of the talk where
everybody agreed that the poets um thing
was green and we can get that from
quantum mechanics we get these two
systems that are in classical
correlation but we did that not by
actual not by having an objective
physical reality that we reflect by
actually by ignoring the thing that
we're measuring or that we think we're
measuring as it turns out that this
extends to any macroscopic system if you
add an arbitrary number of particles the
entropy diagram ends up looking exactly
the same so this is now the mathematical
description of a quantum measurement you
have the system that you're measuring
it's particle Q it interacts and gets
entangled with a particle which is in
the parlance of the theory called and
ancilla which is why they label it a and
that ancilla then gets entangled with a
macroscopic measurement apparatus some
system of 10 to the 23 particles and the
entropy diagram ends up looking exactly
the same where this entire system has
the same quantum information theoretical
information content as the third
particle in a three particle entangled
system so that is now a description of
what measurement looks like purely in
terms of quantum mechanics and the
interest in thinking about that is it
describes all of the macroscopic
phenomena that we see that we naively
observe about classical measurements but
it's purely in terms of quantum
mechanics which means that it's
reversible
so there so somehow we want to be able
to undo an actual physical classical
measurement
but in practice we can't seem to and the
reason for that is because in order to
do that in theory it's possible but in
practice we would have to undo all of
the entanglements in this macroscopic
system so for me to now go back and back
in time you don't really part really
going back in time but for me to erase
all of your memories of having seen this
green thing on the screen and agreed
that it was green at the beginning of
the screen I would have to undo this
enormous web of entanglement that has
since proliferated at the speed of light
I have to bring all those particles back
together and recombine them and in
principle that's possible and in
practice obviously it's not
which is why classical measurements seem
to be irreversible despite the fact that
the physics of the universe say that
everything is reversible so this has
some philosophical implications I called
it the zero universe interpretation of
quantum mechanics if you really if you
buy this as a next as a description of
what the physics of the universe is
really like then it tells you
unambiguously that it is not the case
that the reason that measurements are
consistent across space and time is
because there's a real real underlying
metaphysical reality out there it tells
you in fact the exact opposite that what
we really are is as David Merman puts it
correlations without core alotta we are
not made of atoms we are actually made
of bits we are our thoughts and these
thoughts actually reside if you forgive
stretching a metaphor to the breaking
point
we are a simulation running on a quantum
computer I'm going to skip that so the
take-home message is going back to
design Stein quote that the most
incomprehensible thing about the
universe is that it's comprehensible
here is an explanation in terms of
physical theory of why the universe is
comprehensible quantum mechanics
actually predicts a comprehensible
universe but at the cost of forcing you
to believe that what you perceive as
physical reality is not actually real
it's actually an illusion and the motto
here is that spooky action at a distance
is no more and no less mysterious than
the spooky action across time that lets
us perceive the universe as consistent
from one moment to the next
they're both produced by the exact same
physical phenomenon namely entanglement
and I'll leave you with this quote from
an ancient Japanese Zen master and open
the floor for questions
oh the physicists are walking out yeah
and they were equivalent to the 14th
century
why not you what happens when you leave
with their cart
if you're taking it down as a matter of
experience table this is equivalent yeah
well this is this is all just math right
so these are all mathematical
manipulations the results of which we
interpret in order to tell stories about
what our world is like and if you leave
it in and what you have is a description
of the unadulterated underlying physical
reality which is quantum and the reason
that's hard to wrap your brain around is
because your brain is classical
everything that you are is is classical
you're made of classical bits that are
ones are you're a Turing machine you're
not a quantum computer but you're made
out of a quantum computer and that's why
there's this fundamental disconnect that
will always take a toll on our
intuitions it will never go away because
they're really fundamentally different
the difference between real numbers and
complex numbers the underlying reality
is complex but the thing that is
processing the information that lets you
think about these things is real is made
of real numbers that's that's really the
the underlying the Pythias way I know of
summarizing this so it just depends on
what point of view you want to take I'd
like to make a short speech for the
multiple universes and hear your
response the multiple universes why look
at it is this that ready rare equation
it allows for because it's linear you
can have things or carrying that live in
the same equation and sometimes say with
the dead and a live cat you can see that
you can actually sort of separate and
each goes its own way they don't
interact much for a very good
approximation is to consider them one at
a time
however when real quantum effects go
then you cannot do it this way so there
are some things that you can separate in
some note so now you're saying that you
have an interpretation of the one
universe so not 1 0 0 it's very
important distinction
one universe one classical universe
really is untenable well you can you can
that's Copenhagen yeah that you you can
you can guess the so the question was
what do I think about multiple universes
multiple universes are just as tenable
according to the math as 0 universes the
only thing that's not tenable is one
classical universe that's it that's the
only thing that the math tells you
unambiguously does not exist and and
it's a matter of taste yeah I personally
so one of the things that the math tells
you if you think about it in terms of
multiple universes is that once you get
beyond a certain level of separation
these universes are forever inaccessible
to us even you know to any reasonable
degree of approximation and then it's
this philosophical question that is the
thing actually real and the analogy that
the best analogy that I've heard is
imagine a photon that leaves the back of
the Sun and and goes away from us and so
it's forever outside our light cone is
that photon real and my reply to that is
there's a difference between the photon
that leaves the back of the Sun and
travels away from us because there's
always the possibility that somewhere
out there there's a mirror that's going
to reflect that photon back to us and we
won't know that until that mirror
actually reflects it and it comes back
and we can see but in the case of
multiple universes we know an
ambiguously be math tells us so that
once another universe splits off it's
never coming back there's no way to
bring it back off to fajn correct i
Mathilde is skinny after porn career
time it's will okay in any amount of
time that we have any practical reason
to care about this so yes if you're
thinking cosmologically multiple
universes is a is it the tenable
interpretation if you're thinking in
terms if you want a story that you can
help you to understand how the universe
works in terms of your everyday life and
and what your fundamental nature is I
personally find that I gravitate more
towards the information theoretic point
of view and and believing that that I'm
the universe that I exist in is a very
good high quality simulation but that's
a matter of taste
ah that I don't know I have to defer
that and physicists that's a very good
question
I don't I actually don't know the answer
to that I could WOM prefer beats more
water than zero universe mean it is oh
by the way the question back here was do
multiple universes conserve mass energy
it's a very very good question because
and I don't know the answer I should ask
I need to ask a physicist group of many
worlds moment and
the answer I've got is yes that you're
not actually doubling the amount fast
you're you're dividing the amount of
massive - definitely but oh okay so
somebody in the audience is saying that
when universe is split the total amount
of mass in the universe gets evenly
divided between the two universes and
I'm guessing that math works out in such
a way that if you reduce the amount of
mass in a classical universe uniformly
by 1/2 that everything ends up working
out the same as it did before but I'm
going to have to think about that ok and
yet in walk in the universe Borean we
don't seem to see this massive dwindling
away yes we are now beyond the limits of
my knowledge of this stuff yeah I even
teased where can we learn more so I have
a paper about this it's on the web I
highly recommend david mermans book
Boojum all the way through where he
doesn't actually talk about this but he
talks about the Bell inequality in a
very accessible way which is also I
didn't have time to talk about that but
it's very worthwhile knowing about or
send send me an email I can actually put
you in touch with the guys whose
research this talk is based on they're
down at Caltech I think yeah
interactions
well this skit so the question was is
this a local purely local theory uh it's
quantum mechanics and whether quantum
mechanics is purely local is the subject
of debate and and it depends it depends
on what you mean by purely local
classically it's it's not and quantum
mechanically it is you know I this sheds
no extra light on that question okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
