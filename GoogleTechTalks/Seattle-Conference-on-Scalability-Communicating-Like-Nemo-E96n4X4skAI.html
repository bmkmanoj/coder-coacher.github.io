speaker Jennifer Wong Jennifer's Masters
of Science candidate in computer science
at the University of Victoria her
research interest includes fault
tolerance and mobile collaborative
systems and computer science education
she's been a member of sparks solving
problems with algorithms robotics and
computers outreach our outreach research
team and is the volunteer coordinator of
the computer science volunteer program
and she's hard to tell us about
communicating like Nemo alright so hi
everyone my name is Jennifer wall and I
am grad student from the University of
Victoria now even though we have been
trying to have a little bit of fun with
our title we do believe that there are
serious research challenges and
scalability in the family of devices
that can possibly make a splash now some
of the issues that will be touching upon
today will be with the scaling prom
involved problems with scale in the
context of you I and communication
between mobile underwater nodes so today
I've actually brought along a few
questions with me and I would like to
ask for your help to make this more
interactive and to answer all these
questions together now we've called our
project the Nemo 2022 tab on to the idea
of having a perfect vision for the
future so even though underwater
acoustic network are gaining momentum in
the research area we don't necessarily
have cloud computing underwater yet so I
do need you do need you to suspend your
disbelief and just join me in this
exploratory journey for the next half
hour
so before we actually swim anywhere else
we'll look at a few of the current dive
computers that are out there now here we
see three of the most common dive
computers that are out there for
recreational scuba divers and so there's
the wristwatch there's the console which
comes with the standard scuba gear and
there's the face mask which have the
little LCD screen on the site for you to
look at and they're more or less showing
the same kind of information using a
text based method and their solely
designed for a single person use so you
might ask do we have any collaborative
tools out there do we have tools that
are designed for more than one person to
use well the simple answer here is yes
we do we have tools that allow us to
communicate verbally underwater and
here's the underwater cell phone and a
GSM VHF unit so you can see that both of
these are full head gears and the cell
phone unit actually have a physical cord
that connects the headset to the surface
and the other one uses the standard
global system for mobile communication
with the rate with radio waves in the
range of 300 megahertz to 330 megahertz
to 300 megahertz now the obvious
advantage of this is you can talk while
you're underwater but you can only do
this if the person is using the exact
same here now if you're trying to
equalize pressure in your ears by
pinching your nose when you're wearing
all these gears you might find it a
little bit challenging to do so with the
underwater cell phone there are actually
a few other additional disadvantages
with the physical court if you want to
swim around and try to explore caves and
racks there will be a few issues you
might get tangled up while you're
exploring and this particular model
actually only allow communication
between two people so what do we need
well we need something wireless that can
be used by more than two divers and we
probably don't want something that's a
full face mask so we found this we found
this dive computer that attacks the
issue that I've described now they were
advertised to have the capability of
sending preset messages to other people
who are within the range of 500 meters
and when the message is sent the
receiving unit will get an alert and
other capability that they advertised is
having the homing capability to allow
divers to locate their boat if the
additional boat unit is purchased now
there were limited information on the
internet about this particular device so
we don't really know if it's only a
prototype or if an if it's an actual
device but if it's a natural device this
probably still doesn't scale up so now
you know what the state of the art out
there is we want to look at a few
questions that we still want to answer
so the first obvious question is why
should we do this and then we'll go into
it look at what kinds of related work
are out there for underwater
communication followed by exploring
questions like how well can
communication scale and how well can
application scale and then we'll finally
we'll look at platforms that we believe
to allow us the scale in the near future
so let's just jump into what we should
do or why should we do this now as a
tiny tiny background I'll tell you the
rough estimate for the size of
stakeholders that we're trying to serve
here so with the just the petty program
there are roughly 130 thousand members
and the patty program it's only one of
many scuba diving certification program
out there so from these photos you can
see that recreational scuba diving it's
a highly social activity that involves
extra equipments like regulators to help
us breathe but what if you actually want
to communicate underwater well if you
tread verbally you'll probably just get
a stream of bubbles and a mouthful of
water so we usually rely on hand signals
but these hand signals could have a very
different meaning in your day-to-day
life so now I would actually like to ask
I want to see how many non scuba diver
just by the show of hands are in the
audience awesome this is super okay so
can I please ask all the non scuba diver
to just have a wild guess what this hand
signal actually means okay I'm here
sorry taxi cool anymore sir like there's
a problem
okay yeah all right anymore okay they're
all very very good answers now the
actual meaning of this it means help so
to me my first instinct I I thought that
person was just waving at me so I'll be
very polite I'll just stand up here and
I'll smile and you know I'll wave back
and say hi hello when they're actually
trying to get my get me to help them so
okay let's look at a second one what do
you think this one means i can't hear
you're crazy I'm feeling dizzy that's
very very close anymore okay all right I
those are all very good answers so the
actual answer it's I'm feeling nauseous
but we can see that there's so many
other meanings out there for this okay
so let's look at a third one this is the
last ones that all just sort of test you
guys on what do you think those means
nowhere yep go up
ok so somebody actually had it right
this actually means I'm out of there now
so from this little exercise here we can
see that there are multiple meanings to
a single hand signal and even though all
the hand signals are universal to all
the scuba divers and everybody is
supposed to know about them it's not
really the most intuitive thing that's
out there and it can easily create
miscommunication now because of all the
possible miscommunication we need a tool
that we can support collaboration and
further enhance the communication
between these divers now not only do we
want to support collaboration you want
the support scalable collaboration and
we want to look at how we can do that at
both the application level and the
system level so what we've been talking
about here relates to scalable ad hoc
underwater network but before we
actually dive into the real literature
well just look at a few things for
background purposes so you might wonder
what kind of things this kind of network
could actually apply to well there are a
few these type of applications can be
related to say transportations or
military activities some examples would
be a marine Accident Investigation
military demands like submarine tracking
and underwater research in general and
if we look at underwater sensor network
in particular applications can involve
underwater data collection pollution
monitoring and autonomous underwater
vehicle
now other than knowing the various areas
that we can apply to we also want to
look at challenges in this type of
network now it is natural to have
latency in our environment because this
is caused by water conductivity and from
this equation you can see that the via
this is dependent on things like
temperature salinity and pressure while
as under ah under water so regardless of
the type of technology we use there will
always be issues with latency and
bandwidth so to get a better idea of
what kind of challenges we face in this
type of network will look at to common
problems that we've we've seen in papers
that we came across so the first one
we'll look at is GPS now because we wish
to allow individual knows to know their
current position our first thought would
be why don't we use just use GPS
underwater well GPS actually gets
quickly absorbed by water and they can't
really propagate that far deeply under
the water surface so we can't really use
that now the next one that we're going
to look at its acoustic so with acoustic
we have challenges in things such as
communicate communication range channels
and bandwidth so for communication range
it operates at a very low frequency wave
and so it has a longer communication
range than radio underwater now with
channel there are only a few channels
that are available to accuse acoustic
networks so communication speed is
actually very very slow and with
bandwidth same thing it has a very low
bandwidth
so there are the challenges but how do
these unit actually communicate what are
the possible routing methods so today
we're going to look at two we will look
at proactive and reactive now proactive
routing is using GPS usually using GPS
system where all the nodes are
consistently exchanging routing messages
trying to maintain a sufficient and
fresh Network topological information
and we with reactive routing it is
actually triggered by communication
demand at source so what it does what it
does is it will first flood the network
and it will wait for a reply to try and
see what their path what their path is
or how they can get to their destination
so next thing that we're going to look
at is what are the actual existing
solutions that are out there right now
for problem well one solution is to
deploy multiple underwater sensor net
sensor nodes that interconnects with
underwater sinks through acoustic
Network and these underwater sink will
then relay information to the surface
and a time an alternative is to have an
architecture that uses a large number of
nodes to locally monitor and try to
report any non-accessible underwater
events through the use of
community-based forwarding
so similar to all the environments that
we've been talking about so far we are
the Nemo 2020 also operates at a highly
dynamic mobile setting and we also want
to support communication for not only
small group but all sold large groups so
in our proposed a pro approach we're
using a hybrid network scheme and we
want to use multiple technology to
create a seamless network for the scuba
divers now for all the underwater
communication we're proposing to use
acoustics and for any surface
communication we propose the first rely
on radios and then if the receiving
service unit is a little too far we're
going to rely we're going to use
alternate methods so like a lot of our
related work that we've presented today
due to the bandwidth and bandwidth
constrain our approach will also use
react use the reactive routing method
but you know even though we propose
something like this if we don't have
enough funding to test this in a real
setting what do we do well one of our
ideas is to try and emulate this network
with one laptop per child so by default
one laptop per child uses the 802 11 s
technology which focuses on mash
networking now it looks at how wireless
devices can be interconnected to create
an ad hoc network and each of these OLPC
s can act as a router a dater sink and
the data source itself so we we will we
can also use an 802 11 be or g router to
act as the surface unit now during
during the during our test
can also simulate changes by physically
moving these ll theses and so here we
have a big ol LPC swimming farther away
from the small one on the right side of
the screen and we can see that the juror
connection just disappeared but the that
far right olpc will still be able to
communicate with the big one base John
the fact that they have nearby nodes and
though count those can relay their relay
the messages so even we have even after
we have design the communication scheme
for the big picture we also really want
to look at scaling and an application
level so in their paper we've talked
about a standalone mode and
collaborative mode because we're looking
at scalability here we want to focus
only at the at the clip collaborative
mode and how application can support
scaling so the first thing that we're
going to look at here is the relative
positioning screen and this screen
allows divers not only view positions of
anybody of other divers in their own
group it will also allow drivers to look
at positions of people who are using the
Nemo system but are not part of the same
group so here we can see that the red
the dot in the center represents the
dive computer users themselves any
triangle at represents any other divers
who are in the same group and the square
represents any other divers that are
outside that group add to accommodate
scalability we're allowing divers to
zoom in and out much like how google map
works so here as an example this can
zoom to a bigger view and it can zoom
out to an even finger view
so with our back bar graphs we are
showing the status here we have a bar
graph that shows group status but you
can see that it will quickly get
cluttered and that's why we're also
providing a table screen or a table view
so with the table view you can see an
abstract view of all the members that
are in your group and here since we're
encouraging localization we will only
let you to read data of members who are
in your own group now there are also
liability issues here if we want to
implement this feature this is due to
the fact that the divemaster will be
able to monitor all the air of other
people and if there are accidents or
death that is related to air being low
now the divemaster will be responsible
for it so as important as designing the
right application and the right system
it is also very important to choose the
right platform to build our to built
upon so we had a chance to glimpse at
three different candidates we looked at
tiny OS the Android and the iphone sdk
so here in the first figure up top here
we can see that all the underwater nodes
are interconnected and the communication
between the underwater nodes and the
surface notes go through a gateway note
it and that gateway node will convert
radio waves to acoustic wave and vice
versa and the protocol stack is actually
shown here in the second picture and the
details you can actually read in younes
paper which we set it down here and the
important thing to note is the gateway
node was actually recently developed
to on tiny OS so this shows that it is
actually possible to take tiny OS under
water now in order to test and see if
Android is possible to be a platform to
build up on we've tried to run a few
graphic intensive Android application
and one of them being global time in so
what global time is it's a 3d world
clock that was implemented in OpenGL you
can spin the globe around trying to look
at different areas and you can also look
at the time that is corresponding to the
area that you're looking at now other
than graphic intensive applications
we've also looked at the top 50
application in the Android developer
challenge and we were what we're trying
to do is trying to draw connections
between our design and the current
concept out there to see if there is a
potential to trap to try and transition
Android and take it underwater now we
looked at the free family safe where
application where members can cross
check each other's statuses and we also
looked at the ready emergency manager
where devices will stay connected even
if the infrastructure fails we also
looked at social monster which is which
is an application that allows anybody in
the ad hoc network to try to send
messages without using accounts and
based on these applications that we've
seen we can see a potential in you
attempting to use Android as the
platform to develop on for our project
and some of the things that we foresee
Android to support for an emo 2020 are
things like 3d mapping trying to help us
do navigation and positioning and
image matching for photos that are taken
under water and can instantly identify
the different species but there are
actually a few drawbacks with using and
with Android specific implementation and
by that we're referring to the lines of
code that are required that requires the
Android API so we've looked at a few
open source stuff both from the official
Android side as well as third-party
sites and it shows that a large part of
the code have a direct relation with the
Android API so if we look at the notepad
3 code here it turns out that excluding
all these comments eighty-six percent of
these code are Android related and for
this reason it leads us to wonder if
there are actually other platforms out
there that we can look into so we've
actually bumped into the app iphone sdk
we were watching while we were watching
the world wide developer conference
keynote and so it will be another
candidate that we will invest more time
into along with Android so the key
question here really is do we want to
use Android or do we want to use iPhone
as our platform to develop on now even
though what we've been talking about
today relates to the underwater world we
really can abstract these two other ad
hoc networks setting and we can actually
add move this into applications for
search and rescue teams so an example
would be relieved team going into a
disaster area after things like
earthquake typhoon and even hurricanes
like
Katrina and that's the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
