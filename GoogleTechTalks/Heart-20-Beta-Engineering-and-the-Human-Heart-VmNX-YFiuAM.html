point 0 beta right because you know I'm
at Google and I used to have gmail beta
for a long time until I got regular
gmail and so I just I wanted to kind of
refer to this idea that we're trying to
do heart grow heart in it in a new way
and so first what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you a rationale for what
what is cardiac tissue engineering why
do we even want to grow heart in the lab
at all and then give you some background
on the heart itself and then the because
the idea is that in order to grow heart
really well in the lab we need to know
more about the native heart okay so
we'll start with the rationale for why
we want to grow heart in the lab in the
first place then you know kind of go
back and and revisit the heart itself
and then I'll give you some selected and
biased strategies for cardiac tissue
engineering because I'll really be going
through my stuff so it's a very biased
selected strategies for for cardiac
tissue engineering but please feel free
to stop me as we go along makes it much
more fun for me and hopefully more
informative for you alright so it's
always nice to start with some artwork
this is the the Fountain of Youth this
is sort of our inspiration for the field
of tissue engineering I mean you see all
the people kind of coming in on the left
you know hunched over and not doing so
well getting into this beautiful pool
and then getting out on the other side
rejuvenated and the kind of inspiration
for teach the field of tissue
engineering is kind of to search for
this proverbial Fountain of Youth by
being able to grow spare parts for the
human body to help us extend our lives
and so you know the idea is that you
know at some point if we actually you
know are successful that we will be able
to kind of have a one-stop shop for for
organs yeah so two transplants made to
order so to speak so hearts and bones
and cartilage and all kinds of things as
they wear out we can replace them this
is the idea so the motivation for the
heart in particular is
you know heart disease is such a such a
big I mean we all know the statistics
heart disease kills more people than all
cancer combined and is the world globe
Eliza's and the population ages that the
toll is only going to continue to grow
and if you combine that with the hearts
limited ability to regenerate and the
lack of honor organ donors we really
have a strong rationale for being able
to for needing to find new solutions in
addition we have a very limited ability
to test new drugs imagine if every time
you need to drug you need to have a
clinical trial and so that there's a
limited number of people with that as
well and so um if you combine all those
things with it just a basic desire to
study cardiac development we've got a
really strong rationale for wanting to
be able to grow pieces of human heart
without you know or get pieces of human
heart that don't involve using a whole
human that make sense um so it's gotten
some popular press um recently wire did
you had a cover story um much sexier
looking than what my work is on tissue
engineering and then of course it's you
know it's been in the popular press as
well as on I don't know if anyone
recognizes Grey's Anatomy a show that I
watch where they actually
tissue-engineered some cartilage so this
is you know this is this is a topic
that's getting more and more in the
public mind so so how do how do we
actually have we actually grow tissue
the head does anyone in the audience
have any experience and working in a bio
lab or having grown cells ever 50m no ok
so let me let me tell you a little bit
about what it's like to UM to grow
tissue so basically we have you take
cells out of their native environment
and we put them into what we call petri
dishes and if we keep them sterile keep
them moist and you know give them food
we can grow them anything aiders this is
quite well we grow them you know in on
the bottom of the dish and you
can look at them under the microscope in
there they're growing um and this has
been this is kind of the traditional
mode at cell culture for a long time
maybe almost a hundred years the problem
is is that um in order to get these
cells that we grow in a dish or more
complex issues it's much more of a
challenge because you know the petri
dish isn't very much like the human body
um and so the cells are kind of homesick
for their native environment today the
petri dish doesn't feel like what it
would feel it so for a heart cell for
example the petri dish doesn't feel like
what it would feel for that fell inside
the heart and so the cell doesn't
respond the way it would and it
certainly can't build the piece of
tissue and so we need to do better to
copy their natural environment in order
to get them to not just survive but to
thrive and so this is the rationale
behind the the tissue engineering
paradigm which doesn't use um petri
dishes at all but in fact uses
biomaterial scaffold the
three-dimensional pieces so so the big
difference is really that instead of
growing cells on the bottom of the dish
we're growing cells in a 3d environment
three-dimensional and so in order to be
able to do that we have these um five
degradable scaffolds on which we add
cells and give them a lot of you know
schmutz that they need which basically
means growth factors sugars proteins the
things that these cells need to really
grow and mix those into what we call
cell culture media this is like the food
it kind of mimics there's some serum in
their kind of mimics but what the
nutrients that would be provided by the
blood and so we culture solve in this
kind of environment that will do much
better at growing 3d tissues and but
what our lab does that's really that
really we've got a hand buddy yeah that
sounds like you're forming the shape
with a scaffold yes we're forming the
Jeep whereas with a baby somehow the
heart just met with self-assembled
great shape you explain and how that
does that and why so did everybody get
the question so I'm how do we copy
development or it do we copy is that a
paradigm for us to copy development in
the lab of the tissue here in common the
answer is yes and I'm going to kind of
handle that question a little bit later
you've actually showed them some embryos
later in the top so if we don't answer
your question by then I'd be really
happy to talk further um so so yeah we
we definitely look to development
embryonic development specifically for
inspiration for some of the biomaterials
that we choose for this for the growth
factors that we choose to deliver and
also when I was going to what I was
getting to here for the biophysical cues
that we choose to deliver so biophysical
accusing motion has a mechanical stretch
or electrical signal or flow of fluids
so these are shear stresses mechanical
stresses and electrical signals these
this is kind of the revolutionary thing
that's um that's kind of a more recent
development in tissue engineering is
looking just beyond kind of drugs and
chemicals and looking to some of these
with other cues as well and always
looking to nature for inspiration so
nature being either development wound
healing or homeostasis and in fact I'll
I'll have examples from each of those
three three types of of the of systems
so the idea is the biomimetic paradigm
so copying nature because the best the
better that we do at copy nature the
better the cells will do in the lab and
so in the cardiac context um we can two
of the main types of signals that we
that we choose to copy are either the
electrical signals that are involved in
getting a heartbeat or the or the blood
flow through the capillary bed because
cardiac cells are really greedy um
there's a very dense one supply in the
cardiac tissue and so we copy that in
the lab by outfitting the biomaterials
on which we grow the the tissues with
you pierce them with lazers so that
there's holes through which we can slow
the cell culture media so their food
kind of um as much
arm in context with itself and what a
lot of my work has been on has actually
been on the on the on the top here using
electrodes to make many pacemakers to be
able to electrically pace the cells in
the lab and get them to eat and we find
that both of these biophysical cues are
actually quite powerful in getting the
cells to to create better tissues okay
so this is kind of the oh yes question
what is what find better pictures okay
so this is a great question what defines
better tissues and this is a real
challenge for especially for someone
like myself as an engineer coming into a
biological context in which we have very
different such as how to measure and not
only that very different senses of what
what poses a statistical difference than
a measurement and pieces and so
hopefully well as I as I give you
examples of some of the tissues that
we've grown and shown you which ones are
better than others hopefully you'll get
a sense of how we do that but it's kind
of a a bit of a an iterative process so
we see that the tissue is maybe feeding
a little bit more and so then we'll
decide to make a measurement that's
associated with that another question a
scar tissue from heart attack with it so
to everyone here the question is the
goal of tissue engineering to replace
scar tissue and I would actually say the
answer is some it depends on who you ask
so the if there is a goal of cardiac
tissue engineering to kind of make us
band-aid for the heart that you can put
on the heart after heart attack to help
the heart heal but the idea is also to
avoid scar tissue ever having formed in
the first place so in that sense the
answer would be no we're not trying to
replace this cosine to prevent it from
ever having formed um but uh there are
people who are through particularly
studying inflammation respond and
starfish you specifically but this is
not our personal goal in the lab well my
personal goal although colleagues of
ours are focusing on that there another
question okay so um hopefully you have a
general sense of what tissue engineering
is
and and the idea that we're trying to
copy nature in the lab and so now I'm
just going to jump into a little bit of
cardiac physiology to give you a sense
of what are the types of things that we
look to in the heart contacts for
inspiration so the heart right this is
we should look familiar to everybody
right at some point maybe in the past
some bio class in high school the heart
is is a pump in the most simplest terms
its a it takes blood in visit the blue
blood is the deoxygenated blood pumps it
out to the lung where it gets oxygenated
comes back from the lungs and gets
pumped out to the rest of the body
oxygenated so basically what the heart
does is it distributes oxygenated blood
throughout the body and actually so it
needs to be quite strong because you
know if we look at the schematic of
where all of the blood goes in the body
it's it's really quite remarkable that
it's just one one piece of tissue about
the size of it of a human fist that
accomplishes all of this okay and so
this this schematic gives us as a you
know just where in the body that the
blood goes and arteries on this side the
capillary beds and then veins on the
other side I hope this just gives you an
appreciation for the shear strength of
of this muscle okay and in order to be
able to to perform this task given all
the changing you know demands of the
body there there needs to be you would
imagine there's a control system
involved and indeed there is so I just
want to give you a sense you know this
is a standard control system thing you
know diagram where there's a you know
control logic there's sensors there's
effectors there's a control variable all
of these things exist in the body the
heart senses what local demands are
adjusts accordingly and etc okay and so
um the the main of feedback loops to be
able to accomplish this in the body are
not surprisingly between the brain and
the heart
and also the vascular bed and so there's
a feedback loop that involves sensory
nerves as well as autonomic innervation
from the central nervous system that
together accomplished accomplished
control over over the heart rate and
vascular tone so just to say there are
many challenges to the cardiovascular
system okay just sitting down right now
not a huge demand on the heart all right
let's be honest but if you were to stand
up really quickly your heart rate would
really have to change in order to ensure
that you wouldn't faint right or if you
eat a big meal your heart rates going to
change okay running for the bus if you
have a fever your heart rates going to
change but maybe on the order of minutes
to hours as opposed to second needing to
respond so they're different there are
different time scales at which the heart
needs to respond in addition and to just
you know needing to respond so there are
other things if you're training for a
marathon like I was there are much more
long-term changes that the heart needs
to accomplish and so as you might
imagine there are different types of
biological processes that are behind all
of these on all these control systems
and just as a quick overview this is a
zoomed in picture of the cardiac
ganglion so these are nerves in the
heart that that performs some of these
short-term changes longer term changes
on the order of minutes to days are
often accomplished by hormones and then
when you're really talking long-term
changes the heart actually the muscle
itself for models so you can actually
strengthen the muscle itself okay or it
can weaken in response to injury but
we're really going to focus on this talk
on I'm kind of the on the cardiac
control on the second kind of the order
of seconds so this is I just wanted to
show you I mean this is a schematic of
the kind of scary-looking biological map
of cardiac control system so you've got
neurons that come from the central
nervous system that go to the heart you
also have nerves that go from the heart
back to the nervous system okay so it's
a real control control it but what you
really what I really do want
so the simplified version is there's
kind of two things that are going on
you're either in kind of two modes
you're either in the rest or digest mode
which is maybe after launch right so
probably most people are in kind of like
the upper bucket of rest and digest
hopefully I'll do a good job of keeping
you awake and the so this is called the
parasympathetic rest or digest kind of
autonomic nervous system when the
autonomic nervous system parasympathetic
pathways in control this is how you feel
I feel like going asleep and if the
sympathetic nervous system is kind of
taking over this is called this is like
the fight-or-flight responses so pupils
dilate heart starts to beat a lot faster
year there's probably a tiger or maybe
the beep of a smartphone or something
like this that is making you have a
little bit of a panic okay and the idea
is that these two nervous systems are
kind of imbalance they're not it's not
as if one is always on and the other is
not but there's a very careful
modulation of the of the strength of of
these two nervous system that work in
imbalance to have very precise control
over the heart rate and what's
interesting is that although the heart
rate is set by both the breasts or
digest or the fight-or-flight pathways
of the autonomic nervous system they
have very different dynamics okay so um
vagal stimulation which is the parrot
for the thetic pathway so the the
pathway that slows down the heart
actually works much faster at getting
the heart to change its heart rate if
you if you were to really stimulate the
vagus nerve you get the hard to stop
immediately so the heart is much better
at responding to signal the tell to slow
down then to speed up so the sympathetic
pathway the fight or flight is on a much
different I'm a type of time scale okay
but very very exquisite control of the
heart rate we have questions it's a
really interesting question why does it
feel like the opposite um I don't know
this is something that's always
counterintuitive it was very
counterintuitive for me to learn in the
in the bio lab with with the rabbits why
is it so much easier to stop the heart
than to get it to start do keep in mind
so that this is on the this is still on
the order of seconds okay so if we're
looking at sympathetic stimulation this
is still 30 seconds so what you might
feel it's something Fest is actually
probably only going to be one or two and
you could see a big change within that
window but the the vagal stimulation
that parasympathetic pathway is really
like on the order of maybe milliseconds
so so maybe for the human brain to
process it it sort of feels the same to
us and so we always think of gas and
brakes maybe it this is just the human
mind the way that we think but it's
often counterintuitive for people to
learn that in fact the heart can slow
down faster than it can speed up folks
if there's nothing that you remember
after this talk do remember that because
that that's kind of a mind warp okay so
I'm telling you that the heart rate can
change I'm telling you that there's this
control system for doing so but does
anyone know what the pacemaker is in the
heart like what these things are
actually which part of the heart tells
it to beat No yeah pardon the sinus yes
so yes which sign is specifically we
have we actually have to pace makers in
our heart one is the sinoatrial node
which is what our audience member refer
to so I actually don't have a laser
pointer but it's a yellow dot right here
the SA node final adriel note this is a
main pacemaker of the heart this is what
receives the input from those from those
neurons okay the secondary pacemaker of
the heart is on breeding up here the
atrioventricular node so this is the
note that's between the atria of the
heart which receive blood and the
ventricles which pump it out to the rest
of the body okay you might be wondering
why are there two main pacemakers
there's actually a third pacemaker which
is a tertiary pacemaker which are the
these purkinje fibers so the the fibers
that actually oh well here we go so the
fibers that connect the entire ventricle
to each other you're like why do we have
three pacemakers I thought our heart
only beats once but if you know if you
as anyone ever listened
to a heartbeat um in a stethoscope
there's like the lub dub right lub dub
loved up right and the love is the are
the atria beating and the dub are the
ventricles because there is kind of a
two-step feet okay and so there's
actually a built-in delay between when
the atria contract and when the
ventricles contract so this is a really
exquisite control system here so this is
the the most text-heavy slide that we'll
see basically I just want to tell you so
we have these three pacemakers within
the heart and they're ruled by what's
called overdrive suppression ok so the
SA node which is the main pacemaker of
the heart has the fastest beating rate
ok 60 paces 60 beats per second ok per
minute per minute per second oh goodness
that would be like a hummingbird or
something Thank you Thank You audience
there's there's such a wide range of
heart rates actually i think the blue
whale is the slowest and the hummingbird
is the fastest and it's in i cut and
pasted this one line in every paper that
i right but i certainly don't hold it up
here so there's a heart rates are
actually there's quite a range in the
animal kingdom neither here nor there
but the sinoatrial node has the fastest
heart rate ok so that the main pacemaker
the kind of upper management has the
fastest heart rate and the secondary
pacemaker kind of middle management is
the is the atrioventricular node the AV
node so the SA node is always telling
the AV node to beat faster than it would
normally be ok so in this way the essay
known even though it's not the only
pacemaker in the heart is the pacemaker
of the heart does that make sense
because it's always bossing around the
lower levels ok and so when we have
cardiac pathologies a lot of times it's
because that orders been messed up
because maybe one pacemaker usually the
SA node is a little bit out of whack and
then everything else follows ok the
purkinje fibers also have an intrinsic
beating rate but it's much much slower
and so really when when we say the
pacemaker of the heart we really only
mean the SA node but there are there is
intrinsic pacemaker activity in other
parts of the heart as well but who's
actually doing the beating
who is the Peru is the person who is the
character in the heart that's actually
getting it to be and in fact it's these
billions of cardiac myocytes these are
muscle cells and they're really really
amazing you know they're the most
physically active cell in the human body
they're contracting all the time
billions of beats in a lifetime billions
of these cells they really they never
pause to rest and they're just so
they're just so exquisite and not only
that they're beating in synchrony your
entire lifetime and and they almost
never mess up ever and and when they do
there's usually catastrophe associated
with it so these guys are the guys that
are doing all the work um and how do
they do that question yes did everybody
hear that question are these cells
aren't the same ones that we're born
with that beat our entire life answers
yes yeah we've had these shoes since
birth yeah pretty amazing rats when
they're born they're born with three
quarters of the number of heart cells
that they will have for their entire
lifetime so they they replicate one half
time but we are born with our with what
we got so they'll be nice to them
they're pretty expensive um how do they
do this how do they how do they connect
to each other so well they so as anyone
ever built an electrical circuit before
never some of you guys yeah all right so
how do you do it you take wires and you
plug wires to other wires and there are
resistors they're capacitors they're
inductors they're all these little
things like little bits that you can
connect to each other in a breadboard
let's say and they all have different
electrical impedances right so the thing
about the heart is for it to be able to
beat so well in synchrony they need to
be really well connected to each other
and so what's amazing about the heart
cells is that they're very they're very
interconnected to each other not just
mechanically which makes sense because
the heart has to beat all at once but
also electrically because every single
beep is an electrical event and so these
um see the electrical connections
between cardiac cells are these gap
junctions so it
actual physically physical little hole
between each cardiac cell that allow
ions which are the electrical charge in
our bodies to flow between them and so
it's a very very low resistance pathway
compared to nurse is a very different
type of electrical connection than what
you would expect well then what you
would have in the brain let's say okay
so very very fast connections and very
low resistance okay and very very dense
gap junctions so that the cells really
beat as one giant cell together so
they're mechanically and electrically
connected to each other they're also
anisotropically connected to each other
so if you don't know what the word and
eyes tropic means it means that it's
kind of their more connections along a
fiber then across fibers and so what
this accomplishes is a a spatial
resistance so that you have these fibers
as opposed to having a big rectangle
okay so so the electrical signal really
moves along a fiber because there
there's a less resistant down of fiber
than a cross between fibers that Mason
was their question I heard of breathing
okay so well in so that there's a some
tongue for the signal we get right so
did everybody hear that you know does it
take some time it's just signals travel
at the speed of light no no they travel
at um I actually I don't want to put a
number on it but um maybe a meeting on
the order of meters per second is is how
fast and so that's why there's a delay
between some of them the delays are
actually built into the system between
the SA node in the AV node just allowing
for that but I don't want to put a
number on it i'm not sure but it's
certainly not instantaneous and in fact
i'll actually show you a map of how fast
that takes and and that's why there's a
that's why we have an EKG signal is
because that's actually showing the
spatial movement of the electrical
signal so this actually answers your
question so how how does that signal
propagate through the heart and i don't
want to dwell in this for too long but
basically the signal not surprisingly
starts the pacemaker goes to the
secondary
pacemaker and then it's distributed
throughout the heart and this is a very
and a healthy heart this is exactly what
it looks like and this is why and
healthy EKG is going to look the same or
pretty much every individual because it
really does map the electrical signals
that would be on the surface of the skin
okay so it really travels as a single
wavefront the electrical conduction in
the heart it's the action potential so
the electrical signal at each point in
the heart actually is a slightly
different shape for her reasons that we
won't really get into um but they have
to do with the ion channels that are in
each cell so each cell type is a little
bit different so the electrical signal
each part of the heart it's actually a
little bit different but when you add
all the signals up and you also take
into the pump the temporal delay in the
signal this is how you get this
characteristic that you probably heard
you know q r s t so that's the QRS
complex this is something people often
talk about in me and medical drama but
but basically you're adding up these
electrical signal and they some into
into this this familiar-looking EKG that
you would you know see on television so
the electrocardiogram has these five
waves and since they're so
characteristic we can be able we can
perform diagnosis on on people if
they're if that signal is not if it's
perturbed okay so just really quickly I
wanted to go through and show you some
let me read Mia's when we have problems
in the heart they're often tied to these
conduction abnormalities so the heart's
not conducting the way it should be
meaning that there's something wrong
with the with the eye on that the
movement of ions or maybe there's a
problem with the gap junctions between
the cells but with the heart whenever
there's something wrong mechanically it
can almost always be diagnosed
electrically this is an amazing tool
that we have so this is just an example
here of a shortened yaar interval
meaning that the atria the delay between
the atria and the ventricles is a little
bit shorter than it should be we have
what's called a closed conduction loop
this is when gap junctions are kind of
messed up and so you might have
distance that's variable and so if
there's a bit of a block there that's
only temporarily present you can get
what's called a reentrant loop and
believe this is actually a very
dangerous situation because if the heart
is conducting signals in a loop it will
beat out of control and then as you
might imagine and blood is not
efficiently pumped through the body and
so this is often something that happens
in the atria I think this is my next
slide when we have atrial fibrillation
this is something that's that's caused
by these reentrant loops and so what the
what the doctors will often do is find
those that small piece of tissue that's
creating this reentrant loop and
actually just go in there and ablate it
but go in there and kill it if this is
the Cure and so really thinking ahead
maybe instead of thinking about how to
cure the heart by killing pieces of it
maybe we can think about curing the
heart by by growing pieces of it or
curing it right so atrial fibrillation
is actually quite an epidemic right now
with no real cure and it's only getting
worse so right now the only cures are
either ablation or just giving patients
anti thrombin antithrombin medication so
things to prevent them from having clots
because a real risk of having atrial
fibrillation is stroke oh pardon
question oh why is it getting worse
getting worse because our population is
aging and actually it's a it's a big
mystery so the question is why is atrial
fibrillation such an epidemic this is
actually something that people don't
know is it some sort of symptom of
parasympathetic or sympathetic an
imbalance there where maybe people have
too much adrenal fatigue it's it's kind
of a big mystery right now in in that
space not my expertise but at
conferences it comes up a lot um the
ventric vote sorry v-fib ventricular
fibrillation this usually the next step
after this you notice is kind of crazy
kind of creating has cardiac
fibrillation the next step after this
really it's just a flat line this is
very dangerous this is usually but if
this is what someone's EKG looks like
it's probably not going to be an EKG for
much longer so this is when say oh we're
in v-tach up we're in v-fib and they
bring out the defibrillators and the
paddles and everything that's that's
this this is when the ventricles
going crazy oh so the question is how
does how does defibrillation work and
the answer is mystery it's a isn't that
funny so there some people might
disagree with me but my short answer is
unknown basically but the longer short
answer is that defibrillation
depolarizes the entire heart so
basically gets every single cell in the
heart to electrically get excited at the
same time but for mysterious reasons
that can often reset the heart to beat
normally and that that's the mystery
part so we know that the defibrillation
actually gets the entire heart to beat
in synchrony but then for some reason it
can often sort of pick up where you
leave off and and and be okay has anyone
ever been on a dove defibrillator used
on them Wow hey been great fun okay Wow
compared to a fib I've heard it I've
heard it it feels like being kicked by a
big animal I don't know that's how you
describe it but this is how a patient
that I met has described it a lot of
people get defibrillators implanted okay
so heart attack again has a very
characteristic EKG associated with it
which I don't really want to get into
but I do want to say that one thing I do
want to focus on in this slide is that
when we have when someone has my
myocardial infarction this is heart
attack this is when a coronary artery is
occluded so blocked off so a piece of
the heart is not getting oxygen and and
then the heart the heart cells are very
greedy I mean as you might imagine it
takes a lot of energy for them to beat
billions of times in a lifetime right so
they if they don't have oxygen all the
time they're kind of screwed so they die
really fast so anytime that the heart is
exposed to a lack of oxygen those cells
are compromised almost immediately and
because the heart has a really limited
ability to regenerate this is a huge
problem and often leads to kind of a
spiral in in heart disease so this is
though this is all of this to say that
this is our motivation so I'm almost
going to start here
again and say this is the motivation for
cardiac tissue engineering is to kind of
make a patch for the heart make a patch
for the peace of heart that's been
compromised by myocardial infarction
okay and what we're going to do is we're
going to again talk about this
biomimetic paradigm and try and see well
what can we look to in nature to inspire
us to be able to grow this heart in a
good way so looking back on all those
things that we've gone through up until
this point how can we use that knowledge
to be able to grow a piece of tissue
okay and so one of you asked a little
bit earlier about cardiac development so
so one of the inspirations that we
always look to is like well okay how do
we feel the heart well how did the heart
grow in the first place maybe we can get
some inspiration from there and actually
what's interesting is that the heart is
one of the first pieces of the the
embryo to to manifest itself ok so the
you have this tiny tiny embryo in cells
are starting to beat actually and even
before that which is what we're looking
at here there are electrical gradients
within the developing embryo that
recruit cells to grow recruit cells to
what's called a cardiac primitive streak
within the embryo and then the cells
differentiate eventually become the
heart and so is this something that we
can use as an inspiration for growing
heart in the lab it has been for for
some of our studies which I'll show you
another type of inspiration also from
the embryo is electrical currents that
have been measured that are more
pulsatile in nature okay so the one that
I showed you just a moment ago it's more
like a direct current kind of
stimulation so the kind of current that
your smartphone needs to to charge up as
opposed to what you get out of the wall
which is AC or pulsatile in nature right
so these pulsatile signals come a little
bit later in the developing embryo they
be they come when when these cells are
already starting to beat and they're
starting to connect to each other okay
so um for example these are two
aggregates of myself embryonic cell this
is Betty I think from 70 really really
good solid work from from years ago
showing that the signals that are shown
up here are the the electrical signals
from one of the aggregates versus the
other
eventually sitting next to each other
they start to be together the other kind
of feeding apart from each other and
eventually they're beating together so
these pulsatile signals have been imply
have been implicated in how cells learn
to build those gap junctions to each
other how they learn to talk to each
other okay this is a little bit further
along in development when we move on
into homeostasis and injury we have yet
those pulsatile signals that are
associated with all those pacemakers
right we have the pulsatile signals that
are associated with all of those every
time the heart beats so that blip of the
EKG right but what we also have if those
cells are ischemic after myocardial
infarction for example so you know
everybody knows that your body is filled
with salt water right salt water that's
pretty close to what's in the ocean so
what what I often ask my students is you
know what conducts electricity people
say electrons right and say well well
would you ever want to jump in a pool um
well why don't you want the hair dryer
no no that's not how yeah yeah you don't
want to you don't want to be you know
I'm lightning to strike the ocean while
you're in it right and too close to
where the lightning strikes but the
question is does water will conduct
electricity who thinks water conducts
electricity no hands going up who think
ham going up right and and and electrons
obviously connect electricity but what
is it about salt water that makes it
conduct electricity right you got free
ions and that's what we have in our body
and every single cell in your body is
filled with ions because we're filled
with salt water what's interesting is
that the salt water that's inside your
cells is completely different
concentrations of ions than what's
outside the cells so everyone anyone
know how lethal injection works
potassium what
so that alters the osmolality of the
self that is I'm not sure so I'm just
gonna I'm going to deflect and actually
I'm not sure I don't think so I don't
think it changes the osmolality of
itself but it's definitely a different
concentration of potassium than what the
cells want cells are really thirsty for
potassium they hoard it like crazy and
there's barely any potassium in the
extracellular space and this is how
every cell maintains a voltage across it
ours are our bodies use extraordinary
percentages of energy to just maintain
these voltages they're very important
and so lethal injection works by
throwing a bunch of potassium outside
the cells and basically stops the heart
because the voltage across the voltage
of the heart cells is gone and so the
heart can't beat anymore maybe short
circuit yep um so when so basically all
this to say if you've got a cell that's
compromised a cell that's injured it's
probably gonna be leaking ions okay and
so when you have leaking ions that's
current right so this is what we're
going to be looking for for inspiration
from when we're looking about talking
about injury alright so so to give you a
sense here of what we're doing in
cardiac tissue engineering we're looking
for nature for inspiration right and in
different circumstances we're going to
be looking at different kinds of signals
okay so there is a huge amount of work
that needs to be done in order to be
able to really exhaustively study all
this stuff so I'll give you a short
sampling of some of the work that a
biased sample of studies that have been
from my PhD and current work and so
giving an example first sorry this our
research design basically is that we
take different signals and each signal
is going to imply that there's going to
be a different system that we have to
build so it's actually quite a lot of
work that goes into this and then we
have to be able to perform analytics one
of your questions earlier was how do you
know somethings better than something
else okay so all of these are very
interplay with each other because some
analytics that you need to perform imply
that you need a visual line of sight to
the tissue sometimes this isn't possible
when we're growing them and there's a
lot of trade-offs engineering trade-offs
when we're performing this research that
make it fun or frustrating depending on
your perspective so the electrochemistry
of the electron
versus ions comes into play quite a lot
if we have short signals we tend to
ignore them we have long signals long
signals being anything probably longer
than about five milliseconds you need to
perform some work to be able to protect
the cells from any corrosion or any of
the chemical reactions that take place
in order to be able to perform that
transduction so ideal electrodes need to
be biocompatible injecting charge
efficiently and of course not corroding
because then there's evil stuff in the
body or exposed to the cells okay so
early so our example from early
development we have a bioreactor that's
what this is called a little cell
culture system that's outfitted with
electrodes and this is a kind of small
system one millimeter by so for so the
embroidery growing or about one
millimeter in size so we grow a lot of
them together and what we were trying to
study was um whether or not this
performing an electrical signal a lot
like what you would find in development
would help the cells form better cardiac
tissue and your question was how do you
know it's better well we chose to do a
couple of assays assays being analysis
one was we measured fluorescence of
reactive oxygen species which is a
measurement of how well we transduced
the electrical signal and in this case
the measurement was the cells were
glowing okay so this was the way that we
so there was a fluorescent dye
associated with this depression of
reactive oxygen species so every time we
perform a measurement there has to be
some sort of died there has to be some
sort of way to visualize it right and in
this case we visualize it with a
fluorescent dye so it's kind of cool
you're like in the dark at the
microscope performing these like
fluorescent of you know taking all these
pictures we all we felt like darkroom
photographers a lot of fun a lot of work
the other measurement that we did was we
needed another but these stores and dies
all come from me whenever they come from
there's Nobel Prizes associated with
this one unloading clothes finding bugs
no gel yeah some of them actually
lightning bugs and some of them
jellyfish there are animals that create
light bright and these proteins if
they're conjugated with other molecules
you can use them to make other proteins
globe
so these isn't protein for cardiac
troponin so it's a very important
cardiac protein and we were able to see
it because it was conjugated to I don't
know whether that floor for came from
jellyfish or lightning bug but it's
really cool because they glow in the
dark really amazing so it's a lot of fun
to take these pictures and what I would
love to see one day is like a coffee
table book of all these beautiful
abstract images that a scientist locked
up in the dark by ourselves and have no
one to show them to okay so an example
of pulsatile stimulation with embryonic
stem cell I did a lot of work on this um
I the bulk of my PhD work so these
pieces of tissues are about the size of
a mini marshmallow um so Joan we were
there box of computer controlled systems
to be able to perform the electrical
stimulus right and so let me actually
just show you we did a lot of boring
work with comparing different kinds of
electrodes I mean it this was like years
of my life here so compared lots and
lots of different electrodes and thought
how much current went in and you know
then picked one and then used it and
then did all come to other things where
we did lots of modeling and we said okay
well what's what's the electric field
give them look like where we growing
these cells is all like the boring stuff
right because what you really want to do
you want to see how well does it work
right so this is your question how do
you know you did a good job all right so
let me show you a beating piece of
cardiac tissue that was grown without
any electrical stimulation right there
look it's time you see that up in the
upper left hand corner that's which
drink a little bit yeah you're like
squinting it is beating it is beating
but it's not like super dramatic they do
beat even with no electrical signal but
when you give them an electrical signal
they're like happy happy joy joy they're
so cute I mean I think there's a cute
but this so in you answer your question
which one would you say is better right
and so then you so this is the iterative
process in the scientific world how do
you know you did a better job well you
say look I know that that's beating more
then I now have to come up with a
measurement that shows it's beating more
and hopefully when I write it in my
paper there's not going to be some peer
reviewer who says i don't really like
that method and then it's
into like a peer review kind of thing
right so sometimes if there's a new
method it turns into a peer review thing
where you kind of to convince someone
that the way you're measuring something
is correct if it's a method that's kind
of accepted then you use that accepted
method okay so this is kind of like the
scientific process so the you ask a lot
of the you're asking a little hard
questions got is like these pills how do
you know you did a better job well in
this case it's a little obvious but we
actually have to do a lot of matlab
coding just to be able to say that's
better you know in a way that satisfied
us so this is beating each of these say
electrically stimulate wrong and then I
like related environment and then yeah
did everybody hear that question like
what do I mean by electrically stimulate
it I grew those tissues with electrical
stimulation for a week okay and then
they're beating better so let them grow
with stimulation whole time um yeah but
the beating was with Allison and the
beating is also under pacing conditions
so I'm even pacing this little guy and
he's he's he it draw whatever
conclusions you will yeah these are both
being pasted this is the best this guy
can do but if you grow them with that
signal they do much better okay and so
another measurement that we did was you
know again with matlab again with a lot
of this image processing but to be able
to do some strain analysis to be able to
say well how uniform be is that tissue
beating and so yes you can imagine some
reviewers were saying well I don't know
if I like the way you did that strain
analysis and you'd be like well I did it
the pixel age of this picture was you
know and it's a bit iterative there too
so this was another measurement we did
to be able to say they're beating better
right it's not easy in science just say
to have these yes or no question well
it's easier to have a yes/no question
than how much question in biology so
this is a is a real challenge for an
e-type person going into a biomatter
context um so a lot of interesting
conversations there okay so two more
examples one with adult stem cells oh
this is one of my favorite systems
because um it's a question yes
okay so if I get the question right
you're asking do we know if the in on
the individual cell level how well
they're connected to each other or we
just macroscopically measuring the
tissue the answer is we are actually
just macroscopically measuring the
tissue with this assessment what we also
do I mean I'm only showing you a
sampling of how we draw the conclusions
about whether you know how worried how
we did but we also have to zoom in on
the not molecular level but on the
cellular level and we zoom in with
transmission electron microscopy we zoom
in using some of those
immunofluorescence dyes to really tease
out how well our this individual cells
doing because we do need to know that
answer we need to know not just how well
the tissue doing but how well are the
cells doing yeah so very good question I
left that out of here but really happy
to share some of that data with you if
you're interested so talking about the
cellular level actually on the micro
scale we can do some of this work too so
using some micro patterning techniques
with um in this case a transparent
interdigitated electrode of indium tin
oxide is anyone familiar with indium tin
oxide no it's a semiconductor and it's
transparent and so it's really nice
because it's compatible with a lot of
visualization techniques and not only
that because it's really small we can
grow really small pieces of tissue so we
can get some answers on the cellular
level as opposed to the large tissue
level so for several reasons it's really
nice to use some of these smaller scale
systems so again lots of modeling lots
of rainbows the modeling always looks
like rainbows because we're using them
lat both what used to be fem lab is now
calm soul but then we also zoom in on
the south and we say oh goodness look
look when we stimulate these cells
electrically in culture not only do we
have kind of more of them right blue
dots are the nuclei we stained them blue
um so we have more when we're
stimulating us some reason they're
proliferating more um but also these
green dots here are gap junctions okay
gaps at we'd we stayin for gap
junctional protein called connexin43
which is the main the main cardiac
protein and we see that not only are
there more cells but they're better
connected to each other
we can start to hypothesize that maybe
not just in embryonic development but
also in these in vitro systems meaning
systems in the lab that maybe we're
starting to copy some of the right stuff
we had a question yeah oh ten minutes
left good and I'm on my last example
here so um thank you so if we're going
to copy wound healing so we went through
examples where we're copying early
development where we're copying
homeostasis so we're copying a healthy
environment but now what what can we do
to maybe um a piggyback on the body's
natural wound healing responses so for
regeneration right so if we're going to
copy wound healing maybe we also want to
have electrical systems that can copy
what that wound current is like what
it's like when a cell is injured and
anions spill out so we oh but we also
need it that at that level we really
need to have a direct current kind of
system again and direct current systems
are really difficult to build because
their long-duration signals so anything
longer than you know two or five
milliseconds is long in the body right
and so what we have to do here is we
have to actually find a way to shield
the cells which are growing that chamber
up in the top from any of the chemical
reactions that have to take place in
order to create I will create generate
ions from electrons in that saline
solution so there's a saline solution
here power supply comes in and that's
electrons coming in from the wall right
they get chemically reacted to the
silver silver chloride electrode and any
of the you know crap that's generated
that the cell that would kill the cells
kind of stays in there but what we have
our salt bridges that allow just the
ions to move from there to the cells so
we protect the cells so this is like a
lot of engineering challenges that we
have to overcome just in order to be
able to ask that biological question so
there's a real need for I hope I've
giving you a sense this is a real need
for collaboration between engineers and
biologists in this space and chemical
engineers as well because electro
chemistry biology
engineering fabrication techniques all
of these things come into play and no
one person is going to know how to do
any of that stuff so if you look at the
papers that come out in tissue
engineering they're often many people
from very diverse backgrounds who
collaborate so it's a really kind of fun
interdisciplinary field to be in as well
hope I haven't scared you so this is a
really fun project that we did with
human adipose-derived stem cells as
everyone is everyone aware that you have
tons of stem cells and your fat tissue
something most people don't know but we
get these cells from people just line up
to donate their like yes yes you can
give me lipo for science all helps cure
cancer with lipo right so there's like
hmm but you know people are really
excited to donate but we there's plenty
of cells so your adipose tissue healthy
adipose tissue has has lots of stem
cells in it and these stem cells are
pretty powerful they're pretty close to
what you might find in the bone marrow
so what's really nice is M it by it
exposing these cells to a current that's
really close to what a wound current
would be so six volts per centimeter
over four hours do you see how the cells
are moving and assembling themselves and
lining up I mean this is amazing stuff
the a signals really really talk to the
cells and so what's unclear is how that
how that patterning that happens from
the cells and how the that movement of
the cells might correlate to what you
might find in the body with wound
currents okay so this is an open
question this is an active area of
research but it's a lot of fun to do
these experiments because you're really
watching the cells move and they're
really cute again so we can a say we can
assess how much do they move how long
did they get and so then you start doing
some of this image analysis stuff to be
able to answer those questions and what
we saw is that not only well in this
case we have fewer gap junctions purcell
because the cells are moving around they
have to disassociate from each other to
be able to move and so and so then more
questions open up what does that mean
that there are fewer gap junctions
purcell and so then the science
continues and we also did a really nice
experiment this is all very preliminary
stuff with adipose-derived stem cells
from epicardial
fat so there are fat pads around the
heart and their stem cells within those
fat pads and so what we were
hypothesizing is maybe there's a role
for those cells in wound healing as
limited at the cardiac wound healing
process is maybe there's there something
with those cells that we can do and what
was really interesting is that we saw
the same movement and elongation with
these human adipose-derived stem cells
from this epicardial fat um but this is
preliminary stuff published a couple
years back so so what are we what are we
doing kind of now how what is um what
are kind of current developments in this
in this field one thing that people are
doing though this is actually another
example from us where this is in press
right now is I'm beginning to combined
modality so I had said much earlier that
on perfusion like blood so giving greedy
sells lots of food is really important
for cardiac cells as is electrical
stimulation so one thing that that our
group is doing and that other groups are
doing as well is beginning to combine
some of these modalities together saying
well what if we applied electrical
signals and perfusion would that be
better and what we do find what we often
find with biology is that things do not
some linearly okay a plus B some x
equals much bigger than what that some
would be so we're really excited about
some of these results um but then again
you see there's another pretty
complicated-looking bioreactor that we
had to build so there's all this
engineering work that goes into asking
that question and so going forward what
would be really nice and this is another
ongoing product that we have in the lab
is to be able to scale up some of these
systems and you guys at Google probably
care a lot about scalability and in the
tissue engineering context it's
something on people's minds but we're
often building little prototypes all the
time prototypes prototypes but as we
start answering some of these questions
then the what's going to start to happen
is that we're going to need to scale up
not just up to be you know to be able to
build these things to say okay look
we've got some answers we know how to
grow a piece of tissue now how do we
grow 10,000 of them and then the answer
is daar like I don't know so we have to
be able to standardize these culture
systems and be able to fabricate them
and be able to do it in a scalable way
so this is a
is an ongoing project that we have right
now and we're excited about some patents
that we've filed and then finally let's
just say we actually build that patch
then you have to think about how you
actually put it in the body and so
another area that's going to be opening
up soon it's going to be some answering
some of the questions of how do you
actually put it into a body how do you
make sure that it beats along with the
heart that you've attached it to and so
what what might need to happen is
implantation along with a pacemaker but
these are questions that are just
starting to be addressed now and then
finally finally finally if we have all
those questions answered if we finally
scaled everything up and have really
great pieces of a part that we can put
in the body then we've got this other
really hard problem ahead of us which I
would be remiss if I didn't bring up
which is the gap between the laboratory
and the world okay and right now this is
a huge huge issue which I know Google is
very is very aware of is how to get
really good ideas out of the lab and
into the world and so I felt like I
would be remiss without saying that but
this is something that's on on every
scientist mind is in this field is how
do we how do we make it so that even if
we've solved this problem that it
actually gets to help people okay and so
with that I'm going to pause again for
questions and say you know what's you
know maybe we will get one step closer
with regenerative medicine back to our
prometheus you know the BM the Greek god
of who's of who's formed human beings
and open it up again well I should just
say thank everybody and my dogs and New
York and wine and tea and and all those
things that make it possible for
scientists to do their work and finally
you say do you have any more questions I
would be so delighted to answer them and
just thank you so much for your
attention this is a real honor for me
