it's been my pleasure to know Marcus for
quite a while now actually I don't
really remember when was the first time
we met so long we don't even remember
yeah and back in back in the dark ages
and I've had the pleasure to serve on
his committee and now he's the director
of CA are at the Indiana University of
at Bloomington and he's here to visit us
and give us this talk on on click fraud
and bad verte Iseman this this talk is
being recorded for for video so please
if there are any questions that are
there might be google confidential
please hold that until until the very
end Marcus Thank You Bennet this is
connected can y'all hear me so I'm going
to talk about joint work with two of my
students Mona Gandhi and Jacob brackets
we started looking into we didn't think
of it as click for order all we thought
of as a peculiarity that potentially
could be used for fishing and then after
a while we realized that we just used
the wrong terms and this was a matter of
click fraud of course so coming from
that direction we thought of it as fraud
in general of course we don't didn't
want to distinguish between different
kinds of thawed but so we think first of
all email will come in some common
camouflaged form onwards and I'm doing
work with to my students right now that
analyzes different kinds of camouflage
you could of course use things like
Cyrillic characters and JPEGs and you
know see CSS and what have you in order
to make it difficult to for spam filters
to do their job and we done some tests
where we compile a very spammy looking
message and look at the spam assassin
rating and then we have a plugin for
spam assassin that's then uncompelled it
more or less this is a work in progress
and I just mentioned it because I
believe that spam filters on words are
going to have a hard time catching up
you guys might have good ideas of how to
stop that from happening but let's
assume now that the email is going to
get delivered and then as it's going to
get as it's arriving and it's being
viewed then it also views the user so in
particular I have worked with my
students it's them and there's also a
parallel work done at Stanford that
considers how and how a user can be
spied on by having their browser history
interrogated their browser interrogated
and the browser history exposed to just
using CSS tricks and then of course the
email will display in a way that agrees
with the users expectations you know it
will arrive as an arbitrary phishing
email but after having taken a quick
look at the browser history and seeing
that the user goes to bank of america it
will instantly then look like a bank of
america phishing email and but then what
argue is that it won't be that won't be
all but acid it arrives and is being
viewed by the user why not perform a
little bit click fraud to know there's
no reason not to you could fold these
things into each other of course it adds
a complication to the attacker that
takedown of one could result in takedown
of the other but so we should at least
fear that these to piggyback on each
other and e fraud in general becomes
more of a complex issue so this is going
to be redundant for all of you but just
so that you got the my icons right this
is how many point per click schemes work
you got a javascript component that
displays in an image with the banner and
then if there's a click that will result
in another web page in another window
being loaded with the contents here so
here you'll see that I actually
subliminally advertise my research group
stop fishing calm if you go there you'll
find our results so we are not we don't
post advertisement there but
we might one day because it seems like a
profitable activity and so Adsense this
is going to be increasingly redundant
here you don't write to the page of
course you open an iframe which are
we're go girl rights and so that's the
difference that makes the other schemes
vulnerable to our attack but adds
incessant now it's also important to
note that adds can occur in iframes just
as fine so after the click of course
there's an iframe that opens and and
there's the advertisements the
advertisement doesn't know whether it's
been opened in a in a window or an
iframe and now about same origin policy
of course JavaScript from one domain can
read anything displayed in the same
domain so if it's readable if it's
printed in the domain then it's readable
by that javascript in that domain and
that's really the source of the
vulnerability I'm going to describe in
detail now so you got the same point
pay-per-click scheme and then you got
the bad JavaScript and the bad
JavaScript will just plainly go and read
were the good JavaScript printed in the
Indus domain and then cause a click and
the way it causes a click is it's call
it makes a get of exactly the
information that a user would have
called if they if it actually clicked
and so then that of course opens the
window and and it's counted as so as a
click here of course users would find
this very surprising they didn't click
and still the advertisement comes up so
this kind of scheme would probably be
very quickly people complain very
quickly and it would be brought down so
one question then is how could one hide
it from a user and the obvious answer is
you know open a very small iframe one
pixel I frame and that's where you
display the advertisement so that's what
I mean with this Looking Glass that the
user really can't see it but it but it's
there somewhere
and the advertiser of course does not
know the size of the iframe and this is
just to point out that you can't really
screen what the Java scripts are it's
evident that these two pieces of code
are doing the same thing but but of
course it's a little bit hard to tell
because the lower one is is obfuscator
and that's then of course the point that
it's easy to obfuscate JavaScript and so
you can't really look for a JavaScript
components that does a particular thing
if your if your spy during the web it's
not meaningful to look for a particular
piece of JavaScript code that is known
to be bad because they will just change
all the time now another question is how
would lots of traffic come to the site
and the way this is going to be done is
that in breach of the terms of service
of course you'll have one site with a
huge amount of traffic like this x axis
ight and that xxs site will open a small
i frame in which you got stopped fishing
calm now stop fishing calm is allowed to
place advertisements and it doesn't
raise any objections with the with the
advertising portals however these would
not be allowed so what they do is they
they just take all the traffic they get
and they send it to this unbeknownst to
the user of course the user won't see a
small stop fishing window it's all going
to be a teeny tiny tiny iframe so this
just means that you could get a
tremendous amount of traffic to the not
so evil looking site which in fact is
the evil site because that's the site
that perform clicks performs click fraud
and then the question is how would you
hide this from the service provider and
one way one approach would be just use a
CAPTCHA you know users that go to these
sites they're used to jumping through
hoops and they will know that before
they can do any pictures they would have
to solve a CAPTCHA
that would not be an unreasonable
request and so they would enter the
CAPTCHA and it would be verified now
that of course is not going to be as
easy for a spider it's going to require
it could be done but if it's a good
CAPTCHA it's going to be harder and so
that's one way to keep the spiders out
now that's not the ultimate way the
ultimate way is to really look at
something that really only humans would
do that could be the browsing pattern or
something like that making it very hard
to replicate and and if that happens
then you give access to this click fraud
page so once the person coming to the
site has been cleared as a human then
you open this 05 sighs I frame and then
click fraud is started another way to
hide this from the service providers
would be to instead say anybody who
comes to this page here would be
assigned a user ID or something like
that and then if this ID has not been
visited then you would serve the page
that corresponds to click fraud because
a user who arrives there would serve a
new a unique identifier but then when
the advertising company would windy when
there's backward the spidering is
performed the worst by during is
performed that's of course the second
time this idea would be used because
they would go they will check with the
referrers and they will go to the same
URL and then it has been visited already
and then legitimate content would be
served so this is to say that this page
that drives the traffic could behave
differently based on what it sees and so
could this internal page the page that
performs the click fraud it could say
where was it referred from what's the
referrer status also is this an
identifier that has already been used or
not and so on so it could try to figure
out
was Travis traffic coming from this
other site or did it come from a third
party third parties are considered
suspect to the cliq fraudster because
that means potential verification
whereas anybody coming through the XXX
portal would be more likely to be a user
now notice here you guys would not
unless you know something I don't you
would not know where the user really
came from you you would see when the the
click is performed that it came from
stop fishing but you would know the
second level of indirection where who
referred them to that page and so that's
of course exactly the point here now
this could be made arbitrarily complex
so that you have a sequence of sites
that passes identifying information and
it's only if you follow through all of
them that you are then served the cliq
frauding page and that is of course that
will cut some of the the revenue but it
will make it increasingly unlikely for
reverse by during to actually succeed at
finding it out because they won't pass
through the same hoops and particularly
if there's some subscription along the
lines there and then of course it's
obvious that this could be integrated in
spam if you got a somebody who reads
email in a web browser so any kind of
web mail and it's JavaScript enabled the
same things could happen there and now
I'll tell about some related work and
later I'll explain why this relates at
all this is a fishing study that I
performed with a colleague and two of my
students last year and it's to appear in
the ca-siem and there's a preprint
available online what we did is we took
information from a famous social
networking site whose name I promise not
to mention here because of legal
concerns from my legal my legal
department says I cannot say what site
that is but so anyway we scraped that
for lots of social content who knows
whom which is easy and then we performed
two experiments one which we call the
social context experiment and one which
is called which we call the control
experiment in the social context
experiment a user would get an email
that appears to come from a friend of
theirs now we would know that it's a
friend because they have actually posted
on each other's bulletin boards are on
this social networking site information
that makes it obvious that they know
each other so those are the kind of
relationship that we took and from
Indiana University alone we've got
43,000 such relationships now we only
used around 500 which was sufficient we
thought for to get statistical
significance it turned out that it was
much more than significant we thought we
would get a rather small deal but we got
a tremendous yield what we did was that
we sent an email that appeared from a
 from a friend and we said this is
cool check it out and then a link and we
did the same with the control group the
control group it came from a stranger in
the same domain and so then induced
these two groups we counted what people
did if they received the email and click
they were taking to site with login that
was reminiscent of the Indiana
University logins but with some very
obvious differences there's some
exclamation marks here before the
instruction that you must use money that
you must enter your username and
password and the name of the windows
phishing attacks using social networks
and this is not hosted at IU actually it
was but we used we hosted it somewhere
else apparently it but then just did a
redirect and URL gripping so all of this
actually ran on an IU server and as they
entered their username and password we
never touched it but it was sent to be
verified by this indiana university
network server who told it which told us
yes or no so we knew whether they
authenticated correctly or not and then
we counted and we saved it and now we
got the response dynamics as a function
of time here and if you know about the
takedown claims of companies like say
hora they're very proud that they take
down sites within four to five hours
whereas it used to be
five or six days we could see here that
for four or five hours in each bar
corresponds to one hour it's not that
great because the majority of the
victims have already been taken by that
time and you could see here the slumps
here middle of the night and then the
next day which is a saturday there's a
little peek and then after a few days we
stopped because it seemed pointless and
this shows the number of times that
people refresh that's the blue line and
which they did repeat authentication
that's the red line and so there are
some people who did repeat
authentications quite a number of times
I think it's ten counts here and then
there were some people who are refreshed
a tremendous number of times towards
hundred we think that's probably a guy
who received an email from a woman that
he rather liked and he wanted to see
what really this was when people logged
in they were given information saying
that the site is temporarily unavailable
please try again later and this is of
course what made people come back and we
did that not to make a fool lot of
people to see how many times they would
do it but we didn't want them to
complain to their friends and say what
the heck was this but we wanted to them
to hold on a little bit longer in order
to quell complaints and really get the
stats here because remember this was run
in an environment where the subjects of
the study potentially knew each other we
never selected people to people like if
we sent an email apparently from Alice
to Bob we didn't also sent from Bob to
Alice so we weren't intermingling it
that much but they could be roommates
anyway yes Wow question is didn't know
that there were subjects of a study no
no because they would have reacted very
differently after we were done with the
experiment we debriefed them and we set
up a blog which they could vent that and
some of the very common complaints were
why did you not tell me before that I
was going to be taking part in the study
and our response was then it would not
have been a study you know you would not
probably have clicked if we told them
now we're going to make you click and
trick you and see what happens and then
what happens so we didn't and but we did
get approval from the
from the IRB to do this am and we did in
the debriefing face explain exactly what
happened and the fact that their
password were never divulged to anybody
so we got some interesting effects the
these are the gender effects if a guy
got it from a guy he did not really care
that much but if a guy got it from the
woman that was much more interesting and
women were very interested in whether
they got it from a woman or a man it's
it's a clearly more social behavior that
they want to see what their friends are
saying and these these are not the
clicking rates these are the rates for
correctly authenticating the rates to
click on the link in the email and to go
to the site were between five to ten
percent unit higher so here are some
more demographics on this a social
networking site one could get the
political opinion of many of the users
and so we just correlated to the
political opinion and I found something
interesting here people on the extreme
left and the extreme right are more
likely to fall victim to this which to
me means they're crazier which was a
kind of a nice thing to confirm also we
did find that as people got a little bit
older measured by what year in the
program they were there were somewhat
less likely to fall for this and also we
checked based on their major we could
see that computer science students never
fell for it when they when it came from
when it was a controlled study
experiment so if they get it from a
stranger they're not clicking which is
comforting they did fall for it if they
got it from if they appear to get it
from a friend though now people in the
school of education did not distinguish
between friends and unknown people they
click no matter what which makes me a
little bit scared of our future teachers
now I want to mention why is this
related and this is related in the
following so this is a project that I'm
doing in my one of the classes i'm
teaching this semester i split the
students into two groups this is a
rather small class 15 students one of
them are the fishers and the other
groups are
the cliq fraudsters now the cliq
fraudsters they are experimenting with
ways of using social content to increase
the click-through rates so this is an
example of what they will do they will
send an email that appears to come from
the sysadmin and it will explain
something about the potential virus
outbreak and hope that people will click
on this link now the link I don't know
if you could read it it's the URL is WWE
hyphen full scan com to most people and
this is part of other studies we
performed this is perfectly legitimate
this is part of semantics quite
obviously because it's a semantic in
there you might think that it's hard to
register these things but it isn't it
isn't for example I own chase alerts if
you're with chase bank then you could
sign up for alerts every time you
perform a transaction of some kind chase
alert was not taken and I could take it
I also own Oregon chase which is a funny
domain name but if you append JPM as a
sub demand it makes perfect sense and it
looks like JPMorgan Chase so there are
lots of tricks that you could do and
people I believe will do and and which
will cause people to find this perfectly
plausible and actually click and then of
course that feeds back into the previous
things then they will go to a page that
either gives them some legitimate
information in this case it will say
we've scanned your computer and you're
fine don't worry no need to contact us
but then it will cause a click or you
could have other emails and and this is
part of the project related to judge
what kind of emails will get the highest
click-through rates so another one is if
any one of you is using netflix there's
this netflix versus chavez case were
previous netflix users weren't given
enough they weren't given the service
they were promised and so now this is
just to give it service upgrade of some
kind now you could claim something
slightly remarkable in one of these
emails that you sent to anybody and
there's a decent chance that they have
been or are with Netflix and will will
click and there's also a decent chance
that they will click even if they
weren't just
out of curiosity they're surprising
facts about but what people will do and
and so that of course could link to that
and as a social aspect of click fraud
now coming to death defense mechanisms
to this particular attack to the window
within a window attack what you could do
is what I decide to call Nielsen ratings
but it's probably not such an accurate
descriptor what you would have is
plug-ins for some small number of users
that you hope will would be
representative of the user population
and these plugins they will just they
will act like normal they will display
the all information is normal but they
will also open a virtual machine that
will perform exactly the same tasks you
know display the advertisement and so on
and if ever anything is clicked from
inside the virtual machine course you
know that that that was not the user but
it was the material inside there that
clicked itself and so you just trap any
calls for two that would correspond to a
click and then you would report it and
as I'll show in the next slide you don't
have to do this to a large number of
users a very small number is just fine
and and you will probabilistically catch
anybody who wants to learn more than a
couple of cents for check fraud and
another thing to do would be to have
some kind of active spider of course it
should not conform to the robots.txt
standard you should go out there and
look like an actual human and it should
behave as an actual human and also have
integrated in itself any detection
making a detection mechanism the checks
if ads were clicked on now this is quite
a heuristic thing because it could be
that this order click mechanism would be
started only if the user actually clicks
on an advertisement so and in which case
the you would see that this active
spider if it never will click on
anything then it will never detect the
advert the bad verte Iseman Seether so
it it really has to behave
closely as we can to human which is not
a simple task but it's going to be catch
up with the fraudsters this is the much
more laborious probably in the top there
to just have virtual machines planted
every once in a while among the users
that's probably the best because you
have to make sure that the people who
run that act normally so the best way is
for them not to know it obviously but
that's a difficult thing although there
are lots of cases in which this is done
you could have it in a toolbar of some
kind you could have it as an antivirus
filter anything where users are somewhat
likely to deploy it and not ask any
questions and where the user agreements
allow you to do this now in another
study I run with another student we were
doing a man-in-the-middle attack on on
ebay and we had all kinds of clearance
and we were allowed to do it we just
tested it on our machines my student
machine in my machine and we showed it
to the people in the IRB because they
were curious of exactly how would it
work but never to any outsiders and then
one day the feds contact the computer
science department and asked them to
yank the cord to that computer and we
were very surprised how do they know
about it turns out that norton utilities
reported that there was something bad on
the machine that was potentially going
to do bad things to ebay and we don't
know if it went directly to the feds or
via ebay but we know that it was taken
down rather quickly and so there are
precedents as for where people put
things that weren't known or intended by
the user but which performs some kind of
good for society and this would be one
case now looking at the economic
analysis of this day there are a couple
of curves here the topmost curve
corresponds to a detection probability
of one in a million the next one is one
in 10,000 and then you got one in a
thousand and these two graphs here that
is for 25 cents per click and one dollar
per click and what it really plots is
here's on the y-axis it's the profit for
the attacker
and on the x-axis is a number of users
targeted and you could see that if he
targets too many users well this profit
goes very small on average so this is
the expected profit he would be best off
here maximizing it around here for the
one in a million attack in which case he
would earn almost six thousand dollars
per instance of the attack now of course
what he could do is he could have many
instances with independent websites that
would do this and if one was take taken
down that would not lead the defenders
to the others and so he would collect
for those that he manages to keep up you
would collect five thousand so that's a
little bit too much on the other hand if
you have one in 10,000 you could see
that the profit goes down quite
remarkably so so this is just arguing
that a probabilistic defense mechanism
works very well now I know you don't
need it because you're not vulnerable to
this but people who are vulnerable to it
would probably not want to retool it all
that they're doing and perhaps pay
licensing fees to Google but instead
they would want to say okay what can we
do on the side in order to prevent this
and also here using these probabilistic
detection mechanisms you could have a
third party just interested in what's
going on and perhaps on their own behalf
because they place advertisements or
because they sell this information to
some other company that do place
advertisements that just run it as some
kind of service and just place it in
their their plug-in and you'll see that
it's not quite worth it for the attacker
after a while so we think the fixes are
rather simple it doesn't require a lot
of changes and you still get a
reasonable protection now that more or
less and my presentation I got a couple
of links here if you go to the first
link you'll generate some advertising
revenue not just kidding but that's
where my group puts all of the results
related into fishing and if you look
under papers and other at the bottom of
that page you'll see the paper
describing these techniques that I
they showed here there so obviously it's
not a fishing results and that's why
it's not on the main page but you might
be interested in a fishing results too
we're running a lot of user studies and
psychological tests and we find some
pretty remarkable things about why
people will do things that they do so
recently ran a test in which people were
to rate various stimuli and at the same
time using a think-aloud protocol that
they will say what they're thinking
people might say oh nice shiny ssl lock
I like the vibes on this site and ooh
that's a strange thing and I don't like
this URL and so on and then we sit
afterwards and analyze exactly what made
people come to their conclusion and we
find some pretty astonishing reasons why
people make decisions about fishing
which I think also might be applicable
to click for it to some extent and it's
only way that is not yet up there but if
you're interested I could send you a
presentation that i'm going to give this
afternoon at itt see you could also look
this is more a corporate blog and have a
small start-up on the side so you could
go there and look at our things the
third one is my webpage and if you go
there i liked you to tell you whom
you're banking with except if you're
banking with one of those banks that
don't like this experiment and will
contact it means that take us off the
list and then you won't know anything or
if you haven't been doing online banking
for the last nine days or cleared your
history something like that then we
won't know of course but otherwise
you'll tell you so anyway I'm completed
what I wanted to say and I want to give
you guys an opportunity to grill me
a hundred different audiences that are
the fishing department education
university +
looked at the painting strategies to
sort of and you think that
the question is how we live the
strategist to educate users who are in
vulnerable groups we have but we don't
have anything nice to report in fact we
can very clearly show that education is
useless I mean it's a sad thing to be
said from a person working in a
university but it's absolutely useless
in fact it could harm we've run some
tests that could show how occasionally
efforts could benefit attackers for
example if you run a very aggressive
anti-malware campaign if you're if
you're a bank say and you do that to all
your users then what the Fisher will do
is they will send an email saying this
is the latest patch and please download
it and of course it's a keylogger so for
every educational effort we could find
some kind of draw back and also the
rules are so complex that average users
can't understand it what people do they
match patterns and they look for for
example things like we need your
password now they don't like that and
recently with the chase rewards attack i
don't know i know i mean in oh it's
you get 20 bucks for filling out a
report and then the price went up to 50
and now it's up at 100 you fill out a
survey and then of course in order to
get the money you need to say what's
your account number is and you need to
authenticate and so on that's one step
of indirection was very successful in
the beginning but now I stopped working
and so if you are really into if you
believe that you want to do make a
killing and fishing you need a new
psychological trick and a trick that
doesn't make it seem like you're asking
for something right up front and then
it's going to work for example our man
in the middle ebay study would just send
some you might be interested in this
thing knowing the history of the person
and then they would actually get to
browse around there and see some
remarkable prices because we would do
filtering of the price so that
everything looks very rosy and when they
want to pay well then they're already
five minutes away from the phishing
email and they feel perfectly
comfortable with this site and so I
think that is the strategy education is
one of those things that we feel should
be left out
pretty much yes daddy of having a
website that has two versions one of
them would automatically click the link
and another one wouldn't it just
electric excitement has been explode
before and by a bomb he also deeper
depth of 99 I just want to know how
you're there click spam attack would
compare
okay so the point is that configuring
content based on based on who is coming
there has been done before and actually
I'm you mentioned an academic paper I'm
also aware of actual instances of it
beam BMW Germany were banned from google
for a while because they serve two
different pages 12 users and one to
reverse spiders and so yes this this has
been done in many ways that's not really
the novelty of the paper the novelty is
just to make use of it in the most evil
possible fashion to to really squeeze
the most out of that but that's a good
point that that's something that people
have understood before yes so in
education as a work is there some first
stopping phishing sites is there
something that can be done in the
browser to to make it more obvious that
this fake debate site is in fact a fake
eBay site about the actual eBay site
the good students can you do something
in the browser like a plug-in for
example that would help people
understand it and yes that's a good way
to do it and that's there are several
initiatives on the way that would would
in fact do that one troublesome
direction of fishing these days though
is that it tries to avoid email and web
browsers and do it all by phone for
example or complemented by phone call
that you get a voicemail when you come
home saying we will soon send you an
email and please follow the instructions
in the email and there's no reason for
alert but just to make you aware that
this is an authentic email and then the
same day you do get an email and both of
these of course from the fraudster and
that one will say no please don't follow
links because links have a risk but
instead type in your browser this
address and you know you could get away
with a lot if you actually get the user
on your side to follow up is there some
way
absent any following the Blitz is there
some way some neck be done in the
browser to detect based on the URL you
typed it in the contents of the page
maybe some red so people the question is
can you do something based on the
content in the URL and yes Microsoft has
an effort in which they blacklist URLs
now that is not going to cost a lot of
harm to attackers because their sites
are only up for a couple of hours anyway
and so one common countermeasure is to
just say if it's an IP address instead
of a nice-looking URL then that will
require particular scrutiny it doesn't
really matter because users it turns out
don't like IP addresses they're very
very suspicious of IP addresses that's
one of the things that people are able
to determine that this is an IP address
it's not a normal URL whereas different
kinds of normal looking URLs they're
indistinguishable to users so probably
these kind of filters would do decent
job of countering some of the attacks
but not all and also heuristic
content-based it doesn't quite work
because you could do tweaking of various
kinds with the access the Whois
information for the remaining parent
the domain name that's good but it
requires a lot of smarts to realize okay
sorry the question is using who is it
requires a lot of smarts and it doesn't
always work for example there's one
attack that we developed in order to say
that context should not matter for
attackers we developed all these
techniques to say how to get the context
of whom you're banking with and then we
took it step back and said well let's
find a way to making it context not
matter and so we developed what we call
the switch to citibank spoof in which
you get an email saying this is from
citibank you're not one of our customers
as far as we know and but we want you to
be a customer of ours we're so proud of
our services that will match and what
you're putting in today up to fifty
dollars just follow this link and
transfer money from your existing bank
account and so then you get everybody
who are not with citibank thinking that
this is legitimate and that's a much
larger group than those who are with
citibank and that is more difficult to
deal with because the logos could be
slightly different it could be a new
switch to citibank logo and that would
still make users feel comfortable
whereas it would be hard to match back
to citibank in an automated fashion
complicated
how
the papabili
the question is do attacks make good
money still or do they have to be more
complex in order to work they make very
good money still I'm when I'm speaking
of more complex attacks that's really
just saying if you were an attacker
would you rather have a yield of one
percent or six per cents and you know
it's all about when you retire so I
think it could be more complex and also
they want to get out of there quickly
you know expose themselves as little as
they can so they want to do a quick job
but the tax definitely there are two
kinds the advanced attack which are from
people who know what they're doing and
may even have an education that is very
relevant to it and then there's a set of
attacks which is the larger set that are
just copycat attacks and we actually
have efforts to distinguish copycats
from original attacks to just out of an
academic interest to see is this the
same person doing it again or is it
somebody else who did it but didn't
quite do it very well and I've got one
example that the chase fishing a chase
rewards attack turned into one more
rewards attack soon afterwards now the
chase attackers they were very clever
with the URLs the one who attackers
weren't in fact as soon as i saw this
attack i went out and i registered one
more rewards com and i still have it so
that tells you how aggressive the
financial institutions are in demanding
things to be transferred and so I didn't
do it in order to profit from it of
course but I did it to just convince
myself that these people who did the one
who attack we're doing a sloppy job and
I could have done a better job and it's
not the same people and and so whether
that is going to be a commercial
interest or not it's of interest to us
to understand the community of fishers
think we've exhausted all the questions
