of question copyright org and I just
want to give a very brief introduction I
won't get too much in between you and
Rick just to explain what he's doing
here when we first called Rick and asked
him if he'd like to come to America and
give some talks on what the Pirate Party
is about and what it's doing we expected
to have to twist his arm a little bit
but to our very pleasant surprise he
agreed immediately to come and I
wondered why because I mean he's running
for election in Europe and how many
Swedish voters really are there in the
Bay Area I don't know there might be one
right there
but it's it's not exactly your first
choice for getting elected in Sweden but
the reason he came is that the party's
mission is worldwide reform of copyright
and patent policy and the party fully
understands the shall we say
concentrating effect that electoral
victory in Sweden would have on
Parliament's throughout Europe and even
in the United States it would be a very
big effect which brings me to my next
point
political donations in Sweden are not
regulated and anonymity is the default
for donations to the pirate party when
Rick and I were up at ozk on The
O'Reilly opensource convention in
Portland last week he gave a keynote
essentially a very compressed version of
this talk with a lot of the details left
out people literally came up to the
stage and pressed money into his hands
after that keynote I saw it happen if
you weren't able to be at AHS con but
you would like to do that too you should
feel free to do it today and Rick will
be giving you some more details and a
URL about how you can donate if you
don't feel like pressing cash into his
bare palms today the pirate party is a
very good cause they're tremendously
effective and if they manage to get into
Parliament in sweetener in the European
Parliament it will do a lot to help
copyright reform in Europe and in the
United States thank you and without
further ado Rick Faulk linga of the
Swedish pirate party
thanks Carl
so my talk today is titled copyright
regime versus civil liberties it might
as well have been titled copyright
industry versus the future how many of
you guys in here have heard of the
pirate party in Sweden before today
Johansson
but two-thirds I'm happy how many of you
were asked on and heard my talk there
too
okay so you're not so you're gonna see a
little bit like you saw a task on but
not most of it is new so a little bit
about Who I am and why I'm wearing
clothes saying pirate that might sound a
little bit silly in January of 2006 I
set up a web page for a prototype new
political party called the pirate party
advocating copyright and patent reform
it basically blew up in my face very
very quickly became a real party
registered with the election authority
went on the ballot in June of last year
we had a breakthrough media mainstream
awareness and in September we had a
first election we got a popular voting
assault of 0.63% I had hoped for more
but it turns out that that put us in the
top 10 results which even was a record
for a party founded on election year
we are particularly strong among the
young voters which can be seen in our
youth section which is not ranked number
four nationally and they had have had a
30% growth in just the past six months
so we're seeing a lot of interest in
these issues we're seeing a lot of
uptake we're very much influencing the
debate whenever there's something about
file-sharing it takes about five minutes
from for example a verdict and an
important court case until media causes
so what is this about them
why do you found a Pirate Party
what is the file-sharing debate about
well the copier industry likes to talk
about economic principles as in
file-sharing hurts our profits and then
somebody comes and says now it doesn't
yes it does
no it doesn't yes it does no it doesn't
and it becomes sort of a trench warfare
discussion where it's a lot of he says
she says he says she says and when you
have just a lot of conflicting
conflicting reports with opposite
conclusions you kind of lose the
audience the whole thing becomes pretty
boring so what we are saying is that
copyright at its heart is a commercial
monopoly when it was created it was
created to distribute books to
bookstores by horse and cart and the key
thing there is that if you found an
infraction of copyright you can find a
you could find a copied book in a
bookstore you could see an unauthorized
concert not paying lines money and the
key here is that you found those in
public places with the naked eye today
however copyright has crept into my
private communications it is illegal for
me to send a piece of music in email to
you guys it is illegal if we are in a
chat channel
to drop a video clip there and if
copyright is to be enforced in this new
environment then that means all private
communications must be monitored for
copyright in fractions that means out
costs the PO so secret that means law
enforcement and corporate interest
groups must monitor everyone and zero
that leaves my computer and that
includes looking at letters to my lawyer
and doctor and wife I'm frankly not
prepared to give them that right and it
gets worse the copyright industry is now
lobbying for ISPs to be liable for what
their users do on the net and there goes
another very important principle called
the common common carrier principle
which says that the messenger is never
responsible for the contents of the
message
imagine if the US Postal Service would
be held liable for what you send in
letters this is what the copyright
industry is lobbying for and they're
taking advantage of the fact that
politicians are clueless about what new
technology means so our poor Lady
Justice has a problem on one side of the
scale you have one income source for one
entertainment industry essentially a
luxe luxury consumption in our society
on the other side of the scale you have
two foundations of our democracy
hmm
so it actually gets even worse if you
abandon the postal secret and allow
corporate interest groups or for that
matter law enforcement takes examined
private communications out go because
whistleblower protection no matter what
those people investigating the
communications can or cannot do with it
if you uncover scandal and mail a report
about it somebody will have read that
mail on route and if it's juicy enough
there's not just no way that person can
forget what he or she read it's been
read it cannot be unread and the
whistleblower protection is gone and by
extension freedom of the press becomes
something basically just a piece of oops
basically just a piece of paper because
if you can't have any sources inside
government telling you about things that
things that don't work or officials that
are misbehaving or trust that is being
broken what are you gonna write about
this week's horoscope
it gets even worse actually if you know
you're being monitored you tend to put a
little bit of selfish restrain on
yourself you tend to not say the things
that you typically would have said when
you know that you're not monitored and
this wasn't this actually gets very
important because particularly for some
people I was at the gay pride parade in
Stockholm and I was sort of toying
around with this for me perfectly
logical rational argument that if you
don't have access to private
communications as an unmonitored private
communications then you lose your right
to form an identity because your
identity is formed in a very private
exchange between you and friends and
when I threw this argument out at the
Pride Park which is just next to the
parade and discuss with people there I
could see it hit them very hard and
emotionally what had been just rational
for me what became an extremely
emotional moment for these people when
the penny dropped you could see them
just relive what they had been through
as part of really as part of discovering
their identity in an unofficial poll
later among this crowd by the way we got
20% so these people understand what
privacy is about so the copyright
industry will jump would like you to
believe that it is somehow about right
to profits that the file-sharing debate
is about percentages about graphs on a
piece of paper it is not it is about
vital civil liberties that need to be
eroded or abolished
in order to maintain their old crumbling
monopolies and this is the message that
we've started to get out in Sweden and
to paint a picture of this going back to
the history of copyright once upon a
time when the universe was vast
uninhabited and mostly tax-free actually
I'm going to fast forward a bit to the
Catholic Church and just before the last
turn of the millennium 9 around 900
there was one source of culture and
knowledge and that single source was the
church the communication was top to
bottom you had one source that
communicated out to the masses and this
is kind of important because if you can
control somebody's culture and knowledge
you don't need to lobby for a single law
you control the world time past printing
press arrived late 1400s spread across
Europe all of a sudden you had multiple
sources of information and people could
start to pick and choose what they
actually wanted to listen to there was
still this old model of one tiny source
community communicating to the masses
but you're the multiple sources this
annoyed people
from the 1400s it took about 80 years
for the royal courts to start reacting
and I'm going to focus on the UK from
here on as this is where copyright
originated and 1554 a royal mandate went
out that a monopoly should be formed
that was called the London company of
stationers their role was to print all
the books that authors wanted except for
those which the crown didn't want which
should be burnt instead so they were
essentially a private police force that
had the authority and the duty to censor
on behalf of the crown they also they
were also authorized to burn books
printed Brian unauthorised printing shop
and they did so on several occasions so
what happened here was that you had
instituted a censorship all of a sudden
across Europe you also introduced
responsible publishers that is the
people at the top of this pyramid
started to be held accountable for what
they were printing so it was sort of
okay to not have as much control over
the culture and knowledge communicated
to the masses as long as somebody didn't
communicate the wrong piece of knowledge
and culture in case nasty things
happened
another couple of years past the
Parliament in UK basically said to the
London company of stationers which had
now been a censoring private Polly for
police force with all the huge
popularity that went along with that
task that okay guys we've changed our
months we now believe in freedom of the
press sorry your ma your monopoly is
about to expire which these guys didn't
like very much so what they did when
being told that authors are now going to
be in control of their works was the
sort of think about okay how can we
maintain our monopolies how can we like
pretend to give the power to the authors
but still keep it so what they did was
to go to Parliament and argue that okay
if we're okay with authors getting this
right but wishing we think they should
have a monopoly on printing these books
on printing their work and that should
be pretty much like property and hence
the term intellectual property was
coined
and if it's property then that means it
can be bought and sold like to us so we
can buy this monopoly to authors which
well I don't know maybe need us to print
their books so the key here is that and
this is what happened and this might
have been a very rational and perhaps
even the correct response for Parliament
pass in 1709 which took effect in 1710
but it's interesting to see that the the
exact same argument is being proposed
today for this things have kind of
changed in 300 years so the key here is
that copyright while written into law
that it's supposed to be for the benefit
of the author never was it was for the
benefit of the distributors it was
created and it was lobbied by the old
monopolies as a way for that monopoly
to remain even after the author's had
supposedly cognate instead and it's not
it's interesting also that this was
originally a time limited monopoly 14
years extendable for another 14 to 20 to
28 it's notable that the this state
London company of stationers actually
claimed that even after these works had
expired into the public domain they
still owned the property they still
don't Eamon ah Polly some things just
never do change do they
whereas today the situation is a nice
yummy bowl of pasta with pesto on top no
sorry
today everybody is talking to one
another in a completely organic fashion
in a completely unstructured fashion and
this is the key thing with no more
central point of control there is no
longer anybody to hold accountable if
the wrong piece of cultural knowledge
should happen to spread you might find
one leak you might pretend that there's
still this top-down communication but
when everybody is talking to one another
that's trying to shoehorn an old model
into a new reality so that's my brief
talk of where we came to be so I'm gonna
skip past all this how it came into the
u.s. because it's really not relevant it
hasn't changed that much
since the statute of Anne and
distributors lobbying Parliament now
Congress for better monopolies what
we're saying is that okay there might be
some business models that require a time
limit of monopolies like I can imagine a
200 billion dollar movie or Hollywood
might want some sort of time limited
monopoly in order to get all of that
venture capital but that monopoly must
really not stretch into my private
communication I'm sorry about the box
tops there so we're saying that we're
returning copyright to its commercial
origins we're also saying that a
timespan of life of the author Plus 70
years is not reasonable and most of all
we're saying that non-commercial usage
must be let free we're saying that cou
non-commercial call
action usage derivation and spread of
knowledge and culture must be let free
in order to really take advantage of and
harness the information society we are
now entering we have as vision a society
where every citizen has 24 by access 24
by 7 access to all of humanity's
collective knowledge and culture
anywhere that is a huge leap forward the
this is not it is not a bad thing that
the copyright industry has to take a
step back this is a much larger leap
ahead than when Public Libraries arrived
about 150 years ago and it is now
enabled by today's technology
like I said the copyright industry is
fighting tooth and nail to not have to
change but technology has always changed
Society in Stockholm where I come from
which is the capital of Sweden the
largest employer in the entire city a
hundred years ago was named Stockholm
ice they cut up the ice on the lakes in
wintertime stored them in huge huge huge
barns cut them up and distributing them
to ice boxes during the rest of the year
two households they don't really add
much value today with the advent of
electricity and the electric
refrigerator they're gone and new new
jobs have come to take her place that's
the way it's always been and I think
it's a safe bet that that's what they
that's the way it'll always be
so with this we're seeing a lot a lot of
interesting new business models and I'm
sort of doing the comparison with the
dating service here just because a
exchange is non-commercial doesn't mean
that the change can't be commercially
facilitated like if I were to date
somebody in here that would be
non-commercial even if I had subscribed
to a dating service and he or she had
subscribed to a dating service on
commercial grounds the date itself would
still be non-commercial as opposed to
paying for a date and associated
activities which is usually not which is
commercial and not always encouraged
so I can see lots of new business
opportunities coming along in just a few
years with copyright reform and I mean
I'm at Google so I'm not going to tell
you
and here's the sad part politicians
genuinely do not understand this they
are too preoccupied with their
healthcare with their defense with their
energy policy schools and so on and so
forth heck they've just woken up to
something known as the environment so we
sort of thought that the only way would
be to do something else and another
problem is that the copyright industry
understands this perfectly you think
they're clueless and they look clueless
they are very good at looking clueless
but when you look at what they lobby for
it turns out that they're quite the
opposite and I'm gonna give you two
examples first the in Brussels which is
the European equivalent of Washington DC
they were recently lobbying for
amendments to a bill that would give
four years in prison just for accepting
file-sharing this was thought to be
aimed at the ISP level and four years in
prison that is a magical limit in Europe
which would have given them unlimited
access to warrantless wiretapping in
most states of Europe like I said there
goes the postal secret they understand
this
they're also I'm going to give you
another anecdote from a copyright
industry insiders seminar that I
intended in Stockholm they sent out an
open invitation so a lot of pirates came
there in suit and tie and everything
like my vice-chairman says if you can't
convince them at least confuse them
and the Danish head honcho went up on
stage and said that you know guys
politicians really don't understand
file-sharing we're in perfect agreement
so far so he said what we need to do is
to filter the Internet but since
politicians don't understand
file-sharing we need to associate
file-sharing with child pornography
because politicians understand child
pornography and this is how unscrupulous
and cynical these people are this was in
May 29 you may recall that at the
beginning of June the Pirate Bay was
nearly shut down because of vague
allegations about child pornography that
never ever never ever manifested and was
drawn back in a flurry of outrage might
been a coincidence but like designers
wrote that coincidences can be dangerous
things so our solution was to bypass the
politicians since they didn't care we
headed straight for the voters and
challenged the original politicians on
election day at the polls and frankly I
think we did pretty well our platform
summed up briefly
like I said non-commercial use must be
debt-free
copyright has no place in my private
mail in my private ones and zeros
commercial commercial copyright term
should be shortened quite drastically we
proposed a five-year term from
publication thus just putting a stake in
the ground though it might be three
years in might be seven might be 10 it
might be slightly different depending on
different causes we're just saying that
it needs to be shortened 7 years after
the lifetime of the author is from my
personal perspective infinity since I
will not be alive to see any work that
is created during my lifetime entered
the public domain
attribution is good we really like
attribution it is the key it is the
reason for many many many artists to
create works in the first place
DRM is evil we base we're basically
saying that DRM is corporations writing
and arbitrarily enforcing their own
copyright laws we have a parliament to
write such laws thank you very much
parents are evil they range from totally
useless to immoral to more or less
diabolical privacy is good due process
is good and transparent government is
even better and this is the whole of our
platform we do not take a stand on
things where we do not add value to the
debate we want to add things to the
debate and bring things into Parliament
that the current crop of politicians do
not understand and this is actually a
strength and not a weakness I'm gonna
and I'm gonna tell you why a little
while what's important about this is
that every single business model based
on copyright that makes money today will
make money with these changes
implemented the only difference is that
millions of people will not be criminals
parents however since we are advocating
the complete abolition of parents a
couple of people might have a problem
but I don't think they'll be too much
missed so what we've done so far is that
we've after the election we've started
to influence the other parties in Sweden
people parties are now coming to us and
asking guys I'm sorry but we eat we
really don't understand this issue do
you think maybe if you buy a lunch you
could explain it to us of course we do I
mean we wanted this the whole time now
you tell us what did you tell us a year
ago and we wouldn't have to go through
all this trouble so anyway yeah we've
started to influence the other parties
the Norwegian party a Norwegian Liberal
Party even went as far as to copy our
entire stance of platform stance on
copyright top to bottom they just
translated it and adopted it unanimously
that's that's how idea should spread
they fucked up that form into Norwegian
yeah actually actually they did this one
week after April first and that was such
bad timing
I would love to for them to do it one
week before April Fool's so we could
issue a press release on April 1st
saying that we would sue them for
copyright infringement over this bad
timing anyway and I mean the youth
sections of the other parties are
totally on our side we usually joke that
we don't have one youth section we have
eight we've built an organisation on
Election Day last year we had 2,000
volunteers covering 93% of the polling
stations nationwide I'm extremely happy
with that number and remember now that
this was all done on a volunteer basis
they didn't just chip in their own time
and money time and energy they also
chipped in their own money when we said
that okay guys go ahead go and hand out
flyers on the street here and they said
okay so who's gonna pay for printing and
we said you are here's the PDF and it it
happened and we had to record first
election and give you two more numbers
my personal candidacy for Swedish
parliament came in at ranked 15 out of
over 5,000 and 700 candidates across all
parties now I didn't get I didn't win
that seat because the party didn't get
enough votes we didn't cross that
threshold about 4% but it tells you
something about how strongly people do
feel about these issues another number
is that in the school mock elections
which are held parallel to the real
elections we got four and a half percent
and what's notable about that is that
we were not on the skooled ballot so
those sort of alright in votes so we are
very very strong among people who
understand this which are usually the
very young people if you look at our
membership roster we peak in the college
ages so coming back to why we have a
narrow platform
how can a 4% party have any influence
when you have 15 people in a chamber of
349 would a pirate cap on their head
going har-har-har-har har-har-har in
every debate
how can you contain yourself well
there's actually a plan behind this in
Sweden there are always there are two
bloc's of parties the Socialists and the
bourgeois bloc that are always very tied
in elections it's the the elections go
one way or the other just by 1% or less
usually and imagine now that a 4% party
would come in as a wedge between these
two that means both of them would need
us in order to form a majority coalition
that means we get to sit down and play
who wants to be a prime minister
and the price of that office will be an
intellectual property reform that's also
why we don't have a stance on everything
else because that lets us vote with that
block on everything else without giving
anything up so we're saying that okay
guys here's our platform adopt this and
we'll accept whatever you have and
remember now we're only saying that our
stance is more important than the
difference between these two blocks one
178 percent unemployment benefit one
once eighty who cares that's when our
message and it's actually quite strong I
think and why Sweden then the numbers
you see up on screen is global
production the total global production
yearly is sixty trillion dollars out of
those the US account for twelve the
European Union account for exactly as
much as just differs by a fraction or
percent and China can't account for ten
this is important important as it means
that the US corporate Lobby cannot
threaten trade sanctions against Europe
like they would be able to do with for
example burkina faso which is
economically weaker than the US by much
and another reason is that in Europe
copyright laws are actually at the state
level they are not at the federal level
which means that Sweden is at liberty to
change its copyright laws while yet
while all the time enjoying the shield
from trade sanctions that Europe gives
so I'm going to argue that the best and
easiest way to get around an
intellectual property reform in the u.s.
is to take the scenic route through
Europe because once one or a couple of
countries changes their stance then I
mean the whole system will need to
change dramatically and pretty much
immediately so we have two elections
coming up the first is the European
election in 2009 about two years from
today and to give you a picture of our
chances there I told you that we had no
I didn't tell you we had 35 K votes in
the last national election we're going
to get another 35 K from the school
election people who come of voting age
that gives us 70 K votes we need 100 K
votes to put people into European
Parliament that means we need to grow by
50% counting from September of last year
and remember that graph and the start
now our youth section has grown by 30%
in just the past six months the numbers
very clearly suggest but we can do this
we can really do this
and then comes the national election in
2010 which would let us pray play this
who wants to be Prime Minister game and
to round this off like Carl mentioned
previously campaign elections mean
election campaigns mean election
campaign funding donations to political
parties in Sweden are not regulated
anybody is free to donate
anonymously if desired we treat all and
all donations as anonymous by default
and we will not confirm nor deny in a
particular contributor if you're
interested in donating there is a folder
looks like this placed at the table at
the end here and around the corner it
contains the a summary of what I've said
in this keynote as well as as some more
information it's called the contributors
brief and the same information is
available at this URL
WP our party is a pirate party it is
pirate party in Swedish pretty much the
same words / donate
so that's it let's go change the world
so questions yep hands are coming up
thank you for letting me talk about this
so the question was without patents how
will pharmaceutical companies be able to
fund research this like you notice this
was mostly focused on copyright I could
talk equally long and as long again
about patents but to cut it fairly short
v 80% of the pharma company revenue
comes from public funding pharma
companies claim that they spend a lot of
money on research and development only
when when you look at their own annual
reports and I've looked at the top 20 of
them they spend on average 15% on
research and development out of these 15
percent two-thirds are spent
circumventing other pharma companies
patents that numbers come that number
comes from the FDA in the annual annual
reports you can also see that about 30
percent of their revenue is spent
actually manufacturing the medicines
that means we have forty five percent
covered the rest is profit and when
marketing
so this means that you have public
funding of 80% but only 45% can be
accounted for as doing some real social
good to the public so if you were to
instead take the manufacturing and put
it out to the lowest bidder just on
contract and use public grants for these
15% and you can even increase it within
the existing budget you'd get less
public spending you would get more money
to pharma research and well you'd lose
the profit and marketing costs of the
pharma companies which are essentially
the costs of having a very
institutionalized monopoly did that make
sense okay nodding good
won't parents enable new and in new and
innovative companies that is the usual
claim where we come through all the
claims of the benefits of patents and
we've found every single one of them to
be false parents are usually claimed to
be a protection for the lone inventor
against predatory large corporations
however even the Patent Office chief of
Sweden claims that this is not true the
patent system does not give that
protection this is why I say that
patents range from useless when big
companies have these huge patent
portfolios and just signed cross
licensing agreements to immoral when
third world countries are prohibited by
the industrialized world to manufacture
medicine for their own population to to
diabolical like software patterns go
ahead
you might want to use the microphone car
there's one there that Google supported
itself off intellectual property as far
as I'm aware Google has never initiated
an offensive software or even hardware
patent suit against anyone there might
have been some back-channel threat
everybody's got a filed offensive
patents because it's a jungle out there
but but that doesn't mean that they're
supporting your business okay yeah so if
there were no patent system you wouldn't
have to file defensive patents I guess
that's what I'm saying there was another
question in that area somewhere before I
was at you okay and I see you've done
there
yeah so before I came to this talk I was
wondering you know if you've being a
content creator and you know that would
put you in much more substantial
position to talk about copyright but you
know after I I listened to her talk I
realized well first of all copyright is
for protecting the distributor's so I'm
an independent
well I can't play music you know it's my
hobby and I've looked at possibility of
creating my own internet radio station
right and I realized that ever since
sound exchange imposed the copyright
royalty on it I realized that is
actually mandatory for me to actually
pay them in order to play my own music
you know that is nobody else's business
right so you know for nothing I just I
don't know what to say
yeah I know that that's that's the truth
I have to pay them just to play my own
music so you know I just want to make
this comment you know you know just to
illustrate how copyright is so broken
right and what I usually yeah thank you
and what I usually say when I get this
question well how will the artists get
paid if I had a dime for every time I
had that question I mean file-sharing
hurts the distributors I hope it does I
really hope it does and but the thing is
it actually enables artists gets paid
because all this money doesn't know
anymore does not anymore go to use less
distributors that are not really needed
but can instead go to the artists if you
just see distribution of media as
marketing for your real revenue source
like concerts I mean even in the age of
records wreck the Sailor records weren't
really a good source of income for the
artists but concerts were so I see
file-sharing as actually not hurting but
enabling musicians to have an income
yeah
I'm not sure I understand the question
I'm and I had to be honest I am NOT I
don't hear you and Charlie from down
there could you please use the
microphone okay so if I make something
and then someone use it for a purpose
that I really would rather not you know
like maybe Georgia rice takes my video
and put them in this campaign I mean
right right so I have right so we're
saying that any derivative work should
be given new protection and this is some
this leads to some interesting
interesting effects that actually do
change moral rights not business model
much more rights and I'll give you one
solid example in the 60s there were a
lot of classical works that were give
being remade as rock tombs and all of
the old-school artists tried out file
that this was horrible and they should
be stamped with a skull and never ever
gone on public radio where it's the
entire younger generations thought that
this was the best thing since sliced
bread so it was a great new culture even
though the original artists hated it and
its cuts it was actually a new culture
that contributed to to the common pool
so I what I guess what I'm saying is
that everybody is creating culture out
of from previous pieces in the common
pool that means that you should not have
the right to prevent somebody from using
your piece to create new culture again
there are exceptions we're like I said
any derivative work is a new work that's
not entirely true
then there are a few exceptions like
translation of
books Lux psyche titling of movies where
it's really the same work but I'm going
into details now and I won't take your
time with this okay let's see you down
there no oh okay
no you should go ahead do you think
there are also initiatives that can be
done in other countries especially South
America excellent question
excellent question the pirate movement
we hope actually you've seen it on this
is the Ubuntu screen saver we it's not
part of our talking yeah we are Sumter
sometimes joking that we were born on
slashed up this movement the emotions of
this movement this present all across
the world there are fledgling pirate
parties in many many countries although
as far as I know Sweden is the only
pirate party to have broken through to
mainstream awareness outside the geek
community and has had some reasonable
success in an election there are pirate
parties on six continents out of seven
there isn't one on Antarctica so what
can people in other countries do
particularly in Latin America well Latin
America has a very strong interest in
these issues they have a very strong
interest in intellectual property
reduction unfortunately they lack the
economic clout to put a real put a real
dent dent in the u.s. copyright Lobby
the Europe however has that cloud
because of the equal economic strengths
so what we are hoping for and believing
very strongly in is that when we get our
first real political success as in
putting people into the European
Parliament that that'll inspire first of
all inspire pirates across the world to
build organizations and fast and be
scared the bejesus out of politicians
who all of a sudden realize that they're
about to lose their jobs if they don't
understand this issue and fast which is
gonna be helpful so yes this is present
all over the world and the from what we
see in support it's particularly strong
in Europe and like you say Latin America
yes the worst question down there I have
a tiny question it might be some ironic
so you must be familiar with the GPL
license yep do we understand it so not a
lawyer but do we understand it is that
it's actually protected by copyright yes
so if you take a couple right away you
know someone could take let's say Glu
Emacs or something like that
make some extension and just rip the
binary you won't be able to edit the
sauce and Mosul salute mean you know the
core foundation of free software goes
away Bryson's this is true this is true
and I have to to answer to this one of
the one of the best sought answers is
actually in a signature on the part
parties forum it says that so on one
hand IRA get one restricted 24 by 7
access to all of humanity's humanity all
of humanity's knowledge and culture and
the price I paid for that is that after
five years somebody can take my source
code and do whatever they want with it
and that is an easy choice the other
answer I have is that it could still be
seen as somewhat skewing the system
towards favoring proprietary software
and what we are doing is that we
basically are we pretty much like open
source and free software in fact we like
it a lot
so what we're saying in is instead that
the public sector which has this like
huge pile of money whenever it makes
purchasing decisions
it must actively counteract deformation
or continuations of monopolies on
information or formats essentially that
means not only favoring open source but
actively working against proprietary
software so that is that it's my answer
is it good enough nodding in nodding and
smiling thank you
exactly I mean the Swedish government I
mean the Swedish government's money I
see will we've hit the full hour here
and there are ok
what's your position on trademark should
I be able to make a browser and Mozilla
Firefox for thanks this is actually good
that you brought that up originally we
didn't know quite where to stand on
trademarks but we figured that there are
a completely different animal than
copyrights and patents because
copyrights and patents are only for the
benefit of the monopoly holder whereas
trademarks are intended to be for the
benefit of the consumer it's intended to
be a fraud protection on a market where
it's the seller and buyer are not
personally acquainted as in and is
intended to reduce transactional costs
while the benefit can be debated as in
well if I try to set a Sonia video and
I'm obviously not Sony that's a
trademark infringement
infringement yes but it's also fraud so
would fraud law be enough maybe maybe
not
but we're at we're at least not seeing
the immense harm from trademarks that we
are seeing from copyrights and patents
so we decided that this is not this is
not an important fight let's let's put
our wood behind the arrows that count
okay no more questions then I thank you
thank you very much for having hears
