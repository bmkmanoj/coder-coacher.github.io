I'm a lapsed computational
neuroscientist in the philosophy
department of Oxford University and one
reason I got into philosophy it's better
became interested in issues about
futuristic questions about how can be
enhanced brains how how can we think
better how can I will new technologies
affect the world so I ended up at the
future humanity Institute so we are
trying to be crazy part of already
Robbie strange philosophy faculty so
we're trying to look at big picture long
range questions that would change the
situation of new months in a big in a
big way so one area of our research is
global catastrophic risk how could
things go terribly wrong another area is
rationality and epistemology how can
actually think sensibly about futures
and the things where we have very little
information but we're also interested in
emerging technologies technology that if
they develop would really change the
rules of the game and then as a nice
intersection between both my background
in this we have this field of Co brain
emulation which I'm hopefully going to
give you a little talk about our
estimates and some of the consideration
about the technology and that we have
been thinking about so the idea of I'm
doing a whole brain emulation is really
kind of bringing the classic a
philosophical and science-fiction plot
device of making our one-to-one copy of
a brain into reality
we have a beautiful existence proof that
we can have intelligent systems in this
universe in the form of our own brains
and obviously we want to learn
interesting things from it the
interesting question through a
philosopher might be of course could
they actually get minds out of our
scouts could we actually by copying the
neural structure of our brain actually
create a piece of software that was
doing real thinking whatever real
thinking actually is and here you can
imagine gaggle of philosophers going on
for quite a long while about that
question but you can also view it as a
pretty interesting technical question so
one reason we started thinking about
this is it's a good exercise in
forecasting
artificial general intelligence is an
remember really really powerful
technology that would really change
everything
but we have no idea about how to
estimate time skills that we can
actually as I hope to show make some
rough estimations about some of the time
scales for brain emulation so this makes
it a fun exercise in forecasting and of
course that means of course that in 50
years time we're going to be laughing
quite happily about it too they all the
things we got wrong but it's a
well-defined problem and understanding
that might be very useful an interesting
thing is also that making a one-to-one
copy of a technical system means that
you don't necessarily need to understand
what's actually going on in there
why it was designed that way and that
seems to be very different from a normal
and procedure in science where we try to
understand a complex system usually by
making very simplified models of it and
then we are given understanding here
it's more about lower-level reverse
engineering and finally another reason
is that if this happens if we can
actually make a good brain emulation it
would be a very very big thing obviously
from a kind of philosophical standpoint
if you could finally upload the
philosopher and ask him are you really
conscious do you feel yourself to be you
that would help perhaps answer some
interesting philosophical questions
especially of course if you took the
skeptic uploaded him and said oh yes I
actually think I am conscious I was
wrong that would be really useful
the big problem would be if you're
uploading says no actually I'm not
conscious so that's going to keep the
philosophers busy and of course from our
neuroscientific perspective would also
be interesting because this is kind of a
logical endpoint of the neuroinformatics
getting all the relevant data existing
in the nervous system into a computer
readable form but if you could actually
run human brain emulation it would also
have economical impacts which are
downright frightening laying at large
the economists Robin Hanson has written
one scary a little paper where it
demonstrates the consequence of getting
copyable human capital and essentially
getting economic if not a pure
mathematical singularity for practical
purposes
having an economy with a doubling time
corresponding to Moore's law
well that's still significant enough and
that means that we actually want to
figure out how possible is this and
ideally do that a few decades ahead
because suddenly getting iconic
singularity when you don't expect it
it's probably going to be pretty bad for
avermedia political stability of the
world so we did a little workshop a
while ago at Oxford where we invited
experts in various fields together we
banned all philosophical discussions so
no discussion about what consciousness
really is so what software actually can
represent yes two questions what
resolution of brain-scanning is do we
need and the what method could work and
then we got started and digging into
that and well what about emulations
besides that my dear said the X 81 my
first computer now nicely covers the
title the idea is of course
old-fashioned in computers we can
actually emulate both hardware and
software in another medium so we want to
replicate the causal structure what's
going on inside one system in another
one a simulation just appears similar to
what is being simulated that might
actually be well enough we don't really
want the weather emulation but emulates
all the molecules moving around the
madness fear that would is simply
overkill we just want aware the
simulation that's good enough to predict
whether it's going to rain tomorrow or
not
so this obviously exists for computers
but computers have a lot of properties
which are very nice formulations they
generally tend to have well-defined
abstraction levels and they tend to be
very discrete systems an interesting
question is where the brain is actually
behaving according to that and that
leaves us with some interesting
scientific questions which or again good
for job security among neuroscientists
but also actually pretty important
research questions in for other purposes
as I'm hoping going to going to be able
to demonstrate this is going to
synergize a bit with other neuroscience
so the basic idea is really building a
brain without understanding it so if
somebody gave you the schematics of a
microprocessor and do you happen to have
a factory that could make in silicon
chips it doesn't matter but you have no
clue what the different parts are doing
you could ideally if you were skilled
enough as a fab engineer replicate that
processor and the idea of brain
emulation is well this might be possible
for real
most research about the brain is of
course attempting a high level of
understanding we want to know what
memory is how it does we want to
understand what intelligence is but
that's a high level rob a complex
concept it's much easier to know what
chemicals are around how many different
neurons of a particular type / how are
they connected to each other so instead
of moving towards a high level of
understanding function it's this is
about getting a large understand of
details so this is a bit more of a
brute-force approach it's a bit like the
Human Genome Project where instead of
trying to figure out each individual
gene what we're doing first we sequence
the whole DNA and then we hope we can
understand it in this case there is the
hope that well if we have this kind of
sequence the whole brain would be able
to run something very similar to it so
would need to understand a bit of
function what does a neuron or some
other component of a brain do how can we
actually simulate this efficient that of
course leads to an interest well
interesting set of problems first of all
we have a lot of things we don't know
and that we know that we don't know it
I'm going to get back to the question of
scale actually what resolution would we
need to simulate a braid on and we also
need to make certain assumptions some of
these ones are kind of philosophical
like yeah well we haven't gotten a
metaphysical soul that's actually
behaving separately from the brain
although I'm a really good brain
emulation might I should be a very nice
test of its fear if you could compare
the brain emulation presumably lacking
soul and see the differences its
behavior from a brain having a soul and
that might actually allow you to detect
something most of the dual is
philosopher's the immediate point out
that they can find a sneaky way around
that anyway similarly we of course have
been interesting possibility but well
maybe the brain is doing something non
Turing computable
again that's something we would probably
want to know from a purely scientific
perspective and perhaps even an
engineering perspective if there is a
system around that is doing interesting
non Turing computation we might want to
copy that
then we have of course the issues about
scale separation which i think is
interesting let me jump ahead here
I think scale separation is going to be
kind of a key problem
so if you want to have a really good
scientific problem with a lot of
applications other fields to chew on
this is it so we know from statistical
mechanics that if you take a bunch of
molecules in a gas and allow them to
bounce around their behavior averages
out very very nice slip into a
macroscopic quantities like pressure
temperature volume on the other hand if
you have a turbulent fluid the local
scale behavior all those little verbals
produce in a turbulent flow they don't
that reach out then have a low levels
interact with slightly larger levels
which interact with even bigger levels
and vice-versa
there is no nice separation in a
statistical mechanics we can safely
ignore by individual molecular dynamics
because we have our scale separation in
turbulence we can't do that and that's
also a big problem in simulating
turbulence the big question of course is
is the brain like turbulence
or statistical mechanics or somewhere in
between ideally we would like to find
the levels of scale separation and if we
could find methods of determining
whether a scale separated that's
obviously useful in a lot of other
systems where we might want to engineer
them we want to figure out beforehand is
this going to be hopeless to simulate or
not yeah so I think this is kind of a
big scientific problem to chew on that
existed this neighborhood but going back
to assumptions here we have a lot of
other stuff which most of it should be
pretty obvious similarly we might also
discuss the degrees of success because
we might still be pretty happy if we
made does a complete scan of everything
that's in the head and we understood
that in a sense that we had a list of
all nerve cells and their connections
that might be a very good treasure trove
for science that might be very very
useful for medicine similarly where that
would be of a parts list we might also
want to have just a very good scan for a
lot of other purposes we could imagine
putting back together into a kind of
functional database where we can run
things although it wouldn't actually
produce very much then you could imagine
our functional brain emulation that is
you get something that produces a bit of
plausible dynamics you get brain waves
although you don't get the behavior
so it would be the parks are interacting
at least in a forcible way the chemical
systems don't immediately go haywire
then you could imagine it something even
more interesting but you would get
species-typical
seen behavior so if you imagine that we
do this with a mouse you would get among
a piece of software that ran around and
simulated a labyrinth Humpty four
simulated pieces of cheese in a good way
but it wouldn't correspond to the mouse
you were originally scanning so if you
had a particular mouse and trained that
for particular things it might turn out
that those things do not carry over even
better a certain level of success would
of course be that it's an individual
brain emulation and it's at this point
of course we start thinking that it
might be interesting to humans who want
to escape for your bodies and then we
have a really tricky level our top
levels that it would actually have a
mind but it would be a continuation
personal identity and all the other
tricky social and philosophical stuff
but I think from a kind of engineering
standpoint where we had to start down
there and then it's an interesting
question how rapidly we wouldn't be
moving up I personally believe that if
you'da managed to get the brain but
actually does something species-typical
it's going to correspond quite exactly
to the individual brain be scanned but
right now we don't have a really good
scan brain we have for example a
complete map of the nervous systems of a
little nematode worm C elegans all 945 I
think in neurons there are in this
that's very nice but it doesn't
correspond that a single particular worm
it just the general connectivity and the
really embarrassing part is we don't
even know the sign of some of the
synapse is between the nerve cells which
is I think it's a real scandal although
it's very tricky to do this kind of
research because both and the worms are
darn too small this is of course why you
want to run a test on mug which has in
the conveniently large neurons which ID
in our color code and for our
convenience
well what level of detail would we need
to actually scan or process our brain to
in order to do something useful well at
our workshop we got this very nice
scheme but we can imagine actually
several different levels that might be
relevant and we don't really have much
of an agreement of which would be most
relevant
so some people think about oh it's
actually all about logic we could
perhaps do just pick on a computation on
modules that's a very very high level
understand that wouldn't require us to
understand what memory and intelligence
actually were and how they were in their
processing then you can imagine a real
low-level thing well just run all the
atoms do a big molecular simulation of
every atom in the head that doesn't
require very much new information we
probably don't need any weird physics we
just need to know where all atoms are
located in somebody's head and then a
very very very very big computer to run
it and if we're really unlucky of course
we need to take quantum stuff into
account and that case would need a very
very very very large quantum computer
hopefully and this is what's kind of
rough consensus shown by racing hands
we're probably in the middle quite a lot
of people think that well we probably
need to model individual neurons because
we know that you can train rats for
example to respond to stimulation
individual neurons if they get a reward
whenever we manage to fire a particular
neuron or you know whether if you send a
signal to a single neuron just randomly
selected somewhere in the brain and you
can train them to recognize that oh I
got a signal now I'm going to get the
reward if I go to that part of the cage
so you can kind of have that kind of
sensitivity of the system normally of
course we don't care about our
individual neurons but we can kind of
train ourselves to do that so we
probably might need a lot of chemistry
obviously if the brain is not the pure
nice electric system there's a lot of
interesting chemistry going on it might
turn out that you can abstract this so
if some people like spiking yours we
have to get rid of a lot and get rid of
a lot of and the biological junk and it
might turn out that you can actually
simplify things further well it's
actually groups of neurons not
individual neurons that are doing the
work or it could turn out that actually
we need to care about individual
molecular complexes and when we're down
there as we go upwards in this diagram
we need more and more understanding
about complex from the functional
relationships as we go downwards we have
simpler and simpler
it's mostly physics and a bit of a
simple chemistry but we need much more
data and much more processing power
perhaps if we had another it's so good
understanding of intelligence that we
could be up there at level one or two we
could probably run something equivalent
to human mind probably on a laptop of
today and hand-waving wisely here but
the marvin minsky made the same claim
and he's smart of Annisa I'm just
leaving after that it's pretty clear
about the molecular simulation of a
brain on Barbara hand that's going to
take something very different now if we
don't know which level we need to do
this on it seems to be an interesting
research question actually and then also
this is kind of a general method you
want to run simulation of different
scales to compare each other because we
have a problem with validation in many
engineering fields and size fields we
actually have a lot of work on figuring
out are we measuring what we want to
measure does this actually work in
neuroscience this haven't gotten started
yet and I think as we're going to see
more and more kind of industrialized
neuroscience people are going to develop
validation methods and one nice thing is
to have a bunch of very biological
realistic models and then various levels
of abstraction above them and see that
you can around them and get the same
results and then you compare that of
course to your real biology that way you
can actually be a bit certain that
you're not barking up the wrong neural
tree well Whitney so far looks like it
well
scale separation was one of a problem
another problem so force that we breathe
is pretty massive
this is a typical electron microscope
picture of how the brain really loops
you have probably seen all this
beautiful animation where it see neurons
suspended in the space is so kind of big
empty black space and you have a neuro
standing nice little spark clear signals
to each other that's of course the kind
of science-fiction picture that doesn't
correspond to reality because really
everything is crammed together inside
the tissue so this the stuff mark d down
there that's a damned right one of the
receiving branches of a neuron and then
you have a bunch of s RISP and
representing synapse as the point where
neurons connect to each other and as you
can see this is a slice through a very
dense three-dimensional puzzle
even worse these synapses they might
come with different signs in the sense
that some are excitatory they get the
next neuron to fire it and some of
inhibitory they tell Barba Newman to
shut up but they might also send other
chemical signals some of which changed
the behavior of the neurons and this is
very fun for neuroscientist but it's
also chemistry and you can't really see
the chemistry in this picture so one
interesting an outstanding question is
how much of the function can actually
infer from these kind of images what
kind of method of scanning do we need to
actually be able to figure out what's
going on in here and it might look very
very messy here but to some degree that
of course just finding the topology
especially when you got the stack of
these images that is just a large scale
a in the image processing problem and
there are also some good sites but
certain kind of synapse is actually do
have signs too and if the visual sites
that they have slightly different
functions but that's I'm again going to
give show will later on there might
posit techniques telling us a bit about
the farm chemistry going on in there
well how much do we know about the brain
well that's another interesting question
because this kind of project you want to
estimate how much varies so here I
plotted the time of discovery of
neurotransmitters and it started back in
the 1930s when we found that I found the
acetylcholine and then it started to
ramp up and now for most kind of
scientific progress which would expect
some kind of sigmoid curve this one
doesn't really look like a sigmoid curve
it's definitely not slowing down there
maybe it's slowing down but I have
reason to think given that this paper
was slightly old but it might be
underestimate what we discover since
2000 but it doesn't seem likely that we
would get orders and orders of magnitude
more we're still talking here about
perhaps 150 very good reasons to believe
that because there has to be genes and
enzymes Manor for producing these
different kinds of stuff and we know
that the number of genes are finite we
can complicate things further of course
because the body has found the neat ways
of making versions of enzymes but again
it seems unlikely but most of our
enzymes would be engaged in producing
thousands and
neurotransmitters similarly we can look
at the metabolic going on in a Cell
again it's ridiculously complicated but
the number of different small molecules
involved in our metabolism I think is of
the order of about five thousand which
is a very large network and we are still
not close to actually running a chemical
simulation of them all but we're a
pretty nice substance we were already
doing pretty good progress on similarly
the number of different kinds of needles
again
it seems that depending on how you slice
things you might be getting anything
between attempts two hours and a few
thousands or you might have very very
different we are the clusters again that
is we can do these different scenarios
about this kind of complexity so we can
actually estimate the computation of the
modes so very it's an interesting
challenge actually to do a bit of
technology forecasting here because we
know there are known unknowns in there
and some of these ones are we can say
something for example the dynamic estate
of my brain in this moment suppose
somebody magically scanned it but didn't
take the activity level of Veniero's
into account what would happen and it
seems very likely given what we
currently understand in neuroscience but
you would end up with a slightly
confused version of me as you started
the simulation we forgotten the last at
least a few minutes probably a bit
longer and we have reason to believe
this because some people are falling
into really cold rivers and lakes in
northern nations and they've been
revived after about 45 minutes now
neurons stop firing when body
temperature goes below a certain level
so they literally had zero activity
they're flatlined in a very very real
sense but that's not necessarily but
they could still reboot from this so to
say and they still have the intact
personality and everything else so it is
that the dynamical state that's not
necessarily important maybe we need to
scan the spinal cord because we actually
seem to do a bit of learning there there
might be other interesting problems a
volume transmission there a fusion of
chemicals it turns out that that's
computation probably less expensive than
actually running a neural network
dealing with what glial cells which
previously people were just saying oh
yes there is support
the neurons who are real stars but it
turns out actually but well the newer
ansari glasses are actually like any
good servants and the systems actually
make doing quite a lot of stuff but
again they're doing it rather slowly
like most administration so it turns out
that we can probably actually don't need
to allocate that much more computation
to it there is a lot of fun stuff
happening when synapse is fire because
we adapt the the habituate if you fire
too much sometimes we get stronger it
depends a bit on the chemistry that's
something we the most definitely need to
do we probably need to do about the
simulation more about that later to deal
with the chemical environment after all
our guts are actually containing a lot
of neurons sending a lot of chemical
signals to our brain and affecting our
thinking quite a lot gremlin for example
a hormone which is involved in senses of
hunger is also a memory announcer and
actually changes our activity in frontal
lobes we tend to think of pictures of
food that's being larger for example and
see when we were high on Ritalin so if
we want to make this realistic we need
to include that but again it's a rubbish
flow dynamics and it's not that terribly
many things neurogenesis where
appearance of new neurons that's
slightly tricky we have much less
research on that again a robber slow
process so if you left that one out you
would perhaps get a brain emulation that
would have learning problems but it
would still be able to run a
conversation a peptic effect that's the
weird electromagnetic effects that
happen when you have two signals running
a parallel axons then they actually
induce magnetic fields that might
synchronize them and whereas few people
that argue that this is a real and
important effect in the nervous system
and most of us who are say oh no it
can't be that weird
it remains to see actually quantum
computation is of course the boogeyman
to me I don't think any neuroscientist
really believes in it but Stuart
Hameroff does and he's been arguing for
that what we're going to find out it
turns out that randomness and the
ability to analog computation doesn't
seem to be that important true analog
computation is always swamped in the
brain by the noise level we have a
tremendous noise level inside the
nervous system mainly because it's
embedded in a biological body which
which is doing a lot of weird stuff
again I don't have a time to get into
all of this but they're very
obviously but well let's ignore that one
so the first step is of course well how
can we scan the brain um one of the fun
part we had when we had this workshop we
actually arrived at a consensus if it
turns out that it's nerve cells that are
the kind of central part we need to
figure out what's connected to what and
what's in them then we can do it with a
resolution about 50 times 50 50
nanometers time five times five because
that way you get the smallest branches
of axons to be right here is just an
optical slices through the visible
matter this is what we kind of optical
resolutions too far too crude to
actually see everything so the trick
here is we need to actually scan a
surprisingly large volume that kind of
picture whether that's going on to the
right but of course we are strip serves
a very low resolution picture of a very
large volume with an electron microscope
you can get a ridiculously high
resolution picture but the volumes in
the areas they can scan are ridiculously
small another interesting problem is
that this is very likely to be
destructive when they're calling it
scanning I'm kind of iffy mystically
labeling something that's most likely
it's going to involve taking a brain
freezing it put it pouring onto a lot of
plastic and then slicing and dicing it
them in then if we're lucky we're ending
up with a lot of information in our data
center and the pile of dust that we kind
of get rid of somewhere but that's not
going to get any customers the reason I
think it has to be destructive is
non-destructive methods they need to
scan the brain at a very high resolution
over if your external at least over a
span of several centimeters and
unfortunately a living brain is flopping
around because the blood is moving
through it and that is very problematic
magnetic resonance imaging is also very
good unfortunately even if the brain
somehow magically stopped flopping
around the because over the blood it
turns out that water molecules diffuse
so much that they actually create an
upper limit on the resolution you can
get with MRI
one solution is to freeze the brain all
water molecules are staying in the right
places and then you can get a marvelous
signal-to-noise ratio
just by scanning for a really long time
but again this might not be really
compatible with living afterwards so
this of course
Amida brings up the interesting question
about getting volunteers the research
ethics of this and so on but I think
that can be so they're always people
that actually think this is good it
would be a good idea to be a guinea pig
and as a researcher I think that's great
that they exist
yep so it turns so in general it's
actually I was a bit shocked at our
little workshop that were so many
modality that actually managed to get
there with a resolution higher than the
ones that we felt were needed so for
example a lot of very kind of
traditional ones they probably don't
account it but electron microscopes can
regularly do a resolution much better
the and very various weird methods like
atomic beam microscopy which isn't
implemented it's a kind of ultimate way
for where because we're using helium
atoms the image molecules but it really
looks promising if it could work and you
can actually get down to really low
levels here the big problem which has
kind of worried means of course getting
the chemistry a function out of this but
people are getting better at that let me
first show you just a particular thing
which can be kind of demonstration but
what was other training thing
essentially this is the scan training
wheels version of a scanning so this is
an optical thing where you use a dime on
the micro tube to slice off the layers
of tissue and when you image them
essentially with a 1d scanner as they
pass by so in the lower knife-edge
scanning microscopy so this was
developed by Professor Bruce McCormack
dd-down takes us AMM he sadly passed
away shortly after a workshop but he was
very much an inspiration for a lot of it
and that one of his students Todd
Hoffman has since been kind of taking it
up and is starting a company doing a
kind of commercializing this kind of
scanning so although this might not yet
to be good enough for a brain scanning
because it using optical resolution
which is too crude
it's still interesting because you can't
get very good tissue pictures so for
example this is a mouse spinal cord way
stained with India ink so this is slice
after slice and this is also showing the
interest in challenge which I'm kind of
hoping to throw at you you can see a lot
of interesting artifacts there's a lot
of data here we want to process and we
want to get through that to produce
something like this this is a 3d
reconstruction we did and of course we
want to do something even more than just
nice pretty 3d picture we actually want
to get functional stuff out of it so one
of the later stuff it done some of you
might be in neuroscience I recognize
this as protein yourselves one of the
more charismatic cells of the brain
they're completely lovely little things
and so this is the result of imaging
using this microscope but this is part
of a very large data set a much larger
data sits actually a ridiculously large
data set because it encompasses the
entire mouse brain so that's about 2
terabytes of imaging data and it's
pretty hard to display so Todd here is
kind of slowly assuming out but under
expanding the realm here so you can see
how these perkiness have formed kind of
coral reef they're all aligned with each
other and you can't see it in this
picture but we're a lot of fibers from
the granule cells going through them
making synapse on each and every one of
them and then doing whatever they are
doing down there in the cerebellum I've
heard five eminent research giver nice
nice talks about how the cerebellum
works and there are five different
theories and they're all sound closeable
to me we really ought to be running a
simulation of this to actually find it
out so this is about how big he could
show it but he's got a data set but well
a mile big run this literally and he's
planning to kind of give that away to
research it to get them interested in
using this so this is also showing an
interesting problem handling this amount
of data is going to be a bit of a
challenge electrons carrying a
resolution date of entire brain is going
to require an absurd amount of storage
capacity and it's not exactly clear how
we could do that so that's another fun
challenge for you to think about even
though you might not care about brain
emulation itself you might
still think about there are a few good
research challenges here over at
Stanford we have done and solved one of
my bit worries about the chemistry and
that's by slicing up tissue into a
little array on a microscope slide and
then you can color this using various
immuno states too for whatever chemical
you're interested finding out where it
is and then you image that with a normal
microscope and now we can figure out
where that chemical is you wash off that
stain and another stain for some other
chemical image that and then you repeat
this a number of times now you have a
map of where certain chemicals are in
among the neurons and finally you scan
it with an electron microscope which is
going to do pretty nasty stuff to the
tissue but the result is that you
actually get a nice topology map as well
as a slightly crude a map of where
chemicals are and the chemicals of
course can indicate neuron type and
there are lots more functions I'm very
very hopeful about this and of course
you're getting this in 3d actually
because you actually have an array here
of tissue slices it's just but it needs
to be scaled up a little bit a little
bit then of course we need to do
scanning interpretation we need to take
these slices and stack them and actually
make maps in the past we have been doing
that using grad students that's not cost
effective and the grad students get very
bored after a while I assume one could
do something like an online game with it
but I think it would be too boring too
so this is I think an interesting
challenge for in a computer vision to
actually be able to take this data
actually create good 3d models of the
tissue and then of course you can this
is again with knife edge scanning so
they're just following blood vessels
because we can't really do a full
resolution so it already X is some
algorithm but it pretty clear but now as
these datasets are started to arrive
this is going to be a much in more
interesting error to throw grad students
at actually writing both algorithms so I
think we're going to see a lot of
interesting work here and it's also an
interesting shadow managing this very
very large-scale data set with all the
weird artifacts and noise so well and
here is a kind of what we might want to
actually get we would get the little
synapse is sitting on the dendrites even
I
hint of what their function would be
once we got that of course we have a
nice models and we can actually start
running traditional computational
neuroscience on it so in typical
computational neuroscience you divide a
neuron into a lot of little compartments
so you can see that close up where a lot
of little silly cylinders and you just
simulate the electrical properties of
these ones the ion channels pumping ions
in and out as well as whatever else is
going on in there so each of these
sailors would correspond to a
compartment and you would describe it
usually as I said a couple differential
equations with a diffusion term to
neighboring compartments and well I
don't know if how interest you oriented
all the details because this is kind of
my main areas I could go on absolutely
forever but this is the fun stuff is of
course we have a lot of good experience
here with running small simulations we
know quite well how to do that and for
certain areas of the brain we actually
have simulations which are kind of
one-to-one so for example the lamprey
spinal cord which is kind of a neural
network or of the house at my old
research group in Stockholm
we actually had simulation with the same
number of neurons as there are in actual
lamprey spinal cords
we just didn't have a complete scan of
it Henry Markram down at the eth in
Lausanne he's doing this nice work on a
cortical column again he had got the
same number of neurons as in the real
column it's just that he haven't scanned
an individual column to get this ngerous
he has assimilated a bunch of realistic
neurons Harvey would course it Connect
and that's my kind of complaint with
this model of course we it produce a
beautiful activity that looks kind of
plausible but you don't know whether it
actually is plausible because we can't
measure what's actually going on in a
real column so we need to have these
kind of scans to do that it also this
kind of compartment models if we useful
we actually know a bit about the time
resolution of space resolution which is
useful for constraining stuff let's
ignore that so here is my old office
made nickel your fault simulation so he
was running this on the blue-jean a few
years back and the interesting thing to
see is he ran about one second and it
took you five thousand nine hundred
forty two seconds and that's mainly set
because we
make your simulation large enough so you
can get a nice coffee break while you're
going off so as computers get better the
coffee break stays constant but the
simulations get bigger but people
usually don't care about the slowdown
but this allows us to make estimates
about how much computation it takes per
neuron this was a fairly realistic
simulation for other models of neurons
which are more abstract and there is a
bit of debate which one one should be
using from a kind of uploading
perspective we're interested of course
in finding the most real biological
realistic one that does the work we want
to so for example a CT which is a kind
of boast with his neural model it takes
many fewer flops and it's still produces
pretty biological realistic modeling
Henry Morgan got in a bit of spat with
another researcher over this because the
other research was running a much bigger
simulation using these simplified models
and that both are kind of right both for
interesting models see kovitch neurons
can do a lot of very useful stuff but
they're also abstracting away from
biology and we don't know how far away
from biology we can do and retain
whatever is important any question well
mostly it's about getting the data and I
think we're slowly working our way
towards getting all the data for a cell
it's just that it takes a lot you need
to figure out what the enzymes are and
their various rate constants and that's
kind of the nitty-gritty data gathering
stuff we're getting better at that but
right now people are kind of sort of an
important part of a metabolic network
and here is typical research problem but
you will get nice publications if you
determine some constants assimilate the
kind of famous an important part but we
actually wanted a complete network so
for that we need the kind of automation
but you also get the uninteresting parts
of the metabolic Network but the kind of
chemical simulation is surprisingly easy
if you want to run it you can average
things out and just assume that
concentrations are enough in that case
you get a very nice Michaelis Menten
dynamics
for some chemicals you might actually
want to think about they're discrete
molecules but in some cases a very few
molecules are very very few enzymes per
cell but that's the kind of special case
and it's relatively easy to notice that
depends on how much you squint at it so
the traditional comportment model would
take for example that Purkinje cell with
about a thousand compartment each
compartment would have the voltage
across its membrane the state of about
between free and the six iron channels
which would and then you would get
perhaps one or two internal state
variables so on the order of ten to
twenty state variables per compartment
and then of course we might think well
do we need to store them as bytes or it
can be simplified things further or do
we actually need they were really been a
nice precision I would be surprised if
we actually needed a very high
resolution yeah but Betemit is going
something we're going to find out okay
and what both the unwarned model pretty
obvious but if we run our simulation we
better also give it some kind of input
so we need a border model which doesn't
really have to be quite as good as we
brain model probably and since we're
most like to start with a mouse it's
something that's with a workable mouse
model and again you can probably do
something much simpler than a hundred
teraflops in a complete completely
convincing virtual reality for a mouse
yep
for for example just grasping something
actually involves not just my brain
sending your signals or a few reflexes
in my spinal cord but actually the
mechanics of attendance of my fingers
actually do play a non-trivial role in
making grasping work so if I were to
have a simulated arm we would need to
have at least a physics simulation here
now the question is how much detail
we need in the sophistic simulation
obviously getting the tension in the
tendons right and some other friction
stuff and probably in order to wait for
it to feel right we would need to do a
bit of a tactile vibrations but we
probably don't need to simulate the
cells going on in the tendons we can
just leave you to the tendon as a kind
of abstract spring similarly my bones I
don't really think a simulation of me
would actually require a go at know
anything above and regardless rigid
objects with a certain mass the question
about the very first peripheral nervous
system is interesting because that's
going to affect the feel I think from a
research standpoint you might want
actually to run for simulations and
animal experts of course where you don't
really know what it feel right but once
you get paying customers you better get
the body right and this is again one of
the interesting research ethics problems
I haven't time to actually get into
right now but that's probably going to
be a real problem one of my nightmares
is oh I get chronically frozen then I
wake up in second life and I'm immortal
I can never leave second life and it's
never gonna get better resolution so we
might want to find ways around that yep
that what going on well and now of
course as any future is that I have to
wave around more slower a little bit and
well one should always take that with a
ridiculously large grain of salt maybe
an asteroid of South but I was kind of
looking around at a tech aid time so we
can at least plug it in to get the kind
of if we assume that Moore's Law is not
going to do something Curtis Wiley on
singularity as a singular very rapidly
instead just going to keep on like this
or get slower then we can actually do a
rough prediction of course what's the
earliest date we get enough computing
power to do certain levels of
ridiculously large simulations it's an
interesting parentheses that if we don't
need to send too much really complex
information actually bandwidth it's not
the big problem which is slightly
surprising I think to a lot of people
but especially if you can just send
synaptic spice is actually surprisingly
efficient and another interesting thing
is of course the difference is in latest
and so on it seems to favor certain
architectures
and then of course if we live in compare
very kind of traditional more slower
with looking at the top 500
supercomputers you find that they
advanced much faster mainly well force
because they're actually cheating by
adding a lot more parallelism so it's I
think commodity computers are most
likely going to can start catching up
that's a rate of improvement as they get
really multi-core and then of course the
problem is predicting about really long
term I've been having great fun recently
fitting sigmoids to it and I really
understand now that we can't use that to
predict very much the kind of yeah and
the reason so if if there is anything I
can kind of give you that is a true
knowledge ship is talk it's going to be
this if you have some kind of thing that
is actually very growing as a sigmoid
that's what big round trip and you got
partial data for it and then you try to
predict where the sigmoid it's going to
end up you're not going to succeed very
well with that unless you're just having
great luck until we're over far into the
process when it's self-evident anyway
and the reason is at the early stages
you're essentially just seeing a
straight line or maybe something in
Wiggly exponential so the uncertainty
and eventual level is going to be
ridiculously large and then this case of
course we're looking in logarithmic
space so this you need to exponentiate
uncertainty so I get the eleven orders
of uncertainty my predictions here we
can be pretty certain I think with a 95%
confidence interval but we got yet at
least a factor of a hundred thousand
more computations per dollar that's the
pessimistic scenario the optimistic one
is one very I think we're actually
running into issues of the quantum
physics it seems that no you can't
squeeze that much information to the
solar system but I think that's about 10
to the 27 computations per per dollar or
something like that I see if we don't
believe that but the kind of middle
range yeah we go to get ridiculously
much more computation and then assuming
so just assuming a simple Moore's law
and counting how much state variables
and stuff would we need on the different
levels I don't know whether any of you
can actually read this this particular
font but I can always put this online
and we actually got the white paper with
it so you can actually plug it in and
see well the earliest year you could get
that so for example if you want to run
an electric
logic assimilation of the brain where we
have this compartment with about ten
state variables one byte for each in
that case you end up with a memory
requirement of about 10,000 terabytes
which you could do for a million about
2019 assuming everything keeps up
obviously if you got more money you can
do it earlier and if you need to for
example store a full 3d map using
electron microscopy when you need about
a billion terabytes and that's going to
be affordable for a millionaire about
two thousand forty three assuming them
the cost of memory and so on keeps them
and of course if it's quantum then we
just need to replace which with qubits
and we have no clue but it's interesting
we can already put a bound here
depending on where reality actually lies
we're going to be able to do it at
certain times or Robert that's the
earliest time we can do it affordably
because later on it's going to be
cheaper then of course we can look at
the computation of the models and we can
similarly plug things in here and it
turns out that if the brain were just
behaving like a simple perceptron
Network we could actually probably run
it
we're actually can run it they could run
it on a supercomputer today it's just
that I don't think anybody believes that
and the you know if you want to run this
with electrophysiology well between 2033
and 2006 date around there it starts to
be a kind of computational feasible for
a million dollars of computing equipment
I mean of course it get more and more
extreme and once you need to actually do
any nuclear simulations it produces an
estimated two thousand two hundred at
that point we can just say okay
somewhere indefinitely for probably
never so if it's feasible in a we can
still plug this in and make kind of a
graph and start looking at it so this is
probably also very hard to see but
depending on the green light the
horizontal green lines represent and
they're different estimates of what
resolution we need to run it and the
very blue and red line represents
computing the first time you get enough
computing power for that so you can see
the intercepts that rip sound kind of
earliest stage the problem is of course
all this depends on us neuroscience is
doing our job
not actually understanding enough of
what they believe we want to simulate to
actually do it and we don't have no
guarantees about that science never
really produce a good time tables when
it solves problems sometimes it does it
if a Rome ordering the wrong time the
interesting part is scanning seems to be
almost there already if we know whatever
we need to scan we can probably do it
it's just that we need to scale up the
scanning equipment we're probably going
to need an enormous factory of electron
microscopes or something like that can a
favor for some really interesting work
on this and for doing it but that can be
done so one of the interesting things is
of course well if you got a lot more
money you can do it earlier so if you're
looking at computing power you can
actually accelerate it between one or
two decades if there is regardless oh
this is really important and the most
interesting thing is well smaller brains
obviously we can probably run on insect
brain today that would be a very
worthwhile research project and the
mouse brain I think is important because
at that point people are gonna start
realizing oh in a few years we go to
d-doing humans Oh
social impact first mover advantage
strategic importance and the bottom
point man is going to start flooding in
so from an ethical standpoint if it
turns out the brain emulation is a
really bad thing we want to figure it
out before that and then start somehow
making the field embarrassing enough so
nobody works if it if you think that
this is great this is going to solve the
world problems on Barbara hand we really
we should work very hard towards that
mouse model and it still seems to be a
surprisingly short distance the really
hard scientific problems about scanning
a brain making a simulation creating
this pipeline that's solved by the point
you get to the mouse once you have a
mouse then it's just a matter of scaling
up which is non-trivial but it's still
relatively clear engineering and that
slice is Airy because at that point
twenty years might be optimistic well
and the order actually does matter
because if we think that the kind of
surprise whoops
suddenly we got an enormous change in
world economy and the human condition
that might be destabilized then we
should really make sure that we get the
scanning in your size done and then we
can
just trust Moore's law because it's
unlikely but they can make Moore's law
working faster and that's such a big
powerful thing that it's run by a lot of
other interest in our economy but that's
not going to be effective the scary
possibility is that well neuroscience is
not doing anything good we're having
nice scans we're all over data centers
and researchers are poking around in
them and the computer gets better and
better and then one grad student says
wow we forgot about simulating this and
well now we can go from Mouse to you
money and well whatever time we forget
takes to dig up I go the human model
that would be very destabilizing and
scary so we need to keep an eye on this
but I think this is going to be a very
interesting area and the world since
Google wants to organize all the data
around and I think this neural data
might be very interesting to organize I
haven't time to get into the energy
requirements and footprint but I think
it's actually a software you Manta would
possibly have a very small environment
or footprint so I would like to say
thanks to the people that helped me
develop this and thank you for listening
and then we got the white paper over
there if you're interested in more
detail questions yeah briefly body
models of simple organism I think we're
doing these simply at least if you want
something snake-like or lamprey like
actually we have sufficiently good
models to do it the C elegans neuron
Network the problem as I said this we
don't know the science of the synapse
and don't think anybody's actually going
to do that research because it's just
too in a tricky I know some people like
Peter Pizarro down in Brighton in
Britain who really wants to get started
if we can get founding our product on
scanning the British pond snail which is
very nice because it got big neurons you
can figure out and very nicely
compartmentalized into different ganglia
and I think computationally we could
definitely do that we just need to
figure out exactly which neurons are
connected to what the whatever
properties are
I would guess for a large-scale product
I would guess about million pounds or
something like that it depends of it it
also depends a bit on what research
system we want to start with so for
example it another area that we could
perhaps start scanning would be beretta
now which would be very very useful but
not very glamorous everybody wants to
have cortical colors because they're
miss Spacey and cool thing and if we
figure out what the corpus was doing
maybe we're going to solve some other
tricky problems for AI and machine
learning but the retina for example
doing a retina scanning project would
also probably not be too costly I would
guess about a million dollars or
something like I'm just guessing about
the costs here but they think in general
we're surprisingly close if it was just
somebody getting the funding and
deciding to do it some you first are you
summarizing this question so for
recording is going to be interesting but
yeah what can we find the port let's see
what sub parts of the brain are what you
described is essentially the issue of
how to do an economic simulation of a
very complex system and ideally you want
to figure out what's going on and then
you can simplify the simulation you
don't need to do run the full electro
dynamics of a transistor you can just
replace it with a logical element but
you probably need to run before the
dynamics first in order to figure that
out especially if you're trying to
reverse engineering and say let's say a
Pentium 4 processor this way so this
goes back to the issue of scaling the
separation and I think we have decent
ideas that there must be some scale
separation biology because if you don't
have that if there is a lack of
modularity it becomes very hard to
actually evolve anything and neurons are
pretty nicely compartmental they're
electrically quietly insulated from the
surroundings we certainly have an
interactive interaction with the
surroundings but it's relatively local
so and similarly within cells you again
get a lot of compartmentalization I
think that is what I would be kind of
using in order to
simplify things but what I'm interesting
from a kind of general scientific
perspective is actually could we develop
good tools for rapidly figuring this out
in a new system well how low level do we
need to do this simulation on and
sometimes you can figure that out by
looking at time constants for example
and this scale compartmentalization the
physical compartmentalization also does
is the tricky thing about the chip for
example transistors have very long range
connections they're not just local the
brain is actually quite nice in this
regard because a lot of it all the
interactions tend to be very local
but yeah I'm happy to discuss this later
I even think it's bit tricky to quickly
answer so it was a question over here
yeah that was because of the paper by
Robin Hanson he points out that if it
costs a billion dollar to make a brain
scan and run it
well now great Bill Gates gets
immortality or at least a copy but once
you're down to about a million dollars
now it becomes cost-effective to
actually copy professionals and that is
economic plutonium partially Robin
Hanson's model is the only one that
currently exists among my friends were
having kind of informal models but are
slowly working my way towards actually
becoming real papers mainly because
we're so scared about Robins very
cheerfully cynical model that seems to
suggest and the population and running
off towards infinity and wages going
down towards zero which seems to be
wrong or dystopian but yeah it's very
sunny interesting arbitrariness about
the money and obviously the first
project is going to be some kind of wave
not Manhattan probably at least a well
founded Research Foundation
maybe the Allan brain map or something
like that yeah
well neurogenesis is interesting but we
actually don't have much experience in
simulating development of organisms yet
and that is a real problem if we had a
good way of growing brains in the
software I think that would be very good
but right now that's a much less
developed area than this kind of neural
network model it might turn out of
course that we're going to get a few
surprising breakthroughs in the next
decades and in that case that might be a
better way of doing it that would be a
way of getting artificial intelligence
kind of by cheating oh it's actually a
kind of human child growing up inside a
computer again a lot of interesting
ethical questions are going to keep me
and my colleagues nicely salaried but
from my kind of developing AI in
perspective yeah it might work I'm
suspicious that it's going to be is
going to be problematic because the
biology actually in development is
really missing if we're a bit concerned
about the messy biology of an adult
brain the development is going to
involve structure remodeling again a lot
of local interactions but a lot of this
is going on and low concentration
morphogens diffusing around and that
might be a pretty massive but I'm hoping
to stand corrected yeah
well I think that is a kind of high
level difference what's going on kind of
low level to drive it I think we have a
decent understanding of in terms of
noradrenergic activating system as on
kind of regulating which kind of
attractor states the brain tend to move
into so sleep unconscious well I think a
brain emulation of sleep that's very
doable actually I've seen some papers
about that whether we would get
consciousness is a completely different
matter and given that I get horrible
headaches from philosophy of mind I'm
kind of trying to avoid that
yeah any questions from the other sides
no local questions people have better
fix it Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
