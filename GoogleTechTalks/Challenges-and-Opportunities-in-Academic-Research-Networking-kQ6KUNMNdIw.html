today I'm just going to be introducing
our speaker Donald Clark but let me
explain the purpose of this of this
afternoon session Donald and his
colleagues are here from New Zealand and
they're very interested in advanced
networking their primary focus has been
in the academic arena but as we all know
academic applications and networking
have leaked out into the general public
if that weren't so Google wouldn't be
here our founders leaked out from
Stanford University and started this
company so a purpose is to have a
discussion so although Donald's going to
have something to say about what his
organization has been doing in fact it's
intended to be much more interactive and
so please don't be shy about raising
issues and ideas and reacting to the
things that that we're talking about I
think Donald you'll accept an
interruption at any time let me tell you
a little bit about dr. Clark he was
originally a chemical engineer it from
edinboro and he says in his informal
resume that he failed at being a
chemical engineer so then he became an
IT information technology and computer
consultant writing C code for Price
Waterhouse and he says he failed at that
too now as I'm sure this is by your
metrics don't might perhaps no one
else's then he helped start up Ask
Jeeves in the UK as a sales engineer so
clearly he's drifting away from his
roots at this point he claims he failed
at that too but then went on to booz
allen hamilton a very large and
well-respected consulting company to
doing business in information technology
consulting and he said he did okay with
that and then for reasons unspecified he
moved to New Zealand presumed wasn't the
consequence of having anything happened
at booz allen hamilton and worked for
the government so that's quite a shift
from his early roots to from
private sector into government work
first for the Treasury and then later
for the Prime Minister and by the way
prime minister of New Zealand is a force
of nature as nearly as I can make out
I've met her on occasion and very very
sorry hoots of nieta incredible as so
his consultation for the prime minister
involved telecommunications digital
technology science and transport and
then as of jun of 2006 he became the CEO
of an organization called rihan's which
is the research and education advanced
network of New Zealand the project of
which he'll be talking about today is
called Karen the Kiwi advanced research
and education network it is in some
respects the analog of the American
national research and education network
which in fact led to some of the
commercialization of Internet technology
we have analogs here in the United
States now with the National lambda rail
and with the Internet to project of the
University Consortium for advanced
internet development so Donald and his
colleagues are here to learn from us the
kinds of issues that we see driving
network technology development what will
push the edges and the limits of what we
can do today in networking so without
further ado Donald let me ask you to
engage in the conversation thank you
very much indeed thank you thanks for
having us and there's a certain irony i
think has been said is we came over here
trying to tap your knowledge and
experience and suddenly we end up here
presenting to you so if we can mirror
that as much as possible that'll be
wonderful i think before i sort of firm
i get into this i tried not tried to
have as few of my own ideas as possible
and talking to you today and really
hoovered up a lot of what's been going
around in our community a lot of people
we've got to mention and they'll get it
mentioned in the source material as we
go through but in particular and there's
a couple of news lists one run by Bill
Santa know of the Canadian Network
canary and another one which is called
Archie con which has some quite good
thinking that goes on so I found those
lists particular useful to keep up to
date and I can
of those details if you're interested
yourself so it's probably worthwhile
though starting with a little bit of
context all right you feelin it's why
this is not why I came to New Zealand
amendment New Zealanders a country which
is gob gob smacking Lee beautiful and
it's basically full of nuts errs who
devise new ways to kill themselves in
extreme sports okay physically this is a
sort of territory that you have to put
fiber through okay so it's not a
brilliant country in terms its natural
topography for supporting people laying
fiber okay it's also not the country
where if it's a little bit foggy at your
local airport you get diverted to and
your plane okay this is a hemispherical
zoom out from google earth here's
wellington you can't see North America
okay 11,000 kilometers to get to San
Francisco from Wellington okay across
the u.s. it's fallen a bit okay we can
just about see Australia this sort of
small island over here that there's some
stuff goes on there we don't care about
Antarctica is just about as close okay
so again the challenge you've got here
is our network boundary isn't the edge
of our country right our network
boundary is Sydney and it's Seattle ok
so we have an enormous networking
challenge right just to get out of the
country to internet work with the rest
of the world okane a lot of that thought
drives law that sits behind our thinking
in New Zealand here's some stats some of
them a little bit of them light-hearted
but I wanted to compare new zealand vs
california game to give you a sense of
the context the environment that we're
going to be coming from we're about half
maybe three fifths the size of
California New Zealand with over a lot
of fewer people here to keep and there's
a lot for your people and we've got 10
sheep each which is pretty good odds
okay and I was trying to think of I was
trying to think of the right metric for
a California no I could think was
venture capital firms and to some extent
again this underpins our economies New
Zealand isn't an agrarian economy right
based on sheep in on me too no milk
production and increasingly some other
things as well and I really think of
California think people think of a
capital economy okay an economy by
applying capital and smart ways to to
new technologies
GDP wise New Zealand trucks long about a
hundred billion u.s. and California's
about 1.7 trillion and in purchasing
power parity you can see the GDP per
capita of New Zealanders significant
below that of California's case that's
on a PPP basis not a nominal basis so
again there's a context here of a
disparity of wealth a challenge with
networking a challenge on economic and
you know fundamental base what drives
the wealth of new zealand coming through
we do have a wine industry it's not
quite as big as California's but there
are some fantastic new zealand wine so
when you do get to come and see us and
you'll feel right at home and the last
comment there is that the one thing we
do punch above our weight on thanks to
peter junction is we've twenty percent
so two out of ten of the world's biggest
ever grossing box-office films were
filmed in welly would okay so there we
go that's a bit of a comparison but it
hope you've got a reasonable picture of
New Zealand and let's talk a little bit
about Karen before i get into the
challenges and opportunities i'm not
going to go through all of this but very
briefly and we've got a big old 10-gig
lambda around the country we try and
keep everything at layer 2 as much as
possible so we VLAN and we switch
everything keep it fast we really just
have one routing one writer but i mean
we've got two of them for redundancy but
we just we just right between vlans and
our pops are neutral so we have neutral
interconnects that's really critical for
us and but we leased the the wavelength
from a domestic supplier and released
our international capacity from verizon
so they provide a fully managed service
for us internationally we've got an STM
12 Sydney an STM for to Seattle and
there's this metric you see why what the
hell is that metric well and one of the
European endrin national research and
education network organizations which is
the European one called tarina they have
a benchmarking survey and what they do
is they try and sort of have this who's
got the biggest competition right and
they come with a metric which is your
time to know your capacity of network by
the size of your kilometer stretch okay
so we work out at around 30 million
megabit second kilometers including our
links to Seattle Inklings to Sydney that
actually places as around fourth or
fifth when compared to all the other
European networks so we're maybe not
technically the most advanced we've
maybe not gonna rain for that long Karen
itself has only been lit up since
December the 15th last year the
network's despite 14 months old and but
in terms of physical size and chow
it's significant and we're already
getting in excess of 10 terabytes per
day on cumulative port count traffic
we're not quite sure how is to measure
it so am people are starting to use this
thing and our challenge here is really
good how do we go forward what does
count two point oh look like what are
the challenges we're facing yeah we got
a mic here we go yeah yeah we turn like
you need do you need the mic in order to
capture on the you know okay so it's
been surf and the question is whether
the system is accessible to any other
than the academic community our mandate
is to connect the research and education
community in its widest sense so that
includes schools libraries museums
teaching hospitals it also includes
private sector organizations which are
doing research with our members this is
research in the IT sense or is it more
broadly so it could be bioresources so
Fonterra one of our big domestic milk
and cooperatives does research they're
eligible to connect to Karen for doing
so the implication of that is the
applications that might find themselves
on this network drawn from a very broad
range of R&amp;amp;D activity and could involve
very large data sets in this bio world
astronomy physics and so on could have
very significant demands on movement of
data or storage of data absolutely
that's one of my challenges actually
okay yeah if anybody else has questions
you know hollering on you use the
microphone up there or grab me or
something that's where if anyone can't
understand me as well then to wave your
hand and I'll try and speak in tongues
or something and briefly about me sort
of vint covered it really and but my
first computer i'm very proud of was is
a tech spectrum 48k does anyone remember
tzedek spectrum no worry does that's
easier from britain and no one else does
um but yeah I sort of I got actually
into computers doing my Chemical
Engineering more so in some of the
nonlinear modeling systems and that
process engineer's have to do and
there's our beloved Prime Minister the
event was mentioning that's a really
good picture offer yes
okay I'm not going to I'm finally some
context around e-science Andy research
ok so when science started okay I guess
thousands a years ago it was a
descriptive sort of empirical option we
then moved on to a gay successor
ethically so where people actually said
okay I'm going to create a law max laws
laws on newton's laws and were going to
actually use those and predict the
future because of it simulation I guess
kicked in middle of this middle of last
century and people started to say well
actually I can take these complex
phenomena these laws I can model them
and I can start to see how the site to
the real world might Matt without doing
those real experiments and I think today
really there's picture of Jim Gray there
I guess the late Jim Gray and science is
very much data centric okay so whether
you're creating data from your
experiments your am capturing it from
your instruments you're generating it by
simulations you're generating from your
sensor networks and the vast majority of
science is getting ever more data
centric and data-intensive so it's
creating a set of disciplines and set of
challenges for researchers which says
okay how do I work in that environment
as a researcher ok so just comparing say
a research today with a web user today
and let's say this is mr. average or
mrs. average researcher you know they're
doing things they are sharing but it's
usually quite a symmetric okay and it's
usually not that pervasive and they are
collaborating okay and they are starting
to share their ideas of how they're
doing things but when you compare it to
some of the new paradigms we're seeing
emerging and it's a bit messy will will
any of these be successful in the web
world we don't know but there's a lot
higher sense of instantaneous
collaboration a lot more sense of data
coming together more fluidly and moving
across boundaries more fluidly so I
think this model a traditional
researcher has this model of being at
the center bring the hub I'm going to do
an experiment take the data give the
data to something else process it take
it back think about it talk to a
colleague about it and I think there's
that sense of a research or actually
having to stand back and somehow allow
the data itself to flow between those
elements more easily and be
ductor in the orchestrator rather than
the hub for some app data so those are
some of the background challenges as
well for you researchers in this erm
this data centric world briefly what I'm
not going to talk about today or try and
bring up for discussion is the culture
change the funding those sorts of
aspects associated with erie search okay
they are big and they are significant
but I'm just going to try and stick to
the hard and the soft engineering
challenges because a lot of these things
a lot of the culture change things and
the funding issues of very country
specific and very culture specific as
well now the question about hard and
soft engineering for you soft
engineering might be things like user
interfaces or application space where
you're trying to figure out how do I
make this particular task easier to to
do more automated data discovery and so
on yeah that's okay thank you and
hardware anything probably from sort of
middle Network layers down to the boxes
and the fibers right so here we go and I
pick six I picked three opportunities
three challenges I mean to some extent
you know challenges and opportunities
are a bit yin and yang so there's
elements of both in both but these are
our challenges really today that i think
is stopping us accelerating forward ok
so that's Identity and Access Management
its data curation and its local access
right the pervasive local isolates last
kilometer last mile challenge on the
opportunity side I think these are areas
where we as advanced research and
education networks as academic networks
have a real chance to influence the
wider community both the commercial
space and the public space okay and I
think that's around resource efficiency
so we're environments in which we can
get better at sharing the use of people
data physical equipment and there be
more energy efficient
I think we're also a space where we have
a less challenging relationship at times
or a less tense relationship with some
of the market players and we can drive
some innovation in terms of the
solutions the market wants to deliver we
can derive some innovation in terms of
government public policy and we can
drive Network innovation so that there's
a chance for academic networks just as
ARPANET originally did and as we've seen
with some of the projects that are
coming out of the US and Europe just now
to try and innovate in the network space
and then finally are one of our key
goals obviously is to support new
zealand and support that and generating
greater innovation out comes forward and
sharing our culture and our stories with
the rest of the world so I already know
quite how do you want I have a whole
bunch of reactions to this six these six
challenges and opportunities do you have
more that you are going to present
before you dive into that discussion I
was about to start on each of these so
okay if you want it no no why don't you
dive in and because I have specific
reactions especially in items two and
five and maybe six okay right right does
anyone else feel there's something
particularly missing there or they might
want me to try and cover or just let you
wait wait wait want to be on the record
he talked about the network primarily
being a research network right so how
well is the country itself linked
especially your point fire using driving
the market so unless the research world
and the privates have to really join
hands how are you going to drive the
market and stuff like that we can drive
the market in terms of
telecommunications products now I'll
touch on some this later simply by
forcing the purchasing habits because
we're not a big scary cannibalistic
we're going to take your revenue away
you actually find when you go to market
that the vendors are able and willing to
do different things so we went to the
market asked for a 10 gig least
wavelength of light never done before
New Zealand right just let means just
push the market so far in terms of
delivering that we're seeing already now
some of that type of service been
offered by the telco that provided it to
us into the commercial marketplace a
couple of years later so i think it's
just been able to say we're not a scary
competitor it's not about cannibalizing
your traffic but if you work with us
we're going to want different stuff than
you're delivering just now so you're not
and this this I'll go in time what do
you as a good question it ok identity
and access management so here's this
researcher at the edge being the
conductor not the laboratory but the
collaboratory somebody sort of termed it
at one point and there's also middleware
and there's lots of software sort of
governing all these different unit
operations unit operations of research I
guess rather than chemical processing so
how does that happen well that's great
because I can send some messages here
use some disputed resources and that's
all that's all very good want to pass my
data around but to access the data to
share a resource I need to identify
myself all right I mean we don't live in
this perfect utopia where there's
Commons and everything's available to
everybody all of the time so out of that
becomes Identity and Access Management
the ability to be able to say I am this
person have that asserted and I have
access to the following resources that
you're offering okay and that's a really
important thing and traditionally that's
been done by having multiple logins so
one important distinction here is to be
made between identi
and privileges yes those are should be
distinct the fact that you've identified
yourself doesn't necessarily imply any
particular privilege and the different
privileges systems could exist
concurrently with the identity systems
and the privilege in system says please
help me validate the identity of this
party before I then decide which access
they have and which what actions they're
permitted to take you said here that
it's the number to issue in Australia
this is the number to issue for home for
which that was a survey off the
university IT directors last year or you
know Africa and what is it that's
driving it as an issue I think it's been
driven by two things it's been driven by
science becoming more expensive and the
costs of science became more expensive
whether that's access to a public data
source or a commercially provided data
source or its buying a piece of
equipment and at the same time your
funding stream isn't going to the same
extent and collaborations driving it as
well so internationally people are
collaborating a lot more and as people
start to exploit some of the new
web-based tools or slice a more
instantaneous delivery mechanisms people
that are getting fed up with having to
assert who they are every time and then
try and secure access to a resource so
there's a tipping point coming where the
pain of having to manage multiple
assertion and access privileges is sort
of driving this now insane okay you know
every day if I don't set up a custom
access across campus to allow you to tap
into this database that's a drain on IT
resource if I can have a framework that
we've already agreed okay so they're
interesting appliqued this is important
to Google for example the Wikipedia
which is sort of unattributed has been
subject to some complained about the
fact that you don't know who supplied
the information we made an attempt to
deal with that problem
using a system which we would have a
fennec ation and unfrozen sorry is that
your new this is an old listen all I
dentist but this same thing shows up in
the commercial context as well where you
want to authenticate yourself to some
authority which will then quickly
validate because it's a you know
computer based and interaction quickly
validate you to other parties third
parties this is always the trusted third
party problem which variably shows up
but there's also a hijack technical
challenge here once you've authenticated
yourself to some third party system
which is then going to be used to
authenticate you to other services you
need to make sure that the party who
made the authentication is still the one
that is interacting with the service
that has been authenticated by the third
third hand and in order to do that you
almost have to have some kind of a
cryptic cryptographic method for
inhibiting an attempt to hijacked access
and so Isis somewhere buried in all of
this is a strong I believe a strong
dependence on high-grade cryptographic
support could be yeah something let's um
talk a little bit about some of the
things in our research and education
community that we're seeing i believe
that i love the technicals certainly in
terms of technical protocols are largely
solved there's a convergence around
sam'l to security assertion markup
language okay we're also seen that
convergence not just from the academic
side but from the private sector the
Liberty Alliance has adopted sam'l to
and it has announced in december of
seven that is actually off they have
certified its first set of products
which was sound too compliant okay a lot
of these are actually identity service
from middleware providers be a and
Sonnen and whomever so we're seeing some
pretty good alignment okay the great
thing about the sam'l too and it's
integrated in something called the
Shibboleth implementation for the R&amp;amp;D
community it's a very common
implementation Shibboleth came out of an
Internet to project is its federated
okay you have to set up your levels of
trust but
it does is it says what my host
institution says yes I am me when
somebody asks but it only distributes to
the asker the minimum required set of
attributes to allow me to do what I want
to do so it has quite important data
privacy protection issues as well here
instead of me telling several people all
about myself okay I can control more
tightly my personal information okay my
personal attributes and if I want access
to a resource then that resource says oh
I just need to know if they are
researcher there or I need to know maybe
if there are over 18 or I need to know
if they're part of a particular program
so it can request a specific data points
and once you file guess genuinely
authenticated who you are and you have
much less personal data transfer and the
credential distribution that goes along
with that so this is why and sandwich
susan julito about the government stuff
in new zealand the government is
implementing a government single login
service for web-based services and it's
converging on sam'l to as well as its
architecture so across the education
space across the are any community and
across government as well in new zealand
and sell to is the the architecture has
been used i'm not quite sure the
cryptographic urban actual
implementation standard there is another
potential hazard here as single identity
can be bound to essentially everything
you do and so people who are concerned
about privacy worried that this sort of
single sign-on leads to privacy abuse
and especially you mentioned the
government of course for many people not
just in the US but elsewhere there are
concerns that the government knows more
than you want them to know about your
everyday activity has that risen to
visibility on your radar screen within
the government's now I'm on thin ice
here is on entirely sure what's going on
but within the government they don't
actually store they've got a setup where
they don't store your ID they actually
just authenticate your password and we
can get the architecture references but
they don't actually store your profile
so i think i'm not sure whether that's
stored it differently whether that's
distributed or whether it's toward
personally but they have an architect
the where in New Zealand because we have
previously laws that say you can't do
this sort of thing
they have some architecture that allows
for a validation of your identity but
doesn't store lots of information about
you and I think it's almost like a login
name versus password authentication it's
a they've thought about that but I don't
have a great answer for that I think
maybe we after there we are to do it I'd
like to follow up yeah we can look at
the website yet so while I think we've
got some of those technical convergence
challenges solved and people generally
know where they going to be heading for
there's still lot of business process
challenges okay the levels of trust that
you have to federate at so just because
you know somebody's asserting the fact
that I am Who I am doesn't mean that
nested trust that person okay oh there
are different levels of trust you know
getting a passport and asserting that
somebody is someone so you can give them
a password is a quite different level of
trust and simply allowing them to log
into your newspaper online so a lot of
the stuff there has to be worked through
and I gained legislation comes in in
terms of alignment domestically but
again with international requirements
and more and more we're seeing disparity
between international data regulation
data privacy and data management regimes
and provide some quite significant
stumbling blocks for cross-border
identity and access management how did
you do it that's a big challenge as well
the US has taken more of a carrots
approach in a cajoling approach it has
the in common Federation in command org
the UK because it has more of a top
slice funding modelers be more of a
benevolent dictator and just says we are
going to this and here's fifty thousand
dollars to help you you know tweak your
systems let's just get on with it and I
think it's an open boot quite rare new
ceilings going to end up right now it's
taken a bit of a fact-finding
encouragement approach and this is my
last slide on identity and access
management but I think we've got to
mention open ID as well where does open
ID fit into this picture of the sam'l to
architecture the institutional
authentication and that's just some
Google Trends information you can see
this in the open IDs become very popular
you know at least among searches in the
last little while to me it's quite
different though open ID
a personal level shared ID shared login
service ok your sam'l to Shibboleth
implementations our institution centric
ok so I can go to any site i can set
myself up as an open ID provider it's
just a way for me to not have to log
into lots and lots of sites and
hopefully everyone recognizes my URL
that i'm providing as my identity
assertion location an institution
centric approach has a quite different
level of trust associated with it ok so
they're coming from different angles one
is simply a nicety to avoid down to
login lots of times and i think yahoo at
the end of the month is becoming an open
ID provider so hopefully my yahoo ID is
going to let me access lots of other
things without having to re-login and
re-register it ops for the site but it's
not going to suddenly let me access
resource I can you know academic
resources or trusted resources through a
Shibboleth Federation I think the likely
outcome is we'll see some sort of
integration between the two possibly
that I can go to an institution in the
future i have my open ID and i can
temporarily Federation ID or associate
my open ID with the institution an
institution if they might becomes a
temporary I'm super level and trust
provider for my particular open ID I
that that imposes gain security
challenges and business real challenges
and but something like that might be
might be an outcome as we go forward and
I know you're halfway through here and
we're only on the fourth side just one
thought about identity here I think that
there is a balance between the
willingness to accept another party's
authentication the risks associated with
accepting it and the liabilities
associated with let's say inadequacy of
authenticity and so from the business
point of view we need to find ways to
balance those but if you back up a
couple of steps we also need to define
standards for authenticity what steps
did you take to authenticate an
individual and in the US for example
every state in the union issues driver's
licenses and they are accepted on a
national scale for personal
identification
asian for certain purposes and there's
an assumption that's made that every
state in the Union has applied minimally
acceptable authentication mechanisms and
procedures well you know whether they
have or not that's the assumption so I
think there's a very interesting
business analysis that can be taken here
balancing liabilities and risks yeah
it's a good point I think in new zealand
that it may be internationally the
education sectors i set out parameters
for about four or five layers or levels
of trust and they've done some of that
definitional work but i haven't seen a
good example of the business process
risk analysis ok so that was identity
access management sorry for maybe sky
ting over some of it but I'm there's a
few other things to speak about as well
data curation this is a biggie ok to
some extent I answer this question a
little bit earlier when asked something
about what was driving these but I'm
let's just like the Rick Stevens at the
Argonne National Lab over in Chicago put
up at one of our conferences last year
they call these the super trends okay
that were driving changes in the way
science happened and they have an impact
on data all of them particularly the
first two he pointed out that
experimentation has been increasingly
done by high-throughput robotic systems
a case the amount of data that's being
chucked out is almost exponentially
increasing and it's increasing almost an
ease at least linearly Dino increasingly
used to actually create that data so
what we're having there is a data volume
revolution there are significantly large
and ever amounts of data being produced
the complexity of problems is such that
it's driving us to us interdisciplinary
science I think there's also funding
constraint that it's driving us towards
that so people are now having to operate
yeah with larger data sets but across
larger groups of people more complex
organization and team boundaries and
that puts pressure on your data to be
accessible in different ways puts
pressure on your data to be shared and
to rated and managed in different ways
the last thing I think has to some
extent and impact on data but the point
being made there is that we can actually
fundamentally change some of the
research and some of the data generating
activities we can do by moving from the
Museo scale don't see the micro scale at
topics parents especially in biogenetics
and I have bioinformatics and that
actually what we could be doing there is
seeing where we've worked and all these
data sets to date forget it it's easier
just to replicate them and create a
whole new data set or a whole new to
data foundation for our research area so
there's a few super trends the Rick
point said that sort of driving science
and all of those have data implications
so the first one lots more data ok how
much more data well this is this is
janets it's the UK network and it's
pumping out about and a three petabytes
a month at been traffic that top graph
is from the terrain ER studies that's
the European networks last annual
traffic growth and it seems to be
stabilizing currently around fifty
percent per annum okay traffic growth on
the European academic networks I know we
don't want to get tangled up in a
particular chart but I'm fascinated by
the apparent regularity of the depth in
the in the traffic charts if you look at
and you can see these big yeah what is
this all about is this Christmas time
yes I think that's like it is ok
everybody stops working the computer
still talk a little bit but computers
are never supposed to stop working
there's something wrong here I mean
there are areas of research that are
growing at more than fifty percent ok so
the LHC the Large Hadron Collider is
going to chuck at gigabit per second
feeds to that's a 80 something 86
terabytes a day ok you're already doing
experiments that are chucking out and
you know easily two terabytes a day for
some bio sequencing stuff one of the
reasons I think that this growth here
this fifty percent doesn't necessarily
match the fact the world so I said this
the quality internet pros because we've
been ahead of that I don't think it
matches that hundred percent of some of
these experiments because to something
that it's brought up in the average but
also we're seeing the early phases of
people setting up separate private
networks which don't get measured by the
big-ip pipe so the LHC data is going to
sit on separate optical paths okay and I
suspect that a lot of this data
measurement we're simply not going to be
measuring almost traffic volume in the
future I think one of the traffic volume
measures will be doing is simply how
many point-to-point dynamic circuits do
you have on your network
ok how many lambdas do you have
provisioned we're not really going to
care whether somebody is using that
lambda by full capacity at 10 gigs at 40
gigs or whether using a one gig because
it's just easier and cheaper to give
them a lambda right we don't worry with
mpls don't regret quality of service you
just just provision them a wavelength ok
and what you do then is you'll have an
impact on your traffic volumes and we'll
switch from this paradigm of how far is
the network you know what's the
contention ratio on the network you just
move away from that so there's some
potential is certainly there is lots
more data being created and that data is
happening in lots more places as well ok
so the web's there and then the younger
generation of researchers done to get us
great I can share my business processes
and put my experiments up and do a
public sort of fee no announcement of my
science online and put some data up to
support I can run a grid on my grid in
the UK or I've got virtual research
environment there's lots of these things
coming up now and that's wonderful ok
that's a real headache if you're trying
to manage your scientific data right
it's wonderful to share it but that sort
of web 2.0 science to point o science as
a service or science tools as a service
idea creates real headaches if you have
to curate your data and the ownership we
talk about that international
collaboration as well who actually owns
the data I mean you organize a tomato is
my IP and you know I have to own it's on
my server but suddenly data sets have
been smooshed together okay or maybe I
only have ownership for a period of time
and I think the stakeholder basis around
information sets is getting increasingly
vague and increasingly diffuse and
there's a real challenge there in terms
of ownership as well when you come to
data curation this is wonderful you
won't be familiar this you won't be
otherwise you need to get out more and
this is a new zealand Public Records Act
legislative impacts can have a really
really major driving force on what we do
in this space the New Zealand public
records act 2005 is quite advanced
legislation in this space it says you
have a requirement as a public office
that includes universities to maintain
full and accurate records for at least
25 years if you want to get rid of any
data learnt any record you have to get
permission from the chief archivist
so suddenly now you can't just shirk
your responsibilities as L we've deleted
that we threw that server diskette we
didn't need that data anymore and sorry
you've got to convince the chief
archivist in New Zealand that you don't
need that day to anymore okay on top of
that in 2010 they're starting audits and
for the public offices to make sure the
compliant with this okay so this is
driving huge compliance headaches and I
don't think the research sector new
zones actually sort of the said this is
a challenge for us today okay there may
be some ways to help drive solutions for
this but fundamentally that really puts
a fire under the data curation issue and
here are some of the challenges who what
what role do people have okay what
responsibilities do I have what's my
role to play in it could be different at
different times with different data sets
how do we prioritize hot to store what
data elements you know even what sort of
order to try and store things in who
makes those decisions how do we bother
collecting it do we have incentives for
the researchers because right now
they're probably not getting paid to
spend the time it takes to actually
curate and store and put metadata around
some of this stuff what's our policy on
what do we keep them what we don't keep
because if we allow people to make their
own judgments which is kind of what it
is just now you end up with quite
significant inconsistency the actual
technical ways of retaining and managing
it very hard very expensive okay how do
we keep access for it how do we make
sure that formats shifting and data
degradation doesn't occur for 25 years
you know I can't open my Microsoft Word
to point o documents that i wrote so my
final your stuff in and but we've got to
keep things for 25 years that's a
problem I think our community around the
world is starting to address some of
those challenges I think it's fair to
say that probably the UK in the US are
much further ahead the UK for quite a
while has had its digital curation
center some great stuff here education
some best practice tools how to audit
your data how to pick your standards to
use and they're sort of running at UK
data archive but it's they've got lots
of repositories they're not going from
monolithic you know we'd like all your
data please and we'll take care of it
for you so they've taken more of a
federated and disaggregated approach to
store it pluses and cons to that I guess
the u.s. recognized back in September 05
the National Science Board said this is
going to be a problem for us
and they've actually got an NSF proposal
out there just now that's the number of
it for Datanet and they're looking for
submissions around this and limited
initial scope with a real practical
focus so I think the u.s. is heading
down more further you know a big bucket
for everything we'll see how successful
that is when the proposals come in the
Australians have picked up recently
they're investing nationally in a
national data service for research New
Zealand really hasn't done anything yet
on the are any side and it has funded a
national digital heritage archive but
that's really from a library perspective
so it's about deposits of library books
and web scraping so it's not really
tackling the research side so we're
underway and but i'm not sure given the
exponential rate of volume that data is
increasing at and we should feel at all
comfortable good i just weigh in on one
point here i've concluded that we have
what i'm calling a bit rot problem and
basically it has a lot to do with the
ability to understand the data that
we've archived the formats will change
over time and the software that new that
format may die and we're going to run
into some serious challenges there and
afterwards i'd like to follow up on that
Newt I've got a great example from the
BBC BBC back in the 1980s did something
called the Doomsday project where they
went round lots of schools and and took
you know snippets of our life in the UK
and they put it onto these laser disks
and they were pretty much a custom
format with custom machines that ran
against a BBC micro and you do this
particular hard disc player I think
there's now only one machine left at an
enthusiastic app that can actually read
those discs and play them back in their
original format so yet so that's been 20
years it's an LA the the problem here is
that you have to preserve the software
that knew how to deal with the
application and the data and the
metadata then you may need to preserve
the operating system that ran that
application then you may need to
preserve an interpreter of the hardware
that ran the operating system and so on
after a while it's starting to look like
you need the kind of cloud computing
that Google has been pursuing in order
to maintain the ability to
teen access to that day yes yeah and is
a virtual machine running is that a
valid replay of the data and yeah okay
local access this is challenge three and
I don't know if anyone here at the
particular focus on physical networks
but for an advanced research network
it's very front of mind all the time
it's great having a 10 gig backbone and
it's not so good if you're going to get
into a school at 2 megabits per second
over dsl line okay so it's just a
fundamental problem and we probably face
it more than anything broadband wireless
is improving okay that's great and this
is a map of Vodafone's 3g coverage hsdpa
coverage rain Wellington and I guess the
terms is you still need more fiber in
the ground because the faster your
wireless speed the further out your
fiber backhaul needs to go okay
depending on the frequency you're using
so there's no way of getting around it
advanced networks are obsessed about
fiber right wireless great for some
schools grateful within the campus not
good for us for anything else okay it's
fiber but the market place also has
quite a long yeah the marketplace is
critical for deploying that fiber okay
absolutely critical this is an OECD
graph and it's a range of broadband
prices per megabit second okay so you
can see that new zealand actually has
some great value broadband ok this is on
a PPP basis as well that's actually that
figure there is driven by a cable
provider that has a couple of nice
geographic areas where they've actually
put coax and fiber cabling ok the reason
we've got such a large spread of pricing
indicates a lack of competition and at
the high end this is the incumbent slow
dsl service ok so the US doesn't fear
brilliantly but it's got a more
competitive market it's got a narrower
pricing range ok but you can see the
u.s. is well behind some of our best
services on a PPP basis and you're well
behind and other countries as well so i
think this that to me this is a great
summary slide of how effective your
market is delivering fiber
I'm sorry I'm not sure I'm understanding
how to read this is the that's it is the
horizontal axis is the data rate range
no that's the price that's the range of
prices on the logarithmic scale so from
two dollars up to thirty eight dollars I
see off service offerings in the
marketplace what's the oh okay don't
replace a logarithmic scale okay damn it
is yeah that's a little hard interesting
scale rotation of that chart is a little
hard to I sort of reckoned that the
narrow that is the video competition the
further that way it is the cheapest the
most like we've got we don't have a good
competitive environment in the u.s.
right now for our advantage so this is
what this is my view of what's happening
globally in the world in terms of new
fiber economics 414 better term this is
the inverted pyramid that goes from the
physical network in layer so ducts
cables in the ground okay all the way up
to services you want to have as many
people being able to compete on the
service layer as possible because that's
where most innovations happening okay
that's close to the consumer and that's
the exciting part of things okay the
turnover there is 12 18 months and less
k in terms of new services so you guys
you know know very well here this is the
litany 5-10 year cycles depending on how
close the edge of the network you are
okay but less room for competition less
economical less economic potential for
significant competition especially in
small market places like New Zealand or
in regional towns and cities now the
physical layer there as well ideally
from an economic point of view you don't
really want to have competing physical
infrastructures if you can find a way to
avoid competing physical infrastructures
and still get all the access to services
up above at a reasonable price then that
can be beneficial in terms of minimizing
the overall investment and duplication
of investment in your country the
challenge I guess we got today is that
with an incumbent telco they see a slice
like this okay so they have a limited
amount of service innovation and they
have to drive a return on capital that's
heavily weighted towards this it across
the whole thing so if you see here the
capital requirements are quite different
there's got a very low entry barrier you
buy a server you stick it up in your
garage you get a pay back in two years
hope you can really rich
you get a high ROI down here you looking
at 25 40-year asset life ok this is
utilities pension fund investments right
this is you know you know less than vc
investors right this a short-term vc
work so the different capital
requirements the different network
layers right really engendered
specialist types of capital coming into
them but when you have a vertically
integrated monopoly right they try and
capture the value by taking a position
on the physicals which is very hard to
untrained but what it does it just
limits competition okay and it limits
the returns so we have an absolute
terrible problem in the United States in
this area we have the net neutrality
arguments in the US and the
non-discrimination arguments have fallen
on deaf ears at the Federal
Communications Commission and the
Congress with a few exceptions in your
country I know personally about some
interactions that led to a more
enlightened view of opening up access to
the physical facilities but in the
United States it's been declared that
there are no layers and then it's all
internet service and that leads the
physical owner to inhibit competition by
interfering with others who are trying
to provide value-added services it's
really very very best being some High
Court rulings on that as well so is that
definition it by definition the internet
is not does not have any communication
capability in it at all so if they moved
it to a portion of the telecom act which
is which does not include any of the
common carriage rules of normal
telecommunications but Europe's getting
that yeah that's a Linda yeah Brannon's
is in fact zoobies and reading or wave
area where you know some extent as is
your Minister of Communications so
here's my essential solution elements
for arriving at that sort of model first
thing you need to do is unbundle your IP
to net connectivity from your commodity
internet service okay so fundamental
Karen does provide commodity internet as
a service if you want to go get it you
can buy that as a service you want to
see some rights that go beyond the
immediate edge device on that particular
Network that's a service okay
it's maybe a subtle point but I think
it's pretty fundamental the second verse
you need to coordinate your investment
in that fiber to the curb fiber to the
house layer so whether you take that on
as a benevolent dictator again you've
got a local monopoly maybe a utility
that's regionally own door is owned by
the community happens quite a lot of new
zealand the local regional councillors
often own the energy lines companies or
the water companies use them whether you
end up with a regulated over the top
service provider or potentially
competitive over the top situation you
know the telecommunications got the
traditional incumbent elf has been
disintermediated quite quite quickly
okay you look at energy companies
entertainment company so TV and all the
rest of it health health insurance
companies they're the people who are
actually driving value out of having
higher and faster connectivity speeds
okay so they have a chance to come in
over the top and extract the value out
of the am out of the telco service
provider edit that commodity internet
connection I think in coupled with those
you could also look at doing some
geographical temporal concessions to
that fiber code to sort of say okay
we're not going to we're going to allow
you to make twenty percent or
twenty-five percent returns to the first
five years we're going to set that as a
trade off for you making a significant
capital investment we're going to
regulate you after that or we're going
to let you compete after that I think
you have to look at a range of finance
options to the end user so me and my
house okay maybe I want to share the
capital cost of that maybe I want to dig
up my garden and put some fiber across
to the nearest you know connection node
or a splice point on the street maybe if
I sign up for five years for an energy
service or a health insurance company
they might you know for the fiber in
that last a little bit or there's a
public subsidy option as well okay
there's a number of options there I
think we have to explore those things I
think also end-users becoming owners and
ideally controllers of those last few
meters okay the capital requires the
payback of fiber changes where you're on
the chain the core networks really clear
easy payback model tradition telcos can
do it already municipal networks local
regional networks again quite different
payback economics but the sort of thing
that municipal bodies can get into
validly may be the last hundred meters
are the last five metres off a fiber I'm
the only one that genuinely
seize the payback possibly by the house
about you increasing by certain amount
so i think we have to allow owners to
control what to own that last few meters
and the control thing comes a bit later
in terms of what's happening and if you
go down this route of separating out IP
and ethernet owning your last few meters
of five are having different stages what
you critically need are more neutral
interconnect okay you have to break that
end-to-end circuit control and you have
to allow different segments physical
network to be invested in and owned and
controlled by different people on the
chain so i have to be able to own my
last 10 meters and splice that or
connect that at a neutral point to the
regional fiber that runs past my road
and maybe that connects at the school
and maybe the school it connects to a
variety of service providers and because
you micro peering for services okay and
one that means i'm sorry keep in mind
that we have only about eight or nine
minutes left so we need to pick which of
the ok remaining three topics you can
focus on right okay we'll do that very
easily so here's some potential
attributes of that service and clear
distinction between director on net
services and indirect services commodity
internet just become some sort of CB
channel 19 radio and the minute
something becomes a value you just might
appear locally and you take that service
on your network last leg from that
person at the local micro peering
exchange so we almost bypass net
neutrality simply by the service
providers themselves have their own
network layers okay resource efficiency
i'll skip through some of this initial
stuff i want to focus then on the energy
a little bit and we all want to share
nicely we want to use less ok so the
advanced networks really sharing people
video conferencing is a big thing the
higher definition the better if you've
not tried high-definition video
conference or you don't have it at
Google you really should I'm standard
definition you know 640 lines or
whatever power the US ntsc is it's just
no good you really want be at 720p or
above and the difference when you're
operating with people around the world
in terms of see in their face just
remarkable sharing data are we talked a
little about this earlier as well so
I'll skip past it but we do need to be
building in data considerations that's a
slightly distinct from intellectual
property considerations into research
contracts on the get
okay and we need to be supporting those
data curation efforts sharing kit well
that's fine okay you just network enable
it you sit at the other end of a big
pipe and you decide to control the
tsunami way you've pond from the other
side of the Pacific okay so you've got
your place down in Auckland New Zealand
and you're running experiments in a
large-scale physical kit somewhere else
in the world and that stuff's happening
already and that's great you get really
much more efficient investment in
research capital cloud computing maybe
to spend a few minutes here from cluster
to cloud you asked early what's driving
this stuff and it's that combination of
scientific desire and things getting
more expensive and the fiscal
constraints that are going on equipment
that sort of driving some this utility
computing I think clusters are going to
be around for a while you know the
cluster under your desk or the cluster
in your server room at the University
but interestingly in the last last year
we're really seeing the commercial world
by that I mean the sort of IBM Google
Amazon's I were actually was a leading
leading some of the academic world in
this sort of cloud computing space and
the University of Washington course that
IBM Google have set up around cloud
computing ok disputed infrastructures
potentially your sort of research google
com data archive ok in cloud
repositories for data of course amazon
web services are getting a lot of play
in our community ok now they've added on
them simple DB as well that's to turn
out quite a potentially attractive
research platform for those people who
you know need some supercomputing but
don't really want to get into the
business of owning or trying to run a
supercomputer so there's some real
opportunities there I think for the
commercial sector to be working really
closely and actually driving some of the
possibilities in the research sector
there are challenges though I think
interoperability between providers the
ability to take my data out to move it
to another provider we see the same
challenge on social networks hedging
with your myspace profile to your
YouTube to whatever right to your
facebook profile same thing happens with
these a minute you go to the cloud you
need to have some sort of standard way
to get your data and move it between
services now that decreases profits
because it decreases your locking in
your commercial attractiveness but it's
pretty important I think for wider take
up
now we're good to these but if you leave
these slides obviously they'll be online
and even fosters a Kiwi who works in the
US and is sometimes called the father of
grid computing but he wrote a post just
a couple of weeks ago on where he saw
them cluster or cloud computing going
and I think critically he aligned it
with query things the future of Energy's
going a mix of micro production and
processing and large utilities and
somehow dynamically load sharing between
them I thought I was interesting he
wasn't plumping for one of the other
wasn't pumping from massively
distributed he wasn't plumping for
massively centralized he was actually
saying they'll be a mix will have big
power plants generating big thermal
energy supplies and big nuclear supplies
and we'll have some disputed wind and
solar as well and how we actually sort
of tie those together dynamically
there'll be similar problems we'll skip
that for time carbon-neutral computing
and that's always a big topic just now
and people are starting to locate data
centers next to hydro stations in
Iceland and more and more people trying
to say well let's have a carbon-neutral
ICT infrastructure we don't know what
price carbon will be but it's pretty
fair to say that carbon is going to be
more expensive right here's just a raft
of different estimates recent estimates
in terms of where the price of carbon
will be and if right now it's 20 25 US
dollars a ton then it's certainly going
to be well they reckon at least sixty
dollars a ton by 2050 maybe implore
higher so we do need to take care of
this just now I think there's
opportunity for New Zealand to you
though and New Zealand government set a
target to be ninety-five percent
renewable by 2025 we'll probably get
there maybe ninety percent but already
New Zealand on average has what seventy
seventy-five percent renewable energy
generation so you know one of our
potential business models is to swap
metal for data right now in the various
I founder the country have an aluminium
smelter that has its own hydropower
station why it consumes about fifteen
percent of the national grid power in
New Zealand right and I reckon I did
some research it's about six percent of
the global 2005 data center energy
requirements for the world global world
and so maybe New Zealand yeah it's got
some latency issues there but in terms
of maybe non-real-time on interactive
stuff we could close there now you
minium smelter and sort of host five
percent
the world's data right in a carbon
neutral manner I do think that we need
to go beyond carbon neutrality and ICT
two percent of global emissions are from
ICT so we spent a huge amount of time we
become carbon neutral we've had two
percent impact right I mean why bother
we need to be carbon negative so we need
to be driving ICT and networking
technologies towards a point where
whether we're measuring bits per carbon
instead of bits per second but we're
basically not has been carbon neutral
beam carbon negative and that's going to
come in odd ways this is a survey from
telstra in australia the biggest impacts
from ICT technology weren't the standard
stuff tele working for video
conferencing it was demand side
management of energy requirements right
so I CT is not about just making the
infrastructure carbon neutral carbonate
is about making the world carbon
negative I'm very constant of time so
what I might just do is pick one slide
out of this section and one slide out of
the last section and if there's any last
questions and you guys all went back to
work we have driven practical policy
change in New Zealand but I want to talk
about those this is briefly want to
dwell on this we're seeing a lot of talk
about virtualization of network
resources in our community so this is
about taking network substrates which
could be owned by multiple different
domain owners okay and putting in
control planes which affect they allow
you to create end-to-end sets end user
to end user on demand virtual networks
okay across them so you're not going in
and provisioning a big IP circuit or
configuring a router you know to have a
big sort of you know bgp session set up
get yourself a new asn you're simply
saying i would like to talk from here to
here I don't care what it goes over okay
and dynamically i'm going to provision
it end-to-end circuit it's almost like
back to a telephone calls like back to
go back back to potts right but over a
multi-domain network substrate okay and
without going to a lot of Duty I think
this is going to be a big focus i think
we going to get shift away from some of
the IP router configuration focus of
networks and on more to the resource
management control plane management
layer and down to the physical layers
okay this is a big chance for the Arnie
networks going forward exactly how does
this work
there's lots of people doing things and
the EU spending a lot of money in this
area and more people are saying well we
want to just wipe the existing internet
clean and start again the u.s. is saying
we need a genie program to do that the
EU is saying Federico is going to be the
way forward and they're all sort of
saying we might work together but we're
not quite sure what we're doing and when
we will work together so and this stuff
is still to be determined but it's all
related around this you know what the
networking resources mean and how are
they actually respond to the future look
and the last slide is basically we try
and support some of our companies as
well and get them onto the local stage
or it's critically important for New
Zealanders telling our stories New
Zealand has an amazing history amazing
culture that is quite different a lot of
other places it's very pacific very
Western and it's actually quite modern
but we have increasingly large amounts
of cultural resources online at
ever-higher media specifications and
right now it's quite limited be able to
get to those wants karen's in place
what's got some great educational
institutions you know taking the lead
everyone around the world ever now in
the Pacific will be able to have much
better access and much better
understanding of New Zealand and just as
