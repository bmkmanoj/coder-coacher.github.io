like to introduce Dominic Grella monde
who's the founder of kaleidos software
and he's here to talk to us about a
distributed file system called Walla
this talks being recorded so please
refrain from mentioning any Google
sensitive information in your questions
thanks so thank you very happy oops I'm
very happy to be here thank you very
much Ryan and Thomas for making this
possible today I'm going to show you
what we've been working on for the last
four years the system is called Walla
and it's a peer-to-peer online storage
since it's a rather big project i just i
decided that i want to show you the big
picture by showing you the overview of
different challenges that we have to
overcome the overarching goal of what
we're trying to do here is to build a
large reliable and secure distributed
online storage can harness the idle
resources of participating computers and
that's not a new idea but in fact it has
been an old dream of computer science
tannenbaum once wrote in his book and
distributed operating system stats the
design of the worldwide fully
transparent distributed file system for
simultaneous use by millions of mobile
and frequently disconnected users is
left as an exercise for the reader now I
really hope that he meant this
ironically because we've been working on
this exercise for the last few years
there have been a lot of research
projects around this topic the biggest
one was probably project ocean store at
UC Berkeley but of course they had a
different focus they had an academic
focus and they wanted to build a product
we were inspired by them but we really
wanted to make it work we wanted to
bridge the gap from fundamental research
to what it takes to build a product and
we think with the first closed alpha
with taking the first step so what can
you do with voila you can upload any
file in any size and then you can access
these files from anywhere else you can
share files with friends and groups so
for instance you could just share some
images or videos
with selected friends and then nobody
else has access to them or you could
publish files to the whole world while I
is a free and simple desktop application
which runs and Windows and Macintosh and
soon also Linux it's based on Chavez
supporting it to a different operating
system is fairly easy when you start you
start with one gigabyte of storage which
is provided by us but if you want more
you can trade local disk space to get
additional online storage so in a sense
it's an online storage with the power of
peer-to-peer which means that you get
fast downloads there there is no file
size limit and there is no traffic limit
and there are a number of other
advantages which really directly come as
a result of the underlying peer-to-peer
technology one thing which is really
important to us as privacy all the files
that you store in walla are encrypted on
your computer your password never leaves
your computer which means that no one
not even we as the provider can see what
files the store or share with your
friends now before i go into showing you
how it works i just want to show you
some screenshots so that you have a
picture of the application so what you
can see here is the main window and you
see that it looks very similar to any
file system so you have different
folders if i go into a folder you can
see that folders can have different
colors they can be yellow they can be
red or blue the yellow folders are
private so that only you have access to
them the red folders are shared for
instance sharing them with three friends
or and then the blue folders are
published so that everybody has access
to them here you here for instance you
see a red folder on the top in the
header you would see that this folder is
shared with altie Martina and Maya
probably is too small for you to see but
it's very easy to share it so if for
instance I click on the share button on
the top I could just select another
friend with whom I want to share it or I
could click on public to publish this
folder or I can set it private again
if you go to my friends then you will
see all the files that your friends
share with you so for instance here you
can see that I am in the folder of Julia
and he shares some photos of his sons
and if I double-click on the file it
will just open then there are also
groups and in the groups or members of
the group can post files into it so it's
very similar to flickr pool groups can
be private or they can be public then
there is the world area and in the world
area you can search and browse for all
the files that have been published so
all the files in the blue folders are
being being indexed here so you have
different kinds of ways to interact here
different kinds of features for instance
here you do a search for trailer then
you will find the trailers on the
right-hand side you can see related
items then here for instance you see the
top users of this year and here you have
at a cloud so you have different means
to interact here if you double click on
the file the file will be downloaded
from the peer-to-peer network and if
it's a media file let's say it's a video
or a music file then you can directly
stream it so can just point to any
location and it will stream from there
so okay so let's take a look behind the
scenes and see how this works the
biggest question that arises since we
saw the data in the peer-to-peer network
and individual computers can be offline
at any time the biggest question is
probably how can you make sure that the
diva data is available or in other words
how can you build a persistent storage
now two approaches come in two minds the
first one is you could make sure that
the data is always in the network this
would mean that you would need to move
around the data whenever computer leaves
now this is not a good idea at least not
for our system because we want to have
lots of data now imagine you have 6
gigabytes or in your computer and you
would need to wait until those six
gigabytes are uploaded to another
computer and it's also not a good idea
if you have a high churn rate which
means that people frequently connect and
this can
reconnect to the system this is what you
typically have in such an environment
the other approach is to introduce
redundancy and leave the data where it
is and this is also what we do now if we
speak about redundancy do we mean
replication no we don't and I'll show
you why this is the formula for the
availability of a file when you would
replicate it where p is the availability
of an individual computer or a node and
k is to redundancy factor so let's take
an example let's say that any computer
all the computers are online twenty-five
percent of the time and he would
replicate the file five times then you
would get an availability for of only
seventy six percent which is clearly not
enough for our system if on the other
hand you would replicate the 5 24 of 24
times you would get a nice availability
of three nines but replicating or
uploading a file 24 x is certainly not
what you want fortunately there are also
arrange the codes and the racial codes
have the nice property that you could
end encode M fragments into n and then
you need any n em out of this end to
reconstruct the file so this gives you
totally different availability there are
different kinds of eurasia codes we use
a code which is in the family of
reed-solomon codes they're also used in
great storage systems but since in our
system the probability that an
individual computers offline is much
higher than in rate storage system we
need to have it in a different scale so
this is the formula for the availability
when using the ratio codes it's simply
the sum of binomials which means that
you would need to have exactly N or M
plus 1 or n plus 2 and so on up to n
fragments available in order to retrieve
to find now if you take the same example
where notes are available twenty five
percent of their time
you would have M equals 100 + n 517
which means that you have a redundancy
factor of five point one seven this
gives you already in the availability of
three nines so if you compare this to
replication there you have to replicate
5 24 times here you just ever don't see
factor of five point one seven so this
seems feasible here is he a plot the the
probability density distribution the
area under the curve from 100 to 517
would be exactly the file availability I
don't want to go into Eurasia codes too
much because you can read that up I just
want to give you an idea of why and how
it works let's imagine you had the
points in a plane then these D points
uniquely define a polynomial of degree D
and then I could just choose any D
points along this curve and you can
still determine the exact same
polynomial so it's very easy to give you
new data points and as long as you have
D points you would come up with the
exact same curve so that that is the
basic idea behind the erasure coding now
let's walk through D through our system
with an example let's say that Alice
wants to store a file let's say she
wants to store a road trip video clip
now the first thing that happens when
Alice tracks to find into 10 is that the
file is being encrypted on her computer
using a 128-bit aes encryption then the
file the encrypted file is split into
fragments and then those fragments are
redundantly encoded into more fragments
easily ratio codes then these fragments
are uploaded into the peer-to-peer
network and in addition to that also the
first and fragments are uploaded onto
our servers at the moment this helps us
bootstrap to service because there are
not enough storage nodes at the moment
and in the long run we might still keep
it just to give you a backup so even if
the whole peer-to-peer network even if
our computers would leave the system at
one time he would still be able to
retrieve the file from our servers
now let's say that Alice shares the file
with Bob when they first got friends
they have exchanged the friendship key
now Alice encrypts the fire key with the
friendship key now this is just a
simplification of what it would actually
happens but it serves for this example
and then Bob wants to download the fine
what Bob tries to do is he tries to find
em fragments just a subset of all
fragments from the peer-to-peer network
if he doesn't find enough fragments in
the peer-to-peer network at the moment
he would get the remaining fragments
from our service but in the long run
this will be self-supporting so that he
could get all the data from the
peer-to-peer network then he would
decode the file and then he would
decrypt the file and then he can play
the fine so these are the basic steps
that happen when you upload and download
a file now one thing which is important
is maintenance when I store 500
fragments today it doesn't mean that
those 500 fragments are still available
in a month from now for instance so what
happens is that alice alice's computer
checks and maintains her files so she
periodically the computer periodically
checks whether the the file availability
is still good enough if it detects that
it seems that some computer have left
the system forever then it will
reconstruct some new fragments and
upload them into the network so as an
example let's say it detects that these
free storage nodes where she had soared
fragments on have left the system
forever then she would reconstruct a new
fragments and upload them if you look at
the peer-to-peer network the
functionality that it provides is just
the abstraction of a hash table so you
could put file into the peer-to-peer
network and then you can get them so
this is why the technical term for this
is most often used this distributed hash
table if we look into the network more
closely then you can see that we have
different kinds of nodes we have super
nodes which are responsible for the
routing then you have storage nodes
which which are responsible for storing
the fragments and all the storage nodes
are connect
to their clothes is super node and then
you also have client nodes which
basically don't have any responsibility
they're just there to consume data in
the network so if we look at the gate
command all right the get requests what
happens is the client note this client
know wants to get a fragment so it does
is it sends a get request to its close
at super node which then routed to the
target the target delivers it to the
closest storage node and if this storage
node now has the fragment it will
deliver it back to the client here you
can see the peer-to-peer network in
action were this is just a visualization
of what happens where a client note
downloads file from multiple sources in
parallel so this is also why you get
fast download speeds because you can
download parts of a file from 100
sources in parallel let's look at the
routing the first peer-to-peer network
Napster had a centralized approach to
routing this wouldn't scale and then
Nutella came along and use flooding
which is just a very simple magnet
mechanism of course it works but it's
it's not a good idea because you waste a
lot of messages that wouldn't have been
necessary and it's also not fast because
it takes a long time to find the target
then coordinate APIs tree and others
came along and introduced the notion of
structured overlay networks they had a
nice property that you could find the
target and typically oh of log and hopes
where n is the number of super nodes in
the network and a hop is basically one
node sending a message to another one
now this is certainly good performance
is certainly good but the bad thing
about structured networks in general is
that because they have a structure the
structure could also be exploited by a
clever attacker so a clever attacker
could enter the system with a number of
note that he has under his control then
he could let him build up the structure
and then he could leave the network at
one time in order to partition the
network so we figured that we wanted to
do something different in our system we
have super nodes and those
super nodes are connected to their
direct neighbors which means that they
have some neighbors on the left and some
neighbors and the right that they are
connected to in addition to that they
also have some random links which point
for a father further away into the
network to speed up the routing now the
way these random links are being
constructed is just by listening to
messages that pass by so what we do is
we piggyback routing information
directly into the header of a message so
whenever super node receives a message
it reads add all the routing information
that is contained puts it in its routing
table and adds its own address or
addresses from his neighborhood or
whatever into the message so that others
could learn about new nodes in the
system now this is an idea that is also
was also used in free net it's not clear
whether it works it's not clear clear
whether it yields good performance so we
did some simulations in our system the
number of hops that it takes to find a
target depends on the size of the
network and also on the size of the
routing table and the routing table
itself depends on how much traffic there
is in the system now what we always had
in mind is that in our system we have a
lot of traffic due to the erasure coding
because if a file is split into many
many fragments you always have contact
with a lot of nodes so there is a lot of
regular traffic or get requests that are
just sent in the network so we did some
simulations and the results were really
good so what you what we had is in a
network of 1 million nodes with a
routing table of let's say of 1000
entries the average time to find the
target was less than three hubs or if
you had only 100 entries it was still
about five house which is certainly good
this is reasonable already with moderate
traffic in our simulations we had
routing tables that could be filled much
faster so the routing table was much
bigger than just those entries I just
want to show you an idea why this should
work or why it's yields such a good
performance what's because the reason
is that it has small world effects
Watson strikeouts look at different
kinds of graphs they looked at regular
graphs which had a high diameter which
is bad for routing but they have a high
clustering so let's say that node a nose
note B and P no see the note a nose also
see with high probability this is good
when it comes to routing because when
you're close to the target then there is
a guarantee or at least a high
probability that it can be liver to
deliver to the target at the other end
of the spectrum you have random graphs
they have a low diameter which is good
to travel big distances quickly but they
also have a low clustering which means
there is no guarantee if you send a
message close to the target it's not
sure whether it will arrive at the
target or whether it will just bounce
around so they what they did is they
looked at the mix they took regular
graphs and they just rewired some of the
neighboring connections with random
links in the network and they found that
these graphs had had a very good
performance and they use this model to
explain the small world phenomenon in
our society if you look at the routing
table of one of the super nodes in our
system here is a simulation with 1
billion nodes and the routing table of
ten thousand entries and what you can
see here is that the routing table
contains different kinds of entries so
it has a lot of neighbors which are very
close by in its proximity then it has it
knows some notes here which are in the
medium range and then it just only knows
a few note which are really far away and
this is good when it comes to routing
because what happens when I need to
write a message then I will send it very
far away as close to the target as
possible then the note that will receive
it will probably not know the target
directly but it knows a node which is
already very close so it will probably
use one of the nodes in the middle class
and then when it's close to the target
it this note will know the target and it
can be delivered so these steps have
evolved because in this simulation the
average hop time was free so this is why
those three steps have probably evolved
I want to switch the topic to incentives
and fairness incentives and fairness are
important for any system that relies on
users contributing their resources so
what you want to do is you want to
prevent free writing which means that
you don't want to have nodes which are
consuming a lot of data but not
contributing much if we look at the
resources that we have in our system we
have local disk space then we have
online time and then we also have upload
bandwidth now local disk space and
online time are coupled because a
computer which is online longer is much
more valuable to the system because it
decreases the necessary redundancy
factor so what we came up with is a very
simple formula if you want to earn
storage you get as much online storage
as you provide on your local disks
multiplied by the time you're online so
as an example let's say you're online
and you provide 10 gigabytes and your
local disk and you're online for seventy
percent of the time then you will get
seven gigabytes of traditional online
storage now of course in reality this is
much more complex complex because the
necessary redundancy when you store a
file does not directly depend on the
time you're online but on the storage
nodes the fragments end up on but we
just wanted to have a simple formula for
the user so that you could see what
happens in the system the tricky part
here is not the formula but how to
measure these variables I don't want to
go into the details of this because it's
rather complex I just want to show you
the idea what happens here is that we
have different mechanisms which can
check and double check whether the
reports are correct so there are random
audits in the system so that you can
find out whether storage node for
instance still stores this fragment
because he is sent the challenge and if
you can
to answer this challenge can you assume
that he doesn't store the fragment
anymore so there are different kinds of
checks involved here I just want to
mention one more thing about trading
storage not everybody has to trade
storage when you first start with the
system you get this one gigabyte only if
you want more you can trade storage but
if you want to trade storage then you
have to fulfill one requirement which is
that you need to be online for at least
seventeen percent of the time this is
about four hours but of course you don't
have to be online for hours every day
it's just a running average but the
reason for this is because it just
doesn't make sense to store fragments on
a computer which is just online let's
say half an hour day i also want to
mention that storage can be earned on
multiple computers so if you have a
laptop which is online just a few hours
a day but then you also have a desktop
computer at home you could earn storage
in this computer you can I have all your
computers running for you and all the
storage that you earn our added is added
to your user account the incentive for
upload bandwidth in our system is also
very simple the more upload bandwidth
you provide the faster your download
speed will be now again the tricky part
here is how you achieve that because if
you look at the typical transaction then
you will see that there is an isometric
interest let's say that this client node
wants something from the storage node
but the storage node doesn't want
anything from that client at least not
at that time so because of their of this
a symmetric interest you could not just
use tit for tat tit for tat has been
very efficient in bittorrent but at
least for this part of the forest system
we cannot use it the other simple idea
would be just to believe the software
client so the software client could
track the contribution of the user and
then it could report it to another one
when you have half a transaction but of
course this is a bad idea because the
software Clarion could easily be hacked
and this has been the case for Kazaa
because I have just a contribution level
and then soon after kazar light came out
which just hardwired
this contribution level to the maximum
so what we have developed or what we've
come up with is a distributed reputation
system that is not susceptible to false
reports and other forms of cheating now
again we had in mind that it must get
well with the number of transactions
because we have a lot of small
transactions in this system I don't want
to go too much into the details of this
because we have published it in the
paper and if you're interested you can
read it up I just want to show you the
basic idea so what happens is every note
makes a lot of observations so whenever
it has a transaction it can note down
whatever bandwidth it has received
during that transaction so it will note
that in a vector locally and then in
every round let's say in every week it
sends this observation vector to a
predetermined set of neighbors the
reason why this is predetermined is that
is if you're an attacker you could not
influence the whole network but you
could also only influence your immediate
your immediate neighborhood now the
first thing that happens is when they
receive observation vectors is that they
discard any reports about yourself so if
I say I contributed very much this week
then this will just be discarded so the
only thing you could do is you could
live for your friends so you could have
a false report saying that my friend
contributed a lot or my friend
contributed nothing or whatever but then
since they receive a lot of observations
they can do some statistical checks for
instance they could take the median or
what they could do is they could just
discard the lowest and the highest value
so that cheating would just be within a
very small bandwidth bound which would
be flattened out because they receive a
lot of observations in reality it's a
bit more complex because there are
several rounds involved so that she
could aggregate exponentially many more
observations but what they eventually do
is they update the reputation of each
storage nodes locally and then when it
comes to rewarding they allocates
bandwidth in proportion to the
reputation
so let's say that two storage nodes are
trying to get data from me and the first
storage node has contributed twice as
much as the second one then I will
allocate twice the bandwidth to the
first one here you see a result from a
simulation where you can see on the
x-axis you have several rounds which
means for instance several weeks and
then the y-axis you have the
contribution ratio of two nodes U and V
so what you can see here is the blue
curve shows shows you what really
happened so in the first week node you
come to contributed three times more
than node V and the green curve is the
local approximation taking from taking
from these observations and what you can
see is that the green curve follows the
blue curve very accurate accurately it
just lacks one week behind and the
reason for this is because updates are
only sent once and around so which means
that if you contribute it contributes
this week allow to the system then you
will be rewarded for this next week now
I want to switch the topic switch to
another topic which is about popular
files let's look at the transaction
where this poor storage node happens to
store a fragment which belongs to a very
very popular fine so what happens is the
first client comes along and ask for
this fragment and the storage node will
deliver it then the second client node
comes and asked for this fragment and it
will again deliver it but what happens
if at the suddenness thousand notes come
and weren't exactly this fragment then
this storage node simply doesn't have
the capacity to deliver it so what it
does instead is it redirects them to the
client nodes that have just recently
downloaded dis fragments so this is very
similar to the BitTorrent protocol so
it's just a content distribution overlay
Network which is on top of the
distributed hash table so the client
nodes can exchange pieces of a fragment
or pieces of fragments of the whole
fight among themselves so that no
storage nodes are involved
for this we can also use tit for tat
furnace mechanism and in general it's
very similar to bittorrent but there are
some differences due to the erasure
coding that we have now the last topic
that i want to touch on is encryption
and access control so what happens in
our system is that we use 128 bit aes
for encryption and we use 2048-bit RSA
for authentication all data is encrypted
which means that 5 + meta data is
encrypted and all cryptographic
operations are performed locally which
means in your computer for access
control we've come up with a very simple
but efficient cryptographic tree
structure which is based on an ocean of
untrusted storage which means that
nothing is revealed to the place where
the access control structure is being
stored so all operations are performed
on the client and the storage node is
not in the storage is not involved in
any cryptograph cryptographic operations
also it doesn't reveal anything to those
who have access so if let's say two
people have access they both have access
to the folder but they don't know of
each other it's a efficient structure
which is sufficient for all the typical
operations so for instance if you want
to grant access to a folder and all the
subfolders this just takes one operation
because you just need to be with one key
and all the keys of the subfolder can be
derived from this key so here is in that
example where this is the folder
structure of Alice and she now gives
access to the folder vacation to Claire
and Bob and neither of them sees that
the other one has also access to it now
if she grants access to the parent
folder videos to Garfield then this just
takes one operation operation because
the soft key of vacation can be derived
from the parent key now again we have
published this part
the paper called crip tree if you want
to look it up if you're interested you
can read it up here so with that I want
to conclude the overview and I'd like to
show you a demo of voila so this is the
main window of walla i could just
quickly log out so that you see it from
the start when I first start the
application you will see this login
screen and then you have to sign in with
your name and password and then you will
see this screen so you have two
different kinds of folders so let's go
into one folder the folders can have
different colors and what you see here
is that again what I told you that for
instance the red folders this folder is
shared with these three people I can
just open up their photo I could i want
to show you let's say i want to create a
new folder let's get go into documents
and create a folder work the folder is
by default yellow which means that only
i have access to it and now i can just
drag and drop files from here to the
folder the first thing that happens is
the file has been encrypted and then it
has been split into fragments and
uploaded into the peer-to-peer network
now this file was really small let's
take another one for instance this one
and upload it again it is encrypted
first and now it's uploaded into the
peer-to-peer network and you see this
progress bar going up so and it's being
uploaded while it's uploading I can
already share this folder so i can click
here and I say okay I want to share it
let's say I want to share it with two
friends let's say I want to share it
with unac and Benny then I click on OK
and then the folder is being shared and
it should now change the color okay it
couldn't now it's done so you can see
that in the in the header that the color
is changed to red and that is shared
with two
two people so let's go to my friends
here as you can see your friends so
let's go into one of them for instance
here my mother who is sharing some
photos with me and if I go into one of
the folders you can see the files and
then I could just double click it and
now it needs to be download from the
network it has been downloaded and then
I can show it then you have the groups
and then the group's let's go into the
free movies group here that's the
members and then you have a folder in
the folder can just have different
videos and then one of the advantages is
for instance here you can see it that
there is no file size limit so if the
user wants to upload this file in
whatever quality let's say if the file
was two gigabytes you could just upload
it you can also stream so now this five
is probably already in the cash but even
if you're traveling this cash you can
just jump to any location and play it
from there then you have the world area
and in the world area you can see you
can search and browse here for instance
you see the top flies so let's go to
most recent photos or let's do a search
so I search for USA and then you can see
some photos I can switch to videos then
you see some videos about the USA and on
the right you can see related files and
it can just click on one of them and
then you jump there I can try a search
for trailers then you find some movie
trailers and then if I want to play a
trailer of iron man I just double click
it and it will open up and again here is
you can see very good quality the file
is even bigger than my screen was and
when it plays
mr. stark you've been called The Da
Vinci of our time what do you say to
that absolutely ridiculous entertain
he said your other nickname The Merchant
of death that's not bad so this is this
is basically what you can do with the
system so yeah I think I could end here
and just ask if you have any questions
I also want to encourage you to go to
the website and sign up for the Alpha I
can also give you an invitation code for
the for the offer if you like yes no
it's not about anonymizing exactly I can
show it to you in the application itself
so for instance if you go here to the
world area and you see for instance any
any 5 for instance this one you can see
that this file has been uploaded by
Lizard King and that can directly chump
to his account and then you can see what
other files she shares with me or the
user couldn't but we ask the provider
can see the IP address of the user yes
so in our system is really not about
anonymizing the system it's this was the
intention of free net in our system it's
about building a legal platform a story
an online storage where everybody can
upload files that he wants to so
everybody gets a space to upload files
just for the public files just for the
published files they are being indexed
on our servers and the search is running
on our servers related files are running
on our service but when it comes to the
private files so everything that you see
in here in my files my friends and my
groups is not revealed to us because
this is private it's encrypted on their
computer so we can see this data so when
you do a search in in my friends for
instance let's try it then what would
need to happen is first that it would
build the index locally so if I do the
search you can see that the first search
user has removed me you can see that the
first search is a bit slower because now
it's building D index it's just getting
all the metadata decrypting and locally
and putting it into the index but once
it has built the index the second search
will be faster so only for the public
part the in the the searching happens in
ourselves yes are you familiar with the
motor nation project yes a bit I mean
we've read about it but I don't know any
people who worked it and I wrote a lot
of that so it was you basically
implementing a lot of what you've done
in the back end here but seven years ago
so yeah cool thank you so you've worked
at moja nation yeah Oh once I'd like to
speak to you after work I did that's
fine a detail about your stuff here you
said you can upload a file of any size
when you're doing in a ratio code that
typically means you have to randomly
access parts of the data all over so if
I'm uploading sides something larger
than my ram isn't that going to take
forever yes it will take a long time so
if the file is really really big let's
say 15 gigabytes and it will take a long
time but they will do it in chunks so it
will just read it in chunks if the file
is bigger than your ram it will try to
do it in several passes okay yep your
question
you said if Ellis upload the file I'm
the client of Ellis has to check the
health of the fragments that are stored
in the p2p Network so does that mean
that the client needs to be up all the
time or couldn't this task be done by
some super node or some central server
oh we could do it if this is wish by the
user we could do it also on the server
but the thing is at the moment it
happens really at the client what means
that which means that you would need to
run the client periodically so you can
just if you go into vacation then your
file files will not be maintained so the
worst thing that could happen then is
that the file is not available in the
network anymore are not as good as it
was before but you still have to the
copy on your local machine so when you
go back to the to Walla and you login to
Walla again then it will reconstruct the
fragments and upload it into the network
all right thanks so let's say I uploaded
50 gig file yeah and I lose a fragment
and does it mean how to read 50 gigs to
reconstruct that family that's that's
true so that doesn't sound very good so
you can have you could I mean in that
pass or in that pass when you first
create some fragments you could create
some extra fragments so you don't have
to run it all the time so you could just
save some 50 extra fragments and your
hard disk and then once you find that
you need to upload some new ones you
just take one of these so we do it in
chunks and in bigger chunks the chest if
you have to construct one fragment it
will not be red it's just if you've been
drops below a threshold another question
do you allow text files and updates in
place something about right now you
cannot save to the system so files are
read-only at the moment because it's
targeted much more to media files but
we're working at the moment on it to
make it also modifiable
the replication fraction I like the
simple thing you know it's the how much
space x time but seems like you'd have
to change your race your codes then to
account for more reliable and most
reliable machines or also have a net you
know sort of not have enough space for
the five times replication if you have a
lot of reliable machines they're getting
under % credit all right yeah that's
true i mean this is just if the system
is really big then this will work I mean
then there is always because one thing
is we can also save space if a lot of
people save the same time then because
it is encrypted with the five key it
will end up on the exact same location
so that if two people store the exact
same fragment it only needs to be stored
once so it's a big like it's a big
system and of course you're right but we
could also always bootstrap it with our
service if if there's would be mailed
enough space first I want to make sure I
understood properly when you have a
directory that's shared by several
people you do you have a shared key
between all those people to access that
directory what happens is that if I can
show you an example if this folder would
be
so let's say this folder is shared with
these three friends that you see on the
top then it's just a metadata it's just
a with with each pair with each friend
you have a friendship key and you
encrypts the metadata with this
friendship friendship key but it's a bit
more complex probably it's best if you
look it up but at the creek tree or we
could discuss it offline well is I mean
is that saying that you have to have a
separate copy encrypted in a different
way for each person here sharing with no
it's a the folder has a key itself and
then you could just reveal this key to
these three people ok and then so say
you removed one of the users do you have
to then change the key and inform all
the remaining users the thing is that we
do lazy river location which means that
in case you had access before then we
would change the metadata only if you
add new files or if you delete some
files so only if you do a structural
change in that folder ok so the person
removed would have access to the files
that were there before but not newly
added one everything right so the thing
is that if if we would store it let's
say what he would hack to software and
he would save this key somewhere else he
could still access the exact same size
that he could access before but once
there is a change let's say either one
of these files changes or you add a new
one or you do need to find then this is
a change of tomato data and then it will
be really cryptic ok thank you there's
this project called deep store at the UC
Santa Cruz are you aware of that that
does exactly the same thing to doing
this been going on for like five years
or so now what is the name of that part
I think it's called deep store or
something by a UC Santa Cruz has in the
computer science department they were
the same idea they'd break documents
into yeah you know em out of n yes
mainly they call it internet archiving
so they want to stick it out there an
untrusted archives all over the world ok
and and no be almost identical so I was
just kind of curious if you sort of the
restore or deep store or deep something
I mean I can if you stop by i will give
you some names and you get ok cool
these chopped browser interface is there
also a device driver or something we
could use like a backup software do you
access it so again so what's the
question exactly so one interface is
there besides the browser interface is
this a the browser interface is actually
a desktop application it just looks it
happens to look like a browser but it's
such a popular it's a desktop
application can you actually mount it
like a disk drive yes it is mounted as a
disk drive so when you see here in the
Macintosh you should see it here as a
network drive here you have it so this
is the network drive but the thing is
currently we don't reveal the listing so
if you go into the mounted drive they
need to see an empty listing but as soon
as we have the right access we will also
reveal this and network drive so that
you could write as an application so if
you want to save as and word you could
directly save it into this network drive
or you could buy the backup software
which uses this and we could have like a
very simple developer API using just a
network drive right so what's that
waiting on I I'm sorry you said as soon
as it was writable I wasn't sure yes it
right now it's just read only so you
could not modify a file at the moment
okay but as soon as we have that we also
reveal the define listing so that yeah
just one of the next steps um since
people could hypothetically upload
copyrighted material and since it would
be publicly known who updated that file
I could see some serious legal concerns
coming up spitted that specifically I
could see a company requesting that you
actually monitor and track down people
posting copyright material illegally yes
um you put much consideration to that
yeah I mean the thing is here we have
the exact same problem as YouTube so if
there is an illegal file or a copyright
infringing fine in the public area then
we need to take if someone reports it to
us we need to take it down so we have
different mechanisms you could report a
file that is copyrighted frenching then
you could also flag files as
inappropriate so that they pop up in our
screens much faster so we can look at
have a look at them if we detected
manually which just takes a lot of time
then we will also take it down for the
the other parts we don't see the files
so there's nothing we could do there
you
no more questions then I'm sorry yeah so
you want to have an invitation code okay
so you can write it down the invitation
code is so what you have to do is you
have to go to downloads don't walk alone
so you don't go to the regular web page
because the download page is not linked
at the moment so you go to download blah
blah and then you can just download the
client for Windows and Macintosh at the
moment Lee notes will be there soon and
then you need to enter an invitation
code and the invitation code is four
elements I'll write that down for you
so that's the invitation code that you
can use and it works just for the first
few users so if all of you want to use
it and just send an email and it will
give you another invitation code so
again that is the URL where you have to
go to yeah it comes from the French for
iguala meaning here you are in our
system it means here's your fine just
you uploaded and here here it is
I'm not sure it should work like this
but you mean like this are you trying it
at the moment or
okay thank you very much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
