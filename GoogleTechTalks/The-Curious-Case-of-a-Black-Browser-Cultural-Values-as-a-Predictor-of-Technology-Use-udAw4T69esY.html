really aware of what Google's kind of
attitude was towards racing the internet
so I thought what a great way to find
out would be to bring Andre in and have
them give talk so he's here actually in
town for the I conference which is
happening in Seattle this week and so I
stole him away for a day to come and
talk to us about racing the internet and
he's talking about Blackbird which was a
browser that I knew nothing about until
I got the abstract for this talk
apparently that was designed for the
african-american community so I'm very
interested in this talk and I hope the
people at Google are as well anyway so
Andre take it away I what can we do
interruptions do I have to talk to Pedro
yeah okay so feel free to interrupt at
any point if it gets too unwieldy and I
don't think I'll be able to finish in
time I'll just cut the question short
but I have a lot of information packed
this was a 40 page paper and now it's
like a 15 slide presentation so there
gonna be some gaps and you appreciate if
you pointed some stuff out that you
think I might I could probably add to
the presentation so my name is Andre
Brock I'm faculty at the University of
Iowa the School of Library and
Information science as Cameron said we
were in the same ph.d cohort at Illinois
and so my degree is Library and
Information sciences as well but I also
have a background in rhetoric so one of
the things that drew my interest to this
particular case was I'm I love looking
at information technology products but I
also like looking at the ways in which
people understand themselves in
relationship to the product and so this
case came up to be this this specific
case study came to be really interesting
for me so I call it the curious case of
a black browser and he apologies to
Benjamin Button so cultural values is a
predictor of technology use so when
people say that I was on the internet
they take for granted that their friends
will understand that they used a browser
to access the web and it's not difficult
to see why browsers framed the content
media and protocols we know is the world
wide web and they've become part of our
social life our work routines and our
leisure activities as such the browser
is a cultural artifact defining its
users as technologists and as social
actors it's part of our communicative
infrastructure and you
it's invisible to our literacy
information literacy practices until the
rupture occurs one such rupture found
form in the 2008 introduction of the
Blackbird browser which developed by
three guys at a company Fortier and it
was designed dessert served the browsing
needs of African Americans the cultural
focus of the browser engendered a really
kind of scathing response from black and
white internet users alike because it
apparently contravene popular
assumptions of the browser's cultural
neutrality so where most tech products
are evaluated in terms of their ease of
use their user interface design or their
feature set blackbirds reception as a
ICT artifact and by ICT which I'm going
to say a lot I mean information and
communication technology so blackbirds
reception as an ICT artifact was colored
by the racial frames of the pundits
bloggers and commenters who discussed it
so let me give you a little bit of my
analytical background this is what
Blackbird looks like this is the Mac
version it's ugly I won't be honest and
say that it's not actually but we'll
talk about a little bit more further in
the presentation but I just want to give
you an idea what it looks like it's a a
branch of Firefox and so I can use the
plugins that Firefox uses it uses
basically the same theming set and
everything but there are some special
features and I'll talk about those a
little bit so my research area is I
examine cultural biases in court encoded
within information and communication
technologies and I paired them with
insights into the technological biases
expressed through the culture of the
users and this is one approach through
which cultural and racial motivations
can be apprehended as functional
rationales for technology use so this
lovely triangle here is the beginning of
my oven illustration I came up with to
talk to show my research approach to ICT
usage this particular approach was
originally conceived by Arnold Pacey but
it also draws I don't know how many of
you are calm study scholars on James
Terry's work on communication
technologies and belief so Pacey
described technology as having three
components the first one is the material
artifact or in this case the code the
second is the practices necessary to
employ the artifact and then the third
is the beliefs of the users and Pacey
argued that tech art artifacts are
usually understood under
by describing either their form or their
use I contend along with mr. Pacey who's
much smarter than I am that the cultural
and social beliefs of technology users
play a significant part in the design
adoption dissemination and use of any
tech and these can range from
unconscious design decisions based on
physical traits right-handed dominance
or too deeply held cultural associations
between race and intelligence so I have
my triangle so this is if you if you've
read anything from wired or Gizmodo or
even the New York Times technology
section they primarily focus on what
artifact does and what you can do with
it nobody really talks about belief
except for me because I'm a
groundbreaking researcher in this field
let me make sure I got the right slide
here so I employ a structural approach
to information technologies and I argue
in my work that ICTs operate as projects
linking social structure and cultural
representation they frame discursive
representations of cultural phenomenon
so blogs bulletin boards advertisements
search engines and alike and they work
to organize resources along particular
cultural lines the browser represents a
belief in an unpleasant Lee implicitly
unmarked technological space but the
openness of the platform obscures the
fact that most content available to the
browser articulates very culturally
specific representations of race gender
and class and yes I am aware that the
browser gives you the freedom to
navigate to those particular cultural
resources that may be of interest to you
but if you consider that many Internet
users are technologically
unsophisticated a lot of them never
changed the start page of their browser
or well this isn't as bad as it used to
be many of them were a o L addicts and
are very much aware of the AOL creation
of the internet and are not necessarily
as comfortable with the Internet
Explorer's
last firefox freedom to navigate freedom
okay so for they so my argument is that
even if it is an open space that that
open space is still framed by certain
cultural and technological
considerations for the US and much of
the West the cultural representation
straw
primarily upon white identity markers
and values one of my favorite theorist
Richard Dyer argues that whiteness at
once represents the sign of humanity and
the marker of individual agency and my
favorite example of my new favorite
example is that if we consider recent
violent killers Jared Lee Loughner
Arizona Fame is a troubled individual
with no ties to the Tea Party although
he shot a congressman and all this other
fun stuff while Major Nidal Hasan the
Fort Hood shooter from last year was
suspected of being a radical Muslim
extremist despite a documented history
of mental problems so even in individual
cases there's still cultural frames that
through which we understand content so
the browser shares this Universal and
individual identity and it maps closely
onto whiteness so the universal traits
of the browser are as I mentioned a few
minutes ago evidence to us access to and
compan command of temporal
geographic and economic networks and
information on the widespread adoption
as a browser of the browser as a
communication device does speak to as
universal qualities but it also obscures
his utility as an artifact of
information networks that bolster
economic and social cultural hegemony so
if you think about the case where
Microsoft was bundling ie browser with
Windows installs and how Europe made
them break it away from that because
what they found out was that that
bundling led people to automatically use
that browser and not exercise the
freedom of choice I'm making the same
argument that browsers in general not
just browsers bundle with the system but
browsers frame the way that we
understand the way the web works there's
an individual piece of this though the
current generation browsers enact a lot
of personalization so there's recent
research that shows that a browser usage
can be as individualized as a
fingerprint users can change themes they
can block advertising and they can even
alter style sheets of existing websites
they encourage the store confidential
information password managers or
maintain a library of notable sites so
while many people use the same browsing
software if you will use them in the
exact same way and you know this and
you've ever tried to use somebody else's
laptop right because it's always
configured in a way that seems
completely can I get retarded in the
present
in a way that seems completely
incomprehensible to someone who doesn't
use it every day so the experience of
universal application and individual
preference then prejudice prejudices
users to assume that the universal web
configured to their preference their
personal liking is similarly configured
for everybody else you use it and in
this way and in the same way Western
culture assumes that the universal
values that are part of the mainstream
are equally valid and desired by every
individual under their sway and so
that's the the meat of my argument right
and so there's a lot of room there's a
wiggle there's some wiggle room in there
because it is structural but I try to
account for the fact that there's
individual preference that is part of
and yet diversely represented within
cultural frames let me know if I lost
you I forgot my lovely animations hey
whiteness okay
the browser is a software artifact but
it's also a communication product so see
human Baker who wrote the book mass
media and democracy argued that
communication products offer different
benefits depending on the book upon the
role that various stakeholders involved
in its design dissemination and
consumption media content contributes to
the rationalization of particular
behaviors as well as affecting the
significance of those beliefs and he
adds and I'll quote him here even more
than its direct value to the audience
the media's greatest value may be for
third parties even if they do not
consume the media content themselves
they can be wonderfully or gravely
affected by the media's influence on his
audiences construction of reality and on
their resulting behavior and my example
for this is if you consider the adoption
of Facebook and I say Facebook hey cool
ok good so Facebook prior to say a
couple of years ago was becoming a
watchword in certain tech circles
certain educational circles but it still
was that the Tippie it wasn't quite at
the tipping point where we gathered a
huge mainstream adoption as recently as
2008 Facebook didn't have as many users
as myspace I know that's kind of hard to
believe at this point and so I don't
know about the communities that you come
from but the small town Louisiana that I
grew up in and the neighborhoods of New
York my parents and my grandparents
refer to Facebook as the Facebook right
and they have a very different
understanding of why somebody would want
to
post their personal lives on a platform
that's available for people to basically
consume it their web right so there's a
different understanding of Facebook
depending on your level of technological
savvy your level of technological
experience and your attitudes toward
information technology in general baker
concedes that his arguments have to be
significantly expanded to encompass the
internet as a media product for example
he reasons that the internet's lowered
copy and delivery cost greatly increased
economic incentives to provide everyone
with the same good but also create
parallel incentives to orient content
toward universal motifs so sex is a
really good one violence and good versus
evil and this leads to the sacrifice of
culturally specific content these
universally understood themes are those
that generate the greatest profit and
then leads to a further commodification
of content so the content that appeals
to the most people is the one that
people makes the most make the most
money off of porn would be a really good
example and so although the browser does
not directly represent or embody the
content displayed within this interface
and I'm willing to argue that with you
its role in delivering and framing that
content connects it ideologically to the
cultural values transmitted within the
content so the meat of it for my
analysis I conducted interface analysis
of the browser briefly reviewed although
I won't talk about it here
the history and practices of web
browsers in general and Blackbird and
specific I also carried out a close
reading of the blog post and associated
comments on six blogs mainstream to
mainstream and for african-american
interest blogs to understand how they
conducted the browser constructed the
browser sorry in terms of their
experience and identities and so my
close reading focused upon instances of
discursive association between cultural
culture and technology so if somebody
said I am X and I use this product or I
think X people use this product in this
way that's the stuff that I picked up on
and coded for right positive neutral or
negative across the general categories
of the blog they have found on so I
separated out in the tech blogs and
general interest blogs and then these
observations and analyses were laid out
against some of the critical race
framework that I talked about briefly
earlier the whiteness and Western
culture
and the technical chiral stuff the
artifact practice belief triangle so
interface analysis and discourse
analysis is what we're going to talk
about next we'll start off with
interface analysis and again back to the
lovely Blackbird browser you can see it
because this is a static web shot
screenshot but if you look directly
under the address bar you'll see a
number of headlines under there what
that is is a moving ticker and it
represents curated content that that the
browser or the people behind the browser
feel is of interest to its users and
then it has a number of buttons across
the top with the represent various
features the ticker can be turned off
the buttons cannot there also have
Twitter posts from people who they
consider although they don't give the
algorithm or the rationale for who they
selected other than that thing might be
black people who are black and tweeting
and then headlines from various African
American news sources so news one black
voices Bossip which is a black
entertainment blog and what kinda like
coffee
okay so Blackbird offers a number of
features specific to his installation
that make it different from a standard
Mozilla /firefox installation it's very
similar I don't know if you guys have
used the flock browser at least before
it switched to WebKit or gloss browsers
flock with social networking in general
and gloss was women centric including a
pink theme because women love pink
apparently each variant features custom
interface tweaks designed to visually
identify the bottom source of blackbirds
is strangely enough black and as well as
plugins custom searches and other
features to enhance the targeted users
experience blackbirds creators include
in browser access so they have a sidebar
that you can pop open to using one of
the buttons on the toolbar to Facebook
and MySpace but strangely enough they
didn't offer a link to the largest
majority black social network which is
black planet and so they're expecting
their users to leverage existing social
network accounts and they're allowing
users to browse both their social
networks and the web simultaneously
Flocka does this as well I think you can
set up Firefox to do it but it's kind of
awkward
so I'll talk about two of the features
here well actually I'll talk about one
of the features here in the interest of
time but some of the things that
blackboard offers its users are a custom
go search okay so I just had the
question the the people who do this the
48 was their motivation developing
Blackbird like financial was this a
product that they were trying to market
and sell or were they making revenue off
of people using it somehow or was it
purely some sort of altruistic I'm gonna
report this for them some of it was okay
I'm sure there was an altruistic kernel
of motive but one of the design issues
for Blackbird that a lot of people who
were discussing and picked up on is that
this was a very siloed system so
although you could import and access
your Facebook and MySpace profiles the
rest of the features so they have a
custom video channel they have a dig
clone called grapevine they have a
couple of other features are only for
people who sign in to the Blackbird
network so they were planning on getting
people in using Facebook and MySpace and
then keeping them there with the content
and then serving ads or
never to them in that way so it's a
money-making venture but there is a
slightly different core to it that okay
so the the features were the custom
google search the news ticker which is
preloaded but customizable there are
pre-selected bookmarks featuring
african-american websites and web sites
of interest african-american people so
there was a 2008 Nielsen survey
apparently black people go to the IRS
website more than any other website that
they're interested in BT came in third
it was IRS and I think Yahoo sorry that
was 2008 though things are changing
there's again there's the feature called
give back which links to good together
which is a site that links Internet
users with nonprofits so they can donate
through the browser and those donations
will be targeted to nonprofits in this
particular case they targeted African
American websites which is a pretty
unique feature there's a customized
video channel called Blackbird TV
available only to the BlackBerry users
local and job listings that are backed
by targeting a VA's advertising campaign
specifically for African American
communities so in New York and Atlanta
I've seen advertisements by them in the
blackboard browser for businesses to
advertise on this and have a captive
audience and then the Digg clone
Blackbird community which is the browser
Center social network that lets users
share content and vote on it
it also offers one button access to
Yahoo Mail hotmail or Gmail the buttons
offer unread email notifications and you
can switch between accounts without
going to the address bar and then the
previously mentioned Facebook and
MySpace again you can switch between
them with one click and so that's the
browser so the part I want to talk about
in part because I'm an instigator I want
to talk about the custom Google search
that Blackbird offers so blackboard has
a search that is designed to present
positive results about African American
content to the people who are using it
and so I ran a very quick and dirty
custom search I mean quick and dirty
search using the keyword black girl's as
Gina pointed out I did black girls
plural not black girls singular and so
what I get if I run
Google search this is I'm not signed in
moderates a search applies and these are
the top five results sorry for the
profanity on the Google internet these
are the top five results for black girls
if you just do a simple search right and
I won't leave that up there long this is
the Blackbird results for the same exact
search the kicker for me at least as a
researcher is that and I've talked to
about this a little bit with Cam is that
even in the fact that they got a custom
search term this shows websites that are
of interest so you'll see bt com is one
of them black enterprises another and
then the one the odd one the YBF the
young black and fabulous which is a
gossip site but these are the ones
providing the top results for the same
topic but they also have this lovely add
box on the side with hot black girls and
big black cents which is problematic but
that's another thing all together so
blackbirds the creators of like where
they contended that black content can be
difficult to find using regular searches
and given this quick and dirty
experiment how would be tempted to agree
with them I run for the paper I ran a
much more comprehensive search for
Barack Obama and I couldn't replicate it
for this presentation because at this
point Barack Obama is the president and
not a candidate a relatively unknown
candidate from Chicago and so that the
search results are very similar actually
at this point so the white house website
for Barack Obama comes up in 2010 where
it didn't come up in 2008 let's see it
where else was I oh the features
differentiating black men from other
browsers speak 248 the developers
concept of embedded social networking
has one definition of a community but
also the inclusion of content
specifically layering African Americans
layers a cultural definition of
community on top of the soft software
internet instantiation and offers a
compelling visualization of the explicit
integration of ethnic and technical
cultural practice for TAS implementation
comes across as a criticism the
structural inequities of mainstream
internet content that privileges the
information needs of middle-class male
white Internet users right and it's not
to say that other browsers are bad but
if you
a certain ethnic persuasion and it
doesn't have to be ethnic we try and
Asian girls I've tried searches for
abled and disabled people and the
searches tend to come up kind of random
and so there there is obviously a need
for targeted search results if you're
searching for information that is not
for okay
racial technoculture as the web is
matured and reached the broader swath of
the population its Internet active
nature enables discussions about tech
objects that expose technical cultural
beliefs these discussions construct or
reconfigure the property's practices and
beliefs that people bring to their
understanding of Technology so my
favorite example for my class is the
math I when I ask my students and these
are library information science students
many of them want to be librarians some
of them we bring to the dark side and
make them information scientists but
when I ask them what type of person uses
a Mac they were pretty unanimous in
saying they were snobs they were they
were geeks right and they wanted to be
hit right has nothing to do with the
features of the Mac whatsoever but that
is their perception of a Mac user not
that oh the Mac OS doesn't crash that
often or oh the user interface is clean
they don't care about that they had
specific ideas of people as tech users
and so in that vein this next part of
the presentation briefly visits
discussions about the design and
deployment of Blackbird by people who
are Internet users on technology and
cultural blogs so to understand this
discussion I selected six web logs of
examples for four examples of how
ideological and cultural factors
influence technology analyses and
operationalize online discourse my
favorite word operationalize I still
hate them the Selective blogs have a
post specifically addressing Blackbird
and comments from their audiences that
consistently address the same topic so
very few off-topic discussions they're
approximately 500 comments total across
all six blocks of this analysis so the
two main stream sites and I didn't
select as many mainstream because they
had such a high volume of comments or
TechCrunch and Ars Technica the black
tech blogs are black web 2.0 and Moroni
Smith and then the general interest
black box are around Harlan
calm and the angry black woman and
Ronnie Smith the black web 2.0 will
represent examples of race oriented
technology focus blogging emphasizing
coverage of technology specifically
impacting African American communities
they don't limit themselves to African
American oriented tech news but their
intent is to address the perceived lack
of coverage of Technology by and about
African Americans so for instance for
the Black History Month black web 2.0 is
running twenty eight notable diverse
minorities in tech right which is
probably something that you won't see on
Gizmodo around Harlem comm is a local
blog it represented that covers cultural
events interest of interest of the black
community in New York City and the angry
black woman is one of the leading online
voices for african-american blogs
addressing racism in various media okay
so I guess I should read the quotes for
you cuz it's long so and then I'll talk
a little bit about it so no one this is
from this particular quote is from
TechCrunch no one is going to convince
me that Google is white by default
unless you want to argue that being
simple quick and useful is white lol the
thing is they're from an ideal
perspective when a user logs on to the
Internet they are starting from a
unified and unfiltered position and
choose to navigate towards targeted
content the difference here is that
someone has developed a tool that
controls it filters the experience I
love these scare quotes right from the
start they found a way to create a
segregated experience so discussions of
Blackbird this is a relatively
unproblematic example believe it or not
on discussion of Blackbird on the tech
blogs tended to focus on an ideal
browser and an ideal internet as an
information and culturally neutral space
for internet consumption that can be
configured for individual browsing
preferences these were viewers and
commenters and their focus on blackbirds
cultural features and functions hide the
cultural and ideological nature of the
content while even while speculating on
the utility of features for a
prospective african-american user so
TechCrunch the guy who revolved and
reviewed Blackbird for TechCrunch is a
guy named Robert waters happens to be
white and European and he mentioned
blackbirds content-based add-ons the
video channels the news ticker and the
like
and he said but their addition didn't
seem like enough of an incentive for
african-americans to download another
browser techCrunch's commenters weren't
as circumspect in their understanding of
the racing utility of a browser one said
this is argument and I'm not I didn't
hand them an anon and Neyman thank you
I didn't otherwise the comments so and I
can provide URLs if you're interested so
you can go and see that I didn't modify
these comments in any way so this
argument summarizes mainstream
perceptions of the Internet as a neutral
cultural space and the highlights and
aspect of techCrunch's discursive
position on technology that information
technologies are objective and it's only
the intervention of certain social and
cultural forces that render them as
ideological tools jdb use of the word
segregated losses into the types of
technology that are non normative and
ideological information or tools
exemplifying the interests of black
internet users so this is the nice one
these are the night not nice ones if
obama starts doing all kinds of nutty
stuff well a standard search returned
news articles and criticism and the
Blackbird search century such things in
my favorite so it Blackbird comes
pre-loaded with links to public
defenders and tips on how to beat
weapons charges and if the browser has
article state excuse results away from
potentially more informative and
authoritative sources of information in
favor of those that are more cultural
centric than it is really doing its
users a disservice
now these comments are from Ars Technica
and are the arts technical review was
done by david Chartier who also blogs on
the unofficial apple weblog and his his
review actually begins with the sentence
the internet may have created a largely
colorblind world web that connects users
with just about any information they
could ever want now Chartier as opposed
to the waters review saw the black bear
custom serves as a positive and from
implementation of the developers
intentions to deliver cultural content
but overall argued functionally that
black bird feature-set was nothing new
his articles restrained and it kind of
reflects Ars Technica as a community of
practice because it understands black
bird as a tool that serves a community
of practice users who happen to be black
that want to go on the internet right
but the comments that
Oh char J's review several of the ARS
technica audience members offer these
less restrained and racialized
frameworks to describe blackbirds
feature set and although the last
comment is less overt than the first two
together they work to represent the
spectrum of colorblind discourse
displayed in Ars Technica comments the
first comment is an example of deviant
black behavior I'm sorry the second
comment is an example of deviant black
behavior as a cultural touchstone for
black bears intended feature said so of
course only black people use public
defenders or need weapons charges while
this the last comment employs a rational
perspective that ignores the cultural
perspectives found a mainstream content
and privileges that content as being
more valid and reliable than culture
centric okay now it wasn't all bad like
there were ten crunches in particular
but also our segment to a lesser extent
had positive racial interpretations of
black bears potential but true to the
site's ethos the the functional ethos
they remain centered on the browser
utility so this guy says black bird
isn't about walled gardens or separatism
it doesn't take you to some blacks only
internet it doesn't wipe your hard drive
if a white person tries to use it it's a
product designed to appeal to the needs
and wants of blacks you can disagree
with the viability of this model but
there's nothing wrong with the
motivation and so these comments focus
on blackbirds features while skipping
over the negative stereotypes of blacks
these comments are closer to chart EA in
particular his framing of black bird is
a community of practice and these
sentiments are critical of the
colorblind paradigm of internet used the
earlier Commodores deployed so and this
is an aside I am an avid surfer of the
gaming blogs and I keep in touch with
TechCrunch and Ars Technica because
they're relevant to my interest and I
find that anytime race is introduced
into a conversation or gender that the
comments quickly veer from a community
of practice thing to let me show you how
masculine I can be by putting down or
how mainstream I can be by putting down
other culture so these are not atypical
comments for a racial or gender
conversation it just so happens that
they were focused on a particular
product and so these comments also serve
to highlight another trope of color line
ICT usage that black Bart's users will
be forced to segregate themselves
the rest of the internet were making the
choice to use Blackbird and this is
something that also comes up in the
black box and I'll talk about that in a
second the technology blogs combination
of technical Iquitos and colorblind
ideology speak to the norming of
technology as a human slash blank
discursive enterprise where efforts by
non-whites to stake out space within the
realm are unwell questions am I going
too fast okay good where the mainstream
blogs feature comments critical of
blackbirds feature set in black culture
the black tech blogs critically assess
blackbirds features through their
potential benefits of the black
community and so here's someone from the
black web 2.0 website saying it is true
that if one is very interested in
african-american perspectives on news
and social issues one has to be savvy in
the use of search engines which do not
cough up those results without good
Google foo as a white person with an
anti-racist ideology who is interested
in reading from black perspectives I
would have downloaded and used the
browser just out of curiosity and so the
reviewers roni smith on his own blog am
rushing a black blood 2.0 Roni Smith
noted that many african-american users
access the Internet at work or school
where Blackbird can't be installed
because of administrative policies which
is the missed potential use an adoption
so that's a valid criticism and it also
speaks to the possibility that it also
speaks to the truth that many desktop PC
users still have work as their primary
space where they use the Internet and so
this because Blackbird needs to be
installed and you have to participate in
those networks within the browser
many people want as many people won't
use it Roisin a black web 2.0 praised
the video channel apparently looking for
black girls on YouTube is as problematic
as looking for black girls in Google and
was encouraged by Blackbird stance on
Philanthropy
however he argued that Blackbird is an
innovative because as charged a said its
core functions duplicated pre-existing
features that power users could install
installed on their home
there was a segregation argument over
both of these overhaul for the black
blogs
this is April from around Harlem calm
April's a really experienced web user
and she has a pretty decent blog Empire
of her own going on and she says I don't
need anyone helping me find black
content how was my web experience at
by letting Blackbird filter information
through their browser and so this
comment represents a prominent
perspective the black blog segregation
argument against Blackbird this argument
is that a browser that's dedicated to
information about black people limits
access to the Internet and stifles black
innovation and interest in creating
content online mind you the browser does
not do that the browser allows you to
use WordPress or blogger it allows you
to use whatever coding tools you need to
create but their argument was that it is
a segregation device and so to support
this argument these bloggers and
commenters pointed to features that
constrain their freedom so April's in
terms of her google search and the
curation of the comment her question was
how would people who did they pick to
pick to select this content who are
their experts where their tastemakers I
decided to do this another one noted
that Blackbird in a way that many
Mozilla installs go hijacked her default
browser status and so it automatically
took over her pre-existing settings and
she was unable to she had to go into the
registry to edit it to get it to stop
doing that which is if she wasn't a
power user she would have been able to
figure that out okay
these while making this segregation
argument though there's something else
interesting going on and that there are
articulating a perspective that
complicates notions of the digital
divide that all blacks are equally
skilled in finding content conducive to
their information needs because they
have to be right because they have to do
an additional level of filtering for the
results that they get through search
engines or the life right and compare
this with the perceptions of black
browsing activity on the mainstream
blogs where criticism focused on the
cultural deficiencies of black internet
users so the black fathers construct a
positive image of black community in
their own spaces and also in the
comments on the mainstream blogs because
April is active comments are on
TechCrunch as well even while critical
of efforts made by the developers on
their behalf okay Wow 30 minutes Jesus
okay so conclusion the digital divide is
insufficient to understand the
information needs of minority users so
minority users are just as diverse as
mainstream users but often labor under
the stereotype that they can only be
understood through widen in the category
this stereotype can be particularly
limiting during the design and
dissemination phase of ICT artifacts as
monocultural influences may lead
companies to focus on users that are
most like themselves or their most
valued customers
I see T's frame and diskette second one
ICT framing configure discourse
I see T's do not operate in a vacuum
they alter time format ethos and tones
so if you think the ways in which
instant messaging and text message have
changed the vocabulary and expectations
of feedback from your friends and family
right browsers do similar work for that
right because in many cases they frame
that type of that type of messaging stop
blogs in particular are susceptible to
this because they're primarily
browser-based and the internet I can't
say that word theory we're a non
anonymity ha anonymity plus lack of
feedback equals people who turn into
raving buttholes so they changed the way
people operate with relation to each
other and with relationship to
information also browsers disguise the
cont the the ideological intent of the
content they serve do sheer volume it's
one of the reasons why search engines
are so popular because they helped us to
make sense the the sheer amount of
information that we are faced with every
day and there's a reason why Google is
the number one homepage for many people
in the first page they visit because
that's how you figure out where
everything else on the Internet is right
search engines can contribute to the
confusion though depending upon their
ranked ranking algorithms their results
can reflect the interests of advertisers
or the aggregate entrances again of the
most profitable community to serve okay
number three lessons for cultural design
for when designing any technological
artifact not just the browser ethical
and ideological considerations of the
target communities information needs is
necessary so bring in the power users
bring in the tastemakers and the the
people who are the influences in a
particular community as well as no
regular run-of-the-mill blue-collar or
whatever you want to call people who are
going to use the device occasionally
because they will all have different
perspectives on how something should be
used and that will be of value so this
is contextual inquiry
user I forgotten all my HCI okay so tech
consign tech designers should consider
the needs of a diverse set of users for
example for video games considering
allowing users to configure avatars but
across a wide range of body types skin
colors era styles of clothing styles or
software artifacts the diverse focus
groups and a really good example of a
software artifact that did not have a
cultural consideration as Twitter so
recent discussions online and in the
media about the blackening of Twitter
revealed that high levels of smartphone
penetration in african-american
neighborhoods plus cultural discourse
styles the dozens or signifying
whichever you prefer lead to a software
platform and a content platform that is
dominated by black cultural discourse
topics number three lessons I mean
number four that's just for online
communities the ethos of your site plays
a large part and the type of discussions
your audience generates so if you are an
online community designer or weblog
owner who wants to foster community in
your comments it is very much on you to
decide how your community will interact
with themselves and with the wider world
although many consider the line between
freedom of speech and uncivil discourse
to be a very fine one particularly in
the West the reality is that the
anonymity pseudonymity of online
discourse remove social inhibitions
against implied discourse and that's
something to keep in mind if you are
intent on creating feedback of platforms
or feedback forums for people to give
you advice on how your program should
work or your artifact
okay so last word the blogs examine here
were critical of blackbirds feature set
for a number of practical reasons but
also for a number of shared beliefs
about what information technology and
web 2.0 should do in this they highlight
constructions of technical cultural
identity shaped around ICT practices and
technological determinism so the
Internet makes us do certain things or
allows us to do something things are the
things but racial frames however also
shaped these techno cultural identities
for information science research some
particular interest that through the
racial intentions of the browser the
various respondents mediated racial
identity through their understanding of
information technology and information
literacy right by examining how these
web users interpolate identity and
Technology through their Western
cultural American really cultural frame
racial affiliations we can gain a
greater understanding of how belief and
ideology saves information technology
use and implementation and design done
oh thanks and this is my contact
information if any of you wish to
contact me and then this paper along
with other stuff that I've done is at
the Iowa dot e-d-u academia.edu web site
questions comments criticisms they
released the Mac version and late 2009 I
could not find any and that's my own
unsophisticated attempts I could not
find any sign of what their browser
their share is but it's definitely not
worthy enough of being mentioned when
people are talking about which browsers
are the ones that people use most
I'm sure it's less than 1% easily and
there's no discussions of it and black
tech communities that I follow it's just
not there so when it was released was
there any positive response or black
people made up browser and then there
were some people in TechCrunch who said
you know perhaps Mozilla should consider
hiring these guys to do cultural design
um even though their user interface but
just at the intent right bringing a
diverse perspective to saying what type
of content would be relevant yeah I was
gonna ask how much do you think the
benefits for what they were trying to
get at came from the browser itself
versus say getting a customized
experience to the search engine since
you said that you know Google is sort of
a it's a little bit of both constructing
a custom search engine although it's a
hell of a lot easier now than it ever
has been is now something that most
people are going to take on
so providing it in the form of a browser
which people are already familiar with
gives them gives a larger number of
people access to this type of search as
the one commenter said it does take a
fair amount of google food to use the
term black and anything to find stuff
that is not porn related i had that
experience happen to me when I was doing
my dissertation right and so and I think
I'm a relatively capable search engine
user and so putting it in this
particular space made it more accessible
than perhaps it would have been in any
other way any there's really no other
channel that you could have used to
promote a search engine in particular at
that people would have taken up on this
particular although people are now using
Twitter as a way of finding information
I'm still not convinced of the utility
of that but that's a discussion for
another time
see I'm a librarian the filtering just
open Korea
I thought country where our government
is actually filtering the results and
there's North Korea where there are just
totally blocking dates and users or who
knows what they're doing there and I
don't know because I can't read content
from you know North Korea and if I go
through the Korean website and it just
feels like we're trying to shield the
users from what the internet truly is
right that we're trying to sort of guide
them to you know the safe results and
results that whoever the group of people
who is controlling this things is
benefiting the community and that just
makes me kind of anxious I mean how is
it any different than you know Google
engineers deciding how the search engine
links relevant results and what is
determined to be relevant but you're not
well but I mean it's the same things
like you know 48 making some decision
about how they're gonna rain I mean I
mean maybe part of it is the perception
of in this case I mean that is always
going to be the first search engine you
see right so it's a it's a question of
choice where you could make it easy to
choose which search engine you want I
think Google has always said we believe
that people should have a choice about
what search engine they want we're
you are best to make the best one but if
there's something else that works better
whether it's a custom google search
engine or something else that it should
be easy to make that the default whereas
it seems like in this case they've made
that somewhat harder I don't know the
details but I mean can you change the
landing page or do you always the start
page or do you always end up oh you can
change it okay but for I mean for their
intents and purposes that is the one
that they feel best serves the base
users needs so I can understand it and
okay so kind of to answer your question
but also to answer yours so to me the
the interesting thing about your
question is that there's an implicit
assumption that infant information in
and of itself is a good right and so
there's a case that in which people
often use that unfilter information is a
bad right because people have should
have access to all the information that
can ever need and then especially when
you want to bring government's into it
then people really get kind of twitchy
but my thing is the government is
necessary in many ways to ensure that we
have a civil society so the idea of the
police right given without police you
would have lots of cases of say I don't
know domestic violence right rape
robbery murder because people will be
people right but the government has
decided that it is in their interest to
provide a service that allows people who
are not physically strong or necessarily
financially strong although that could
be argued to have protection from
elements who would prey on them and
commit crimes against them and in some
ways I think the government and
commercial institutions have a
responsibility when serving content to
both provide for a much more diverse set
of audiences but also to understand that
many of their users are not tech savvy
many people do not ever do custom
searches or even add multiple search
engines to their browser toolbars right
most people I know many people when they
go to the Internet to find a specific
website they type it in the Google box
the website they want to get to and then
click on that search result to get there
right and so there's a lot of
unsophisticated information usage and so
knowing that many people are not
technologically literate
and informational illiterate and that in
many cases we allow minors to surf the
internet unsupervised I think there is a
responsibility to provide results that
are not heavily dominated by porn
results but that's just me I mean the
key for me is that at least for me for
this particular exercise was that black
girls is a fairly innocuous term but the
results that you get from that term are
problematic but I think it's the same
you know I tried white girls just now
and a lot of the results that you get is
porn
I tried asian girls and it's the same so
it's the problem with the content itself
there's a lot of regenerated guys too so
even if I search with just men I get a
lot of you know homosexual porn so but
is that okay well I mean so I think
we're focusing too much on the porn so
for example if I'm Korean and I have a
website that caters to Korean people's
knee and it filters the results that I
see the results that are positive about
Korea but I think it's important for us
to also see the other side right if
people you know there are people who
hate Korea and I want to know what their
reasons are and I want to be there so I
can argue with them and so you have
educate them why that's not true and you
should you know consider a different
kind of perspective and I think maybe
we're sort of missing that if you're
trying to just provide the results that
are just catering to the needs sometimes
what we want is not what we need but any
catering to the needs means that most
people are sexual beings
yeah I'm uncomfortable with that
question but it seems like this is if
you take the state extreme it was like
okay so a lot of the reaction from this
for creating this was because there's
this cultural hegemony of whiteness on
the internet and so we want to provide
something for black people and a lot of
the reaction against blackbird was
because it seemed like there was just an
assumption of black agenda if this is
what black identity is on the
and this is the black Internet it
allowed black people reacted negatively
against that and so it seems like then
you take this to the extreme it's like
where are you gonna go you're gonna have
purely individualized technologies I
mean and then how do you actually design
for that because what what role does
culture play in that kind of design
context I think and this kind of relates
to Gina's question too I think the
ultimate that end result will be search
agents individual search agents and so
you will have some software tool that
you can query and that will bring you
the information tailored to your needs
whenever you want it as opposed to a
general Google search box that being
said I think something will be lost in
the translation because by focusing only
on the narcissistic individual and what
is into it his needs are you kind of
miss what the larger community does so
that's why I bring the the police and
the government back in because somebody
has to have a compelling interest for
the wider society and individuals are
not wired to necessarily think of what
the community means they will an
abstract but most people are not
abstract thinkers it's like you know
master students so are there any
questions from the VC before we kind of
wrap up hi thanks for presenting what
I'm curious about is there are more and
more social efforts and self-assembling
communities one of which is Rock mill
which is a browser that has been
similarly skinned integrated with
Facebook as a particular community but
more and more of these all over the
place
my question is how the self-assembling
communities in a social grouser would
contribute to or avoid the
marginalization that you're talking
about today I don't know if they can
it's I mean the discussion the
difference between assimilation and
accommodation is something that is like
minority community community since the
beginning of the modern era right and so
I think rockmouth fits very neatly into
this on this line between community of
practice and community of interest right
where it's people who want to use face
Nick Facebook Hana browser versus people
who just use Facebook to find their
friends and so this browser brings both
those worlds together but Facebook is
another one
which is intensely personal and in many
ways operates according to the principle
of Immokalee right where your friends
will be in many ways at much more like
you than they will be like other
people's friends right and so and and I
mean it will allow people who have form
groups of social of peers social and
otherwise through Facebook well Rock net
will allow them to associate with them
but what chances to give them to
interact with outside and I don't know
if that's necessarily a bad thing I
never thought that being black would
limit me from any opportunities that I
would ever have I just kind of run into
those obstacles from time to time but
that being said I find immense value and
seeing the world from my identity
perspective and I can't help but think
that people who use rock mail or the
people came up with Blackbird or use
Blackbird have similar intentions like
there's something positive to be said
for seeing the world in this way so I
don't know does that kind of answer your
question sort of as an engineer I
naturally think of a browser as a
component that is culturally and you
know identity sense neutral now whether
it ties in other pieces of socially
social interaction can stray from that
neutrality and in some sense having a
browser like either Blackbird or rock
mail does not keep you from getting to
does not prevent access to all channels
that you might want to find but it does
lead you like you said with the ticker
and the browser and likewise with rock
mail and it's social features it will
lead you to like-minded people and a
particular channel of thinking that you
might be searching for or searching
around yeah conversely I I agree so let
me just try this from an engineering
perspective as an engineer the intent is
designed something that is functional
and abuse right and for software
artifacts that functionality and use is
in many ways integrated with our
perceptions of the world as information
creatures
right for more physical artifacts those
constraints are often limited by
material aspects so geographic location
the types of materials available
whatever for the the browser in
particular a lot of people are inclined
to think because it we are information
people that there should be no limits
right but that in itself is a cultural
perspective right Gina pointed out
earlier that the Korean government does
think that there should be limits on
what type of access should be had what
type of news should be had I would argue
the American government does the same
thing so even if we desire that there
are that there should be no limits there
will always be cultural and social
limits imposed upon us and the browser
goes a long way towards addressing those
things but there are instances and I
call them ruptures where we understand
that through that rupture that there's a
hegemony of ways of which we should see
the world and then there are people who
see the world in a slightly different
way so I'm not saying that the browser
is a bad thing that's never my intent
I'm just saying that and this is one way
that we can understand that for many
people the browser does not serve their
information needs this unlimited
unfiltered access to this wide world of
information content is in many ways
prohibitive to their experience and
enjoyment of the Internet and that's a
problem okay thanks thank you thank you
