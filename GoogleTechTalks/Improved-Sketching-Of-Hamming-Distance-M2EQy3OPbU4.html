early even in those times is a bit
remarkable because he did is a high
school and university and computer
hacking in a serious way of the same
time and since then is continually
studying and being a professor of
computer science and he is going to talk
about computer science algerie naturally
so there is okay then i'm going to walk
about a walk that I done with or Lipsky
a student of mine is now at a checkpoint
I done it when was the polyline
University this is only sketching of em
in distance with or without coaching
that i click ok then i start i have two
definitions i will start from the first
definition which is a communication
complexity definition but it isn't
regular commuter communication
complexity it's one-way communication
complexity let's assume that we have two
person Alice and Bob at least a is on
earth and Bob on the moon and now as you
know if alice is on the earth it is a as
more power it can both cut small things
and if you are on the moon might be on
literally a spaceship without a lot of
power then you don't want to to send
communication a lot then this is the
motivation of one way complexity that i
only a I i only send a message from
Alice to Bob now there are several more
motivation for one-way communication
flexpay for example in simplicity if you
want to do several things on the net it
to download a file form a silver but you
don't want to build real server that
will answer a question to download its
special it it is the HTTP protocol and
sign here this then to download it easy
but you don't want a connection in the
other direction now what you want to do
now is that a list of some document ta
and Bob f document TB which which are
the same but there might be several
mistakes there might be several places
that are different we want to calculate
the m in distance between TA and TB but
we will calculate it given that there is
a bound on the number of the mistake if
the number of mistake r2i then we say
that it's all corrupted and you need to
download the file again or something
like this can kill it again now the
second definition is using sketching
it's as follow ever again several texas
is not it doesn't need to be TA and TB
it can be mobbed exit and i want some
how-to to save a simple as snips I want
to save as a sketch of the text that
will enable me using two sketches to
compute the m in distance between P a
TNT be I i will run some function s on
ta and we run some function s on TB and
from then on I will I won't look on TA
and TB and I will be able to calculate
them in distance between T int B only
with the sketches and again it's a
analytic and again it's a with a bound
on the number of a arrows but here I add
another property that
yeah I I want even to find the mistakes
and I will be able to fix the mistakes
then you can use it is some some a
sophisticated arrow curtain call thank
you then motivations are a lot of
motivation I only put your a bullet then
in databases the server motivation you
want you you have a huge database then
you want to save some something really
small that you will be able to answer
several queries then these sketches will
be able to answer the query efficiently
with saving a little space and actually
in databases you can actually run a
clustering algorithm using only the
sketches and another property of the
sketches that it will be faster to
calculate the difference between
document if you have to real big
document and you want to calculate the
difference you want you need to run over
all the document now to calculate the
differ different would be only something
that will be close to linear on the
sketch eyes they need to it's really
will be better a better algorithm to do
first sketches and then after it running
clustering a in the internet i already
mentioned when you download things and
you want to know that it's okay or you
want if even if it's not k you want to
fix them as a mistake then there are
several internet a a application and now
working you have click on these things i
want to talk about another day pallid
i'm a that that is called streaming let
us assume that i have several outer in
this like this net and now when is
sending something i'll tell you receive
something and then send it forward it to
auto bill auto be receive all the things
from all today and now is send several
of them to also see and servitude of
them to our 2d the thing with routers
they don't have a lot of memory they
can't restore all the information that
moves a way that moves you
then then I want some ow to be able to
correct the mistakes that was on this
edge without saving or they all the
information that will send and actually
our sketches will be able as to to
compute the sketches a on a real-time
online you see you see element you
modify the sketches and after it I will
be able to send only the sketch and
compare between the sketch in and fix
the arrow and after I fix 0 I can
forward the collection to others in also
d then it's really good for collecting
things in network then my talk would be
as follow I give a lot of algorithms
that are doing it something that will
start will be simple solution but they
will air more it it will it will need
more memory and so and so on each a each
algorithm is a neat technique that i
want to show you then that's why I given
all this algorithm at the end if i have
time i will i will show some something
neat on file sharing that week then i
will start with the simplest solution a
then for simple solution i will talk
about binary alphabet the alphabet is
only 01 after it we will deal with a
with any alphabet that you want then in
the binary alphabet you can click
another click I will allocate k square
cells this is the cells this is the
document and now a each each element in
the input array I will ask for one cell
and in the cells what I will keep I will
keep the Akuma latex all of all the
elements that are to the same cell
another geek
then for example you are to document and
these are the mistakes then you see that
the m in distance between the cells is
somehow related to the M in distance
between the document yeah I assume the
position each position you see you see
each position as the same at the same
way this a actually it move here yeah
this value it's me to be this value no
it's this value yeah it says movie then
this thing ashtray land this thing as to
you as well it's the same ash a then as
you see you that you I asked one mistake
drill then dead and you it was something
different then I have something you're
different but another click you see that
you I don't have something different why
I don't have something different I I
supposed to do something different but I
don't ever because two mistakes ash to
the same position but we will use next
week we will use the birthday principle
that we tell us that if we use k square
sails with with a probability less than
alpha we will have two cells to to
mistake cells that will ask to the same
place then it means that with concerns
with I with more than alpha ability we
will succeed by having the correct time
in distance but else probability is not
enough then to get better probability we
can run it several time and you know
when you when you have a mistake it
means that you will say something less
than the correct value then if we take
the maximum over all the run we will we
will get with with really high
probability with for easy a which
probably to sell Delta will get a the
correct answer okay yes
then another click then now I said to
you that I talked about how to do with
general alphabet then this is slide
let's say that our alphabet is s at the
size of that phrase it s we can easily
in code each letter of the alphabet tu
anari for example zero get into 10 000 1
2 0 1 0 0 0 and so on now another click
now after encoding that way what it
calls to us that our array will be our
input text will be bigger but actually
if you saw slide before the complexity
doesn't depend on the on the size of the
array so it doesn't cause nothing but
now the number of mistakes will be twice
you see here's the difference between 0
and 5 it's this one and this one then we
twice the number of the mistakes then
then the algorithm actually will have a
constant of for a on the size because we
will seek for 2k mistake and not k
mistakes okay then it's simple reduction
now we'll talk about simple way to do a
recording then it's really the same but
now I won't keep bits I will keep a
numbers i will keep to to kind of case
where cells i will keep the red kind in
the blue kind another click the red car
the red kind it will be simply the sum
of the element wash to the same place
actually i do it model or something but
I don't want to get into a the model
thing it will it need to be modeled some
prime that bigger than a alphabetize
okay actually doesn't need to be primal
but in the after it will have to be fine
a another click now in the red cells
what I will save there will be not only
they I don't only a put your
the element itself I multiply the
element x is indexed by I see I a I ok
what it will give us then another click
then as before with probability a molten
earth no that won't be too mistakes that
map to the same set because it k to the
power of two cells another click now
let's say that the there wasn't another
arrow that that met to these cells then
if you see that these five it's add/edit
to you and this we edit where it doesn't
need to be a five and so because the
other other positions at editorial but
the difference between eight and six
must be equal to the difference between
five and three yes if it's one mistake
that map to the same place okay then now
a backward it's a it doesn't matter then
now it's all the now I know the
different if if I will know the index of
the mistake I will know how to fix it I
will know that I mean to if I will know
that I need to add your two to get the
correction another click but now i will
know that it is a i will know say the
index i will look about on the blue
cells in the blue cells else i
previously time for you to you but now
it's multiplied by the index the
negative 11 a minus nine it's equal to
two times five minus three which these
two we can form from the index the index
of these things is too okay then this
way I get the index either click now for
doing it with really a tiny arrows we
can learn it three times and then i will
get a list of mistakes but the are they
can be they can be a row that to mistake
map to the same cell then i will get on
Lee they play same mistakes that appeal
at at least two of the three runs okay
the probability that some arrow will
occur twice it's really it's really
small we do it really fast then this was
a simple solution now I give a solution
a about about measuring the distance is
the first solution that is based I it
was invited by x value safe at all
actually sivakumar is a google actually
value safer to get it might be the case
that several other of them a hardware
but i don't know a the ID is based on on
to stage a search what I will do I will
first ash each position to one of K
overload k cell you can click now I will
look on the mistakes itself another
click f with I probability or slope K
mistakes actually the probabilities that
each chair will have more than let's say
five lo que is exponentially small in k
okay then it's really high probability
that each cell f of log a mistakes now
another click now I take itself and i
will run something like the solution
before i will i will allocate off log to
the power of two of k a cells and each
of the thing here i will map to one of
the cell and i'll click the probability
that i will have two mistakes at the
same cell is less than alpha another
click i will run it to locate I'm and
take as before the maximum another click
now the fair probability if I run into
cake to locate I'm is wonderful k square
because of its it's even a less than 1
over K square because up to the power
of tool okay it's one of the case well
okay magic the space is off logged a
lock to the power of K because I have
all flow to the power of K cells and a
line to locate times now the complexity
of all of this is off k about the earth
k time lock to the basket of 2k it's
simply x x have careful okay sales
tactic in the fair probability i have i
can fail in each in each a failure then
I have kol ok opportunity to be filled
this is a Union bound its sale the
prorated fell is 1 over K to the power
of two then the probability to fail is
less than 1 over k then this sketch give
me the distance between a between any
two sketches i can compute the distance
between the documents and it use only ok
lock to the power of 2 of cake a memory
but this solution was due to a zebra
safe sivakumar at all improving that
solution is is easily by using a caution
but it need to be calculated really
carefully because let's say another
click let's I separate it again tulocay
overall ok sales it's by putting UK as
lo que I get this number and now i will
run let's say that alga i will run the
algorithm before but if there are under
i go to look for ok another click i will
get a probability of one of the log of K
to the power of sea of some contrasting
but these things is really it really I
probabilities to fair because i have
several sense so i will fail
for sure then these things I will be I
will need to one several time like no
other I will need to write lo que of a
log locate a time to get actually a good
probability to not fail and overall if i
write it in the Carson it it's not so
hard to calculate it I will get this
formula the log style of K it's the
number of time I put iia i do log in
order to get one then this thing is
about five then this is what i get any
question on this okay now is the it i
can call it the last solution because i
have another improvement on this but
it's going to be a 14 then a I I show it
as communication one will come great
complexity but actually it can be shown
as before as sketches it it's just the
way to show it better and click a assume
a global random assuming global random
is just taking some ash that no on
advanced or if I say that that Alice on
a on earth and Bob on the moon they both
see the suns in the cake then they can
take the random bit from the Sun now
that ick they both choose apply so if to
the prime deterministically then you up
I'm of all their n to the power of 3 s n
is the size its need to be smaller and
the size of the text and s is the
alphabet size another click now I choose
I take al in this in this way it means
that a most of the Allies 0 will be 0
with probability 1 over K L I would be
something random between
12 to pinning p minus 1 but with high
probability with probability k minus 1
okay it will be 0 quick then almost all
the Li L Z oh I think now i compute this
formula see one of TA and i compute ill
at Bob side side I put see one of TB and
now I send i click I said 31 of ta to
Bob Alec now you remember that most of
the Li are zeros now I have your three
cases i will look only on the place of
the mistakes and I ask myself this
mistake what what the value of the ally
in this position if it's zero or not Co
if all the places that a mistakes if it
is x 0 it's mean that the difference
between few one a of T a and P one of TB
would be zero because i multiply the
mistake by zero and all the other place
are really the same then the this value
are the same if one place of mistakes
have some LJ that is not deal in all the
the other places f 0 then I will get
these things that it's LJ time aj minus
bj this is the case of one mistake and
if i get more than one mistake if I this
mistake of some allies that not equal to
0 and this mistake I have some not equal
to 0 I will get something random that I
won't use but i'll click but with
constant probability a actually
something that little greater than 1
over e i will get this case and what I'm
going to do I will going to use this
case yeah analytic
and I think now i compute another
functional it's a fee one a pie which is
the same thing but I multiply it by I as
you remember the whole coaching a simple
solution is the same i multiply it by I
now when i multiply this by I and send
me Tuesday to Bob click I will get you
then if if it was the case of what
mistakes then this thing equal to these
things and its really equal to J with J
is the position of the mistake but how I
know that that I did these things and I
don't use the random thing another click
if it was a random thing with high
probability J will be greater than n YJ
will be greater than n because I do all
the calculation mod loopy p is something
that can can get to end to the power of
three time s then what is the
probability is a random calculation will
be less than n because the we have a lot
of a a lot of the number in between okay
then from that I get with I probability
the position of mistake but from this
algorithm I got only one mistake yes I
got a new Jay I want to get several
mistakes and I will do it like this i
get i I didn't say that from that I can
get RJ and eighty- bj and coax a mistake
likely what do we do I will need to run
it all scale and K time why need to run
it off Kate and Kate I you can say the
same thing is that I really sample the
mistakes it means that each time that I
run it I might get the same mistake as
before actually I will get it a lot of
time the same
the same thing then to get all the
mistakes it's it's called the open
collector a problem I need to run it
kalyan k time ok ok I want to reduce the
land kaiser then the way to reduce the
line Kaiser is as follow I start by
learning the algorithm as before with a
lie as I told you this probability 1
over K it will be something random it's
not in 10 and i run it only some
constants time k time now after I done
it now click I actually fixed some
mistakes and actually I can show you
that with really high probability i
fixed more than alpha mistakes then if I
fixed what's another mistake I can run
it now into the caution when I said I
click when instead a lie to be two of
the ok because i have only else's
mistake to / k is one order a alpha k ok
and now another click now i'll run it
only because it's only caution I now run
it only ck over 2 times because my k is
now k over to another click then overall
you can see that i write ck ck or to see
kofo and so and so on click then I learn
it less then two ck x okay
then the sketch eyes is off k log n s
why is the log and esta el is the log n
s because each time itunes made log and
SPS I stress eat some number that is
bound by P and peas into the power of
sleep time s ok ay and actually as I
said the size is off k log n s a
computing the sketches it's really we
can do it a online in real time we get
if we get each element one by one I can
compute it in Oh n-no k time which is
really fast and comparing sketching is
really fast it doesn't depend on n
itself it cost me off k lo k then if i
want one the after its sketching a a
clustering algorithm which somehow
compare all all the pair i won't have
another factor of n i will ever factor
of K which is smaller okay now if I want
only to know the distance and not to
calc and not to fix the mistakes i can
easily do it i can easily reduce the
earth k log in s2o scale okay by simply
a takes the array and a to ke to
the power cells as before after i asked
you to k to the power of two cells i
have probability of alpha two cells is
that too misty a mistake would be in the
same cell but if i asked you to k to the
power of see the probability of
collision that two mistakes would be at
the same place a is smaller but now my
text size n will be k and actually i can
ask the the alphabet as well actually i
can do the nelly code and then arching
and then i get off k lo k algorithm
and I think this slide is with a lot of
references actually all of this
technique can be deterministic ly by
using something like right Solomon codes
the thing with the red Salomon code is
that it it will actually take about the
same size but the thing with the lateral
code it's that the encoding and decoding
will take more time and actually the
decoding of flats animal code actually a
actually a a million Farage and a finger
boom each I marking nice team stowed a
and so on a a little already saw that
and the bell theft or a but we managed
in 2006 a me and two student of mine we
managed to do it really fast randomly
the algorithm all of other give its
deterministically we do it really fast
randomly by using in leeds animal in a
tournament called you use until k here
and not to k then we used until 2k and
we use something from a coding cure that
called welcome back MSC technique and in
2007 we managed to do it even
deterministically but actually it says
several log facto that cost more than
technically as a technic before the
deterministic algorithm is really nice
because it include some technique of
factoring a polynomial domestically now
about file sharing now file sharing i we
start with Napster i fix
question so in your calculations about
now you're completely agnostic to the
work the permeability of air in the
papers it's appear the probability you
can reduce it as as what you want and it
costs a by repeating it but actually all
that other place that I put only k
dependence if it wasn't dependent upon n
it's something that it's it's polynomial
of 1 over K the probability of error and
other places that was a n the probate of
arrow is something that punnami all with
one over n can be one of them and to the
valve 2 and so on now it's somehow the
same the same technique that I will do
to file sharing in fashioning let's
start with snapped which I think was the
first then Napster the pawn with that
was legal but another problem with that
is that we have some sauce and several
people download from the sort the sauce
and then download from the beginning
until the end it might be the case that
the source really gave a lot of
information as you see give a lot of
users but in left before even one of the
user completes a fight so now you can't
open the file you can see the movie I
don't know what a quick then we have a
problem that the sauce need to stay
until someone will af0 file then we need
this all too willing to stay and click
and whereupon bottleneck that even if
the sauce think it might be the case
that a lot of users ask the same a
bucket then they say botanicals ok I'll
click now in emule cancer in tow and
they add some heuristics but actually
you can see it is you can see it because
the network we can analyze as well as
careful
anything like this then isn't it might
be the case that that that each user ask
a sum a bucket it at the it's a scam
bucket at random when each user Aston
bucket or a no then actually it might be
the same case that all of the user at
the same bucket and there is a problem
it's a bottleneck in a problem a of not
Evans or file but it less then what was
before and another click I think then
actually the source to calculate how
many pocket you need to send in to send
in an end packet as before the cop and
collect collecting problem in order that
someone a not someone in order that in
the network you will have all the file
it's not meaning that someone will have
the audio file it means that after we
send in a name packet and live somehow
they can gather together in F or the
file now to improve this file sharing we
can use the following version it's the
version number one I actually we denote
it that AI is not bit it's it can be a
blood a block of bits click I'm looking
on a ki on these things is a polynomial
a 0 plus a 1 X and so on a and now in
polynomial I can put as value of the
polynomial which values that I want I
put 0 1 2 until even into the power of 6
now the thing which polynomial I have a
lot of point but if I have n point of
this set I will be able to reconstruct
the polynomial then it means that I
don't need exactly 12 this point I can
take an exchange this point I don't need
to have specialist point
there are less water neck and with a low
probability i will ebb really fast all
the all the information in the network
click then now I some I'll get from this
file something really bigger and each
user download something and you you see
that with high probability the they
won't have the same thing each user can
can give something new to our other user
and and then each user doesn't need to
download all the end to the power of 6
it can download only endpoint and they
construct the file from sign point
because point know me I'll can construct
by in point of degree n minus 1 a
electric then now there are no more the
N and N and there is less a bottleneck
ok a version two of the judging this was
like the red Solomon a solution which I
didn't get got into here but this
solution is based on the improved
solution for the sketching a click what
I will do click i will send linear
equation on the file i will take these
things and let's say so to these things
actually i want Duke so i will do i will
multiply and we take these things and
add twice these things and add five time
these things and so on click then i have
something a matrix like this that I I
took each value and multiply by some
random thing click a and you can see
that there is a theorem on this field
that the probability that this matrix
will be dependent if I have n low a an N
column it's really small it's depend on
the field side
but if the field is big enough even if
the field is a f-22 the 10 that it means
that I get only 10 bit in each packet it
will be really small it will be 1 2 5 1
to 1 over 2 to power fair 92 not a hair
different to be dependent that it means
that each each user need to get only n
function in order to reconstruct the
file an hour I'll constructed file by
simply solving this system please then I
have syrup wrong with this solution the
first problem is that it's really
everything to encode the packet because
each packet and we'll need to go over
all the file and and take these things
and x something texas in x something
else and so on I will F to go all the
file in na do a calculation then it will
be really easy to encode this file and
can't really implement it the kick and
the decoding is easy is Evie as well it
involves all n to the power to block a
operation which is really heavy and off
aim to the power of sleep field
operation which is less every but n to
the power of sleep is every as well
click the now several facts that do it
more easier then the fact that if we
take only a combination of two block i
will choose one block at random let's
use this block and this lock and now I I
just put a combination of them then with
I with really high probability if I get
a lot of this disperse they won't be
dependent then I can really encode a I
can really encode
fast most of the packet and even after i
encode things that use the to block and
i get to this bound i can take now block
of three element and there is another
blind for block of slough element and
then four and so on then it won't take a
lot of time to encode and click and
actually this way of encoding give me a
way to decode really fast because
actually if the maddoxes pass I can
really solve it fast then a bypass thing
I can really do it click a do things
fast a functional and now we really
choose we actually implement these
things and will choose the this version
because the following features first
feature is the complete complete ability
if we do it for torrent then now if you
have a regular torrent client who
sending your pocket then you can look
about it it's functional of one it it
won't a it won't help to gain more than
really regular event but if you download
you can download from client that
walking like you and you can download
from regular diet own client because you
will use it is only functioning if you
get the block a5 use it as functional
that say al5 is one and all other things
are 0 then it's a backhoe computer
waiting click a another feature of this
technique and not the red Salomon code
like technic a is the thing that I can
mix mix the functionals before I get all
the file a in the Reds around neck if
you get a point and let's say you have
even n minus one point you did you can't
create a file
and if you can reclassify you can't you
can calculate another point you if I
have to functionals I can show them well
i can add someone to another time some
constant then i can mix functionals and
this gave me the ability not to need to
control the communication if i send
someone to do something to someone i
don't want to get it back and if I like
so functionals with high probability i
will gain always a new new block then
this is a really good feature actually
we still didn't give something to
download but actually have a really
great feature of this story end because
it's like a virus it will spread because
a let's for example i will somehow get
ten percent of the power population to
use my tongue a client then it means
that all the other population can't
download from them but they can download
from you then now more people want to
get a new torrent a client and actually
the new talent talent it's it's really a
sum algorithm point of view that will
download quickly then note that even
more than say it's better in algorithm
point of view it's better because it
will spread like a virus because if a
lot of people we download it then a lot
of people we want to download it then
actually if you want this client you can
send me an email I don't know if it
would be in the fuel a mass from now or
maybe in the next year's that we will
release a way I don't know if we will
put it in as open source or not because
we don't want some occurs to to put
several things that we would our
communication but we might put it as a
library that you will be able to connect
and
put a good yo Phil Owen so that's all
you have a question actually I'm not
from network and I'm not recording I
mean algorithm then I don't really know
I mean Microsoft Research yeah I
actually saw it only now a jackoff show
it to me actually I saw research by
Microsoft that it's somehow related to
that but they actually publish it i
think in infocomm 2005 I only saw it and
now jack off is so me but after I saw
saw that I talk talk with a civic uma
and you show me something from 2002 that
was before when really contained the
micros of things then I can I don't
think that Microsoft can do about 10
points in tactics because there was
something before a share them there's a
huge amount of work that's happening at
recordings are not saying no the problem
is like us off its knife is the case at
the putting patent on things and then
you can't a really use it what you
should look at some of the work that
comedian he is in the pterygoid Joe
would be a Petrova but it is not my
field of expertise I don't need this I
only see that because it related to my
algorithm you see that it's really you
you see that it's really the same
technique as male go team and the
version one it's really the same
technique is another algorithm that I
publish that I said to that it it based
on a red Solomon code like then i guess
williams later these
it particularly that info count on cyber
it it does solve some different problems
but there they are putting this in the
update client so the windows update when
you go and pull you binaries instead of
holding all from the server you have it
so they are quite a they have made quite
a bit of progress in using network
coding in and then you seem to be
reinventing some of that so it might it
might be the case where this part of the
presentation they all the algorithm
itself with web icon to turn 2003
actually we only now publish it well I'm
sure but I'm sure that is Sigma we do
know is that but no but the file-sharing
cargo 18 I don't think that for my point
of view the vertical I don't think that
it was publishing because it's not
vertical rates then we didn't enter it
to say paper at all it's just for teaser
of the photo talk
ok
ok
