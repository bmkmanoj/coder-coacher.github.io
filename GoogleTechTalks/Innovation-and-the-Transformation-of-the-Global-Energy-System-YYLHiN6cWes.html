a very enlightening afternoon around the
topic of innovation in the energy
industry and how we need that innovation
to transform the energy system we live
with today my name is Tim Woodward I'm
one of the Managing Directors a tenth
power and its many know and power has
been an active investor in this sector
for the last 12 years we're delighted to
host this event the Genesis came from
our sponsorship of the Massachusetts MIT
Energy Initiative the mighty program
which professor Moniz directs at at MIT
and we've been a sponsor there for
several years and then thought was to
bring professor Moniz out to the west
coast to introduce the activities at MIT
to the community out here and a lot of
the interesting work that's going on
there and we thought it'd be very
interesting to bring together the three
leading universities doing research in
this area to talk about their programs
and common areas of interest and
graciously Stanford and UC Berkeley
agreed to participate in this panel let
me just go through a couple quick thank
yous before I turn this over to Dan
Reicher will make an introduction of our
guest speaker first of all google has
been a very kind host great facility
we're in great great view we'll have the
reception afterwards back in the cafe
they're very active in helping us
organize market in and sponsor the event
Dan Reicher who many of you know led
that charge as well as Charles and aya
who are probably out in the audience
thank you both very much secondly Brian
Walsh was really the inspiration and all
the perspiration behind getting this
event off ground Brian's with nth power
he was an MIT alum who's kept us engaged
with his alma mater and in an active way
and and he he led the charge and pulling
this all together so right now let me
just turn it over to Dan Reicher who's
going to make an introduction
our guest speaker who is sitting by in
the Google offices in Washington DC dan
thank you Tim and good afternoon to all
of you let me also many Google
colleagues to thank but i'm just going
to thank to the same two who Tim thanked
I akuma and charles barron done a great
job of putting this together welcome to
our colleagues from several universities
and ferment power to kick things off
it's now my great pleasure to introduce
dr. christina m johnson a friend and
colleague who is one of the great titles
in Washington when it comes to energy
kristina is the Undersecretary of energy
for energy at the Department of Energy
with that title with that title comes a
great energy having served as Provost at
Johns Hopkins Dean of the Pratt School
of Engineering at Duke and professor at
the University of Colorado christina is
a Fulbright Scholar has 142 refereed
papers and proceedings and holds 45 US
patents and patents pending in areas
like liquid crystal on silicon micro
displays pattern recognition systems for
cancer pre-screening HDTV and 3d
projection displays in other areas like
tunable optical filters microscope
autofocus systems and of course to keep
things really ticking and be green
rechargeable pacemakers Christina I
really like that rechargeable pacemakers
Christina's in one sense comes home
today having received her BS ms and PhD
in electrical engineering from Stanford
I told Christine about today's event and
without a moment's hesitation she agreed
to speak thanks to the wonders of
videoconferencing on which Christina
probably holds some patent she comes to
us from the Google office in Washington
DC it is my great pleasure to give you
under secretary of energy Christina
Johnson
thanks very much din and I'm so pleased
to be part of this very prestigious
panel and also to say hello to Google
mountain view I was out earlier this
month when secretary chu announced the
first awards with the rpe competition so
it's a pleasure to see you all again if
not from a distance wanted to
participate for a couple reasons one is
that as a third-generation electrical
engineer I watched my father and
grandfather spend all their life early
focused on making their communities
better through energy and its this time
then I get the opportunity to serve in a
similar capacity and it's both a
privilege and honor and I know that
there's a former undersecretary on the
panel and also an assistant secretary so
it's a pleasure to be with you and talk
about the future of our energy I'm
keenly aware of that in order to be
successful we've got to learn how to
rapidly transition technology from the
laboratory to the marketplace and so I
wanted to talk a little bit about some
of the opportunities that do e is
supporting in that regard but first let
me start by saying that secretary Chu's
made it clear to all of us that from the
beginning science engineering and
technology will be the drivers for our
efforts to help President Obama
administration achieve the three top
priorities and energy and the first one
of course is climate the president set a
goal of eighty-three percent reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and
to think about the enormity of that
particular task our energy mix today is
about 85 fifteen eighty five percent
carbon based in about fifteen percent
non-carbon so that's on the energy side
of course it's a little greater for
electricity if we're going to get to say
let's say we want to get to forty-two
percent by reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions by 2030 then we would have to
take that mix from 85 15 to about fifty
fifty carbon non-carbon and then to
migrate out to twenty fifty to eighty
three percent reduction we will need to
flip the mix to be about ten percent
carbon based
and ninety percent non-carbon and I will
include in that carbon capture and
sequestration so we are working very
hard within the energy offices in the
Department of Energy to put together an
integrated strategic plan by which we
can take all the different technologies
whether its nuclear fossil energy
efficiency renewable energy I nuclear
together and the smart grid and to
integrate all these technologies in
order to hit these goals and migrating
from eighty five percent carbon based to
fifteen percent over the next four
decades so with that plan one of the
things that we've observed is for some
first of all we need a diversity of the
technologies there is people talk about
no silver bullet even within a sector
there is no silver bullet you take
fossil fuel for example we'll need gas
fired with carbon capture as well as
coal fired with carbon capture plans so
that's sort of the first take away the
second major goal is energy security and
I think what we've learned by studying
how to integrate all these technologies
is that the hardest thing for us to do
will be to reduce carbon emissions in
transport and part of that is because
we've thrived over the last century onic
on a carbon gasoline economy and it's
become something where we're used to
having a car and go anywhere anyplace
anytime and we're going to have to see
how to migrate to a less
carbon-intensive transportation sector
so some of the things that we're looking
at our how do we reduce our dependence
on oil when we import two-thirds of the
roughly twenty built 20 million barrels
of oil we consume every day and that's
the toughest thing for us to get get to
is how do we decrease that and again
that's going to be a combination of
technologies and also frankly it's
making the internal combustion engine
more efficient it's changing our driving
habits to be more efficient it's going
to be electrifying a good segment of the
the fleet and all that's going to take
time so my goal as undersecretary is to
put us on a glide path to hitting our
targets at 2030 and 2050 and the last is
the economy secretary Chu's talked about
the clean energy as clean energy as
being the industrial
evolution of our time and there's two
things we're going to have to do in
order to prepare for that the first is
invest in our infrastructure you know if
you look at some of the statistics we
are still number one in the world in
terms of college graduates per capita
but if we look at the 25 to say
30-something demographic we're not even
in the top ten of the eighteen percent
of the students that took us only
eighteen percent of the students who
took a science and math proficiency test
in high school passed and only one
percent excelled only six fifteen
percent of the graduates going to
college today are studying math science
technology and only six percent in
engineering so those of you at Google I
appreciate everything that you all have
done and also at the universities the
three great university is represented
here to try and get more students into
science technology engineering but this
all comes at a time when it's estimated
that between forty and sixty percent of
our energy workforce will retire over
the next five years so we're really
hitting kind of a perfect storm if you
will and I think that's something that
we're all very concerned about in the
future and the second is our domestic
manufacturing supply chain we don't even
have a large foundry in North America in
order to build pressure vessels for
nuclear or to build the castings for
large hydro systems so this is a these
are three goals but those are also some
of the constraints so just to summarize
I think the three major constraints
facing us in order to prepare the
workforce revitalize our domestic
manufacturing supply chain and hit the
three goals of the president will
include funding you know right now the
science and engineering budget science
and engineering and technology budget
and Department of Energy somewhere
between six and eight billion dollars
that's just about enough to build one
power plant and isn't quite enough to
have built the Hadron super collider so
clearly we're not going to win in terms
of a deployment strategy we have to
learn how to do with the funds we have
research development demonstration
deployment smarter there's also an
urgency this is the first time in my
lifetime that research and development
has to be done under time constraints so
we have a funding constraint we also
have an urgent
you have a time constraint we either put
ourselves on a glide path to meet these
goals in the next 20 years or else we
will see according to experts in the
climate area catastrophic changes in our
climate and finally it's a matter of
scale how do we scale the workforce and
manufacturing base to prepare us for
meetings particular challenges I wanted
to raise the three goals and the the
three constraints and just talk briefly
about the funding constraint so we were
fortunate enough to receive thirty six
point seven billion in stimulus funding
and we've worked very hard to deploy
this in some the highest peer review and
strategic way but we know that that's
not going to last the president is
called for spending 15 billion a year on
clean energy R&amp;amp;D China spends 12 million
an hour about 110 billion per year so
we're hoping that as we go forward in
order to prepare the country for this
new industrial revolution that we will
d/c the kind of funding that we need in
order to prepare the the u.s. to be
ready for this new industry and I'll say
a few words about the new industry but I
know who somebody knows a lot more about
this on the panel dan kamon but I will
say that if you think about jobs for
megawatt the industry's we're talking
about will generate somewhere between
two and ten direct jobs per megawatt and
if you look at flipping the mix from
saying electricity alone 7030 where
seventy percent is carbon based and
thirty percent is non-carbon to thirty
percent being carbon based and seventy
percent being melon carbon-based that's
going to generate something like 360
gigawatts over the next 20 years with
that two to ten chops per megawatt means
that we're looking at upwards of
anywhere from a million to save four
million new jobs in the clean energy
sector so this is quite a tremendous
opportunity that we need to prepare for
we can't do it alone our budget isn't
that much or do I think the government
should do it alone we should support
those areas that are way too risky for
for VCS or other private investment to
take on the question is you know and I
would pose this to
where can we make the biggest impact
certainly in research certainly within
development in demonstration to reduce
the risk of investment when limited
deployment I think heard some of the
important things we need to look at I
mentioned earlier the role of
universities is critical in the rd and
we're looking at a number of ways to
work with academics and the academic
Enterprise in particular I think that we
need to do more in the energy offices to
engage the excellent mind share of the
universities and so we're looking to
increase the amount of funding from the
energy areas into the university and
lastly we also need to walk the walk as
the federal government last month the
President signed into an executive order
expanding legislation mandating federal
reduction in environmental requirements
of federal agencies and facilities and
this executive order was followed up
with a green government challenge and we
intend to be at the forefront of leading
and energy efficiency so let me just
conclude that I think that what we've
learned so far is that we need a diverse
portfolio of energy technologies to be
successful in attaining the president's
three goals and only by looking at where
are the gaps in that pipeline from
fundamental research to commercial
deployment and provide funding there to
mitigate the risk for future investment
by industry I think will we be
successful and I'm certainly looking
forward to hearing and seeing the
panel's thoughts on how the federal
government can better do our job with
the resources that we have and
appreciate being part of this panel so
thank you very much
thank you Christina certainly for all of
us it's great to have a partner in the
administration in DOA that really
supports the task at hand that we have
so thanks for your time and comments
today so let me take a few minutes to
frame the discussion and Charles are the
two graphs sorry Christina yes you you
have disappeared you can stay and listen
if you'd like so the two graphs which
are supposed to show up here are going
to be familiar to anyone who's spent
time in the energy industry you think
Google would get the technology right so
while they are preparing you know one
that the first chart will show the
energy supply side of the equation in
the US and how we've evolved our energy
system from one predominantly based on
biomass to what is today as christina
pointed out eighty-five percent
depending upon fossil fuels carbon based
fuels the other slide will show the uses
of energy and it will show how certain
sectors dominate our energy consumption
but most importantly what it shows is
that we have a very very inefficient
energy system here in the United States
and globally for that matter but
particularly in the United States only
forty two percent of the energy the
energy equation actually is put to
productive use fifty-eight percent is
wasted that's just something that is not
sustainable long term and that's really
really what we're talking about here
when we we focus on the need for
innovation in transforming our energy
system we need to transform it from
predominantly based on fossil fuels and
to one that is efficient secure and
sustainable for generations to come as
long-term investors in this
one of the biases we carry is that the
consumer of energy really doesn't want
to change their behavior too much we've
we've gotten addicted to a system that
provides us a lot of benefits for very
little cost and if we are to change the
equation we need to understand what the
consumer receives today and what their
expectations are going forward we really
become addicted to a system that
provides us what I will call low
out-of-pocket costs for energy we don't
pay for the direct subsidies we don't
pay for all the externalities and until
we politically are willing to prices
into the products we have an energy
system that has to deliver it today's
market price and a consumer who's
somewhat reluctant to change we have a
system that's readily available we have
fuels available on gasoline available at
every major intersection we go home the
lights go on most of the time didn't for
me this weekend but they go on most of
the time we have become accustomed to a
system that we depend on Google depends
on twenty-four/seven absolutely
available power and that's going to be
more and more important as the economy
grows and the amount of the digital
economy grows and data centers which are
the largest load growth in the in the
system continue to populate we also have
an energy system a transportation system
that's been built for 80 years on the
premise of fundamental consumer
convenience that's not necessarily going
to happen immediately if we change to
electric vehicles we have very liquid
markets and by that I don't mean
physical liquidity I mean economic
liquidity these are large markets
they're usually not manipulatable
usually local events cannot catastrophic
catastrophic ly disrupt the markets we
need to continue to diversify our
supplies that we are not dependent on
Middle East oil nor batteries from China
we also need markets that are very
interconnected so that local disruptions
will not create a catastrophic event in
some today we have an energy system
that gives us energy in just about any
for we want to use it at any time we
want to use it and we don't spend a lot
of money to achieve that but that is not
really sustainable going forward because
that's the last hundred years and we
need to look at what what is addressable
for the next hundred years and what's
fortunate is today we face an
opportunity with an abundance of natural
gas that's been discovered in the last
five to ten years to have a bridging
technology to get us to that long-term
solution but we need to begin the
innovation process right away these are
very very large markets it's going to
require lots of time lots of capital to
get to it to the solutions that
Christina talked about we have in front
of us leaders of university
organizations that drive innovation and
have historically driven innovation for
the last 30 to 40 years in the economy
we live in today we're fortunate that
they're here to talk about what they're
doing in the way of energy innovation
very exciting work and they are very
engaged in finding the solutions that we
all need one of the things we'd like to
have come out of this is a little bit of
a dialogue because many of you in the
audience whether you're entrepreneurs
representatives of the incumbent energy
VCS I think you need to be interacting
with the universities that are leading
the innovation charge because through
that conversation we're likely to get to
the right solutions and we're likely to
get them into the market more rapidly
and more successfully so let me turn it
over now to the panel what will have as
each representative will get up and talk
a little bit about their program and
then we'll go through a series of
moderated QA I don't know what's
happened exactly in terms of questions
from the audience but we've asked that
if there are questions you write them on
a piece of paper they'll be picked up
and we'll sort of try and go through
those and consolidate towards the end 15
minutes of audience Q&amp;amp;A okay so Ernie
since you're our guest of honor would
you please come up and talk a little bit
about the mighty program
okay well thanks Jim and we appreciate
both you and Google hosting this this
event getting together with Stanford and
Berkeley really is a terrific
opportunity indeed I think we need to
really heighten our levels of
collaboration these are our e3 terrific
University programs in in energy the
themes today are the kind of two
intertwined themes one is I think the
broad discussion about innovation and
the transformation of the global energy
system that is driven by a number of
factors but most especially the climate
climate challenge which as you heard
Christina's characterization of the
energy energy industry going to a
low-carbon a system that starts out at
eighty-five percent carbon is not
exactly a trivial trivial task and the
second theme is in our university
programs and how and how these these
these intersect I think I'd start by
providing a reference frame of kind of a
characterization of the energy industry
it's I think my colleagues will agree
but if not they'll have a chance the I
think it is important to put innovation
in this business in the context of a
multitrillion-dollar very highly
capitalized commodity business highly
refined supply chains very developed
customer relationships supplying
essential services to everything we do
in society there by inviting and
receiving strong regulation considerable
political interest that's the kind of a
euphemism and a system that therefore
for good reason frankly has valued
reliability and low cost over innovation
and now that is the system that in the
climate context we now face the
task of trying to have a major
transformation to low carbon in a time
scale much shorter than historical time
periods for evolution of that system I
mean we need serious change in a 10 20
30 year time period and not the
characteristic 50 or even longer time
period in the past that's that's that's
the challenge I would I would then
suggest that to meet that challenge
technology innovation is necessary but
so is policy innovation and so is
business model innovation my own scoring
of that is on pretty optimistic on
technology innovation I think business
model innovation will follow once the
rule to the road get straight policy
innovation well we can argue about that
as the as the the follower in that
context I think I would then discuss
what I consider to be key
characteristics of university program
certainly the program at an MIT and I
believe at those of our colleagues one
is that we need to involve the entire
campus to address technology and policy
and business model innovation it's about
science and engineering and architecture
and planning and management and
humanities and economics and political
science etc secondly I think that our
charge clearly involves research and
here again I think the climate challenge
is kind of an overarching theme in terms
of how our programs are put together but
those programs must involve both
innovation around today's technologies
coal nuclear etc as well as of course a
real focus on some of the
transformational technologies that would
in fact have a completely new kind of
energy system in the
in the years and decades ahead and at
MIT I would say that if anything our
flagship program is around solar energy
and associated storage questions but
again focusing as well on innovations
around today's systems plus policy
planning dot secondly of course where
universities education is key and i
would say that at MIT at least one of
our milestones this year has been the
establishing the establishment of a
novel minor degree program in which all
undergraduates can supplement their
disciplinary degree with one in energy
that includes once again science
technology social science third the
universities become hotbeds of walking
the talk so the students get
tremendously involved in research and
and an efficiency projects at MIT this
is having a material impact we
considered to be ourselves to be a
target-rich environment for energy
efficiency and the students are
addressing this quite happily i might
say entha power as the sponsor has
sponsored undergraduate research in in
energy efficiency projects and finally
outreach and in our case that's been a
major focus on a focus on outreach to
policymakers with integrative technology
and policy studies carried out by large
multidisciplinary faculty teams we have
published a significant integrative
reports on the future of nuclear power
and of coal and for those of you waiting
with bated breath nuclear fuel cycle
shortly natural gas and solar energy
next year and the future of the electric
grid we expect in about in about two
years another characteristic that's very
that's very important is we must be
attracting really the best researchers
on campus to the task this is I think a
very important metric of how we're doing
and in our case very pleased that in a
major seed fund program that
had literally half the projects have
been by faculty who historically have
never viewed themselves or had been
viewed by us as engaged in energy
research that plus the fact that 15 out
of the new 50 faculty hired last year at
MIT across the entire campus we're doing
energy related research I think holds
great hope for a sustained emphasis in
this area another characteristic i think
is very important as convening power our
program is founded on industry support
first not not even i will come to other
support but in industry support we have
a long tradition at MIT certainly of
working with industry but in the end
industry is going to be where the
solutions lie in terms of this
transformation and that's where we focus
however it's very important in this
convening sense that we're not engaging
only the large energy companies the
incumbents who are supporting research
but also what we call affiliate members
and power was our first actually with a
lot of VCS the entrepreneurial community
because it's the link of the
entrepreneurs to the energy incumbents
that we believe is going to be a
critical part of the of the solution to
the challenges that we that we mentioned
earlier and so that dialogue across the
innovation chain if you like is critical
I might say that that one I'll come back
to this perhaps in a bit but new
Christina mentioned alluded to new kinds
of Voe programs one of them is called
arpa-e Advanced Research Projects Agency
dash energy and there we were very
pleased that there were five on a 37
Awards last month with direct connection
MIT including three spin-out companies
of just the last year and a half II in
our flagship area of solar and storage
and I think this is that the another
important issue that Tim alluded to we
have to be looking at the basic research
but we have to be part of the innovation
chain in getting these technologies spun
out and into the place where investors
take interest and ultimately hopefully
many of these will scale up it's part of
creating in an innovation cluster and I
think frankly around the Boston area and
here in the bay area of course are two
real central places for this kind of
energy technology innovation cluster
convening power also means reaching out
to the political policy establishment
and again this has happened we were very
pleased in particular late last month to
have President Obama come for a visit
and sign a vacuum flange great work
which now has led museum lighting on it
of course but actually today we are
hosting an MIT a field hearing of the
FCC looking at broadband issues for the
smart grid and so I think more and more
universities are being seen as a place
to go for for these kinds of these kinds
of policy policy events and and finally
well maybe two more points 1 point is I
think universities very naturally have
again another key characteristic
International Programs we signed a we
think significant agreement with Xinhua
University in China and Cambridge in
terms of a low-carbon energy alliance
but I think with Stanford Berkeley MIT
and other universities we are a natural
bridge I think to these countries who
will of course be critical in meeting
climate change goals and finally I'll
just say a word since Christina asked
for it on the role of government this
year has seen a real transformation in
the new administration of the way the
Department of Energy is supporting
innovation
with new kinds of programs and from our
point of view in particular supporting
innovation in a way that engages
universities much more in with with
multi-year commitments pursuing specific
technologies energy frontier centers
arpa-e hubs coming up etc and I'll just
mention this is maybe for part of our
later discussion that while this has
been a great boost and leads to the spin
outs I mentioned earlier for example
that's just just just one example but
the fact is we have to remember a lot of
that came from the very novel use of the
stimulus package that goes away so the
question is now i'll be going to have
the commitment and find the money
someplace to ramp that up over this next
year's and sustain it for 10 15 20 years
which is what it's going to take if
that's done i'm sure that all of our
students will tip we'll take care of
their end of the bargain thank you it's
a hard job following Ernie that's for
sure so I'm Lynn or I'm the director of
something called the Precourt Institute
for energy at Stanford University and if
you think in broad terms our goals are
much like those that Ernie described I
think there's a real sort of confluence
of interest here we have by my latest
count something like a hundred and sixty
faculty members across 22 different
departments working in some way in ways
that touch energy and we wanted to make
that that endeavor be more visible to
students to provide opportunities to
work together when it makes sense to do
so to support that disciplinary base
that is absolutely required in order to
be a full-service institution
working on these kinds of things so
we've created an energy institute that
is funded partly by endowment for some
new faculty positions and some support
for students and and some opportunity
for seed funding kinds of research
activities as a way to coalesce this
this broad effort across the university
now the education side of course is very
important to us as well there is huge
student interest on our campus and well
gosh if you look at the room today there
are a lot of people here I I suspect
we've all had our our minds focused on
energy because of a period of high oil
prices my hope is that we won't forget
that even if the oil price is not quite
so high I'd be willing to bet that it
will be higher than it is right now
going forward so in any case there there
is huge interest amongst our our
students in trying to do something that
has the potential to change the world
indeed we knew we do need to change the
world with regard to the to the mix of
energy that we use going forward that
needs to be accessible secure
economically viable and and sustainable
and so those are very big challenges
because these are very big systems
worldwide so so what's our piece of this
well certainly research is an important
part of it but I think equally important
is educating a group of students who
will help do everything that needs to be
done over the decades to come our
program involves a series of elements
the biggest of those is something called
the global climate and energy project
its mandate is to work across the
spectrum of research to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions associated with
energy supply and use it has a
wide-ranging portfolio ordered
20 million dollars a year that that
attempts to think about energy
conversions so if you think about the
energy system it has it starts with some
primary energy resource could be a
fossil fuel could be nuclear could be
the Sun could be wind and then it
converts it into services that we can
use and if you think about that really
what in the end it converts it to waste
heat all of it but the idea is to
extract as many services as we can along
the way and at the same time reduce the
amount of energy we have to put in at
the beginning in order to get the
services out through the end so that
gives a huge opportunity space to do
better than we're doing right now if you
look at the resource side the really big
resource is the Sun and and many of the
other resources actually flow from the
Sun when biomass those kinds of things
so we need to move to a system that in
one way or another makes a bigger use of
those energy flows and a smaller use of
stored energy that's stored in the form
of for example fossil fuels so the
global climate and energy project
portfolio is if you look at what's in it
it's it's the biggest single element is
is the solar area that's a rich
opportunity space because we can now
make structures at very small scale
so-called old nanostructured materials
small enough to be able to take
advantage of quantum effects to change
properties in ways that are useful to
capture a bigger fraction of the of the
sunlight for example or to do to make
batteries that that give higher energy
densities those kinds of things so
wide-ranging portfolio all the way from
solar to some biofuels effort to carbon
and capture carbon capture and storage
at the other end lots of
electrochemistry along the way we also
have a group called the Precourt energy
efficiency Center it's really focused on
the idea that we actually know a lot
about how to reduce energy use
and I'll just tell a brief story that
makes me look sort of stupid but I was
stupid and thinking about it so I
decided to put in a solar PV system at
my house and I i sized it based on the
utility bills for the last three years
which of course made me look at the
utility bills for the last three years
and when I did I was appalled at how
much electricity we were using so while
I was waiting for the permits I actually
went to work and measured everything I
could think of in my house about where
the electricity was going and by the
time I was done with that process I had
reduced electricity used in my house by
almost 40% so so that wasn't it wasn't
that I didn't know how to do it it was
getting me to pay attention so we need
to do that as a society and we need to
make it easier for people to use energy
more efficiently to understand how
they're using it and to figure out ways
to make that work better so that's the
energy efficiency Center does that we
have a very active group on the basic
science of materials that works with the
incredible new free electron laser
coherent light source that we have at
the slac national laboratory just up the
hill and we're creating a new center on
sustainable energy that that will help
us really focus on these large scale of
ish issues of how we get from from some
renewable resource or some low carbon
source all the way through to the
markets that allow us to do this in a
way that really does penetrate in a big
way as I said we'll have some new
faculty hires we're working on
assembling lots of postdocs support will
work across the spectrum of energy
science technology efficiency and
economics and policy issues and we'll
try to train a cadre of students who can
help lead the charge it's clear that
universities are only one part of what
it needs to happen here but i'm pretty
sure that it's the right thing to do to
take the kind of talented students we
have it at MIT and UC berkeley and at
stanford and put them to work on
I'm calling back in of lots of new
energy programs and Berkeley has been
involved in the sort of process of
building out programs on basic solar
science basic bio fuel energy storage
efficiency energy markets and I'll come
to a few of those but the real exciting
lesson here is that students are now
driving innovation driving demand for
interesting programs and courses in a
way that's really gotten quite
breathtaking when I came to Berkeley and
I inherited from now president science
advisor John Holdren the energy gateway
class that was just it was called energy
100 at the time we've always described
this class as drinking energy from a
fire hose I a huge flow of information
in one semester that course was about 45
students and it was considered big
relative to other universities back then
ten years ago that course now is almost
300 students it is truly this kind of
gateway energy class on campus and we
literally turn students away and find
and find ways to get them into sort of
other routes in so it's gotten to be
this incredible exciting moment in terms
of student interest in activities in
terms of kind of the environment though
of what I like like to say about
Berkeley is it's really the anti Las
Vegas you know what starts at Berkeley
doesn't stay there and I mean that a
whole bunch of ways there are as Nobel
prize-winning research going on at
Berkeley in basic solar in nanosolar in
advanced energy storage in some of the
control technologies for wind turbines
for the smart grid issues but it's also
been a place where faculty and students
have engaged in the whole spectrum of
from basic lab projects to being really
an energy outreach sort of person and
engaging in policy and thankfully
California has been a great policy
leader from the greenhouse gas laws to
the earlier really heroic levels of
efficiency rules that were put in place
by the state a number of them traced
back to a UC Berkeley professor and a
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
researcher our Rosenfeld so-called
father of energy efficiency who was
actually one of the founders of this of
this unit ERG on campus the energy
resources group he's now one of the cal
the energy commissioners but all of
these things really tie together to make
this exciting environment where things
go on and that leads me to the next
piece of it and that is that we've had a
unique situation in that we have UC
Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory and you know essentially a
good for your good arm a good throw up
the hill from one another there are huge
amounts of faculty who have appointments
back and forth in fact the current vice
chancellor for research who's here today
Graham Fleming has both UC Berkeley and
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
appointments and that's meant that
there's really large cluster I think
actually technically it's the largest
cluster of energy researchers anywhere
in the world has got this back-and-forth
relationship between government projects
basic research outreach and applications
so it's gotten a very dynamic
environment berkeley faculty if you sort
of you know if you ask them to pull
themselves a very large fraction
something like thirty five percent of
all faculty will list energy and or
energy environment as one of their
primary if not the primary research area
and it really does span the spectrum
from people like george lakoff in in
rhetoric to basic researchers like the
current head of Lawrence Berkeley
National Lab Paul Oliver Sato's you know
instead of a world leading researcher on
nano solar technologies to world leading
researchers on topics in energy markets
like seven Borenstein and michael
hanuman and many others so it's a place
where all of these things are really
melding back and forth it's also a place
where focus on energy environmental
issues in developing countries from the
work on basic basic combustion people's
homes and work on cook stoves that Kirk
Smith and myself and others do in terms
of innovating on the science and
technology of stoves to understanding
the health effects to a major report
issued last week on the health benefits
of addressing greenhouse gas issues as a
as part of this overall mixture of
things that are taking place one feature
of this is that many of us have served
in international groups like the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change and actually currently I chair
the policy chapter of the IPCC the group
that does
the assessment of science technology
policy economics feeds it into the
negotiations around the Kyoto in
Copenhagen other protocols and part of
that story right now is that at
Copenhagen we can have from now I'll be
releasing the first results of the
policy chapter the policy chapter will
be the first internationally sanctioned
report that is going to have a zero
carbon scenario as part of the basic
landscape so Christina Johnson mentioned
this switch from eighty five percent
fossil to 15 from 85 fossil in 15
renewables to essentially switching that
so now we're going to have scenarios
that are being played out for national
governments look at that have that whole
mix of decarbonisation in place a lot of
that's going to require a real close
attention not just to the basic science
but also the policy and that's really
where I think this interaction that
Berkeley has in working with state
regulators federal regulators right now
obviously the president's science
advisor was the founder of my of one of
my units on campus but the course the
Secretary of Energy Steve Chu was at
Stanford and was now at and was at
Berkeley and lbl and then the head of
this arpa-e that Ernie mentioned this
advanced research project agency on
energy kind of the place to take the big
gamble maroon Majumder was a professor
in mechanical engineering Berkeley and
also a program leader up at lbl so it's
got this very interesting mix of things
going on one piece of it I do want to
highlight though is that if you think
about where all of the science and
technology leads in terms of making a
global difference many of us we were
actually just talking in the session
before have spent an inordinate amount
of time in China over the last few
months I've been doing a monthly commute
unfortunately or maybe fortunately to
Beijing and at some of these recent
events we have signed or I think are
some really powerful new agreements that
support what we're seeing with this
president who President Obama dialogue a
my own research laboratory the renewable
and appropriate energy lab at Berkeley
signed an agreement with the National
Grid company called the state grid
company of China to jointly model and
develop hardware to manage and implement
the smart grid and if there ever was a
pair of countries that have tremendous
renewable energy resources but also are
today very dependent on traditional coal
it's the US and China and so in terms of
more policy drivers of a clean energy
world if the US and China start to make
that the dialogue which I really do
think we're seeing it changes the
equation dramatically where you can
think about very different sorts of
agreements so if i were to highlight
some of the programs at berkeley that
are involved in this i mentioned one of
my home departments the energy resources
group i'm also actually a nuclear
engineering and in the Goldman school
policy because in energy world's too
exciting to sort of stay in one spot we
also have this 500 million dollar energy
bioscience Institute funded by BP Chris
Somerville a colleague from Stanford who
came over to berkeley is the director of
that we have an over a hundred million
dollar project that again no
vice-chancellor Graham Fleming was
involved in setting called the Helios
program to look at novel forms of solar
nanosolar trying to do direct charging
batteries and things and very very
environmentally friendly batteries we
have something called the energy program
at our business school at haas that is
looking at energy markets we have
exciting programs that link energy and
development the Blum Center for
developing economies focuses on poverty
issues and so we have a very large
program that's got field efforts around
the world I myself have a laboratory and
if and have run it for now 16 years
based in East Africa based on University
of Nairobi and at the Africa Kadim of
Sciences also trying to do the same
story doing basic research but also
being in a mechanism to deploy and we
see that over over again the kinds of
programs that have come up if I were to
end with one kind of final part of the
equation it really would be that the
types of innovative new students and
programs that were now seeing in energy
is not only long is long since do but it
represents a real mind shift what I
moved to Berkeley now 10 years ago it
really was unusual it was almost weird
if a professor in energy had or
associated with a company
now it's almost weird if you aren't in
the same way that biotech for example
when through a real run up in some
public support private support and a
cycle that for all of the all the
problems in the biotech world is really
generated waves of innovations patents
spin-offs and programs and we're now
starting to see that in the types of
graduates so one of my recent graduates
got a PhD with myself and Paul Alba
Sato's the now the director of Lawrence
Berkeley National Lab went off and was
the key architect on one of these are PE
programs which was successful it's an
energy storage company it is now feeding
back so we're now seeing my Center my
other Center I direct on transportation
sustainability now working directly with
one of these startup companies to
develop the next generation of very very
long-lived batteries to go immediately
into electrified vehicles and that's the
kind of a feedback loop that we like to
document we don't we didn't have lots of
examples before before only a few years
ago where from the laboratory a student
who did not enter University to study
energy became a real leader 11 of these
are one of these are PE grants and is
now feeding back and drawing students in
in a larger and larger sphere of energy
programs so those types of projects kind
of illustrate the range I think you've
heard a kind of very similar story in
terms of growing not only the number of
programs but the types of areas that
they do things that are different than
in the past and clearly that energy
challenge we've described is going to
require those sorts of not only bright
minds or dedicated energy but bright
people from outside the energy field
really flow flowing in and making this
is the engine of transformation or
hopefully the next century so thanks
very much
well I'm the other Dan that was dan cam
and I'm Dan Reicher I before I give you
some thoughts I'd like to recognize some
other Google colleagues bill while is
here our green energies are at Google
one of the great titles at Google
Jacqueline fuller our director of
advocacy and communication for Google
org Michael Terrill our Google energy
policy guru and Jamie you'd who's done
wonderful press work on this event and
and many others I had the opportunity to
testify a few weeks ago in the Senate
Environment Committee on the the carry
box or climate bill there's intense
interest on this committee and several
others in Congress regarding energy and
innovation particularly what's going on
in terms of research demonstration
research development and demonstration
to confront climate change successfully
I stress to the committee that the
critical need to address the climate
crisis provides us with an unprecedented
opportunity to rebuild our energy system
with vast economic security and
environmental benefits by putting
significant limits on carbon emissions
and adopting strong complementary energy
policies we can do the many things that
I think we see create millions of jobs
reduce our dangerous dependence on
foreign energy and protect ourselves
from a global climate crisis at Google
we published a scenario last year called
clean energy 2030 which outlines one
potential path to a clean energy future
and some the proposal reduces us co2
emissions about fifty percent below the
baseline projection by 2030 while
creating 9 million new jobs and net
savings of 800 billion dollars at the
global level the International Energy
Agency estimates that between 2007 and
2030 the world will need to invest 26
point three trillion dollars in energy
infrastructure to meet currently
projected demand as John Doerr at
Kleiner Perkins has said global energy
spending could make clean technology
clean energy technology the biggest
economic opportunity of the 21st century
the ability of our
country the ability of us to seize this
historic opportunity will be influenced
to a large extent by actions taken by
government to put a significant price on
carbon emissions but a significant price
on carbon while absolutely necessary
will not be sufficient to address the
climate problem and importantly won't by
itself ensure that many of the
technologies that can address the
problem are invented and deployed here
in the US with the massive resulting
economic security and environmental
benefits there are four complementary
policies that I want to highlight that
will be critical for the u.s. to take
advantage of these opportunities first
as you've heard today we must
significantly increase public funding of
research and development of advanced
energy technologies in 1980 ten percent
of total government rd was an energy
today it is about two percent the
federal stimulus package has certainly
provided a shot in the arm for clean
energy projects but as you heard from
some of my fellow panelists there is a
serious risk of falling off a serious
funding cliff when these investments run
out we were encouraged when President
Obama called for investing 15 billion
dollars per year over the next decade in
clean energy technologies our failure to
invest becomes glaringly apparent when
we realize that barely a fifth barely a
fifth of the top 30 manufacturers of
wind turbines solar panels and advanced
batteries are American in contrast all
five of the world's leading internet
technology companies are from the US and
the Internet itself was the product of
federally funded R&amp;amp;D work by DARPA in
the 1970s let me stress that the private
sector cannot completely fill the
serious gap in energy R&amp;amp;D funding the
high risk early stage research funded by
government that has brought us major
breakthroughs in biotech information
technology and energy is generally not
the province of venture capital
investment or corporate research second
we must increase the capital available
to deploy these advanced technologies at
commercial scale moving from a nation
that derives 70
% of its power from fossil technologies
to one based largely and clean energy
will require literally trillions of
dollars of investment the challenge is
that raising this kind of capital
especially for innovative technologies
is not easy the problematic step of
moving a technology from a small pilot
project often funded by venture capital
investment to full commercial scale
projects financed largely by the banks
is frequently the point at which many
promising energy technologies die indeed
we call it the valley of death at Google
were major supporters of pending
bipartisan Senate legislation led by
senators Bingaman and Murkowski which
would create a federal clean energy
deployment administration to provide
various types of credit support to drive
private investment in valley of death
projects cita would be an independent
administration within do e with a
senate-confirmed administrator and board
of directors third we need to build a
smarter and bigger electric grid to
better harness energy efficiency and
renewable energy a smarter grid will let
us see our energy use measure it price
it and managed it to get the most out of
every watt at Google were working to
advance the smart grid on several fronts
our engineers have developed a simple
secure and free software tool called
google powermeter that gives consumed
consumers and easy means to see their
home electricity's on their computer or
smartphone and as you heard from lynn
when you finally understand what your
house is using it's a lot easier to make
changes I didn't really realize every
time my gas fired furnace turned on how
much electricity i was using with the 40
year old electric motor that was running
the blower i thought i knew something
about my own home i obviously didn't my
son loves my six year old loves putting
that bread in the toaster in the morning
and watching our base load go from 400
watts to 2,000 watts for a minute and a
half as the toast toast the light bulb
went on for my son when when he saw that
kind of real-time Energy Information at
Google we've also developed and been
testing a fleet of plug-in hybrid
vehicles that could help stabilize the
grid and
also provide massive storage capacity
for a vastly greater renewable energy
generation and beyond building a smarter
grid we also need to build a bigger
transmission grid that will allow us to
tap and deliver our nation's clean
energy resources fourth we must set
national standards to accelerate the
uptake of cleaner and more efficient
technologies Congress should adopt both
is stronger a strong national renewable
energy standard and a strong national
energy efficiency resource standard
state renewable energy and energy
efficiency standards have sparked new
industries and created thousands and
thousands of jobs the federal government
should also provide strong leadership on
the development of rigorous appliance
efficiency standards let me emphasize
that these policies if adopted and
supported will help us finally put in
place what has long been lacking in
terms of clean energy innovation a
complete and robust pipeline extending
from basic research to applied research
to demonstration projects to commercial
scale up to full deployment at Google we
call the cycle lightbulbs to light bulbs
from the initial idea in a scientist
head to full commercial deployment each
one of these steps is vital to the whole
process and each step if ignored can
inhibit the whole innovation cycle to
address climate change with new
technology we do need to increase the
size the speed and the coordination of
the entire light bulbs to light bulbs
pipeline a significant price on carbon
emissions and the complementary energy
policies I've briefly sketched could
finally build this pipeline a quick
example is solar thermal power were
early on do a funded demonstration
projects help prove the technology where
today state renewable energy standards
are driving demand and where federal
government finance is helping get plants
built and some we do know the not
sounique the not so secret formula for
accelerating clean energy innovation
with equal measures of policy investment
and will we can realize its great
potential thank you very much
okay this working right here well if we
could harvest your enthusiasm I think
we'd go a long ways to solving the
problem it's great great to see there's
the enthusiasm at the top of these
organizations and clearly within the
organization the student body has it as
well first maybe start with just sort of
a sense of how your your programs are
allocating resources today between sort
of the major sectors of renewables &amp;amp;
Company sources transportation storage
can you share with us a little bit about
how you think about those sectors how
resources are allocated across your
programs well I actually said part of
this already that we we have a big
renewables focus the in the
transportation arena we have two pieces
that involve biofuels and and better
batteries as a way to think about and
then that requires also thinking about
how you generate the electricity if you
want to reduce the carbon emissions
associated with it so so we have a group
that's a quite active in turn storage
area the so we've really tried to adopt
the portfolio approach the one thing
that we don't have but some of my
colleagues do is in the area of nuclear
engineering and that's just a result of
not replacing faculty members when they
retired at a period when there were no
new plants being built in the United
States and so so that's an area where we
don't we don't work but but otherwise we
had a quite wide ranging portfolio so I
guess I also gave a little bit of it at
Berkeley but we have this very large
effort half a billion dollars on
biofuels which is also spun off some
efforts on not only electrified vehicles
plugins and plugins and pure electrics
but also efforts within a couple of our
transportation centers looking at high
speed rail and the land planning
shoes in fact faculty at Berkeley were
involved in in setting up a law it's
called Senate bill 375 in California
that's a smart growth bill that now ties
land-use planning and why is it that we
have people who drive from one end of
the mall to the other and that kind of
thing so there's a big that's right
there's a big chunk on transportation
which in about forty percent of actually
the greenhouse gas emissions in
California we also have efforts i
mentioned this hundred million dollars
or a little more now on solar there's
big efforts on carbon capture there's a
Lawrence Berkeley Lab effort which is
about 20 22 million dollars on ccs
there's a program called P sir it's
actually the study of the grid it sort
of integration of electrical engineers
and economists and some some wayward
fizzes like myself who are involved in
designing a smart grid to take advantage
of the lower carbon fossil fuels like
gas natural gas that is but also to
think about the transition so in terms
of research there's and big chunks in
many of the areas but I think that we
know one of the hallmarks is that the
energy industry is very much a policy
driven one in a number of ways and so an
example innovation actually something
that we set up initially between myself
and the City of Berkeley was a program
now called pace financing property
assessed clean energy that allows you to
invest in energy efficiency first solar
or wind second and to do so with no
upfront costs and it's something that
came out of a initiative by the mayor of
Berkeley Tom Bates and myself that is
now in the House version of the climate
bill and is now in 10 different states
have set up versions so there's kind of
an example of the financing side that
underpins many of these things as well
so really a lot of things really cross
spectrum and we we do have a nuclear
engineer department as well which one of
them with mi T's and a couple others is
one of the top rated ones the country so
try to hit really most of the energy
areas well we also have a broad
portfolio so but rather than go over
them all let me let me give a few maybe
some texture on a few of them so I
mentioned we've all mentioned solar is a
major major focus area
I would say but if you now go one level
below many different kinds of activities
activities that are focused on let's say
cost reduction around today's
silicon-based photovoltaic technologies
novel kinds of solar concentrators cheap
cheap stuff to get more Sun on the
expensive stuff but then we also have
new materials organic materials organic
semiconductors for example biologically
self-organized materials for PV and four
and four and four batteries solar
thermal everything from applying the
kinds of novel mirror technologies you
see in large telescopes to new ways of
getting very very interesting large
amounts of energy storage to make it a
dispatchable resource water splitting
ultimately integrating the essentially
the electrolysis electrolysis step with
the fundamental solar conversion if one
can do that one has the dream of
distributed generation potentially with
all the storage you want in terms of
hydrogen and oxygen and then in addition
to that doing the kinds of integrative
studies I mentioned the future of solar
energy is one of these future of studies
that we that we are doing where we bring
together again faculty from four
different schools to understand how
technology and policy interplay what is
in fact the kind of technology of policy
space that would stimulate rapid rapid
introduction of solar that's just such
as one kind of drill down in that area
but let me also mention okay I bet you
two other two other issues one is very
importantly I think we have a
long-standing now almost 20 year program
that
has been pretty pioneering in the
integration of natural and social
systems in looking at global change the
science and policy of global change
integrated that's interesting also in
the context I mentioned one of the
criteria but I think universities are
very well to international collaboration
with our new agreement with Xinhua
frankly this tool is not going to be
refined for application in China and
will basically become a tool of the
Chinese policymaking establishment in
looking at carbon policies and obviously
the us-china dialogue as was mentioned
is is critical and finally a different
kind of direction is that one of our
programs which frankly is my favorite
this call is a seed fund program where
150k he goes to a researcher for kind of
an early stage idea we've not gone
through two rounds we've had 250
proposals funded 54 but what's
interesting now is we are to position to
mine these and to see how new
communities can be formed across the
Institute one of them which didn't
anticipate was the level of interest
from the life scientists in coming into
energy and I don't mean just biofuels I
mean other applications of biological
sciences this is at Berkeley the EBR p
is an example as what we're seeing it in
our community of a world-class life
science community looking at novel
applications of biology and
biotechnology I think these are the
kinds of things that happen at a
university looking at these kinds of new
opportunities and some of them are going
to be very very successful but what is
the
process at each organization for
determining which programs do get
funding which professors projects get
funding is the scale of impact taken
into consideration its commercial
feasibility taking into consideration
how do you how do you go about that
Ernie start okay well I think that
that's probably a little bit different
in our in our different places in our
case so I said our lead source of
support it's funny I'll take two
different ends of the spectrum our lead
source of support is from industry and
with industry it is not a consortium
it's industry by industry deciding with
us which programs they want to support
as fitting into their strategic plans
and our faculty want to do okay so that
in some sense implicitly the criterion
of a possible impact but on the other
end of the spectrum it's very important
as well is the foundation and
philanthropic support where they are
choosing areas and again I see my friend
Doug spring there some place again in
our flagship store area on the one hand
we have large example this made me some
maybe that's worth a surprising we have
a 10 million dollar a year program from
me and I the italian oil company and
half that money is for a solar frontiers
program but the industry sponsorship
taylor's programs in a certain way we've
also had substantial philanthropic
support to fund high-risk student
student rich programs in solar and the
combination of these is very rich and as
i said earlier we see how just in the
year and a half three spinouts coming in
in these areas so i think that's kind of
the nature of the program so i think
that you'll get a bit of a similar story
in all three case
is we also have this issue that faculty
and students are like cats you can't
herd them you can incite you can induce
them and lead them and so what we tend
to have is the model where faculty
either individually or increasingly in
groups go after funding whether it's
from the federal agencies whether its
foundations and so really is a there's
many many places to go but I think that
the the feature that characterizes the
pro the projects in the energy area
right now are that we're seeing teams be
it student-led be at faculty-led be at
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and UC
Berkeley faculty or also efforts through
our University diversity of
collaborations there's a number of
collaborations with Veda with Beijing
University with the University of
Indonesia with Cape Town number of
places where faculty themselves go after
programs that are meeting either basic
science needs or exciting individual
applications like developing low cost
lower efficiency of a very low cost
solar to be manufactured not just in the
United States and China and South Africa
but in many of the emerging developing
nations so in East Africa and Kenya and
Ethiopia there are as efforts that are
brought in material scientists at
Berkeley at UC Irvine that UC Merced to
work together on developing materials
that can be manufactured without clean
rooms very low cost to meet local energy
needs and it turns out surprising to
many people before they started but
there's really basic fundamental lab
research involved in that it's not an
applications program so you see a whole
bunch of things and I guess the one'd
and onto the same kind of one that Ernie
started with then there's a program that
was run by Tom Kalil who was special a
special assistant to our chancellor who
is now the deputy to John Holdren in the
office science technology policy in DC
and it was it was called bears breaking
boundaries a kind of a classic inverse
name and it was really to give out the
same kind of grants to either groups of
students or students who then roped in
faculty on projects they really saw as
critically important so you get kind of
bottom-up but also some big top down
things like the project I mentioned the
BP funded a lot of biofuels so as a
range yeah so the story
similar for us the for this year's round
of seed funding proposals much like what
Ernie described those proposals are due
tomorrow so will I will have an inbox
full of work to do as as we try to
select the best for us the big part of
what we do is through the global climate
and energy project that's actually
funded by four companies but and there
we do international proposal
competitions so we'll pick an area where
we think there's a real opportunity do a
call for proposals with some pretty
tough bars the measures we use there are
look for high quality science or
engineering science a pathway for impact
on greenhouse gas emissions and
something that's step out in the sense
that we're really looking for for things
that have break break through potential
not so much the incremental work that
that follows on something that's been
done for a long time and in our
university or one of the other so we
also have a combination of private
philanthropic support and and lots of
competition for federal funds as well so
a spectrum I'd echo of what Dan said
that nobody tells a faculty member at
Stanford or at any of the other
institutions represented here what they
should work on but but you can challenge
them with with interesting and exciting
problems that really do impact and the
energy arena certainly one of those let
me just add Google obviously things a
bit different from the universities the
initial motivation at Google was around
our own electricity use in the data
centers which is a fairly significant
use and bill while who I mentioned
earlier among his responsibilities is in
fact overseeing those data centers and
how we improve their their energy
efficiency and green up the supply but
more at the core of the energy
challenges we have in this country we've
really broadened the work quite
substantially so we've got google
engineers who are getting up every
day and actually working on software i
mentioned google powermeter other
software opportunities around how in
fact you would integrate millions of
plug-in vehicles into the electricity
grid ona on a hot day in july in
california when everybody gets home at
five thirty in the afternoon and plugs
in at the same moment you might have a
little bit of problem and I think
software could have have something to
say about how you manage that kind of
charging and equally importantly how you
could take advantage of that massive
storage capacity that we would
potentially have in those millions of
plug-in vehicles with large batteries
for example to store wind generated
electricity that tends to blow more at
night than during the day so so
interesting software opportunities
across a range of areas and then on the
hardware side we actually have some
engineers getting up every day working
on some clean energy hardware for
example like you've heard from others
how would you lower the cost of of
mirrors for solar thermal radically
lower the cost of of those mirrors to to
really drive down the cost of the
deploying it Google Earth Google Maps
you to lots of things you can do with
those we've we've done what we could to
get the word out for example about
advanced geothermal technology so called
enhanced geothermal systems or EGS you
drill deep enough anywhere around this
country or anywhere around the world and
you get to a heat source it's 365 days
24 hours a day and big opportunity so
where are those resources how do we
begin to exploit them we've made several
tens of millions of dollars of
investments in clean energy technology
companies across a range of technologies
and we'll make a step soon into energy
project investing as well how do we go
into those sorts of areas and have some
impact as well in getting actual medium
and large scale projects built and
finally certainly last but not least is
the policy arena in Washington in
particular you know how do we have some
impact there and some focus areas for us
have been number one this whole clean
energy deployment administration how do
we get that actually adopted by Congress
number two how do we actually reach 15
billion dollars
here in clean energy R&amp;amp;D increase
substantially over what we're we've been
spending in recent years that's a heavy
lift but it's one I think everyone up
here agrees we need to do and what do we
need to do from a policy perspective to
make that happen so let me just ask a
little bit about the pros and cons of
private funding versus federal funding
at some level there's a lack of federal
funding so we've turned to private
sources what issues come with locking up
IP or as folks out there might want to
interact with the University in
licensing some of these technologies are
there limitations because of the way
you've had to structure your
organization's well I could just say a
few words about that the global climate
and energy project is sponsored by four
companies ExxonMobil slumber J Toyota
and GE those companies get a
royalty-free license to to the patents
Stanford owns the patents they get a
royalty-free license but we're free to
license them elsewhere and and every any
research that involves graduate students
in Stanford must be publishable there
might be a you know at 30 or 60 day to
delay to get the patent stuff in order
but there's no restriction on
publication and there's there's freedom
to license and and so there is a to get
the technologies out so it's actually
quite similar Berkeley from very small
individual grants that might come from
individual donors to things coming from
the Energy Foundation kind of classic
found probably find foundation support
of work all the way up to the very large
the half a billion dollar one from BP
where the company the funds at BP has a
right of first review they get to look
at the projects first but then they go
out to be competed if the one doesn't
set a deal so there's a real range and
we have energy projects that are
literally go from that a few thousand
dollars for a researcher all the way up
and in a very similar way the kingdom
campus and IP office manages that with
some very standardized agreements so I
suspect you're gonna you're going to
hear a similar thing that all the
universities are saying they're open for
business subject to those same
conditions that right to publish first
by student
and faculty and at a public inverse like
Berkeley also to serve the public
interest first where the research is
publicly done is sort of the standard
deal the one wrinkle that we have of
course is there's also linkages as many
universities have to the National Labs
and then there's an those in those
contracts whether it's at Lawrence
Berkeley National Lab we work very
closely with sandhya Pacific Northwest
National Lab are gone and the National
Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado those
can have government funded projects
which will look a little different but
it's pretty similar structure across the
board same so five years from now 10
years from now how do you measure your
success what are the goals that you have
established or your sponsors have
established to say we achieve them I
think it's unfair that I get to answer
this first and that the other two guys
have a chance to think about this for a
while so so well i mean i think what all
of us would like to do is to have an
impact so that means that you can think
about impact in terms of students who
flow through our programs and who
provide the real leverage for what we do
because they make career-long
contributions you can think about impact
in terms of research results that spawn
more areas for research that create
opportunities for energy conversions and
transformations that we can only imagine
now but will find their way into the
marketplaces of the future that we've
created an educational system that
serves students and faculty members well
that we create a way for them to work
together when it makes sense to do so
and that we take the intellectual
horsepower that you have at an
institution like any of the three that
are represented here and apply it to
something that really does matter to the
whole planet so I would say ditto to
I'll add one set apiece that and that
there's a truly wonderful book so very
high a 30,000 foot level book called
Pasteur's quadrant written by Don Stokes
who was formerly at Princeton and it
defines an area which he calls Pasteur's
quadrant
use inspired basic research there's lots
of important applied research there's
basic research for its own sake but I
think a lot of the energy projects and a
lot of the motivation for our students
and faculty falls into that can I do
things that's really fundamental in
terms of economics or science or
engineering but it also comes directly
to use so I suspect that most of my
colleagues and myself certainly would
say that if the things I was doing
personally on cook stoves or smart grid
or life cycle assessment for biofuels or
developing a very low material intensity
solar if those things didn't find their
way into large or niche markets but I
would regard that as a bit of a failure
even if it was really exciting basic
research papers I really want to see
what we're doing make a difference in
terms of making this low carbon economy
profitable a quicker transition than it
would be otherwise and one that does
become a driver for for much of the next
century well I would agree with the
comments in terms of science technology
and human capacity will add one other
feature that we take quite seriously and
that is again this outreach to the
policy world and frankly influence in
the policy world through hard-nosed
objective technical analysis leading to
policy recommendations and that is one
major component of our program as well
catan the academics duck the question
for accountability how about Google what
how are you accountable at the end of
five years for what you're doing if I
had to pick one thing it's that people
actually five years from now are
measuring energy use in their own lives
and understanding it and and and having
what it takes to make very simple
changes absolutely it's it's really
quite quite straightforward the good
news is that the technology in many
respects is there to kind of give people
what they need to make much much smarter
choices and to make the right kinds of
decisions about how to improve their own
energy use first and foremost
take it taking advantage of that low
hanging fruit which is energy efficiency
and as we know it's low-hanging fruit
that grows back you know the
incandescent bulb gets replaced by the
compact fluorescent which is getting
replaced again by the LED and who knows
what comes next so that I think if if
we're going to measure performance at
Google it's really making making that
happen and and giving people the ability
to make smart choices as much as I I
love solar energy and had one of the
first legally connected systems in the
state of Maryland when I live there I
think people are making some dumb
decisions to put solar on the roof of a
house that basically is quite
inefficient and we're building an
industry around around that that I think
is unfortunate so we need to be doing
both we need to be giving people that
information to understand their own
energy use and to make smart decisions
at the other end of the spectrum as
Ernie said I think the other thing I'd
like to be measured on is that we've
really we've really given Congress and
other decision makers in Washington the
information they need to make much
smarter policy decisions it's not that
hard I think to come to the right
conclusion around energy from a from an
investment of policy and a technology
perspective I think it is indeed a lack
of information that's keeping us from
making the right choices in Washington
so I think I think we have a real shot
at changing that and the first test will
be of course what we can do in terms of
climate legislation great so we asked at
the registration for any questions I'll
read a couple does and then we'll open
it up to some there's a couple of quick
questions from the audience I think
there may be some microphones floating
around hopefully anyway uh one of the
questions is what is a single largest
obstacle to modernizing our current
energy system well I would say it is the
fact that we that that energy does not
we do not charge as much for energy as
it really costs us to use it that is
what don't reflect the externalities in
the costs and that has led
to make Assyrians about about the energy
mix we now need to change so if we're
going to do a good job of recognizing
the couple that will go a long way
toward building for the future I think
that I mean that's that's certainly the
number one for me as well I mean it's
not just putting the price on carbon but
it's also recognizing impact on
biodiversity and water and indigenous
communities and a whole variety of
things that may not all take the same
quantitative metric but it need to be
part of that equation think the other
one that's that that's probably second
to me beyond pricing the impact of
energy is really that the markets for
energy need to reflect the values that
we want not just the ones we inherited
and we need to have markets for energy
that reflect these features not just in
the price but in the degree to which we
allow ourselves or push ourselves to buy
the cleanest most sustainable energy
first and put the barriers up and there
are examples in California some other
states have versions of this but if you
don't if you don't set up the market
signals not only will you buy the wrong
thing but you tell industry that
innovating in the areas we want clean
sustainable job creating energy that's
not actually our value and so it's
really that whole chain of reflecting
what we want which we don't do today
well I will add to that particularly in
the context of climate that on the
supply side of the equation the fact is
there is too large a cost premium for
low carbon and that is a very big issue
that has to be overcome in fact that is
a goal of innovation in this in this Bay
is getting that premium down will make
policy a lot easier to make getting that
premium down is essential if there is to
be a global condominium on addressing
the carbon problem and I just echo that
quickly by saying that the major focus
of ours at Google is an initiative we
call re less than C renewable
electricity cheaper
Cole it is indeed a recognition that we
are not going to get to where we need to
get in deploying renewable energy until
it can compete straight up straight up
with traditional energy sources and
that's a combination of technology
advances smart policy and putting the
right investment tools in place to make
to make that happen but that's really
what it's going to take in the
marketplace if renewables in particular
are going to are going to seize the
opportunity that would that many of us
hope they will okay so for about 5-10
minutes here then we'll break for the
reception there are folks out there with
questions is there a microphone they're
still in these okay don't seem to really
have the same types of renewable
resources we have near here and who also
have a lot of vested interest in the
current energy system how do we make
that policy compromise because it seems
for the last two years that's been kind
of the problem so the basic question was
Boston in California have a melding of
the minds but the south and the
southeast might have a different opinion
they don't quite have the resources that
we have and they may have other
resources that are important to them so
I'll actually have to thankfully
disagree because I think we've seen some
interesting examples Texas is now not
only the wind leader in the United
States but Texas is going to be the
global leader so three years ago
everyone was champion geminii as this
remarkable place of wind Texas is now
likely to surpass that quite soon and
part of that was due not just to a
wonderful wind resource but to policy as
Ernie was saying where the public use
commission for texas decided to
authorize and to work on the financing
so that there will be a so called the
clean energy superhighway to bring the
in power largely from West Texas in
eastern New Mexico some of the cheapest
wind power in fact that he is wind it is
re less than C today in the environment
to bring that in Florida is one of the
most recent additions to this renewable
energy portfolio Club the states that
have their own standards to set
different levels and actually Florida is
infecting its neighbors so I've been
down to hearings in Mississippi and
Louisiana recently where they are trying
to work on versions of this as well so
they may not have started out with all
the glitter that we've seen elsewhere
but there's excellent solar there's
excellent biofuel resources there's
offshore ocean energy there's the EGS
the deep geothermal that the damn Riker
mentioned so it may be a little bit
later to the party than many but in some
cases that means that you haven't made
some of the policy mistakes there are
some downsides but I actually think that
there's a really remarkable range of
resources and you've got to really build
towards that mix let me let me just add
that offshore wind on the East Coast is
emerging as something of keen interest
and it literally extends from from Maine
to to South Carolina you go enough miles
offshore where you first can't see the
turbines which will be helpful in citing
them and where their turns out to be a
very vast resource and often a
topography on the bottom that allows you
to cite these turbines far offshore in
relatively shallow waters and we have a
real opportunity I think to to develop a
major resource close to population
center so adding to what Dan kamon had
to say about those other states I think
there's a great wind resource I do think
there is there is the opportunity over
time in deep geothermal um there are
though you know there are constraints
and I think that's what but Ernie is
about to tell us we have political
constraints in some of these some of
these states we the wean these states
off of very low reliance on coal or make
the big transition to carbon capture and
sequestration and there's a strong comin
it's as well get to carbon-free energy
well it's all finally good and I agree
with what then Dan and Dan said maybe
it's a longer term but i think the
questioners perception is certainly has
reflected the fact that we have very
very strong regional differences we have
very strong regional differences in cost
of electricity and frankly our failure
in my view to accommodate those up front
in the policy-making process has really
retarded our ability to to move forward
more effectively christina johnson
mentioned that one member of the panel
was an undersecretary and one was
assistant secretary that would be us and
reminded me back in those wonderful days
that who could be against our
discussions 10 11 years ago about the
great big grid that Dan referred to the
one that would resources renewable
resources on continental scales well it
turns out that the parts of the country
that already had cheap power didn't
think it was such a great idea and I
think until we face the fact that there
are horses for courses different kinds
of energy mixes in different parts of
the country no one who generously
mentioned the Northeast where we got
nothing at all that we simply have to
address the distributional effects
before we get into serious climate
policy I opposite win you're great for
how well actually actually for New
England Frank the logical thing would be
nuclear power frankly but that is not on
the horizon I've heard overriding theme
today from all of you that policy is
going to be a key player in advancing
renewable energies I was curious I've
been seeing feed-in tariff programs
popping up around the United
it's curious your opinion on you know
the effective effectiveness as that as a
mechanism over investment tax credit or
production tax credit and what your
opinions were on that okay so feed-in
tariffs for those not totally hot body
this is the idea that you give long-term
fixed contracts so secure contracts for
renewable energy ideally cross scale so
anything from a local mom and pop store
the wants to put solar on the roof to a
big solar farm say in the desert or wind
farm something else gets a fixed
long-term rates been very successful in
Europe there's a federal version that's
been introduced once and rejected and
looks like it's coming back sponsored by
congressman from Washington California
is working on a version to feed in
tariffs have so far been arguably the
most successful made
you
though many of them seeing their
long-term costs rising enough that these
may be more cost competitive and so
we'll find out where this emerges it's
certainly one of the many as already
said the u.s. is a very diverse energy
market my suspicion is that we're still
going to have different policies for
different regions RPS these these quota
systems in some states of feed-in
tariffs and others some concessions for
big projects but really all of these are
wonderful second best mechanisms they're
all really p things we need to
transition but it's that price for
carbon over time that we think most
people think I certainly believe we're
going to need that not in the next
couple years but in the longer term way
to dominate to even out the playing 11
you know the mechanism we've used to
date largely in the United States for
renewables has been tax credits but of
course the peculiar thing about tax
credits is you need taxable income to
actually use them and in a Down economic
time like we're in now they're not very
useful to large players who used to find
them quite helpful so it's caused you
know people to take a second look at the
sort of incentives we could put in place
thus I think the rising interest in and
feed in tariffs but but today in
Cameron's point ultimately we've got to
get to a point where these technologies
can in fact compete straight up and you
know I think a price on carbon is a big
first step in getting there and I just
add that I actually out the entire of
sin principle but I think one might
temper the great enthusiasm for the
success in Europe it depends what the
metric is if the metric was a bunch of
today's technology you got to put out
there okay may be successful but for
example I thought the German
over-exuberance was not a particularly
good policy in terms of an innovation
driver for example and today in Spain
it's kind of crashing and burning so I
think the feed-in tariffs are very good
mechanism but they need more careful
design than they've been given there's
also the issue of
what is the cost of the feed-in if it's
qf land it's not so good you know anyway
so a good idea but they have not been
always implemented in a very effective
way every time one more two more two
more so far the panelists had all talked
about missions reductions but according
to work of people like James Hansen
we're already at dangerous levels of
greenhouse greenhouse gases in that
Monsieur so what can you say about
negative emissions both in policy and
technology and research in your places I
don't well first of all that we had a
workshop partially supported by someone
in the audience who I won't name the if
you looking at the questions
modification because told today
reengineering what's in a good word the
capture capture so I think there are a
variety of ID search today some of them
are not removal of carbon but things
like sulfate emissions to cool sound to
me to be awfully dangerous got to be
studied a lot more carefully as it
possible band-aid and then there are
others in which it's really carbon
removal which seem to violate some law
of thermodynamics I can step you know if
if it's a big if but if we could
actually figure out how to effectively
do carbon sequestration you can not only
apply it to fossil fuels but you could
actually apply it to biomass fuels which
are in a sense they start out as as net
neutral the carbon tax and carbon
dioxide taken in by the plant and then
released when you burn it if you could
actually capture that
co2 and sequester it you could in fact
lead to a net negative in the atmosphere
I think we're some distance off in terms
of figuring out sequestration but it
would be a great addition to applying it
to coal and natural gas the piece of
this given that these technologies are
largely not available yet we don't know
how effective they'll be cost etc is
that we particularly need them in the
equation because we have sort of danced
while Rome burned for a long time in the
sense that we have emitted a huge amount
of greenhouse gases and we do not know
exactly how quickly will be able to
deploy these low-carbon solutions so we
may need this one either as an insurance
policy or even as part of a strategy if
we discover the rate of climate changes
is really affecting us the problem of
course is that when you wait till you
see it happening all around you and it's
a little late to unmelted a sure and
things so it's a really challenging
point no question though if we're really
good invest in the level of Science and
Technology around energy issues that
we're talking about this should be part
of that portfolio but the debate is
still out as to which what fraction of
this portfolio should be in these carbon
negative options versus on the
deployments and there's a similar debate
around so-called mitigation versus
adaptation how much do we fight off what
we can get rid of what we can avoid
doing to the planet and how much do we
start dealing with what the plan is
going to become a respective to that so
we'll see I'll just oh I will actually
be brief so the thermodynamic driving
force for taking co2 out of the air is a
lot lower than the thermodynamic driving
force for highest concentration sources
so if it's strictly capture that makes
more sense to use a whole bunch of other
sources first and then the air now some
of the things that we're mentioned were
the you know sequestration with biofuels
that's that's a different matter but it
actually uses a our concentration source
for the capture part of it yeah I just
want to add about two very brief
comments 1 is add and raised I think
very importantly the issue of adaptation
an area where I think we are woefully
under investing
but going back to the atmospheric
reengineering so-called at least two
cheap things like like sulfate emissions
we really do need to study the science
of that much more carefully but what I
would add to it is we should in parallel
seriously do the research on the
institutional structures that one would
need for a world that might contemplate
doing that kind of a thing you can't let
the academics get started on this Tessa
so I would say that that the one thing
that and actually I'm not disagreeing at
all with them with Ernie but even if we
manage to to use the what would you call
it atmospheric re-engineering schemes
the that those don't do they might
influence the warming part of it but
they don't do anything to the pH the pH
change and yeah I jack yeah so I to work
more carefully it doesn't help the
problem with pH reduction in the ocean
so they're pretty good geochemical
reasons why we need to work on that
never mind the climate side the spirit
of our workshop was to hopefully make
people understand the importance of
mitigation I'm we get one here to us so
thus we go back to our lowest hanging
fruit which is energy efficiency and I
think that's changing the subject but
that's what's there that's what we
aren't we know we can do now something
yes it should be a pretty quick question
my question is that there's a general
consensus it seems that we're woefully
under investing in energy innovation on
a federal level I think that's shared by
all the panelists as well as the
undersecretary you joined us earlier and
my question for you is in terms of
federal investment what is the scale of
funding you see as necessary to meet the
Innovation Challenge perhaps on an
annual level and where do you think that
that money should or could come from
once the stimulus expires well let me
let me say that we there is a number out
there 15 billion dollars a year for
federal investment in clean energy RD&amp;amp;D
that President Obama has has talked
about and talked about that kind of
spending over a significant increase
over today there are a couple of options
of where it comes from one is through
normal appropriations which is a very
tough way to to increase this kind of
budget particularly in a and in the lean
times we're facing and particularly with
the deficit that we're staring at the
biggest in history obviously the the
second source could well be if we
actually got to climate legislation and
be able to tap that funds that come out
of putting a price on carbon that I
think is some years off I think the
issue is and in fact find this through
normal appropriations I think there's
strong reason to to do so but I think
it's going to be tough sliding over the
next couple years yeah I will I greet
the comment that the time scales don't
work out for the carbon allowances we
don't have time but I do and
appropriations is the obvious approach
but i do on emphasize there are other
ways of going about it ways that we used
to do not so long ago for example
congressman voucher introduced a very
simple idea of a very small line charge
on electricity to support he had in mind
a fairly narrow focus to support major
RD&amp;amp;D around coal and carbon capture and
sequestration well the same idea could
be could be extended to other areas it's
interesting we used to do that for
example of natural gas there was for
many years a surcharge on interstate gas
transmission which funded a 200-plus
million dollar natural gas R&amp;amp;D program
run through a nonprofit organization GRI
that was a casualty of deregulation but
it's interesting these ideas are coming
back there is an example in place with a
small with
a piece of the annual oil and gas
royalties of the government going
towards natural gas supply rd there's
the pouch about your idea which is in
the waxman-markey bill and so i think we
may be going back to these approaches in
which a small charge on energy use is
reinvested into our DD and actually if
you look at the essence of other fields
that that policy really has some legs
when there was a national debate over
essentially doubling the national have
NIH budget the med the medical biotech
rd budget there was very public debate
about doubling it it happened it wasn't
perfect but at the same time private
sector investment actually went up not x
factor too but by most measures by a
factor of 10 to 15 and so you really
want to structure these in ways where
the public sector provides the kick to
get it started a friend of mine in DC
likens this he says well because we've
done it in biotech but not and energy we
may be living long enough to see the
error of our ways but it does kind of
highlight they're a bunch of tools out
there we have another mechanism that
actually ireland pioneer does there's a
neat thing to do to have a fee bait
essentially when you buy a vehicle for
example in the transportation sector
that if you buy one below the standard
for that class of vehicle there's a tax
that goes to people that buy the vehicle
that are more efficient and the irish
liked it so much they decided to make
