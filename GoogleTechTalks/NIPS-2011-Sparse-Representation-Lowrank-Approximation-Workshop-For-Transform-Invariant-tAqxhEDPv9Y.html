like slo-mo voice and so I'm going to
about a joke so the short happy in
contrast for near on the right texture
but after work today and above the
theory and unreason recover sparse on
the ramp to keep structures and then
there's a lot of people in recent years
so right off our try to put you on an
application so what cool start we can do
and hopefully neither one to return that
will suggest a new problem between they
have not sought to do walls become all
of us this is a key toying around with
my father students all right and also
college freshman on campus especially
the theoretical anarchism side I also
toxic me and Russell you keep so I mean
but I don't know where really fun
tonight you know why is this Marceline
sleep because in a really resisting
which Michael really make sense of this
massive hydrogenated right so we try to
really should instruct compact on such
massive data why because our great
learning process a few less per second
we need to have a very compact
consultation of what's in the data plus
make good decisions so I also one thing
my assumption your icons that the thing
i do have structures it is just random
wrong we know are going to lose so
there's nothing
Trinity to go out so they have made
something that the data do have these
structures and intrinsic degree of
freedom are very compact very low that
but hence all the techniques going after
so this is actually those assumptions
are fundamental for us to do all those
soothing to inject about internal data
images you turn the compression or
discouragement we use the reason we can
currently very patient thing because the
High Court has two measures of Emerson
structures right what we have a great
weekend best and we're fishing season
precisely because of collaborating of
information so I'm going to discuss our
best source of numbers thank you so just
using my example to give you an idea and
why this kind of speaks very fundamental
and crucial for modeling data life
source of data we have a lot this daisy
chaining itchy Magette use it a lot big
matrix I say do you think about the
entry the pixel is just entered
operations so it could be huge matrix
especially not on camera gets more more
higher higher resolution each camera
even iphone in their app megapixels so
you're dealing with huge matrix position
but good thing is that if you look at
this kind of limit is a very
representative right you know that they
actually very regular right although I
want you to find out what you mean but
you listen you saw them you love there's
construction right and there's you know
it also if you treat the muscle
maintains you can you imagine they're
also highly correct right for example
this is by left for signature you know
there is one column on the left and go
to be exactly the same on the life
prospect so the question is there's no
irregularities and the symmetries and
how can they actually harvest them for
all kinds of purposes or see all
so the common Rudy learners those other
structures with that for those textures
very highly correct and record from high
dimensional so the problem is not so
easy right in conservation you know so
far i'm talking about all this
idealistic are visual models that we can
try them and recover the rack matrix
with livernois or smart or smarter but
in continuation especially for
practitioners you're doing this probably
like this you're getting daylight right
you do not control because you don't
control the acquisition acquisition
process your pieces of data you have a
few ways they're so this thing or across
your emotions you found everything you
know there's something very regular
behind right and how to handle those
crunches or something and also
furthermore you will get to see the
front of you very often there's
information so suppose you apply piecing
a to this kind of data okay Amanda once
you would get over a positive garbage if
you try to process them something to
lower low right population you can argue
that you are not be getting the
fundamental structure looking so I'll
convert briefly and then rushing is that
we can compose the city to two steps
first of course how many head up
Russians it supposedly some dough rack
structure in the data but there's some
pressure on our island and also one more
step what if there's always an
additional transformation either day how
can we have it so this part is actually
related to Lincoln or talk about today
is go much PCF know very quickly
overview of what we do but now try to
focus on this art and also exempt
occasions so if you're not don't just
think about huge architectures so this
is a traditional PC a try to estimate
low rank matrix despite my gosh alloys
or pump dispenser vs so this
everybody knows we've left in the right
position so the problem that I'm saying
some real forget this kind of problem we
try to compile the error is not what it
can be gross mushrooms right so actually
could be some lowdown you should
structure plus some scratches we still
try to impact the scratch Kaylee Collins
and then this is this error model is a
lot of cautions Lamar sharing or sparse
you can make your own assumptions the
question is how do decompose the data
matrix into a lower house part
components right do this often I do but
this is actually we can if you say so
think about this is a lot of robust of
TCP right teacher if you say handle
small boys this actually handles gross
errors hours right there second Thank
You tremendous effort to try to solve
this problem in almost every researcher
every every area this is some
represented was in computer vision knows
every community has song so I turns out
in other side chain one way to make this
problem plausible is actually you have
to assume something coherence between
the bell rang bhare the sparse part and
the very broad conditions person
actually indeed you can actually do it
but a lot of addition probably is not
trivial Greg we know that randomization
and a fleet Rises smarty of a signal amo
special people never ever attracted but
the lesson I will also learn from a
persisting is that actually can actually
sell its almost hard from magic relaxing
with their comeback survey I try to
soften your step but everybody can do
this I mean this actually comes upon
your metabolism and then the question is
that Linda achievement clock today mom
just like we done for solving on one
device you end up going to solving a
zero so they're so close with are always
because this probably is np-hard this is
not and but you can do simulations I
mean that there is action region that if
you do commerce accumulation
actually you have high prorated of 66
success but precisely when the bank is
low enough as a fraction of the total
domination and the crotch it is actually
this is actually the properties are just
no fracturing properties so I don't like
you can argue this is also reaching we
actually care package right the data is
not totally tool prompted and also do
have no rank that has been structures
also if you know which interest
properties i did this become a bitch's
completion problem and then you have a
larger range of working range so
actually going you can't prove that
actually of their fairly broad
conditions that was a wreck is bumping
football by almost proportional to the
dimension and Eric have your constant
fraction of entries and actually assault
combat stop edition DVD from this one of
them well the first result support
system problem and we just need to dig
that we can say that the Commerce of
tradition is has a lot of actively
factor but if i solve this doesn't
really have any free engine for to tune
the global minima Christmas with Roger
and also you combine this matrix
completion if you have been complete
measurements and you can see let's say
ten percent of the measure is still has
all come as a position for you the
correct solution and and also if you
allow the to the lambda actually turns
out of their same conditions the evil
that error is the drivers right outside
the fresher error you can corrupt regime
asymptotic approach under percent so
that she has this a dense air approach
also you can combine with Lawrence this
noise then in this case with this big
west of it rather precise again recall
so I think probably Martin will talk
about
but it's fitted to in communication with
some honest answers so there's ice cream
but one thing that this has been a lot
of theoretical flow blessing few years
very very smart people I really has done
a lot of contribution to this problem a
vicious completion recovery including
the high wizard but but seriously series
so if we cannot compute the thing that
is very very efficient thing then we'll
be useless practitioner might be right
so for example this probably is actually
not easy even we are able to view for
the Commerce conclusion but if you have
a followed by fellow matrix in fact
alert us all comments creation is creamy
another but that is a very haunting if
you use traditional artificial commerce
position so this turns out in the past
few years has been a lot of development
to be the fast if you should I agree
more and so you can just solve this kind
of problem is unprecedented skills mean
this is why representing example by all
a graffiti just basing this on video on
the bus tomorrow and you solve this
month later the automated fashion and
the three steps of my steps just devour
signal manager shrinkage that wants
doing the actually watch your kitchen
and each rate which currently to
commercial I saw and as you can see
really doing a very short amount of time
the speed up by several magnitude and he
got you can compute several solid by
column inches all seem fresh upsets our
second problem this is evil oh this is
all I now is already polomoche master so
this is nice meaning that if I have a
low-rank waitress with some error
crusher I can actually recovered and
under favorable conditions myself well I
mean this stuff you can see that in the
division so we deal with this kind of
images right we try to recognize
barcode is war length capture a lot of
imagination and Google gamble trying to
recognize buildings from a picture
mobile devices right so they are you
think about the law library restructure
write text and the building facade and
also barcode or religious structure but
the practice that you may take a picture
from the arbitrary and you have to do
messages like this writers so even the
structure you're looking at actually
continue for there's a perspective or
even though I mean amount of information
the one you do you can apply our pieces
for them but you're still get garbage so
the problem is like this right so you
don't even see the frontal view of
profit of you you see actually let's say
I wrote taking the word hope you realize
we have actually no problem to do to
decipher this image right we didn't know
this is rotated crafted one there's a
fracture second but why computer to do
this is very very difficult it is up to
this work right so that if you look at
what's the difference between the
Reverend of the usual window it's a very
bad matrix because it's located right
it's supposed to have very structure and
some fashion but but if you this is
rotated version if you look at matrix is
actually hiring the rank very high they
don't the columns are not very correct
but once you can adjust and swindon
let's say to the grid window they
treated that as a matrix that can be
decrypted precisely compose as an
already passed prop change so now I was
Travis or seven or topic in proper you
don't know the information would have to
estimated some kind of commercial
deformation of the domain before you get
to seasonal ramp a smart structure right
but the good thing is that you can use
the lower exports to as a go to achieve
to help you to look for the deformation
imagine you just try to compress them as
much as you can but the low rank as far
as opposed to be hiding
impressive so has wonder who you look
for t formation such as we can further
compress data better bet and of course
this become a nonlinear problem right so
if you minimize lower class sparse
subject to this constraint is still
allowing in your pockets double convex
opposition well like any engineer are we
doing for a valid under problem with
linearized right so so you can actually
try to solve the linearized problem
first so we can space we solve this
incremental every time that we push this
a little bit in the direction where you
can imagine further compress the data in
terms of low rank plus power structure
right we do this recursive actually that
really shows this process besides the
situation now if you look at this
problem this is almost like a robust you
see a right you cannot datamatrix this
is the power you don't have now this is
no matrix you try to compose composing
the lower end crossbars Plus this
tricomi we'd also done in computer for
matrix and inner image and avatar this
is a done deal I was of the system knee
turn unknowns right try to compute this
term you can do you need it is by just
pre multiply both side with with the
colonel jay jacobian youjizz this edgy
every box is a compressed version of RPC
right you get to see a projection of
little ramp a sparse matrix in fact
there's a favor by Richard Meier talk
about this in the slips how does you
know under what condition you expect
this to work actually there's still we
also still working on it so now let's
just forget on the theory and but let
that i must say that still under exact
condition this can actually got you to
find the correct solution is due why my
mom's run-over problem so now let's look
at it a lot we can useful this is all
right so we'll also show examples with
progressively more complicated to tau
here if not can be an occultation
offline protected or see how far we can
go with severe so envision the first
thing you took
first thing you learn is actually
actually or corneal infection right so
let's think about this actually pretty
unifies our bodies add JD's to rank one
matrix but corner mostly the rental
cemetery anything that you have a
significant pattern you actually get to
the red one dog by the way the Revelator
you put LeBron the grid window is the
object to merge of Matthew to that this
stock I saw the license plate you don't
have to recognize license plate from
that angry he always rectify it then
this is called a straight front texture
there's a lot of work but straight from
random texture well I are you hav
karachi gets shaped much more acrid
sharing from such your pension which has
little rap texture right like those
patterns and this can you give suffix or
accuracy and also by the way this whole
admin remember we don't do a there's no
feature extraction look for our edge
nothing not even filter just moving
pixels around it's very fun as to what
you see is what you get so and you get a
very accurate filmography into john
density formation and also anything that
has some kind of regularity this will
find it automatically and you don't have
to do this formation on an angle when
the lady always shows how that will
convert everything is a step and chinese
character will see how far he knows x
factor or some chinese here you can
actually imagine so how many Chinese
Catherine can think about humming charts
character I'll go and robust the rapid
textures and barcode or text well this
isn't this actually does is
automatically and the senior prom i
tilted power I Jones
lego is what seemed a little flat right
actually make your flower it's very
robust and turns our Jesus actually
question Ernest you already how I can to
fail I mean that's a first time into the
region if you working come to be you
know that things always a little bit
fishing right but this is a question
then what were a few a reason that
really hard to fail if you failed
actuator is a very good reason because
you're entering into the Atlantic Ocean
optimization this is me well why do you
say it one way to do this is your
computing interest which you said that
you're not gonna features it also is
that you need in the objective function
yes we're dealing with basic additional
pix 11 there are pics oh he's a barrel
right so I which is e matrix dick
responding to what wrenches of it so
actually you are using all the
structures of the pixels together so
they're actually they're actually part
of you does not or internal think of
patient well I can say pixel are often
features all the information whatever
extract from image so you look at a
couple of Asian why ill regards I work
with the reasonable my life right all
the cultivation no matter if you
reconstruction or recognition I resist
are with local features corners your
structure for motion like this you can
converse with all from all the images we
try to stash for our course dongles but
the problem is Wonder is that you know
it's for clueless but also there's a lot
of the features on the same corner right
looks exactly saying it's like the image
will do correspondence is fundamentally
a pupil's but unfortunately that's when
we stopped that's why waiting on vision
a vision are not very robust but even
the first step of camera coverage if you
want to be closer to university to cover
up cover perfection is not you have to
extract corner pictures right so for
example Microsoft sales are all cheap
cameras these days right key that can us
but that we can break you know how
expensive the conversion rate for
calibrating this not even very precisely
close look up few million dollars is to
calibrate good and break to cannibalism
now probably don't have to i mean the
tradition if you do cabaret shun the
toolbox you download from the web and it
was other one is that we take many
pictures and can see there's a really
distortion in the camera what you doing
start kicking vocab you soon click in
Congress so this is our Bible so you
don't have to keep anything right so the
whole thing the straight as a texture it
was a body on
formation for me unless you're a nun who
or not you know all the calibration
crimes are precisely with a hacker to
right so here you just keep clicking
right so if you don't have a wreck just
go to back when we take some picture of
a mosaic and steal energy caricature
will completed also if you don't care
all interest private or if you wouldn't
have long image I just want you can you
can get rid of the reading this book so
you can have a very bad like a webcam
you'll make it a wife face looks fat so
that's why we don't like this here okay
um also the new catch it with a lot of
things alright so example from Wall
Street View must review images I mean in
fact you get the very very sharp precise
geometry from images like this and you
can do all kinds of interesting things
the video precisely shows how that is
involved in a compensation path so
actually rectified precisely probably
nobody has seen where if you've seen the
Empire in for this angle right that's
you clearly windows me so I do a lot of
your traditional structure from motion
become rather simple honest for this
kind of structure my buildings normal
facade as you can see you to unfold that
like another intersection you get a
little rank techniques and also can you
no longer have to do pointwise
corresponds you have to region to region
you have a much much less and be good
from single image you already get a
camera and everything from a signal
range that's how we proceed probably the
geometry we don't have to correct
before you just probability together the
precise camera future and by the way was
you know that the compared to
traditional method of a cute them this
is this all the accuracy is subject
slackers like because it's completely
consistent but before if you try to
attract corners you can get a few people
a dirt that gets in her in oil camera
positions and your estimates and this is
also from if you have a site building
all you only need eight pictures but you
get a very good student models and you
can't read rather see there's all the
refraction occlusion in such a very
robust you can run or the despite a lot
of working on structure for motion I
whole other topic or private systems
engineer highly engineered systems you
can run on this kind of sequence the old
Phil reason very simple signals so this
is still I'm going to go I also become
curved surface still I mean or change
abilities the top it's more complicated
right here you have a interest the
camera interest parameter rotation
translation plus the shape of the curve
so why we are no longer afraid of doing
this keep in mind you this is how 2 per
hundred window and eat already 20
million other 20,000 times you are you
doing a pair price to to do optimization
with 28,000 division and another 20
burgers is nothing you don't even see
that really slow start but so basically
if you do the right thing with a high
garnish optimization the degree of
freedom of some of the founder is
actually t really in the past were very
afraid are we doing the traditional
computer vision very much afraid of
doing your computer estimate the next 10
or 20 parameters but now unless you have
enough measurements such as a proper
become firmer
welcome addition have you fancy field
very simple others just this very
quickly and you can actually get into
learning doesn't show you the Amazon or
just push the matrix starts with a
visual too LOL texture are you don't
have to do any feature attraction and
negative 360 to paranormal actually
works very robust agency this is the we
tried all some old landmarks of the
regime has a curved surface but the many
matters of Lucian saturation to get
light but I said what's your like
generates the D to the right things we
had a hard time to fail we really have
to we know try very challenging
initialization when you fell and then
you guys should do all kinds of once you
do the computation you can almost all
the local geometry and you can do all
the editing and adding all those banners
this hearing it ladies sub pixel
accuracy your eyes cannot tell the
difference a lot of all the Chinese
characters they're not little ramp
texture but they're all robustly little
maggot textures so it's not right as you
can see because this is a rotation of
this is the nuclear go on it's very shy
somehow I love little hola the doctor
Norris vs it into rotation the
composition is very very sensitive now
you can actually rectified computer is
compared with traditional half stressful
when you've actually rectify Chinese
character after here on tape
correct position we can do almost all
Chinese found popular for Haiti salty
Kyle solution and the actual you can
cancel our the problem is OCR right now
the Woodworks foreground images from the
text if you rotate interspire let's take
20 grand 50 degree drop from high 90s to
below ten percent all right so you can
actually do a cell phone take a picture
of Sunside there are black rectify it
and they recognize even charm English
which it has a lot of let's just show
you up so this is also a result using
the rectum you see they are already very
very frontal but see if you don't
rectify them the tradition say that
doesn't return anything you know
recognizing right this is almost like
front all right what do you recommend i
should get open don't shoot so this is
just a give you idea that we don't you
the perspective distortion i change the
fundamental difficulty for our computer
vision to do recognition and so on but
so hopefully business techniques you got
you can rectify can undo the
transformation under this transformation
and you can make recognition of tax
basis buildings that much more reliable
and to 3d reconstruction much more
without relying on local features which
is true traditionally ambiguous and
problem at all so expertly mentoring
right i'm not saying this with nice
picture of course you can you have
pictures to use it let's give you a
tissue information and also this logic
petitioning helps allow is other image
from bleeding castle and techniques for
example this is the building facade if
you don't rectify it into SPD you can
even take the first letter head terms
the operation is very like if you're
rectifying just only to fix first two or
three you get a very sharp recover let
me suggest you are going to image
compression you could gain a lot by
rectify matters right rectified
so this trickle message is rice it is a
lot basically the trust formed around
crossbar structure are really central to
a lot of videotape does the good news is
that now is all the equipped with modern
high dimensional position techniques
week actually compute them at our
facility the scale we do get the simple
mentions now legendre tremendous so
everywhere you look we should have the
information you don't have to realize on
this individual corners and you try to
assemble on there right now this
actually close to the hopefully what I
have allowed in that door of usefulness
see lots of good things about this is
has a really good holistic nature but
you don't really realize on local things
local statistics of the images because
you deal with regions to active and alex
from end up with a couple of promotion
slightly so to me why there's a lots of
interest to study in this partial Iraq
techniques because there's a lot of data
by Allure Salon application court and
unfortunately we start understand how
the visual statistics much better now
there's good back working theory are
exposed to people like us we can
understand you know no better and also
we do a much more efficient than a
reason right well its commercialization
random techniques and actually help us
to be able to compute the structures and
I'm Chris of this scale asleep so
nothing is really new is still fixing
the same old product for trying to do is
to put you two hundred years ago but we
have new technique stuff right and the
reason why are all this one and this
more very interested to a more tension
is because you know first of magic
conversion because actually fits the
model of the data like judicial
and this is our chief justice let slide
summarizes the sort of the power to
inspire recovery and low ravages am I
talking supposed to feel about this but
you can see that there's a rarity parity
between this two lines at the moment
rank people being compressed sensing and
also which is completion very much
following a slide so I maybe I deny that
this week each other before
mathematician this is actually the blog
a lot of work has been focused on this
right thoughtful practitioner like us
for new years we also have to deal with
errors correction because that happens
we don't control the big it stays on
most of the data contaminated you have
to do an air of the last error
correction very lonely especially to the
division while huge processing you have
to deal with your my transformation
because you're going to get to see the
frontal data the deformed air in many
cases so you have to solve my heart
attack and subsequently of course we
actually give you problems for society
for general Naga promising how do you
solve robust we see in the compressed or
laughter straight walk for and of course
you know we see that in math we had this
saying an equal idea works plus is the
trick twice become a referee right so
suggesting dollars in sparse recovery
and no record cover may have murdered
powerful tools what about other
structures there must be other burial
structures Camilla Torres structure
problems you can solve with similar
techniques so people started
investigating that dollars on recent
paper but Karis invention and suggesting
there's no I think travel also followed
what ? if you have thoughtful from large
family of spectra of norms with the good
structure support instructor from the
airport actually the leaf you expected
the Commerce Commission to work forever
and very efficiently address specific
consistent so that's very excited we'll
see you know as practitioner will see
how and how what kind of practical
problems we can use them to solve in the
future so this is a you're interested in
some
papers it's just actually accepted by G
C D and there's a series on this the
most PC yeah I actually Alice website
you could just google me and there's a
website for the bell rang matrix let you
have a colorful till feels like you
could double it's not a Philippine
government labels with yourself and
there's actually a lot of work people at
the msre i also tried to speak up and
this is a better imitation let's say
random projection insiders make it much
much faster lots of new jersey we've all
been busted t-shirt so this is some of
the flowers I'm sorry what our top story
million times and then you keep okay who
are you that the hottest identity top
again just identity of the rotation so
well just everything to start from zero
and we just really cool employ or your
vehicle look calm yourself you saw the
town by every step you saw combat
accommodation times yeah when I lack
give you another one that gave you the
data tala turn update so you saw that
okay so you set us up sit here that's a
linear term right so you can get it to
from solving this comments and finish
this cover to give you a updated to be
each other for the do you update asset
okay pasta we questioned it great
question so that's right in this case
the citation there's an extra constraint
will actually maintain the window have
the same error but that's another
constraint which he came off kinda
steamy erotic so you know where I live
you are familiar with some of room for
me to accept my sort of the division
you're trying to scale in mind this set
feature actually does fix the location
and also the scale hi I think I think
about tell us exactly opposite because I
rank easy where will you change the who
mean wow and also if your ship it if you
have a symmetric pattern if you share to
the window you can assign rack so this
one does not deny who is allergic fixed
while the point now fix the scale so in
some of this to just look completely
complementary to each other but II
correct them all our other deformation
obviously doesn't crack is the location
translation and in the skill so it's
very interesting you can I use with me
please wow you have to have structure so
I can settle yeah I love in
naturally busy hey Kira which gonna make
a difference between low rare texture
and the random tension there's a lot of
studying division in the beginning
synthesized texture sqn of
stochastically homogeneous or stochastic
desire but here i will emphasize this
kind of technique steel i will structure
texture if you have structure works much
better in terms of recovering to shave
recovering the structure its geology
