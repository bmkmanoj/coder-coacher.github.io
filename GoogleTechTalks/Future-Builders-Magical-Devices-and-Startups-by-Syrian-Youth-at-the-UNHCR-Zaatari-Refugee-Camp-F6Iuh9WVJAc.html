like Freddie to start this is Karen and
catcha and I think they're actually
gonna insure themselves that right this
is Professor Kevin Fischer and i'm katya
you can move i am a PhD student we are
from the university of washington
information school and thank you very
much that on catalina for having us here
it's a real pleasure to be here thanks
for coming and we will share with you
our work with Syrian refugee youth so we
are living in an increasingly
sophisticated technological age but we
are facing the worst humanitarian crisis
since World War 2 60 million of the
world's people today are refugees and
the lawn and brutal war in Syria has
contributed to this crisis the United
Nations refugee agency unhcr this month
counted 4.7 million Syrian refugees who
have fled the country and Jordan is one
of the country's hosting Syrian refugees
I want to bring your attention to that
red spot on the map Zachary refugee camp
it just it lies just a few miles south
of the border about an hour away from
jordan's capital am on the other where
PG camp started in the summer of 2012
when about a hundred families crossed
the border from Syria to Jordan fleeing
the violence and most people about
eighty percent of the people living
there now are coming from Daraa the
province just that province that's
predominantly it's predominately rural
and low-income
and in these past three years Zachary
has grown to be the fourth largest city
in Jordan it houses right now about
80,000 people it's a huge place more
than half of these people living there
are kids it operates like a city with
hospitals schools an informal economy of
shops and restaurants and it's comprised
of 12 districts people rely on their
mobiles to communicate and use the
internet at NGO centers and other public
places and there is very complicated
infrastructure at the refugee camp it's
run jointly by the UNHCR and in turn
Daniel government and humanitarian
organizations work day to day in the
camp
Thank You kochia it Scott you mentioned
no we've been working with immigrant and
refugee youth from around the world and
a couple years ago we were invited by
the UNHCR to go there and start doing
some work but to build capacity with the
youth and the first piece of work at the
assets to do was to help them understand
how the young people of the camp how
they were using mobiles and the internet
using technology it was an awesome piece
of research for us because once you go
to zap tree your you leave your life
changes you never quite the same again
because it's just no community out in
the desert when you check the weather on
your phone you know what it says dust
that's very good forecast because that
as well as like it's totally
life-changing and now I'm what a cartoon
I would like our presentation today is
not to be very interactive so by all
means ask questions because we have a
lot of questions that would like to ask
of you so we designed this instrument no
in no partnership with you and this year
and when you work with them you work
with task forces that's how you make
success how it happens we're working
with NGOs so I know a lot of you know
folks to here google as well and we know
we developed this instrument and then we
redid the survey with a couple of
hundred youths and came back Thanks
Thank You budget and we found that shift
you would not expect that majority of
youth do have mobile to and they love
google they Google all the time Google
all the time and what's half of course
is very highly popular there and they
love YouTube but they can't always get
on YouTube of course because you don't
have broadband and it was really
refreshing cross that the UNHCR when
they did the survey when I was there my
last trip November Facebook was there at
the same time Facebook technicians in
the head of the camp turn around to a
nice apparently not invade this but
we're using your data is shocked
facebook because they didn't have any
data before to talk about how many youth
had mobiles or they were using them for
where they were going in the cam to get
the best connections and so forth things
like that we also asked a lot of
questions about know if you had better
connectivity what would you use it for
what are using for to how to help other
people and one of the great
for that because no my research is all
about how do you help other people and
check in society to want to call being
in an ICT Waker we found that they're
all doing it but the voice the young
guys are you doing it more than the
girls because they have more mobility
for at the camp this is very gender eyes
culture there and we will go on
chocolates father research here um co
design workshops Gilligan never engaged
in very much is what we call connects
learning that is good quickness right oh
I have a quick question so um is it
fairly affordable for these gets them to
get online and like what what's the data
plans and I like the Hackett many ways
that's a great question how affordable
is it now you can get mobiles you know
you can get them but if this your
phone's just out of that going on the
bigger thing is sharing sim cards
enjoyed i use i'm playing sorry where do
they get the phones to get two phones
and you can get different different
providers they can pick up the cell
phones you buy them I just have solid
out the city in Mafraq you can get them
and I'm on you know there's not a
hand-me-down some bones things like that
can get the phones the bigger things to
get the sim cards and then you get those
from different providers from Zane
orange one of the things that's really
interesting though is that you don't
typically by sim cards under your own
name because as soon as you do in
history with the government to save
example when I went to him on first time
I went there with the air college she
immediately pulled out a different ID to
be with my sim card or if you know what
I mean it's fascinating things you learn
when you start know doing this doing
this type of work so and then is Wi-Fi
of course use Wi-Fi to get on try and
get connectivity and there's one place
the camp known as Syrian hill you should
go there and that's the best place for
getting your access to call back get
access to Syria so a for the methodology
so we the first thing we did with this
survey we're going around the can Jones
it no surveys people the located and the
chance to Sabres where they do have lots
of shops and so forth as well as the
NGOs and things and yeah but we also if
you I want to do with co design
workshops cuz I did
were you the different parts a little
bit based in Seattle but I really wanted
to understand how you've helped other
people through information technology
and we've been doing a lot of different
series of different types of co.design
activities and what we're really really
into is connected learning and recently
talking with Mimi Ito was a MacArthur no
professor based at the University of
Irvine and we've also I'm very inspired
to pro work because they find that
really set you up for success you know a
real youth capacity and it's really
important that you work with the mentors
in youths blogs as well and have a great
family based approach community approach
to it and what you see right here this
one picture this is at an NGO called the
American school you can see the valley
on the Left he's the refugee translator
but I employed in the can and you can
see the lego is there all the different
drawing materials whenever I go to the
camp I bring all my own materials course
these are being 11 x 17 spec sheets and
I always try to bring the most beautiful
materials that I can find I always leave
everything behind on the principle of
abandoned imagining things and what the
idea there's kind of a Bedouin concept
that you no longer me things so you
leave it there so that other you do from
the NGOs can you know use materials
afterward and also the idea that they
can continue to use the activity of the
co.design exercise with other youth in
the cab continue them so I'm going to
show you some of these narrative
drawings it's just a few i have about
forty eight of these and we analyze them
and some of them are set in syria and
lava set in the camp I love this
particular one and i was just wondering
if you can tell me what jumps out at you
you read this what's going on all flogs
emails he didn't the authoress he won't
thank you i'll be showing speak up yeah
anyway yeah is it a boy or a girl you an
xterra they define a big of my social
Dage up to age 25 as a young person even
though early marriage is a big
phenomenon the cam when the reasons the
girls don't go to school cuz you can be
age 14 and get marriage unfortunately
you're trying to stop that of course
we're going to get married you don't go
to school but the other page 25 because
people's lives get disrupted education
gets disrupted and so forth so I
typically work with a lot of older
people too but this has been done my
girl of course is actually two stories
in this because with knoweth Arabic and
our culture's you read from right to
left so in the first story on the right
she's explaining that she helps her
mother with technology with my mobile
and in the second story on the left just
stating how she helps her younger sister
with her letters but what she means by
letters is not just the elf of it but
also learning how to read I love this
particular one's beautiful too looking
stories what else is very striking about
this one though is that the figures are
westernized right in see ya there
wearing skirts their legs are showing
blonde hair and none of us were I don't
have blonde hair right and you know with
winter we're wearing no coats it snows
marchers to snow and everything so it's
interesting really interesting example
this next one I'm going to show you
do you think the author is what's going
on here
all right the boy yeah so when we do
that design work though it's very
gendered and this is with at Norwegian
Refugee Council amazing food to work
with and theory right this is true drawn
by young man liberal presidencies age Oh
Kenzie's can optic and typically but if
the arabic it is a five means that you
need or a zero you need to add five to
the edge so could have been maybe he was
17 or so but anyway and this one is
definitely set in Syria you can see that
he has the show el assad written on top
of the tank are you talking about i know
a body is there and this is amazing
because this particular story and a set
the second trip that we made to camp
back in november when we decide the
magical genius devices this screens or
locating device is having to do with
crisis intervention and how you've
provided assistance during the diadem
times of crisis crisis information
systems this is what his story is about
how you talk with that and the next
example that I have right here I love
this one as well this is all set the
narration refugee center and this is
really really typical we have a lot of
this type of example and if you can
overturn Middle East you'll you know
that the roads are treacherous try and
get across many reasons one is that you
just don't have the resources to be no
fixing the asphalt all the time
especially if you've been a place for
this conflict there is no mortar since
shell is so clever there's big you think
we have potholes are obviously I wish to
see what it's like over there actually
that and they're not the best drivers
it's really really crazy trying to get
across the street and the other part of
it is that just a lot of people with
disabilities when you're in a crisis
environment especially like in the cabin
see when you go there a lot of people
who have problems with mobility and love
you with lost limbs if you're older and
you
vision problems you're hearing a pair
and things like that there's not a lot
of support there okay you just can't go
out just get a wheelchair people catch
the most amazing wheelchairs that they
put together just incredible engineering
feats so one of the things I've found
working with young people they're just
fantastic at identifying the didn't get
the help that are needed in society and
a lot of those stories are about helping
the elderly helping people with
disabilities if the orphans people who
don't have family support them in
structures around them and they tell us
in their stories how they help other
people and how they would design
technology apps and stuff like that to
helping others so that's what's going on
that particular story see some more
gotcha ins alright so then I looked at
these stories and come back and look at
all the stuff you know so how this is
really powerful so then when I went back
in November UNHCR said yes it's come
back don't work with the children
somewhere without I want to do something
different these stories seemed you know
a little bit sad what we do so for this
next trip we went back and I wanted to
do what I call magic genius ICT
weight-bearing devices and for this
particular one I love this activity
because this time was a to spec sheets
together and again i love the lego
foundation I know you guys have a lot of
Lego out there I saw right and this
particular one and it was really
indebted right yeah irshad young yeah I
was really indebted to the Google
response team here and if some of the
ideas that we're talking about with work
amazing work they've been doing over
lesbos with the Google refugee
information hub looking at
misinformation disinformation and things
and thinking about what types of ideas
would younger no kids put together no
for helping other so that's the
questions that we put in this bag shape
we asked them wonder what would you
design for somebody else who would this
device before what types of things would
it do and then we didn't curtail their
imaginations in any way we didn't ask
them you know what would it be built out
of X Y or Z or anything we'd have to
wide open
American Thomas L could be this shape or
with that shape it could be at plastic
all colors would have gave and before
where they did things individually mr.
I've time I let them work whatever size
kooky wanted to use it was in twos or
threes and we worked with about a
hundred forty-five 150 years and I got
61 designs and if it's were just the
most amazing things and magic
instruments Oh for heaters are all kinds
of classes robots yeah this is my
favorites these are magic glasses that
team designs designed a team of girls
that you see there in the photo and what
do you guys think these glasses do
hopefully you can see them baby well
these are glass is designed to design
for seeing if you have illness in your
body so you put them on and you can see
you know where your the other person is
hurting and the glasses also allow you
to cure the disease one of the things
that we do differently in this
particular activity was I brought along
the Fuji max reversed yeah it's right
here and one of the reasons I want to do
this because she knows like where our
phones of course did not take selfies
and I couldn't I couldn't take a cameras
with me there because you wouldn't
necessarily it's such a low resource
environment you don't know what's going
to work normally I still wanted them to
have the capacity to be able to take
pictures so i thought i saw these little
authorities not that well let's try it
and then when I got there just super
expensive live one photo cause a dollar
so expensive but I brought I think it's
like six of the cameras in true colors
and I got there and I realized that now
these kids some of them have never had a
boat on themselves or skin year since
you've had a photo and we have one
driving ban truck for our group
and that is used first and I find that
when you live by that it makes
everything in your life really really
simple it's really simple and good make
sure that every young person had a photo
that they could take back to their
Caravan you stood in tents of course not
everybody's moved into a caravan for
locking diminutive caravans and make
sure that everybody in mind I had an
image of course known behold what did
what they do they started taking through
Sophie's everywhere right there taking
selfies with their friends I think
there's more pictures for me in the camp
are we doing anybody else now right and
then they had the option as well to glue
the other photos onto their design unto
their spec sheets which is what I was
kind of hoping might happen and no the
whole that's what they started to do but
it's one of the most empowering parts
this design activity oh yeah this is a
magic car in case you're wondering and
it can take you anywhere yeah this one
is really important of course because
you get around the camp quit up and the
kids don't go to school especially the
girls is dangerous do they always want
to go a half day if you're a girl you go
in the morning and in the afternoon you
go to an NGO if you're away you go in
the afternoon then you don't fix digit
just to have to but any time only you
you want to go to sports cool cat found
kept a but only know half the kids the
camp at those cool so anyway that's that
but the idea with these all of their
magic designs had a very whimsical
quality to them because they all igual
helpful hope in the future building
things so just to kind of kind of kind
of wrap things up here and amazing
amazing bindings we've been privileged
to work with youth all over the place
when I work with youth and saturate the
first thing I do is kind of an
infographics presentation working with
the NGO staff he translate for me I'm
like a beginner of Arabic and explain to
them you know why I'm back what I
learned the last time and I explained to
them that you know is actually you if
they're like youth everywhere they're
macing it using technology you talk
about what we're gonna be doing
and this is one of the most powerful I
days these years have lived through so
much their families have and they're
just so resilient and the NGO staff in
the UNHCR work with can psychologist is
say to me you know Karen what are you
noticing what is different from just a
few months a few months now as you can
see people starting to thank gardens the
things like that and it's just the hope
in the East youth this is one thing that
I'm adamant that thinking is not the
future of the Middle East now we're
going to make a difference there how
instrument change if you look at the
migrant refugee crisis a lot of people
have gone to Northern Europe I'm you
know the win Canada the United States
hopefully things are gonna change here
Nolan have more you know humanitarian
response because I actually call myself
no humanitarian researcher really
believe in that well there's a reason
that these kids are staying near the
banners of error is because they want to
return oh you want to return to Syria
it's really once today this is the
future of the Middle East right and
working with these kids with education
especially with the girls this is where
the difference is going to be made we
talked about crisis response we talked
about no education we talked about
health care we talked about a lot of
hooks for parents this is where the
differences and one of the things i
found just amazing is he noticed a
design archetypes I have so many designs
for robots I'm so many designs for
watches and the glasses and everything
but how the kids can to operationalize
them by the affordances differ and these
guys have somewhat to creativity and
just so much desire to help and the
girls especially can you can you talk
about some examples of how that's
different a deserted bridge yeah yeah so
like you talk about robots and we work
with like a youthful miamor it's another
example of the country's it was just the
horrible stuff Noah blade in Seattle and
that's some of those kisses no time look
at you can't settings and no working
with us in Seattle and they talk about
how they want a robot that will stay
there the homeless in Seattle and help
look
sure their grandparents their so forth
no do more at home base type things and
then we find that in this picture right
here well here's a robot and they talk
about how they want the robot to be all
ready to help them with education no or
maybe to help them with child type
activities you know so it's sooner idea
of having somebody and in order Norfolk
robot something you know there are
artificial intelligence and things like
that but the actual affordances of what
it will do for you will differ another
great example is what you mentioned of
the glasses no because you think the
google glass it was great and I guess it
took the gold alas is actually really
good one or like you love an Apple watch
I love the kids that we work with in
Seattle are exposed to media so they
know what these things are there a youth
in the camp don't they don't know what
google glasses right they don't know
what an Apple watches but they still
think of these things not I mean and gig
and then when you ask them I've read
along my book here on the binder I have
all of the inspect sheets copies of them
and as well as our analysis is it one of
my colleagues the Syrian cesarean
information scientist which is great for
the position ality of analyzing all the
data and it's just really really neat
when they talk about fusing no Syrian
cultural values but how they'd like to
use these technologies to we reimagine
we envision their futures for helping
other people around them now some of
them lives to tempe to talk about
insects safety being able to catch
criminals things i'd catch bad things
event from happening making sure that
people have really really good
information so we took a lot of things
pop out that we hadn't seen about from
our data that we've been no clacton UCL
i just wanted to say this is wait did
have several robots in the data set and
this particular robot is a helper
this robot would be available to look
after kids while their mothers are away
so this is kind of an example where this
design either sucks like an existing you
know technology of the complex is very
different this context kind of reveals
the need that exists in the community
and that need is different in zachary
than it would be you know in here in the
Bay Area in Seattle message huge need be
having a hundred births a week who looks
after those kids and this girls having
the kids frankly young young young young
young and they need livelihoods that's
one of the big things you can charge
Griffin I go back and marched forth they
know you and they want us to figure out
starting just one district just 12
districts learn start in district 7 and
working with the youth how can we help
them create blog ebooks for the women
there such as social networking in
general GIS problem figure out how to do
things because the women just can't walk
into it being a Muslim community the
women can't just walk into any space or
sign up you can't go out not add to grow
themselves in some areas and information
problem we need to use involved with it
we ought to do the research what are
they so startups or aunt if some things
that's right here without oldest oh yeah
the word started with the thought right
yeah I call them game changers kids
their game changers so it can you talk a
little of what what yeah so I do yeah I
can't stare at our school because a
google search out of this the ultimate
startup just a couple guys right and
that's how I think about all the work
that we do when I get the kids working
in pairs and the the girls themselves
that we have one Gupta culture cells
futurist butterflies right and that's
basically what we have here we have so
many designs that we want to go back and
new topics that we want to go back and
get some designing around ok picture
from the camp so we're we're hoping
content I coming here today to be able
to bring to our Googlers to get your
know Fabolous which ideas and how we can
do some of these things around building
capacity for education
Crisis Response never that first images
show to know about know Christ
situations in Syria because that's
probably going to be continuing these
things they're not going to be going
away and I started even within the
campus all this crisis cultural memory
is a big one you've told us how they
needed to have smartphones that would
enable them to you know capture all the
memories from people living in Syria
what's going on right now so that people
could you know continue to you know keep
these things together and lobby who
doesn't mention is a really big one yeah
so we want to build some of these
devices and we were hoping to get some
ideas from you guys here's an example of
the one of the devices the one on the
right fourteen-year-old boy created it
and it's a phone as you can see but the
magical feature of this phone would be
that it would allow this boy to preserve
memories to help him I think he wrote I
would help my grandfather capture
memories preserve memories because he's
losing his memory and the enjoyment of
the channel is then destroyed everything
is yeah in the designs over and over
again we saw that the kids wanted you
know large large capacity for storing
data and their devices you know large
memory ability to capture images and
this idea of preserving stories
preserving memories came up over and
over again so we thought well and we
want to build some of these devices but
thought this is a good good example and
we were kind of inspired by the app
StoryCorps I don't know if you guys are
familiar with it but basically yeah it
allows you to record record stories
interview somebody and record those
stories and then share them or if you
will if you don't want to you know keep
them to yourself and this we're very
whipping this app would really lend
itself to kind of been adapted to
Zachary because I would allow to capture
these stories and memories but there are
definitely
challenges and we have challenges but
training translation we need to make
sure everything's translated into Arabic
and getting that people to participate
guarantee you wanna talk some more about
some of the challenges they are storing
data how and basically how this data how
all these where all these stories will
be stored all their recordings and how
the community exactly we would be able
to access it so we are thinking about
these questions now in preparation for
Karen's trip that's coming up in March
what we're hoping you know maybe you
guys have some ideas about how to make
it a reality and how to think some of
these challenges are there any questions
on GBC for comments ideas I was
wondering if you could clarify the term
you use Wayfarer information we share
yeah well my parents the term it's an
area that we can working in many many
years may use it to describe how people
that help other people to information
and technology so in the past have use
terms such as MIDI Ares sometimes these
brokers sometimes we use trumpet guide
sport but i tend to use like like using
your weight barren because it implies
kind of suggests that people are just
acting on behalf of other people
sometimes to do it with intent for
example you I might know that you'd need
to know something yes I'll proxy go and
do it but other times I might just do it
worth or serendipity and they'll bump
into some information and i'll pass it
on back to you you know so it kind of a
ones like the full gavel and what's
really interesting kind of unique to
young people there were teenagers
especially with immigrants when you move
to a new area your needs are substantial
if you need to know how to probably how
to navigate the language new language to
learn you have to situate it learn about
getting a job somewhere to live the
single stop immigration have to contend
with it talk about learn with
culture probably needs the rest of your
family there's the health care that's
insurance you know what I mean there's a
ton of stuff going on and that's
assuming that you're probably the
country even legally right and then you
got of trauma that you're dealing with
as well and with our research shows that
young people seem to be the most adept
at navigating a new society and there's
reasons for research that based on what
I've learned information science is that
the kids go to school first and because
they're plugged into the system and
having younger brains they pick up
language first private secretary
psychology grab brain science shows us
that kids are most adept at learning new
languages want you to two languages it's
easier to pick up the third language
know things like that and kids tend to
be able to make friends more easily
raised especially for older women more
barriers we're trying to get out and
you're too busy trying to find a job so
the kids kiss have more mobility so this
Specter the question about the wavering
part of it and then we also find the
kids are really good at this concept
berry picking interpersonal berry
picking for you maybe be befriended by
their teacher or somebody else for
school they'll get that knowledge being
effective a parent and then they go out
and don't quite another adult to another
mentor connected connected learning
framework that I mentioned and just so
they kind of go around they get all this
and couldn't nuggets of information that
between back to the family and they'll
make no other kids get involved so
they're just really really good way
Barry and it's really complex because
with the kids will find that they'll do
this way theory but it's navigating for
their parents and really complex
information settings such as banking or
could be health care situations so ill
if you could be providing information
back about situations that the kid
really doesn't really know that much
about so such as diabetes you know and
they don't understand your medical
treatments and they could easily
misinterpret at that extra zero that
need to be it needed to be added for
that prescription or something you know
what I'm saying victim love this
translation could occur before around
but a research number and I'll share the
kids played extremely vital roles
especially you know immigrant refugee
youth in supporting not the all the
changes that are going on in society
today and they do a lot of unpaid work
especially in social systems such as
schools because most teachers nice
people in language look how big class
masseur how different they are known as
the other kids who are doing all this
work mazen work the question about the
app that you guys yes yes oh my
collective missus yeah I think story
court do you guys know StoryCorps it's
like a really beautiful some project
yeah so um just like a quick background
it's partly sponsored by NPR National
Public Radio so a lot of these stories
that people just regular people will
record across the country the US and
then NPR will share them and they're
very moving like they'll put a radio
booth they have one in the Genesis no
public library and they had one out of
smithsonian for a while and like you
hear stories of like conversations
between grandparents and their grandkids
and family stories that you've never
heard but they've never heard before and
it's really moving to hear their
response of things so i think it's like
such a strong fit four people recording
their stories and also i think
translating those stories to people
elsewhere because the crisis is so bad
and i don't know if anyone can really
digest that information until they hear
at first hand but i wonder like with the
StoryCorps app being such a like an
established presents like have you
contacted them or NPR and yes so
stressed i love the introduction that
you can destroy present it's a
StoryCorps let's see one week 10 award
just just last year and it came out of a
knight Foundation proposal right and so
we've been talking to StoryCorps in New
York and they love this drink one loves
what we're doing and I was talking with
their head archivist yeah just a couple
of days ago and they love what we're
doing gave a one
they want to see us do this and they
have that they don't have this narrow
brick right okay and you want to see it
translated into other languages they get
requests all the time for a StoryCorps
don't do bead and your trip implemented
in international context yeah so they're
behind us all the way but like in the
store itself is an NGO right choice so
we're thinking now about how you know we
might like this not really adapt this
just after eight yeah and there's yeah a
lot of hurdles but like you said it's
such a good kid over all right what we
really want to do is I'd like to get
disconnected use YouTube as an archive
because we know that you youth love
YouTube we know that but we have
challenges example with training because
it's not narrow brick and it's one thing
to make it available what we have to
empower youth firsts going to them how
it all work and they pick it up really
quick there's no doubt about that not
work with the NGO staff there such as at
the International maple court as well as
that I rd I was talking with the not be
assistant director of camp just
yesterday and she was really really
excited about this and Amazon and gave
me 20 mobiles just last week so the fire
are once and the park to be had to go to
the camp and my colleague who Syrian
he's translating other stuff into Arabic
but I have to go there and I'm what I
want to do a march for that's just some
fun at work painted them how it all
works right you know the stuff and then
they're going to be camp in t.o I am see
them look after all the permissions know
with everybody for participating in the
interviewing that's going to be done and
we're going to help them pick out what
questions they want to ask a people and
then i'm going to leave the phones we're
just gonna leave the mobiles i'm leaving
them but i have to take about two things
it's the access question how am I going
to keep track of what interviews are
done is I have to think of it as a
resource planning to this right now
we're going to keep track of what
interviews the kids are doing notta me
because I'm going to have to just
register
them all you know moving bitch I googled
some Google bed this isn't like phone
one phone two on three phone or 18
phones we're going to keep to if trouble
chefs but in case you have fun at the
cam right so for 1.2 how this stuff and
I have no idea it was gonna be using
them because they're all going to be
shared you know that's gonna be social
right you know that it was much fun and
then we're going to do as he's some kind
of a logbook of what interviews are done
on the phones and then we got to get
access to that data to those to the
interviews we know the StoryCorps you
can chat with them that the interviews
can be uploaded to a desktop or
somewhere to the cloud but they mostly
saved on YouTube is going to put it on a
machine then in yourself out it to you
too so we're going to have to create a
channel or something like that and then
everyone what I have movie night at the
camp so everybody can gather round other
districts or wherever they want to do in
the middle areas and watch their
families watch their interviews that
they do something my ipod and we wants
to hear the interviewers are going to be
in Arabic so we're going to have to do
some loose translation of them so we can
get a sense of what's being said so that
we're thinking with it and we only have
18 and the the UN they want us to do
more a lot more than 18 you want to see
what people want to do with this for
it's going to go you guys have any other
thoughts so I noticed that with the
designs a lot of them were kind of
designed collaboratively do you think
the solution will be inherently
collaborative yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
well I'm just gonna bring the main stack
right and I said amazon gave you the
phones last week anonymous way of making
this with yes um yes alright so we have
some phones and yeah so we're going over
to this is just a pilot and I'm gonna be
making multiple trips over the next year
we'll see how this part goes with the
see what the community runs does
everything has to be a community-based
community-driven if you because this is
co design work yeah right
and the you know see what happens with
that who knows maybe they might decide
to get into using these for the lively
hoods but the women that I was talking
about in district 7 with youth ambala
that wouldn't have employment looking
like that yeah make a new yard no
memories install write another to crisis
response part you're 11 and I'm kidding
so many opportunities guess the use of
social media they're like you mentioned
Facebook all you kidding his design
sheets just talking about he and the
youth on her own came up with names for
their own blue soap that's right and I
think it's a future builders group turns
out that some of those guys look after
the social media pages for the weekend
so are there what social media platforms
are they using in a facebook human
Facebook's anything they have them on
Facebook pages but they also have the
and you know YouTube that channels as
well and they post all of their own
videos i play before you start again the
NGOs if you look at it as soon as we
have a lot of refugee volunteers video
kimchi oh but you posteromedial Imam a
connection like oh yum data can Jensen
yeah i'm not sure where I left boat left
off facebook was there like I said back
in November right and the it's supposed
to be happening I know that it's a
partnership set up I think Mike sounds
part of that as well how many google
because i think it well it's to
Facebook's benefit to I'm like yet about
other companies like Instagram yes like
not only is it empowering for the
community but also like through hashtags
are sharing like that message then get
out cuz its own likeness gorilla
newsfeed to show the missile to ya to
show that the bench oh um write um
okay you can go to the I just have a
quick follow-up on ya social media um
how much content do actually like
generate thanks all that and what kind
of content versus just consuming just
want to go to this so the question
question is own how what are the kids
winter internship I thought versus
consuming how are you mr. than
generating on and that's a great
question for a future research habitat
baby I know they're definitely
generating content and there was
generating is the question is how much
content over youth generating yeah yeah
that's a great question to ask when I go
back according to the UNHCR they had no
idea it's not first trip that will be
wet an s venture you didn't even know
what percentage were using mobile phones
right or what they're even going online
what they were doing online to ask them
about being adopted as a content I know
that they're definitely actively
involved because I've been talking about
the ones who are no one what they're
doing I'd be very interesting right way
I asked them to watch types of things
would you be interested in doing things
like that this is no doubt I have a big
small indicator seven but I don't know
that it's tentative yeah definitely has
