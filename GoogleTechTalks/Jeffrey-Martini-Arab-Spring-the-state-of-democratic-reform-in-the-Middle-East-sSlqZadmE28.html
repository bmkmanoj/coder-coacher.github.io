Google team here in the Google Los
Angeles office whether you're joining us
live or on YouTube we welcome you and
hope that you enjoyed this presentation
I'm very pleased today to introduce our
speaker Jeff martini who who joins us
from the rain corporations of Washington
office mr. martini is a middle east
analyst at Rand his research is on the
political reform in the Arab world with
a specific focus on North Africa topic
of his talk today we'll focus on Arab
Spring and its aftermath and the
prospects for democracy in Egypt Libya
and elsewhere in North Africa please
join me in welcoming Jenna well thank
you Chris for that kind introduction and
thanks to Google for hosting me and also
thanks to the folks who are here in the
room taking time out of your days to
engage in this discussion so as Chris
mentioned we're going to talk a bit
about the Arab Spring two years on from
the onset but I don't want to do that in
abstract terms I want to root that in US
interest and the strategies that we've
employed to try to advance those
interests in the Middle East so if you
bear with me i'm going to do a little
bit of background so if we start from
this this point of what our US interests
in the Middle East a lot of Americans I
think tend to collapse US interests in
the Middle East to energy security and
that is certainly at or near the top of
us strategic interests in the Middle
East but it's not the totality of it so
we're also concerned with things like
the stability and security of our
partners and certainly at the top of
that list would be Israel and like it or
not we're the security guarantor for the
Arab Gulf states for the Gulf
Cooperation Council states of six GCC
states and then in addition to energy
security and the stability and security
of our allies we also have an interest
in military access to the region both to
respond to contingencies in the Middle
East and then to respond to
contingencies farther afield so if you
take Egypt for instance
its strategic importance is that it
links the eastern Mediterranean via the
Red Sea to the Persian Gulf so if you
want to flow forces from Mediterranean
to support contingencies in the Persian
Gulf of which there happens to be a lot
of contingencies in the Persian Gulf you
need military access through Egypt in
even farther afield for example the US
couldn't have prosecuted Operation
Enduring Freedom the war in Afghanistan
without over flight over Egypt and then
finally post 9-11 we've put more
priority on counterterrorism goals both
for protecting the homeland and again
for protecting the security of our
partners in the region and many of you
probably heard President Obama talking
about that yesterday so that's kind of
the core of us interest in the region so
what are the strategies that we've
employed to try to advance those
interest they too have varied over time
so if you go back to the immediate post
World War two period we defined our
vital interest is trying to contain the
influence of the Soviet Union in the
Middle East and the way that we did that
was to set up a treaty organization of
buffer states that was supposed to keep
soviet influence out it didn't work so
well then later on in the Nixon
administration we adopted a strategy
called twin pillars in which we are a
lot relying on at that time our ally
Iran and Saudi Arabia as the two kind of
regional hegemon to provide stability in
the free flow of resources now you all
know what happened to Iran and 78 79 and
that strategy proved unsustainable and
we've had others I won't go through them
in the same detail but we had the Carter
doctor and dual containment and so forth
so we've had these various strategies
culminating in direct military
interventions in the 90 91 Gulf War and
then again in the 2003 invasion of Iraq
and if you think about these strategies
that's a you know kind of a quick survey
of history over the past 60 years I
think you'll find they have two
characteristics one is we've made some
bargains with authoritarian regimes for
the sake of stability frankly and then
to
we've disproportionately used the
military tool kit so now if you could I
want you to put yourselves in the
timeframe of late 2010 so this is on the
eve of the Arab Spring and I want to I
want you to put yourself in the shoes of
the US administration what is the US
administration how are they viewing the
Middle East on the eve of the Arab
Spring so Mohammedan Bouazizi that fruit
vendor hasn't self-immolated yet but we
are withdrawing forces combat forces
from Iraq we're winding down the war in
Afghanistan and we are weary of all
things Middle East we're actually trying
to inoculate ourselves from the region
so you have defense secretary Robert
Gates saying something to the effect of
any future defense secretary who advises
the president to send a land army to the
Middle East or Asia should have his head
checked I'll repeat that again should
have his head checked and this is when
you have people start talking about the
Asia pivot or in Washington we're not
allowed to use the term pivot anymore we
have to use a euphemism it's rebalancing
but all that is code for containing the
rise of what we see is our near pier in
China reassuring our Asian allies and if
you will playing with the winners of the
international system the emerging
economies of Asia the states that are
doing well instead of mucking around in
the Middle East and then what happens
mohammed emwazi self-immolate seeeeee
manali Falls and Tunisia our
long-standing ally Mubarak falls in
Egypt in Libya you have conflict that
leads to the top laying and then the
killing of Qaddafi Saleh is forced to
resign in Yemen I you added a revolt put
down rather violently in Bahrain Jordan
and Morocco or on a slow boil any of
this terrible civil conflict in Syria so
at just the time when we're trying to
distance ourselves from the Middle East
there's historic changes going on the
metaphor I use is on the eve of the Arab
Spring the Middle East is a lot like
your kind of needy friend whose phone
calls you don't want to return but you
gotta return them at this point there's
there's really manyam
until change going on so I just want to
use that as a backdrop for talking about
the Arab Spring itself and kind of keep
that in mind so what are some initial
reflections on the Arab Spring now two
years on from its two-plus years on from
its start one observation I'd make is
there still identity politics still
matter there's still kind of a salience
or resonance to identity politics
although it manifests itself in
different ways in different states so if
you take for example Syria it manifests
itself through ethnic sectarian conflict
there you have a minority led Alawite
regime that's putting down a largely
Sunni Arab revolt and there's a
sectarian dimension to the conflict in
Bahrain as well of course similar you
have a minority led regime and an
uprising by a repressed majority it
manifests itself in different ways for
example in Libya and Yemen where the
identity conflicts aren't sectarian so
much as they are tribal and regional so
if you take Libya for instance the
leading political party is is led by a
guy named Mahmoud Jibril he's a leading
figure in the war fall a tribe the war
fall a tribe was the base of the Qaddafi
regime it's a tribal conflict it or you
have people in Libya for example people
from the south who live in sub ha who
self-identify as part of a Zen which is
the south of Libya versus people who
self-identify with barca which is the
east of Libya or people who self
identify with the center Tripoli and you
have similar dynamics in Yemen where you
have these tribal divides and regional
divides and in fact Yemen has fought to
civil wars over that in its modern
history and then kind of the final
manifestation of identity politics and
something that's really been sharpened I
think by the Arab Spring is the
polarization between Islamists and
non-islamists or in some states
Islamists and people who are avowedly
secular and here it's most pronounced in
Egypt so for instance you have Saleh
fest many of whom would like to deny
legitimacy
to political actors who self-identify as
secular and by the way the secularists
are just as doctrinal in their views
they view the Islamists people that the
women who are Mahasabha who wear the
hijab or the Salafists with their beards
as backward in anti-modern and they're
not offering themselves as partners to
them either so you have this pronounced
political polarization anyway that's
that's the end of the first observation
that's on kind of the identity politics
that I think has been sharpened by the
Arab Spring the second point I want to
talk about and one that might
particularly resonate with folks at
Google is the challenge that is faced by
revolutionary groups to transition from
mobilizing opposition to the regime to
being active in participants in the new
political order and I challenge you to
tell me one Arab Spring state where the
revolutionaries that drove this change
have taken power they have not in all
the cases so for instance if we dig down
into Egypt two key groups one was the
april six movement that was largely an
online group that's how they organized
young group people who look like me in
their 30s and their 20s another group
was we are all hallows i heed that was a
it's named after a young man who is who
died of allegedly but most people would
say definitely of police brutality and
alexandria and he became sort of the
mohammed emwazi of Egypt people rallied
around that now these groups are not
well represented in the new political
order who took advantage of the
revolution first it was the old guard of
the military in the form of the Supreme
Council of the Armed Forces they were
the caretaker government and they were
the old regime and now more recently was
the Muslim Brotherhood who yes
historically was an opposition group it
was sort of a johnny-come-lately to the
revolution didn't jump on it at first if
you look at Libya who's in power not
that many people follow Libya but the
head of state is a guy named Mohammed
magaria his prime minister is ellie's a
den the prime minister under the
transitional government is a guy named
abdul rahim
beebe all these people were exiles that
made their name in opposition to the
state in that in the 80s they are
generation removed from the
revolutionaries and very disconnected in
fact from the reality there I meet with
these these folks many of whom by the
way we're in exile in California they
were academics in California and people
in Libya call them dual SIM cards
because you know they change out their
sim cards when they go back and forth
these are the people that have you know
benefited or filled the vacuum caused by
the revolutions not the people who are
catalysts for change the third
observation i want to make and then i'm
going to bring it full circle to u.s.
foreign policy but the third observation
are kind of internal dynamics from the
Arab Spring is that prior to the onset
of this phenomenon we were being fed
this trope or this sort of this
boogeyman by the old regimes that it's
us or the Islamists it's us or chaos or
as mubarak famously put it you know it's
me or the abyss basically setting up
this false choice of you've got to
accept this regime or you're going to
have havoc in the region and I think
what we can say two years on from the
Arab Spring is it was just that it was a
scarecrow it was a boogeyman it does not
come to pass so for instance I don't
want to sound like an apologist for the
Muslim Brotherhood in fact I'm quite
critical of the organization in terms of
some of their social policies and some
of the ways that they've managed the
transition on judicial independence or
press freedom for instance but the
Muslim Brotherhood has not moved to
abrogate gant David last time I looked
Camp David is still operational the 1979
peace agreement is still in effect
Mohamed Morsi helped negotiate a
ceasefire in Gaza he went to Iran over
fears that you would make nice with Iran
instead he went there and and castigated
the regime for supporting Assad you
could say that Mohamed Morsi who's the
leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and the
president of Egypt has been more
pragmatic in his foreign policy than
Mubarak so this really was a scarecrow
and you could make similar observations
for instance about the Islam
that took power and in Tunisia they're
called aneta the the Renaissance
movement they've also been very
pragmatic in their foreign policy so now
I want to transition back to what I was
talking about in the beginning and that
is sort of how the Arab Spring plays
into the evolution of the way that
foreign policy establishment in this
country looks at the Middle East and the
strategies that we've employed to try to
advance our interests so I think in some
ways it's an opportunity because if you
look back since that sort of post-world
war two moment that I started with the
United States has been gate engaging
with a very narrow elite in the region
and a very narrow elite which is totally
out of step with with their public's so
let's take the Egypt example again if
you politically exclusion of Islamists
economically selling off state-owned
enterprises privatization deregulation
in foreign policy i would say bluntly
basically they auctioned off their
foreign policy to the highest bidder
that was an easy partner to deal with
but it was totally out of step with the
Egyptian people let's take the Libya
example there is no historical
continuity whatsoever between Qadhafi's
bizarro leadership in the green book and
the Libyan people so finally we have a
chance to engage with regimes which
while not entirely representative of
their people are getting closer and I
think that's an opportunity and these
regimes themselves hold the promise of
maybe at some point generating popular
legitimacy and not having to rely on
coercion as their means of rule so
that's an opportunity I think the
central challenge however is how the
United States reconciles its principles
its values with its strategic interests
in the region and in the early part of
the Arab Spring it was kind of easy it
was easy because the states that fell or
at least the first state that fell was
not was peripheral to us strategic
interests so god bless the Tunisians I
love Tunisia I've been there but frankly
they don't matter for us grand strategy
so it was very easy for the u.s. to
throw in with the opposition if you will
Ben Ali the Falls we shrug who cares
you know to nisha's removed from the
arena of strategic competition that is
the Middle East or so they thought Egypt
was more central but I think realists in
Washington realized that Egypt strategic
interests are with with maintaining the
cold peace with Israel and so forth and
so we're able to stomach that but as the
Arab Spring developed there was times
when our principles are values were
really in stark contrast to our narrow
strategic interests in Bahrain is the
key case here so there you have a
minority lead very repressive regime
that was cracking down on the majority
Shia population or oppressed majority
and by the way their demands weren't
that crazy they were asking for
constitutional monarchy and they weren't
even framing their opposition and
sectarian terms but the u.s. wasn't
going to go out on a limb there because
that's where the Fifth Fleet is
stationed Bajarin is a critical state
for what we see is the central challenge
in the region and that is preventing
Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons in
the near term and should they acquire
deterring a potential nuclear Iran we
have NAB sent a naval Central Command
forward there NAB sent the Fifth Fleet
is there it's a tougher choice and at
the end of the day we decided to side
with our strategic interests over our
principles and values that's exactly
right that's exactly right and so I
think going forward we're going to be
faced with this challenge and it's how
we reconcile that you know Hillary
Clinton gave I mean I empathize with her
she's in a difficult position explaining
US policy she gave probably an
unsatisfying response and saying look
we're going to deal with these states on
a case-by-case basis but that was code
for you know there was some states or
was pretty easy Tunisia Libya because we
couldn't imagine anything worse than
Qaddafi although the instability that
followed might be worse frankly and then
where it's hard in places like Bahrain
we're going to have a pause and so I'll
end the sort of you know talking on that
note and I'm happy to take questions
hear your thoughts the engine reform
comes from below the wheel is region and
you talk about the US vs china model
where we try to steer strategically and
they try to profit opportunistically
from and limit themselves very strictly
to their own self-interest and right so
I could correct me if I'm wrong but a
sort of his i distilled those questions
the first one was more common about you
know why not more discussion of other
extra regional powers like russia that
have influence in the region and the
fact that a lot of these conflicts
really our proxy conflicts between a
bigger powers and then the second
question I think had to do with China's
model in their ability in some ways to
kind of outmaneuver the United States is
that fair working with whatever player
right
okay you know I think those are both
good points and you know your first
point resonates particularly on Syria
because I see Siri as a regional
conflict a proxy conflict really the
same way that I would have said the 2006
war and in Lebanon between his flow and
Israel was really a proxy conflict
between the United States and Israel his
bow and Iran for instance but let's take
that the present example of Syria you do
have Russia's a very important player
there the primary arms supplier for the
Assad regime but you also have other
emerging regional powers like Iran codes
force on the ground and a training role
and then you have his fella who's
fighting and dying alongside the Assad
regime we've known this for quite a
while but you know it's just coming out
now with this it you know very publicly
in this coup say our attack in which
hizbollah forces were involved and then
on the other side we tend to ignore it
but it's also a proxy conflict we have
the Sunni Arab and non-arab but Sunni
states like so you have turkey and you
have Saudi Arabia Qatar those states
supporting the opposition and you have
the United States to so far with
non-lethal aid but certainly a wink and
a nod for the lethal aid that's flowing
and we are vetting the forces that the
lethal aid is flowing to so I take your
point I think it's a good one on the
second one I have to defer a bit because
I really narrowly focus on the Arab
world but I'll say something off the
cuff and then the China experts can
correct me I do think that you know
China's playing you know is playing
their strongest hand and that they
haven't been sucked into these conflicts
as you said they sort of narrowly
pursued their strategic interests and
often in purely economic terms I think
they've also been very smart in that
instead of trying to convey up of the
United States conventionally they've
tried to kind of go to the next level
matts space and cyber and so we see that
with cyber attacks on the US for
instance so this is sort of like the
third world model of not going to
landlines but going straight to the cell
phone I think China is doing that its
military development it's not going to
catch up to the u.s. in terms of power
projection from
craft carriers that realizes that just
going straight to space and cyber I
think that's smart they are they are
building they are not totally giving up
unconventional again not my area of
expertise they're not totally building
giving up on conventional capabilities
for example they're trying to build a
stealth fighter they're building
something that's called a carrier killer
so they aren't giving up on that but
their emphasis i think is on space and
cyber to do that to you know sort of
jump to the next level but III don't
want to get too bogged down in China I
just want to sort of validate the point
that was made which is which i think is
a good one yeah but but really I do
narrowly focus on the Middle East
a lot of thinkers sleeping giant or the
Sunnis in general and inquiry I might
set up the Alliance of minorities the
Sunni Arabs with Turkey and Iran and the
Kurds and everybody who was afraid of
afraid of the Sunnis as it has a big
force now obviously this this has been
an oversimplification then and it is an
oversimplification now because they're
all sort of local concerns that cause
all sorts of weird you know weird
fellows like you know Hezbollah and
Hamas but you consider that this could
be like some is there a real concern
right now as the students become you
know throw off their minor the minority
dictators over them and become more
politically active that this will cause
some kind of something well I mean I
think it's important in the sense that
if you look right now at the Syrian
conflict for instance you have this very
repressive alaoui regime a minority
leader regime they're only about five
percent of the population and but the
other minority groups for example the
Christians and the Druze see that alaoui
regime is kind of a bulwark against
straight majoritarianism from the Sunni
Arab population which is about sixty
percent of the population so yes I think
the fears of minorities are holding back
a change in the region because these
regimes might be repressive even the
Mubarak regime the cops the Coptic
Christians in Egypt generally viewed the
Mubarak regime is sort of their
protectors and they to fear you know a
Muslim brotherhood-led state so i think
the fears of minorities is a check on
change in the region i think it's up to
the Sunni Arabs as the majority to say
look you know we're going to respect
minority rights we're not going to go
for straight majoritarianism but when
you have for example in Syria an
opposition bloc which includes should
Hutton uh Sarah who's been fighting the
Kurds in their free time and self
identifies with al-qaeda that's
not very you know it doesn't really play
Kate the minority so I do think it's
important I mean that's the
million-dollar question I I gave a
similar talk as as this one the other
night and I said you know maybe you can
imagine you don't know how many sort of
dissertations were being right written
on the durability of regimes in the
region on the eve of the Arab Spring you
know there's a theory that nothing was
going to change in the Middle East not
many people saw this coming now looking
back I mean it's a bit of a perfect
storm I think part of it is you know
there was part of it i think is growing
political consciousness in the region so
it was easier to control populations
when they didn't have access to
information against something that i
think would particularly interest this
google audience and so i think part of
this is you know in egypt traditionally
the regime was able to deliver if you
will deliver the rural areas they could
you know buy them off with you know
bread and bread and sugar and and that
was enough to get their votes I think
later as people got more access to
information it became sort of a more
volatile climate but I think there's
other sort you know there's economic
factors for instance you had a rampant
inflation in the right in the region i
think that was definitely a factor and
has been associated with previous
political uprisings just think there's a
bit of a perfect storm you had people
outraged over what were republics a name
that were operating as monarchies so you
know in Syria you had Hafez al-assad
turn over power to a son Bashar al-assad
that's a republic not a monarchy in
Egypt people thought that Hosni Mubarak
was angling to hand over power to his
son Gamal Mubarak same dynamic in Yemen
in Algeria you have Buddha felica who's
the president his brother is the one
that's supposed to be in line these are
all supposed to be Republic's they're
operating more like mo
on our keys and so I know that's not a
satisfactory answer but I really think
it's a confluence of things that came
together and and yeah no one I can say
that very few of my colleagues saw this
coming I think we all saw the potential
for instability but I would have been
one of those people making arguments for
the durability of the regime
understanding what I'm curious about is
where Egypt might be in say five years
time so when you co can stalk in in five
years I recognize that you know the US
strategic interest probably won't be
that different in that time frame but
where do you see what kind of changes do
you see them that we would make that the
u.s. book value that are sort of
non-military I guess what the rest of
the economy sort of the social system in
Egypt what do you see that okay so in
terms of Egypt itself if I'm lucky to be
lucky enough to be back at Google in
three to five years giving this talk I
think I'll say something like you know
one of the good news stories is while
the Muslim Brotherhood in Islamists more
broadly emerged as almost a new ruling
party a new dominant force in Egypt
almost taking the place of the old
National Democratic Party the old NDP
that dominated Egypt in the initial
period of the transition I think their
political star is actually waning a bit
and a political scientists who have done
comparative studies on Islamists and
so-called breakthrough elections when
there's political change or when they've
been excluded from participating in
elections and then they do they do
disproportionately well in the first
election and then they tend to fade over
time and that's because many of them
inherit one of my colleagues calls the
golden chalice or you know you've got
basically they've they've inherited
situation in Egypt where the economy of
foreign reserves have been cut in half
since the revolution you've got
insecurity they've inherited a
bureaucracy which never went away with
the revolution
actually disdains them and they have
trouble riding that horse if you will
and so I think the non-islamists in
Egypt well I still think the Muslim
Brotherhood will have a plurality in the
parliament in Egypt in three years I do
think that the non Islamist groups who
have caught up in a way and I think the
US will value the fact that Egypt will
be moving towards genuine multi-party
politics I'd but I do think they'll
still be plagued by a really tough
economy I wish that I wish that was in
the realm of the possible but I
personally don't think it is and here's
why the military who is the initial
caretaker government in the form of the
Supreme Council the Armed Forces the
scaf they step down but they stepped
down and what I think was a sort of
implicit bargain in which some of their
privileges would be preserved and one of
those key privileges was their role in
the economy and we saw this even
enshrined in the Constitution not so
much on the economic interests but on
their political interests so for example
a lot of people in Egypt wanted a
civilian Minister of Defense I like the
United States has that of course the
military wanted it to be a uniformed
officer that's what they got in the
Constitution they got a bunch of other
perks enshrined like they would control
the arms deals they would have limited
oversight over their budget and I think
implicit in this bargain is that they'll
be able to control their economic
activities and the other challenge is
the Egyptian while we tend to think of
the military making refrigerators which
is actually what they do food and
refrigerators how could that be
efficient the private sector in Egypt is
so corrupt and so inefficient that if
you talk to Egyptians they actually
think that the military is a model of
efficiency maybe it is in comparison to
the private sector there
so people actually want to buy the food
that's produced by the military partly
because they're there they're making
that food with conscript labor so they
can sell it you know it's a conscript
force those people work in the fields
they can sell it cheap but the Egyptians
actually think it's the high quality
food is made by the military electronics
and stuff not so much but people really
look to the military in Egypt is kind of
a vanguard and they still view them
through this prism of 1973 which for the
Egyptians is viewed as a historic
victory even though in the West we don't
think that and that this is the force
that restored the dignity of the country
so I think the military has a lot of
leeway their popularity ratings are
still eighty ninety percent so I don't
see them being reined in too much at
least in the near term
you know there's a big debate about this
to be simplistic about it the
demonstrators in the street they were
chanting bread freedom and social
justice so two of those three things are
aligned with what you just said I mean
social justice is code for
redistributive policies and bread is
code for you know having your needs met
so I think a lot of it was sort of this
economic motivation but freedom isn't
you know that that definitely whether
they saw this democracy or not they're
definitely chanting and asking for
freedom but I take your point I do think
a high birth rate i would add to that
delays in the age of marriage I mean
it's very tough to be an Arab male
because if you don't have a job you're
living under your parents roof you're
not going to get married and I probably
shouldn't say this on camera but if
you're not married you can't engage in
things that guys like to engage in in
the Arab world I mean you're you're
sullivant that is a tough position to be
and I mean there's there's people in
that position where 27 28 29 years old
imagine how frustrated you would be so I
think that definitely drives you know
drove some of the unrest and I do think
some of the solutions would be in
providing jobs and opportunities for
those people and one of the challenges
going forward is going to be the
mismatched expectations of youth in
what's possible it's particularly
pronounced actually next door and Libya
you know Libya sees itself as the next
Abu Dhabi because they have oil and gas
and so you go to Libya and there's youth
unemployment but it's actually sort of
voluntary there's jobs there's blue
collar jobs but they're being filled by
foreign workers by Moroccans and
Tunisians and people from outside the
region even so your broader point holds
though I do think there's a strong
economic basis that underlies this
unrest
change some combination of energy yeah I
do think that it's a very positive
development that the United States has
begun to wean itself of Middle East oil
and we have made progress on that and
the last decade or so it's a little more
complicated though in the sense that
when i say energy security it's not just
for the united states but it's also for
our allies our allies in the Far East in
particular and they happen to be more
dependent upon Middle East oil than we
are so it's not just weaning ourselves
off Middle East oil but Japan whose
security we are very invested in for
instance and as I tried to frame it I
think you that is sort of the key US
strategic interest but it's a little
broader than that in the sense that I
mean the Middle East geo strategic
importance it's simplistic but
frequently you can't get to point a
without point B without you know kind of
crossing through there it's just a
transit point and and we are very
concerned about stability of
long-standing allies in the region so I
think even if we achieve a greater
independence from Middle East energy
we're still going to be kind of sucked
into the region but I do think that
trend a line of weaning ourselves off it
off it gives us a little more leverage
and gives us a little more choice about
what conflicts to or to not intervene in
woof I mean potentially in very
momentous ways you know political
scientists tend to think about the
general bargain in the region is it's
called the ronte a state of the state of
seen as distributing rents among the
population to basically by people's
political loyalty and if they don't have
the rents to distribute they don't have
legitimacy its legitimacy by results
it's the fact that the Saudi regime is
basically buying your loyalty the
Bahraini regime the Kuwaiti regime is
buying your loyalty if you know that
commodity wasn't so expensive I think
those regimes would be in tough shape
saw a water crisis yeah no water is a
key issue for Syria free rock for the
Nile Basin region for Egypt and it's
definitely a potential source of
conflict i will say the region's aware
of it too so you have Egypt you have the
new leadership in Egypt that's reached
out to Sudan Ethiopia other states in
the Nile Basin to try to get a handle on
on the water issues I think it's it's
even more difficult with Iraq and Syria
because both states are in turmoil so
how they think about sharing the water
and in the Levant that is then reaching
Iraq the top of the Gulf but you're
right I water could definitely be
another source of conflict in the region
yeah this order's all of us just about
money and stability because today
dissemination is more expensive but it's
cheap enough and they said that we
spending annually the same prices two
fighter jets will provide all the water
required for the Israelis and
Palestinians and the Jordanians kind of
put together so you're not talking about
it away some huge thing make sure that
well that's a good I mean part of the
advantage there for the sate States you
site is their small I mean you've just
sighted three very small states in the
Middle East but I can state site others
that are very populous so I me you cited
Jordan Israel and Palestine Egypt has 80
million people it's a different order of
magnitude Algeria people don't think of
this Algerian Morocco I think that about
65 million people so you know we have
regions with big population basis where
the water problem I don't think we'll be
as easily solved and then the Gulf
states of course they worry about desal
plants as a potential target should they
be pulled into a target with Iran as
they build up their ballistic missile
capability
speak to the potential rise of turkey is
a geopolitical force and especially if
Syria in such a way to maximize turkeys
power would that be a stabilizing you
know the Turkish model I mean people
mean different things by the Turkish
model but it's an interesting one I
think they've been successful in
integrating Islamists into the political
sphere so that AKP party the okapi party
is I think become more of a status quo
actor in Turkey and that's a good thing
and probably advance democratization
there although the military
establishment certainly felt like
they've been hamstrung by the AKP and
then turkey of course is a rising power
in terms of its growing economy and
people in the region in the Arab world
do look to Turkey as a model both on the
inclusion of Islamists and on you know
being a no kidding regional power that
said I mean we can see turkey right now
is for setting up a no-fly zone in Syria
they don't have the capability to do
that on their own I mean I think and we
sometimes I think overstate the power of
Turkey they're getting there but they're
not there yet they're faced by all these
crises and they don't have solutions and
they're still looking to the United
States their dhawan was just in the
United States asking for more support he
didn't get it from the United States not
to I was just in Istanbul and you know
based on how beautiful that said he is
you know I I hope that's the model for
the region but we'll see he was asking
for more to the u.s. to be more
forward-leaning on on basically
supporting the opposition in Syria he
wants Turkey wants the u.s. to be more
interventionist to perhaps set up a
no-fly zone to provide lethal support to
the opposition
