bold statement I'm going to defend it
then you know later you guys been asked
questions as well but I believe that
there's a market for about 150 million
of these cars right now not that market
could be achieved immediately but that's
how many people would be driving these
that they were cheap enough to drive and
the reasons are many but the most basic
one is just what do people do with their
cars I once heard that if you're going
to innovate something don't give people
what they want watch what they do I've
been watching what they do for over 25
years and makes me crazy they sit in
traffic jams for many many hours there's
actually sixty seven billion dollars per
year wasted because of in product lack
of productivity because of traffic jams
throughout the country it also wastes
about five billion barrels of oil which
is enough to fill gasoline tank trucks
from New York City to Las Vegas and all
the way back that's just the waste due
to traffic if if everything we're
free-flowing that's how much you say so
there are 118 million people that work
in the US and of them 92 million drive
by themselves in a car public
transportation is only about six percent
there's a couple percent walk and so
forth but 92 million people drive by
themselves to work every day an average
of only 20 miles now let acid batteries
can go three to four times that amount
and they're pretty cheap and the cost
per mile with lead acid batteries for
that average commute is only about a
penny a mile here in the Bay Area I
think with PG&amp;amp;E I think it's maybe a
penny and a half a mile but it's still
very very reasonable compared to the
price of gasoline which is well over ten
cents a mile so battery replacement and
electricity is is not an issue but I
don't think people will buy the car
because it's electric I mean I thought
people I mean some people will of course
but in England people are paying 675 a
gallon and still commuting 50 miles to
work so there's something about the
convenience of having a car that seems
to overwhelm everything else so this is
the first car to my knowledge that can
fit two analane it actually fits in half
a lane with more clearance in a truck
hasn't
pulling a standard freeway lane is 12
feet wide truck is allowed to be 9 foot
four inches from Mirror to mirror that
means they only have 16 inches of
clearance on either side to take a
six-foot lane if you put a stripe in a
lane and said we want to double the
capacity the freeway or at least a lane
on the freeway you would have a lane six
feet wide you have 16 inches of
clearance will give you a 40 inch width
for a car our car is 39 inches wide it's
just under a-a meter so it does fit side
by side in the lane as you're seeing in
the video here we've driven for 40 miles
side-by-side with these two cars and
quite comfortably I've also driven
side-by-side with motorcycles and they
also felt comfortable in reality cars
don't generally like to be side by side
though they can stagger but that doesn't
mean you're not doubling the capacity
because if they're staggered a little
bit so you're not side by side it's much
easier trucks when they're on the
freeway they are side by side because
there's 70 feet longer so they're side
by side with that small clearance for
very long periods of time which is
rather nerve-racking but in this car you
can see your mirrors out of the corners
of your eye and you know where you are
in the lane so it's really not
nerve-racking at all you could drive in
a 6-foot lane 70 miles an hour all day
long and not even think about it so
anyway I think that you know it's the
future any crowded city needs us
desperately and we're just starting slow
and carefully building a good foundation
we had two choices when we started this
company one was to build the car as
cheap as we could and that would
probably be a sixty thousand dollar car
and the other choice was to build a
really high-end car and our target price
was 85,000 but unfortunately the price
has crept up but the thing is is that a
car in low production just costs a lot
to build and there's nothing you can do
about that and if we've done the cheaper
option the people who wanted an electric
car like this couldn't afford it and the
people that could afford it wouldn't
want it so we tried to make it appeal to
those who could afford it and luckily we
got a check from George Clooney one
and the mail for 10 ground as a deposit
he started asking where was my car and
we delivered it so that's our first
delivery last year yard Brown has an
order for one we have another customer
in Berkeley we're building their cars
right now it's going to be about a
six-month process to build these cars
and they keep getting more and more
refined we've made some major
improvements we're going with all
stainless steel chassis it has a full
NASCAR roll cage made of chrome moly it
has four times more stealing the door
than I then a Volvo or any other car
even the ford excursion has one bar in
the door for protection and it's not
really attached and I think substantial
other than the sheet metal whereas ours
we have special design hinges that are
as strong as the rest of the roll cage
and tie those four bars into the rest of
the roll cage with pins and with
specially designed hinges so we built
you know a car that we believe is you
know the safest the fastest and so forth
I have a another video that'll kind of
answer a lot of questions let me play
that other is it a new sports car about
to hit the streets the sculptured lights
the sporty wheels a racing car cockpit
and power to burn whoa wait a minute
what's this it's the tango the commuter
car of the 21st century
man it's got tons of power it feels
incredibly stable and it just goes I
mean and it's fun to drive this
particular autocross this is the
Monterey historic car race weekend only
conquers italiano invited us there my
son and only driven a lot across before
years only three seconds we might
experience for our driver
some cars
a new national study on traffic jam
suggests the problem is bad and getting
worse it found the average American
driver spent at least 51 hours a year
caught in congestion but now an inventor
in Washington state has come up with an
amazing way to cut traffic in half it's
the mini car Early Show natural
correspondent had a caufman has more
imagine if you could fit twice as many
cars onto the freeway twice as many cars
into each lane
well good everyone drove a skinny car
and on the street when every parking
spot is full just squeezed in between
them it's definitely a head turner I'll
fast 130 miles an hour 0 to 60 in four
seconds you're kidding me just think of
the parking spots you could get the
traffic you'd avoid the tangle may
revolutionize the road I think this is
the biggest revolution since the Model T
and transportation you had to think
outside the box or the early show Hattie
Kauffman CBS News Spokane Washington as
fun as it is to watch the car it's
almost as fun to watch people watch the
car cute outrageous this is
because if they don't come up and say
wow wow they certainly think wow and
want to see what they look like in what
could be the world's fastest funkiest
electric car it's really spacious inside
here about crash were these crash
worthiness is better than any production
car that i know of it's got a nascar
roll cage and why use gas when you can
go electric you can juice up a tango in
as little as 10 minutes the facts that
make electric work in this case or one
that the average commutes only 20 miles
and this will go four times that 80
miles so they painted it Ferrari red
yeah that's great wouldn't forget the
cup holder yeah it doesn't get a lot of
excitement so the guy who drives this
car chick magnet excellent so you get
sports car enthusiasts who probably turn
up their nose and go yeah this golf cart
could not beat me I love to meet him at
a stoplight 0-60 half past four seconds
okay so would be zero emissions if it
weren't for the tire smoke actually we
set the torque so it doesn't spin the
tires you can just adjust the torque
infinitely you can adjust the horsepower
we have a valet mode so if you don't
want people driving it over a certain
speed you can set it up as you wish
ok so this I'll just go through this
presentation quickly and skip a lot of
slides because it's really designed for
an investor presentation
let's help you get it back to the
beginning something off
so we have a one of our investors the
surgeon from Harvard Medical School and
he got into he's a medical device
analyst now so he put together this
presentation for us and it's really just
targeting certain angel investors we're
trying to break it away from the
automotive market because the automobile
market is not investment worthy
according to most people you know they
say that it's to capital intensive you
can't make a quick enough profit etc so
we're trying to show that this really
isn't like the automotive market any
more than the pc was part of the main
computer market it's really a different
market it's going a different place and
when people think of this as an
automobile it's kind of like me i think
back in 75 when friends of mine were
getting into the pc business i said what
are you gonna do with this stupid thing
balance your checkbook you know i
thought what a waste and so look now so
i can't be too hard on the people that
don't think this has a future they just
don't get it they will so anyway
becoming
so we have a deep-seated consumer
dislike 50 minutes a day in gridlock
traffic they hate it we can fix that and
this is the only person is not
frustrated but he's taking a little bit
of risk you know which most people won't
take only one percent of the commuting
traffic use a combination of bicycles
and motorcycles together so it is a very
small percentage right now and I think
the main regions safety the other is
whether we solve both of those problems
so lane splitting is legal according to
California Highway Patrol webpage
motorcycles can lane split as long as
it's done safely it's only legal here in
California possibly Nevada and Arizona
and basically all the rest of the world
it's absolutely the way to get around in
Taipei for example but Oliver England in
Europe and the Orient lane splitting is
perfectly okay and this car is five
inches narrower than a goldwing so it it
actually lane splits a lot easier and
obviously a lot safer than others so I
don't think there'll be a lot of
resistance government you know policy
makers are very interested in saving
money on freeway construction so I think
we're seeing a lot of positive from both
the state and federal government level
as far as this being a really good
alternative and something that they want
to push forward so
I think you know I had a situation where
I was coming off the Bay Bridge going
toward Berkeley and took me 20 minutes
to get from where I was to the overpass
up ahead and I was counting the time
timing the motorcycles it was 20 seconds
it's a 62 one advantage and I'm sure a
lot of people would have loved to have
that and if I looked around me I'd find
that ninety percent of the people had
only one person in each car so these are
basic specifications zero to 60 in four
seconds you know to be able to drive
comfortably in a 70 miles an hour and a
six foot half freeway lane it's the only
car in the world that can really do that
the next competitor is about 48 inches
wide or more I think that people seeing
a small car I think it's a death trap
immediately so we have to prove to them
that not only is it not any less
strength than a regular car but it's way
beyond that it has four times more
stealing the doors it has a full race
car roll cage these cars are crashed
routinely people ask apart carbon crash
tested every weekend by NASCAR 200 miles
an hour they crashed tumble t-bone each
other and the guys walk out almost
always so there really a lot to be said
for that
the dragstrip we managed to beat a
shelby cobra that was kind of exciting
you're able to keep a lot closer
proximity to the car in front of you as
well because you always know you have an
escape route you can be over near the
line and you just have a comfort zone
that I can't explain you can only feel
it by driving it because you just know
where you can go and whatever happens
you're you're able to avoid collisions
much easier than you could in a car so
parkings kind of need I've been down in
LA I was driving george clooney's car in
los angeles and i pulled into a parking
lot that was completely full I saw two
Hummers going around and around and I
just pulled into this little triangular
spot just like one of these here and
just I'm in and out San Francisco Cole
Street hardware I went down there there
are people circling around looking for a
place to park and I was in and out and a
saying people are still going around
looking on geary boulevard as you go out
geary it you know a lot of the there's
just parking in the residential area
there's really no other parking so
people are going up and down the
residential streets but with this car
you pull around the corner and there's a
four foot space between every single
home and the entire San Francisco
avenues and you just pull into the first
one park perpendicular you're done it's
very convenient so even though it may
not be the best configuration for dating
because your date would have to be
behind you it will fit to six foot six
people but you know after after a couple
gets to know each other really well and
they can handle being that separated by
a seat you know then maybe they'll take
this because it's so much quicker and
they can get on about their business
high school girls said now I think I'd
rather be side-by-side with my boyfriend
so anyway we have four wheels that
requires it being sold as a kit car
until we raised you know some 50 million
dollars or so into a full fmvss
certification it's extremely expensive
to enter the car business with a fully
certified car they require airbags they
require passing crash tests without
airbag or without the seatbelts the
airbags have to do all the work so quite
a bit of engineering involved it's
really to protect the car companies more
than anything else I think it's like if
you meet these specs and you can't get
sued for a safety item I think that's
probably what's behind very complex
rules because they're really not nearly
as safe as a as a typical race car but
yet safety isn't really the top priority
I think I went over this gas prices will
drive it but I'm not counting on it so
you know our cost of goods sold right
now is about eighty-five thousand
dollars you know we're working on that I
think you know we'll come out with other
models in the future that'll be less
expensive but we're going to have to
sell a bunch of these for 108,000 in
order to get the cost down it just takes
a lot of tooling to reduce costs so one
step at a time
we do have kind of an incentive if
people try to sell oh oh sure yeah let
me do that okay so i can take questions
now
yes I was driving a rental car and was
hidden by an SUV oh my rental car was
totaled everyone in the car was either
easier killed there was some minor
bumper damage on the SUV and I don't
think that's because of you know how
much metal I had a zombie it's just the
weight difference right what is it same
way it weighs 3,000 pounds it weighs as
much as a midsize sedan so you have that
in your favor and to ward off SUVs you
actually have bars that are up right
right at the top of the door this is a
part of all the way through here and
obviously if you get hit hard by an SUV
in the door there's not any car that's
going to protect you from your head
hitting the grill so patna a slide
airbag and we're planning on that in the
future having actually just we have a
four point shoulder harness in there so
those belts can actually be airbag BF
Goodrich is designed an airbag belt that
would go work by nicely to protect you
inside info but you're definitely better
off not having the car going through
your car I saw the Cadillac at the
evidence here up in Spokane and the
driver's door was touching the passenger
door somebody driven right through the
car so you can talk about crumple zone
all you want but I'd say integrity is
the first thing race cars have to have
that they talked very little about
crumple zone crumple zone is really nice
for marketing it's cheap it's easy to
convince people of but that's not really
the point of safety safety is keeping
you alive and crash which is how race
cars have to do
it's extremely low maintenance you have
brakes and tires obviously the brushes
on the motors are good for about a
hundred thousand miles or so so they're
about twenty-five dollars or hundred
thousand miles so maintenance is almost
nil except for batteries and batteries
you kind of choose based on what your
driving style is according to optima
yellow tops you know cycle like a chart
they say that they'll go about 80,000
miles if you drive it to thirty percent
dead each time so that would be about 3
cents a mile extremely inexpensive the
hawkers that we have in here aren't so
bold with their claims they say that
they'll get twice as many miles if you
empty them completely in other words 400
cycles instead of 200 so that would give
you you know every few years or every
say 50,000 miles or so you'd have to
replace batteries that would cost about
2,200 dollars but the cost per mile I
think is the key thing we have that on
our webpage we have whole charts that
work that out and compare it with the on
the inside another car segment yes
it doesn't have regenerative braking
regen is most easily done with AC and we
love to have an AC drive system in there
but it's even much more expensive than
what we have we use the highest torque
motors the same kind used in freight
trains so we have actually over a
thousand foot-pounds of torque 0 RPM and
our controller is actually a 600
kilowatts which translates to about
eight hundred and five horsepower so no
AC drive would have that we'd still you
know we'd rather have regen but doing it
with traction motors or with series
while motors that's very complicated and
i think that the failures would be
higher so keep it simple right now yes
yes absolutely it must be in fact
Crawford 5 yeah he asked if the
batteries could be recycled and yes
we're paid five dollars of battery so
yeah you'd be silly not to nothing that
leads worth a lot we're kind of
followers of dill McDonagh's Cradle to
Cradle concept and as much as we can
we're making this car something where
every single component will be totally
recyclable or disposable but I think the
key thing is to keep all of the
technical nutrients things that are
necessary and rare and keep recycling
those you know so keep stainless with
stainless copper with copper etc yes
first creature comforts hood does it
have any
it has air conditioning and air
conditioning system in the heat or
actually I think better than an
irregular car because you have a
variable speed control rather than
sitting at idle in a normal car you have
maybe that's when you have the most heat
that's not baking down on you and the
car is just idling so with this one you
can crank it up to eight thousand rpms
and really crank while you're idling it
doesn't matter it's totally independent
of what your engine's doing it's got its
own little electric motors this good
system yes do you plan a convertible
model no yeah we can all these models we
want to build 150 million cars in 30
years so yeah they're going to be
everything you know but one step at a
time I mean we can just barely afford to
put these out at this price right now
it's a very it's a very slow painstaking
process when you don't have tons and
tons of capital behind you so you know
we just try to do a good job yes what's
the schedule for building affordable
cars it really depends on investors I've
met with three billionaires who all are
very interested but I think that it's
that they'd rather see us learn on
somebody else's money I don't know how
to explain that but it's it's like if
you have something very capital
intensive and for someone to put out the
kind of money that it requires to get a
car company up and going there has to be
an awful lot of trust and so they
generally like to invest in companies
that are already making a profit and
we're just we're just about there right
now we actually can sell cars profitably
yes okay
yes it's the center of gravity on this
is significantly lower than a regular
car yeah very very significantly lower
it's like 12 and a quarter inches off
the ground it actually has the same role
over threshold as a 911 porsche so you
think of a Porsche as wide like this you
tilt it up to about 56 degrees and
balances on two wheels our cars like
this but you're leaning over until the
roofs almost on the ground and that's
where balances on two wheels it's kind
of like a mud go-kart you go carve a
left and then you're sitting on top all
the weights download 2,000 pounds over
the floor and the rest of it spread out
throughout the rest of the car okay well
I guess that wraps it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
