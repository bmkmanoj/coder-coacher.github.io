Amala ver who came to visit us from MIT
Lincoln labs is also an adjunct
professor at MIT and works in
superconducting qubits and essentially
covers the whole hardware stack if you
want to call it such from fabrication to
design of the superconducting qubits to
measurement all the way to the control
electronics in fact Willis regarded as
one of the up-and-coming stars in the
area of superconducting designs will has
some very eclectic bio so far as I
thought for example he worked for two
years on an interactive music
installation which I think two weeks
before Burning Man starts this may be an
appropriate topic to talk about but on
the more serious side in the 2003 he got
his PhD in electrical engineering from
Stanford
he had a master of science and
electrical engineering and computer
science 1997 from MIT and he even has a
Bachelor in Japanese from Rochester
University and yeah we are very glad to
have you here and hear sort of about the
latest designs that are going on at
Lincoln labs Lincoln Labs has from our
perspective a very interested yup a
funded program on quantum enhanced
optimization which is pursuing very
similar goals in two hours to use
quantum resources to solve heart
optimization problems faster than any
classical machine could and okay well
thank you very much for that
introduction apartment I'm really
pleased to be here today to be able to
talk with you about the work that's
going on both at MIT Lincoln Laboratory
and also MIT campus and so I framed this
talk under the general title as you can
see quantum engineering of
superconducting qubits it'll be mostly a
high-level talk I'll include a few
recent results but mostly I just want to
give an overview of the breadth of the
work
that we're doing and before I get
started let me acknowledge team and
collaborators both that Lincoln
Laboratory on the left as well as the
MIT campus on the right we also
collaborate with a group in Japan
yasunobu Nakamoto and also a group at UC
Berkeley
irfan city key and Shawn Clark so by way
of introduction if we considered a
timeline of computing we could say that
there was a first information processing
revolution that happened in the 20th
century and this started with the vacuum
tube really which was invented in 1907
it was about 40 years later that we
finally had the ENIAC one of the first
tube based computers of course
contemporary with that the transistor
was invented and it took not too long to
have the first transistor based computer
but to get to something that looks like
what we're using today it was really
several decades as well and on and on on
the quantum computing side it's a much
newer story richard fineman in the early
80s said suggested that we could build a
very powerful machine if we build it
based on the rules of quantum mechanics
and so this was an idea that got kicked
around for about a decade and a real
punch came with Peter shor and two
things that he did in 1994 the first is
that he came up with Shor's algorithm
which we'll talk about in a moment the
first real practical quantum algorithm
that had a real application and the
second thing that he came up with was a
way to allow a fault-tolerant quantum
computer so essentially quantum error
correction and so okay then the US
government gets involved and starts
funding people and sure enough you know
a decade or so later we're starting to
have the first milestones in these
qubits or fundamental elements and I
think that many of us believe that
quantum information will lead to a
second information processing revolution
and it's not just us of course there's
worldwide investment here and I just
show a few of the places you know around
the world and I'm sure that I've missed
a few that are investing in this area
and of course within the last couple
years we've even seen companies jumping
in including of course Google and
Microsoft Intel's thinking and IBM's
also involved
and the reason that people are getting
involved now is because it's becoming
real and we're at a stage when we can do
engineering of these devices and the
potential value for economic and as well
as information security is driving this
investment and so Peter sure as I
mentioned just a moment ago came up with
this algorithm for code breaking or
factoring use as you know public key
encryption is based on RSA it's a
one-way problem it's difficult to factor
a large number into its primes a
composite but it's easy to multiply
those two together and confirm that you
in fact we're successful and known
classical methods require exponential
resources to do this if you're
dissatisfied with a level of security
double the you know the length of your
of your encryption key and it will get
exponentially harder now what Peter shor
showed is that with a quantum computer
you can actually do this in an efficient
amount of time and the plot here okay it
seems a lot of things but if you take a
Pettit ops computer and you ask you know
what's the computation time in hours for
a bit length key it gets to be you know
extraordinarily long even the age of the
universe by the time you're at 2048 bits
whereas a quantum computer based on
superconductors let's say running at 100
megahertz could solve this problem in
about an hour so so okay for a long time
people asked is that the only
application and the answer is well no in
fact richard fineman when he first
talked about this he said it's actually
a simulation of quantum systems that's
the most interesting you know he said
look nature is not classical and so if
you want to make a simulation of nature
why not make it quantum mechanical and
so in fact uh Floyd at MIT was the first
one to show that this could be done
efficiently and so you want to use
quantum to simulate quantum and the
applications here include quantum
chemistry material science can even
stretch that to optimization problems as
well and so as I'll show you I think the
past decade in quantum information has
really taken these qubits out of the
laboratory and we're
- they develop to a point where we're
ready to actually engineer them into
larger systems and so what this graphic
is showing is essentially that you know
we started with transistor tubes and
made it
we started with vacuum tubes and made a
vacuum tube computer and then the
transistor came along and we made those
you know transistor based chips and we
certainly adopted a lot of what we had
learned in making the vacuum tube
computer not all of it but some of it
and we're now at the right side here
where we have qubits that are working
and now the question is you know we want
to build there's some goal let's say
it's quantum information processor you
know and what can we use that we already
know to do that so so here's the outline
of my talk I'm going to give a fairly
basic introduction to quantum
information science and to
superconducting qubits and then I would
like to talk about what we're doing at
MIT now and Lincoln Laboratory in terms
of quantum engineering both on the qubit
plane as well as the control in the
readout plane and so you could ask the
question how is a quantum computer
different than a classical computer so a
classical computer we're all familiar
with it's based on a bit a classical bit
this could be a transistor and the
states are 0 and 1 it's binary
these are discrete and they're
deterministic if you set it as 1 you
know unless there's some error you will
measure it as 1 if you set it at 0
you'll measure it as 0 a quantum
computer in contrast is a quantum state
it's a two-level system but you can have
a superposition of states both 0 &amp;amp; 1
simultaneously and this superposition is
what makes this computer powerful and
one consequence is that measurement is
now probabilistic it if you repeat an
identically prepared state in a 50-50
superposition over and over again half
of the time you will measure zero and
the other TAF at the time you will
measure one and so quantum computers
rely on encoding information in
fundamentally different ways than their
classical counterparts the consequence
of this is that if you have n bits in a
classical computer you have one n bit
state so if if n is 3 then 2 to the N is
is you have 8 different states but if
you want to process on them all what you
have to do is parallel wise right so you
then repeat the the hardware that you
use to compute or you
extending time the computation whereas
Ana quantum computer you have to to the
end components simultaneously and so let
me give an example now of how this works
so so imagine that you have three atoms
you call these qubits there are two
level systems they're coupled together
and this gives you 8 possible States and
the state space is listed at the upper
right with coefficient C 1 through C 8
indicating the various possibilities the
quantum state would be written as such
these this notation is called the bra
ket notation or Dirac notation and the
state requires these eight in principle
complex numbers C 1 through it C 8 to
specify it and so we can give an example
of what quantum parallelism means in the
following way so imagine that we target
just the first qubit on the left and we
apply a pulse to it that will flip the
spin if it's up it becomes down and if
it's down it becomes up you can think of
this as a an inverter and when we apply
this pulse
we're actually applying it to the entire
state space at the same time so what
that means is that coefficient C 1
through C for which were ascribed to the
spin up they move to now being with the
spin down and C five through C 8 now
move to from down to up as you can see
and so by applying one pulse at one time
we're operating on the entire state
space this is an example of quantum
parallelism now we can do something
further which is quantum interference in
these systems which has no classical
counterpart and the way that we can
illustrate that is imagine now we have
another laser beam that targets the
third atom and does what we call a PI
over 2 pulse and what that means is that
if you start with a spin up it's going
to rotate it 90 degrees that's PI over 2
and create a superposition of up plus
down and so if we just look at the first
element of this register the up-up-up
spin combination and the coefficient c5
in front is now spread between the first
two elements on the right and I'm not
worried about normalization here for
experts in the crowd now
instead if the spin we're down this same
rotation rotates it to a superposition
of up and down but it does so with a
minus sign and that's very important
this is
due to quantum mechanics and so the
coefficient c6 as you show as you can
see on the right adds to its spin up up
up it adds and in the next one it
subtracts and so if c5 and c6 happen to
have the same amplitude then the up up
down state would destructively interfere
and so there would be no more amplitude
for that state this is an example of
quantum interference and in fact it's
also an example of quantum parallelism
because it happens on the entire
register at the same time now we can
extend this further and say what is a
quantum algorithm in the gate based
model and so what it is is that we start
with an input state let's say an equal
superposition state shown on the left of
all different all the different states
and the first thing we do are the single
qubit operations of the type we just saw
followed by quantum interference and
what that does is it modifies the
coefficients in front so whereas they
were an equal superposition to begin
with they now go to Alpha Beta Gamma
Delta etc now there's another type of
operation called coupled qubit
operations where the state of one qubit
depends on the state of the other qubit
there the operation that it does on Cuba
two will depend on the state of qubit
one and that is also followed by quantum
interference and the goal of anybody who
writes this algorithm is to of course
solve a problem but also to do it in
such a way that at the end after many
many applications of these gates that
almost all of the amplitude or ideally
all of the amplitude is located in one
of the states at the at the end and that
is the state which tells us the answer
because we know that despite this you
know this Hilbert space is 2 to the N
massive increase in the state space that
a quantum computer affords us
measurement has an exponential decrease
that collapse down to one state when we
make a measurement we only measure one
state and so it behooves us when we
write an algorithm to make sure that all
of the probability amplitude is in the
state that has the answer so that when
we measure we get the right answer
okay so the elements that build up these
computers are of course qubits and there
is an intuitive figure
merit for the quality of the qubit I
want to note that this is not rigorous
but it's I think it brings some
intuition and what that is is that first
of all there's a gate time right how
long did it take me to do this pipe also
that's PI over 2 pulse it's a time
required for a single operation clearly
faster is desired right so classical
processors for example if they run it a
gigahertz then we're talking roughly a
nanosecond clock and so with a hundred
percent activity factor that's a
nanosecond per hour okay the second
thing about a qubit is that it has a
coherence time and that's the duration
of time that it remains quantum
mechanical that's the qubits lifetime
and so we start with this perfectly
quantum mechanical qubit state but
unfortunately due to its interaction
with the environment it will lose
coherence and you can think of this as
the state is becoming blurrier and
blurrier over time and eventually the
state is lost so these are these two
time scales and the one figure of Merit
is the ratio of these two times and it's
essentially a measure of how many
operations can I do before I lose my
quantum coherence and it turns out that
you can sustain quantum computing
operations by quantum error correction
provided you reach a certain threshold
and that threshold for certain codes the
most lenient ones is about ten to the
three and so now let me say okay so
that's just the intuitive metric the
real metric is what is the error per
gate that I have so I think I'm applying
a PI pulse and the question is how close
to that did I get ideally was it a
hundred percent or was it not quite a
hundred percent and it turns out that we
need to do that both the applying the
pulses as well as the readout with at
least 99.5% fidelity so that means about
half a percent error per operation and I
can say with superconducting qubits
we're there we're actually beyond that
now and so well what are these
candidates I mean we're talking about
superconducting qubits but there are
many candidate two-level systems that we
have to our you know and are disposable
at our disposal why did we choose
superconductors I should say at Lincoln
we're actually working on both trapped
ions and superconductors so what's
plotted here is the figure of Merit
versus the gate speed and here's this
Louis
threshold for achieving quantum error
correction of course you want to be as
far beyond that as possible but you need
to be at least this good such that
adding redundancy makes the computer
behave or operate better the best
performance is in the upper right corner
so if we look at trapped ions they have
a gate time that's about 10 to 100
microseconds their coherence time is
maybe 1 250 microseconds and so you can
see where they are placed and
superconducting qubits they have a gate
time of about 10 nanoseconds coherence
times of about 100 microseconds that
places in there and so what it means is
in the superconducting qubits side we're
continually trying to improve the qubits
to give them higher coherence they're
already relatively fast and the ion trap
side they're already high coherence but
they're relatively slow and so they're
there at Lincoln lab working on ways to
make those gate operations and the
readout faster and faster and it matters
right because if you have for example a
quantum computer that's working your
factoring number is great it doesn't
take the age of the universe it takes my
superconducting cue
you know quantum computer only a day to
factor that number it will take the ion
traps about a thousand days so three
years so the prefactor absolutely
matters it's not just the exponential
speed-up so we've talked a lot about
this what we would call gate based it's
you have a universal set of single and
coupled qubit gates and you can do
things such as factoring it's a quantum
simulation and in this case for gate
based quantum computer there's a known
speed-up over classical means if we can
build this computer it will work and it
will be much better than what we have
today the other type of computer is
called a quantum annealing computer and
this solves things such as Traveling
Salesman problem essentially
optimization problems and here there are
many many applications that it could be
applied to if it works but it's unknown
if there's a quantum speed-up and that's
an active area of research both I would
say at Lincoln Laboratory and also here
at Google is to try to identify problems
for which quantum annealing will give a
quantum speed-up so conceptually what is
a quantum annealing algorithm the idea
is that you have a Hamiltonian or state
of the system
and initially this is a known starting
point there's also the problem
Hamiltonian which encodes your problem
and that's the the and encodes the
answer and the goal is through annealing
to slowly transition from this known
state to this encoded state and so the
way this works is as it's illustrated
the little red dot is going to tunnel
over to a lower energy State and there
are two ways that it can get there and
one is through thermal activation and
the other is through quantum tunneling
and so what quantum computing brings to
this problem is a new pathway to get
there and that is through quantum
tunneling to find the global ground
state and the extent to which this works
will give us the answer and and the real
question you know the open question is
this quantum tunneling provide a super
classical speed-up and we don't know the
answer to that so if we ask the question
what is the hardware pathway now that we
have these qubits to building a quantum
computer well step one is let's make
sure we have singling coupled qubit
gates for a gate based model or in fact
for a quantum annealer - or maybe you
want to have a three body interaction or
four body interaction the next step is
to demonstrate that you can control it
so error-correcting parity checks
syndrome measurements high connectivity
in the case of an annealer and then i
think where we are now is that we're
building initial test beds so this is
between say ten a hundred a thousand
cubits where we can really test either
in the gate based case logical
protection quantum error correction
sustained operation or in the case of
quantum annealing let's find problems
that can give a quantum speed-up and and
beyond this is outside the scope of this
time and it's going to stand on many
many technologies right so at the bottom
here we have of course theory and we
know in theory this works physical
qubits we've done two to five qubit
experiments but where we really need to
focus on I think in the next decade is
architecture and logical qubits so
architecture of course is how we lay
these out to to achieve the most
efficient implementation and logical
qubits in the case of gate based is
allowing sustained operation there's
also error correction possible with
quantum
and these are clearly engineering
directions so we're talking about
fabrication control electronics both at
room temperature and cold temperature
packaging and on the computer science
side the data paths the compilers
predictions of performance these are all
things that are key and you know this
this next decade is when it will will
happen so let me say that we're trying
to address all of these things at MIT
and Lincoln lab this is our group called
quantum information in integrated
nanoscience group we're focused on
superconducting qubits and ion traps on
the quantum computing side but we have a
lot of effort on the classical side as
well for example classical
superconducting electronics CMOS
cryogenic CMOS 3d integration integrated
photonics and these really as you can
imagine all come together to to make a
quantum computer revealty so let me move
on now to superconducting qubits and how
do we build a superconducting artificial
atom what starts with a linear resonant
circuit so take an inductor and a
capacitor put them together it has a
resonance frequency as you can see goes
as 1 over square root of LC and we
desire that it be low loss because we
want this qubit to to live as long as
possible and so to do that we use
superconductivity so we build these
elements out of superconductors which as
you know if you take a normal metal with
electrons and cool it below a transition
temperature the electrons pair up and
form Cooper pairs and they lose their
resistance they become superconducting
so it's truly resistance equals zero at
DC this dissipation list and of course
these Cooper pairs are all phase
coherent with one another and what that
means is that this this LC circuit is
actually quantum mechanical so if we
cool it to a low enough temperature to
make this thing super conduct what
you'll find is that it's a harmonic
oscillator and it has a discrete set of
energy levels 0 1 2 States 0 1 2 and 3
and they're each separated by a
resonance frequency nu naught and this
quantized electric harmonic oscillator
looks like a quantized electromagnetic
field there's a term which corresponds
to the capacitive energy and a term
which corresponds to the inductive entry
and
and in fact these two variables charge
and phase or voltage and current do not
commute they have a commutation relation
that's nonzero it's not trivial so
they're not simultaneous observables in
this quantum domain so this is okay but
the problem is that these linear
elements make a harmonic circuit and
what we would like is a two-level system
and so we're not able to uniquely
identify a zero one transition without
also driving the one to in two to three
because they're all degenerate so what
you have to do then is to make a non
linear element and for us it's very easy
to do that it's it's called the
Josephson junction which is a nonlinear
inductor and essentially as is
illustrated here there are two pieces of
superconducting materials separated by a
very narrow insulating barrier about a
nanometer and the phase coherence on one
side links up with a phase coherence on
the other side there's a net phase drop
across this Junction and the current
that's going through this Josephson
Junction is proportional to the sign of
that phase and the voltage drop across
the junction is proportional to the time
rate of change of that phase and so we
can define an inductance clearly ldi/dt
and as you can imagine there are lots of
nonlinearities here and this leads to a
nominee or inductance so that's exactly
what happens by combining the current
and the voltage together there's a
nonlinear inductance we put that into
this LC circuit and it becomes an
harmonic so as a result we can address
the zero one transition independently of
the higher levels the degree to which
those levels are separated is called
rightfully so the end harmonicity and
achieving high end harmonicity is a good
thing in this system
so why superconducting qubits why are
they more special than other modalities
so one is that we manufacture them right
we use planar IC fabrication
technologies just as was used for say
silicon and transistors and we apply
them to superconducting materials
there's a lot of compatibility that's
there and so there's a lithographic
scalability right from the start
and what's illustrated here is we
fabricate on 200 millimeter wafers and
you see some pictures of the qubit and
also some Josephson junctions at the
these are SEM pictures there are two
basic fabrication approaches that we use
one is called a subtractive approach
where you deposit metal and then etch
away which you don't want add back more
dielectric more metal at UA which you
don't want this is closest to how
transistors are manufactured today in an
example at the right is shown so the
other approach is additive shadow of
apparation where you create some stencil
type masks that only puts the metal
where you want it and we've made qubits
in both processes and as I'll show in a
moment our best qubits are made in
number two the shadow of apparation
process in terms of their coherence
okay the second reason I would say why
superconducting qubits is because they
have they're fast you can do nanus at
nanosecond scale gate operations and so
what's shown on the right is a
dual-channel arbitrary waveform
generator and this arbitrary waveform
generator the way that we control the
qubits is that we'll apply a pulse the
pulse envelope like a Gaussian for
example to an IQ mixer and the input to
the IQ mixer is a microwave and the
microwave tone is resonant with the
level separation of the qubit that
you're trying to drive and that's
typically around five gigahertz so this
is cell phone technologies appropriate
here and whether it goes through the eye
channel or the cue channel this pulse
determines whether you know the phase
goes through as is or whether it gets
shifted by 90 degrees so it's called
in-phase and quadrature pulsing and so
what it looks like we represent this on
the Bloch sphere so the Bloch sphere you
can think of it as Poincare a sphere is
a way to represent a two-level system
quantum mechanically and so when the
qubit is pointing towards the North Pole
that's state zero and when it's pointing
towards the South Pole that's state one
and what's illustrated in time here are
different types of pulses that we
generate by having this arbitrary
waveform send a pulse either to the eye
channel or to the cue channel so it's
now approaching a cue channel this red
vector that comes out is illustrating
the amplitude of the pulse there's a PI
over 2 pulse which takes it to the
equator of the Bloch sphere and a second
PI over 2 Falls brings it back to the
North Pole so this is how we this is how
we control these qubits
the the last element here which is very
important is that there's been a
remarkable improvement in the cubic
coherence over the past decade and this
has been a combination of materials
fabrication and design improvements
what's plotted at the right is the
coherence time t2 as a function of the
year so the first qubit superconducting
qubit was from the NEC group at a
nanosecond actually a little bit less
than a nanosecond in 1999 and since then
there's been a five orders of magnitude
increase in this fundamental metric now
many different types of qubits are shown
here I won't go into the details about
them all but let me say that the blue
dots that you see those are
contributions that we've made from
Lincoln and MIT these lower ones here in
the early years these were made by our
niobium process and we had still do have
the most coherent niobium qubits in the
world but they peak out at around 300
nanoseconds so we switched to aluminum
and these upper dots up here are the
aluminum qubits and one one feature I
would say of Lincoln and MIT is that we
look at all the different types so for
example we have a flux qubit that's got
a t2 of 23 microseconds 2d and 3d trans
Mons that are state-of-the-art and we
even have a new capacitive leash on in
flux qubit which I'll talk about with t2
up at 90 nano 90 microseconds and the
last thing I can say about
superconducting qubits which is very
nice is that they're applicable to both
types of quantum computing whether it's
gate based or quantum annealing okay so
let me let me now turn to some of the
quantum engineering that we're doing
we'll start with the qubit plane so here
are the architectural layers of a
quantum information processor abstracted
and this is worked by Cody Jones at hrl
what you can see is that he's
represented it as five layers at the
bottom layer are the physical qubits the
the individual elements that build up
the computer at layer two is passive
error suppression this is called
dynamical decoupling and it's
essentially an open loop error
cancellation technique which I'll
describe in a moment and the idea is
let's make these qubits as good as
possible increase their coherence time
as much
as possible reduce their data as much as
possible before we have to do layer
three which is really hard and called
active quantum error correction so this
is what Peter shor came up with in 94
which is a way to allow the computer to
run fault tolerant lis because clearly
if the if the the coherence time is a
microsecond I use this example earlier
that it's going to take us a day to
fabricate or to factor a large number
that's incompatible and so quantum error
correction at least as we see today is
clearly going to be a part of any
foreseeable quantum computer and if you
look at for example transistors in your
laptops right what's what is the error
rate of a transistor in a laptop it's
probably one part in 10 to the 15 or one
part in 10 to the 20 right if if the
computer stops working it's usually a
software error all right and what we
have is error rates now at one part in
10 to the 3 one part in 10 to the 4 and
we're working really hard with materials
and fab to improve that but we're not
going to make up 16 orders of magnitude
at least you know maybe I shouldn't go
on the record and say that engineers are
pretty clever but that's a big
difference and so quantum error
correction is going to be an important
part of making up that difference and
the way it works is that you start with
these faulty qubits and you do error
mitigation that's layer 2 and then you
do error detection to the quantum error
correcting codes to see if there's an
error and then you correct for it and
then you do a logical operation and
correct for any errors and then you just
keep cycling this around and around
every clock cycle you'll do this over
and over again and the most advanced as
far as I know demonstration of this is
from the UC Santa Barbara Google group
where they've done five qubit and nine
qubit repetition code this is not a
fault tolerant code but this is a very
nice demonstration along this along this
direction is and as suggested by this
picture they've only done a 1d chain
here but they've drawn it in the context
of a 2d plane what's called the surface
code which is this lenient code that
allows us to do fault tolerant
computation but what I'd like to talk
about is some work that we've done at
layers one and two and so let me start
with layer two and this is open loop
error mitigation or dynamical decouple
and it's you know the concept is pretty
pretty straightforward so for example I
think of it as lacrosse cradling I don't
know if you've played lacrosse before
but the idea is that you have a ball in
the stick and this wicket and if you
just run with it across the ground like
this running creates noise and the ball
pops out very easily you know so nobody
does that what they do is they cradle it
they go like this right as they're
running and just by doing this you
decouple the ball from you know from the
ground from your running and that works
most of the time until this guy in red
comes up behind you and knocks it out of
course you're not preventing that right
that's going to happen once in a while
but at least you've improved the
situation dramatically and so the analog
here is that passive error correction is
the cradling and active error correction
is going to be mitigating the defender
so we applied this technique
demonstrated it for the first time in a
superconducting system using a qubit
that was a very good qubit in 2011 it's
the first one to exceed ten microseconds
but the red boxes here what they
indicate was a puzzling question and
that is that if we do a ramsey
experiment which is shown right here
which is essentially two pi over two
pulses we take the spin and we put it on
the block spheres equator and then we
let it process that's what the
oscillations are it will do that with a
decay time of about two and a half
microseconds that's pretty short but if
we do a spin echo which is over here on
the right so we do the same PI over two
pulses but then right in the middle we
put a PI pulse and I'll show more
examples of this so the point is is that
just by doing that one PI pulse we're
able to extend the time to 23
microseconds factor 10 so the way that
we can understand this and this is the
one the one place in the talk where I'll
have some math is to think about what
what causes qubit D phasing and so if
you have your qubit energy levels zero
and one they're separated by an energy
e01 they're at different energies and so
these two states will accumulate phase
at a different rate so if I have a
superposition alpha 0 plus beta 1 we can
write it in such a way where it looks
like state 1 is accumulating a
in time and if it's a deterministic
phase if there's no noise
then it does so predictably ad infinitum
but if if there's some noise in the
system which is causing this energy
level to fluctuate
this will cause de phasing and then this
is this random variable here Phi tilde
now the phase accumulates in an exponent
so we can calculate what's the ensemble
average that we expect for this phase
and it's really just a time integration
of the frequency which is energy divided
by h-bar and if we assume some
reasonable things like Gaussian
distributed fluctuations there are lots
of sources of this noise we can write it
down in this very appealing and
intuitive way so there's an exponent
then there's tau squared which is the
time the first term there is the change
in energy per change in whatever is
causing this noise it'll be flux noise
as we turn out and call it lambda here
and that quantity squared so this is the
sensitivity of the energy levels how
much the energy fluctuates for a change
in this noise parameter and then the
second term is an integration of the
power spectral density of this noise
which is the variance so that's how much
fluctuation you have but weighted by
this function we call here G which is
the filter function and the filter
function depends on which pulses you
apply so if you know what s is the power
spectral density you can choose a filter
function ie you can choose a certain set
of pulses which will shape that noise
and hopefully mitigate it or at least
reduce its its impact so the filter
function depends on the pulse sequence
and it windows the power spectral
density so here's an example this is
just what's called a spin echo so we do
a PI over 2 pulse the spin goes on to
the equator and then due to noise it's
going to diffuse it goes at different
rates so I think what's simulated here
is maybe 10 instances or something like
this
quasi static noise so for each instance
we assume a fixed level of noise and
that's what causes the precession so you
could imagine this as a loop with a
magnetic field that threads the loop and
the spin is going to precess around that
magnetic field and the value of the
magnetic field is changing so
spin processes at different rates
sometimes it goes forward sometimes it
goes backwards and the way that we can
understand this is in the following way
so we have these two PI over two pulses
and then the period of time in between
is called free evolution we're not doing
anything we're just watching the qubit
and this free evolution has a fixed
energy level separation we said the
noise is quasi static and so it looks
like a rectangle right if we take the
Fourier transform of a rectangle we get
a sinc function and so the filter
function corresponding to doing nothing
is a sinc function and of course I'll
say that this flux noise is 1 over F
light we've measured that many times and
so what you can see is doing this as the
most is one of the noisiest things that
we can do because the peak of the filter
function is also at the peak of the
noise and so when we integrate it we get
a lot of noise so the second thing we
can try is to put a PI pulse in the
middle this is called a Hanako named
after one Hahn in the 50s who did it in
NMR first and as you can see it
refocuses the noise very efficiently and
so what's happening is that the first
period there's a rectangle here the tau
over 2 comes in with a particular sign
let's call it plus sign but after the PI
or the PI pulse will flip everything
upside down so now it the second
interval comes in with a minus sign and
if we take the Fourier transform of
these two rectangles with a plus sign
and a minus sign and we get this green
filter function and now it's moved out
to a higher frequency and so this
reduces the effect of noise seen by the
qubit and the intuition of why it moves
to a higher frequency well that you know
these time durations are a little bit
smaller between the two various pulses
and so that goes to a higher frequency
and so if you add more pulses the
situation indeed gets better and so here
we have an example of two pulses the
duration of time becomes smaller and
smaller and so the filter function now
shown in red goes to higher and higher
frequency and the degree to which this
is improving the situation gets better
and better of course there's no free
lunch here I had to apply some pulses to
do it so it took some resources but a
factor 10 is a big factor so we
demonstrated this back in 2010-2011 and
showed that we could in fact take a
qubit it's intrinsically
is that a very noisy point and improve
its decay time by about a factor 50 went
from you know 300 nanoseconds or so and
increased dramatically and so approached
the limit which is twice t1 and the
reason that's a limit if you're on the
if you're on the equator of the Bloch
sphere of course you can do phase on
that equator but also you could just
relax off of it all right and so we know
that at some level t1 is always going to
be a limiting factor and then that it
needs to be corrected by layer three
quantum error correction now the second
thing we can do is let's make a better
qubit to begin with right let's increase
t1 as much as possible so that I can do
these dynamical decoupling pulses and
hopefully achieve twice t1 and I want to
move t1 up as high as possible and so we
did that recently with the flux qubit
driven primarily because it's it's a
good qubit for both gate based and
annealing and so the question is what
can you do to improve t1 in a flux qubit
well we know that design and materials
and fabrication can all impact the t1
and the way that it does so is through
Fermi's Golden Rule
so Fermi's golden rule is essentially
the rate of decay 1 over the t1 time and
it's proportional to two terms the first
one is essentially a matrix element X
you can think of this as a generalized
dipole operator that causes the
transitions between excited state and
ground state and so we borrowed an idea
from the trans Monde community that's
another type of superconducting qubit
where they added a large shunt capacitor
and so we asked the question with some
help from people who proposed this idea
listed at the bottom what happens if you
do this and it's it turns out that it
helps it reduces the sensitivity to
charge noise and it also reduces the
sensitivity to stray capacitance so if
you had a big capacitor to the flux
qubit which intrinsically has a very
small capacitor and you have some small
stray you just don't see the stray
anymore you see the big capacitor right
the second thing we did is we reduced
the circulating current in the in the
qubit loop and this has reduced this
reduces sensitivity to flux noise so
that's a good thing
it also slightly increases sensitivity
to charge noise so it counters a bit
adding the C shot but it overall it's a
net win
so that's on the design side on the
other side is the power spectral density
what can we do to to make the noise
environment have a lower have a lower
noise and so what we can do is improve
the capacitor film quality so we
improved how we fab it how we grow it
and so this increases the capacitor Q if
you will and reduces its noise and the
other thing we can do is optimize the
geometry of the capacitor and what that
means is of course the capacitor has
some electric fields that go from one
plate to the other and there's some
distribution of defects there that are
causing this noise of course we try to
reduce the defects as much as possible
but whatever is left right we try to
make sure that the electric field
samples them all equally that there's no
high intensity regions of electric field
because if it is then those defects
participate much more strongly and so
this is the qubit that we came up with
so it's a flux qubit with a square
capacitor
there's qubit a and qubit B that are
shown and a zoom in of qubit a shows the
capacitor so these are two plates the
electric field goes from one to the
other and in between is the qubit and
then that's the zoom in shown here it's
a three Junction loop the junction on
the left is smaller than the other two
that are on the right now we could
perform spectroscopy find out what the
energy levels are at least two qubits
and they're shown on the right here's
qubit a and qubit B and one interesting
fact here is that this qubit has three
to five times the an harmonicity of a
trans monitor that's a good thing we
talked about that earlier is the zero
one transition versus the one two
transition and the more different that
is the higher the n harmonicity the more
useful it is for for quantum computing
and the T one and T two times here are
very good so T one for these two qubits
44 and 55 microseconds the T two
measurements I only show one here but
they're similar and so the T two with an
echo is about 90 microseconds that's
this isn't a planar device so it's a
very good T to time and if you ask
without the echo what was it it's about
T one it's about 40 to 50 microseconds
so I believe these are state-of-the-art
qubits and they're in a planar geometry
which is
again leads to lithographic scalability
I'll just mention in passing that we've
developed models for the noise which
allow us to predict what the value of t1
should be across a very wide range of
designs so by changing the design this
is not fabrication variation just the
opposite by varying the design we were
able to create qubits that had of low t1
around you know half a microsecond all
the way up to say 50 microseconds and
that's these are the data points that
are shown here and the produces measured
versus predicted t1 so all of those
points should fall on the dash line and
more or less they do with the noise
model single noise model that we have
works across all of these qubits so this
is this was for us an accomplishment and
in fact it indicates that our
fabrication is pretty good it's
reproducible because we pick a design we
make it and it behaves the way that it
should so the model works and the
fabrication works so in the last few
minutes here let me talk about
engineering of the control and the
readout plane so of course the way we do
it today is we have room temperature
control electronics and these are some
electronics that we've built at Lincoln
Laboratory an FPGA card and mixed
signaled cards and back planes and dual
channel AWG it's essentially a DITA a
converter and a 2 D converter and a way
for them to talk to each other and to do
feedback eventually we would like to
make this cold and we've been working on
this for several years now and what I
can say at this point is that we've used
cryogenic CMOS to facilitate
measurements of Josephson junctions so
what that means is that what's shown
here in the upper left is a probe where
we use cryogenic CMOS to switch between
different devices that we're trying to
measure and so there are 14 chips and I
think roughly 12 devices per chip and we
only have four wires that go down to
make the measurement and the other wires
that go down are simply telling the CMOS
where to route those wires now that may
sound very simple and it is but we did
it at cold temperatures in fact we even
did it in a dilution refrigerator of 20
millikelvin
and so only 24 wires could measure 151
devices okay and so I think that without
saying it I think we can imagine how
that could be useful if you're trying to
control a quantum computer and what's
shown on the right is an expanded
version of this in a dilution
refrigerator where it's not just well
let me say it's eight of those in
parallel so oh and here are some results
so we test for example Josephson
junctions with this and we can get IV
traces again in a dilution refrigerator
the temperature is remains less than 100
milli Kelvin even in the presence of
this cryogenic CMOS so this is an active
area of research for us now I
unfortunately can't talk much more about
it than that now another type of control
logic that we're working on is called
single flux quantum or sfq electronics
and this is a it's classical it's
digital superconducting electronics
it's a flux shuttle logic so you have a
loop and the loop is interrupted by a
Josephson junction shown here and then
you think of that you can think of that
Junction as a valve the valve let's in a
an amount of magnetic flux lets out an
amount of magnetic flux and the presence
or absence of that magnetic flux is the
digital zero or one and what's shown at
the bottom is just a simple schematic of
a D flip-flop what makes this very
interesting is that the switching energy
is extremely low and conducive to using
in a dilution refrigerators so what's
plotted is the energy versus the speed
and what you can see is that these sfq
indicated in the green here these types
of devices are much lower energy than
competing technologies now CMOS can be
made better by cryo CMOS indicated by
the blue arrow but it doesn't quite
reach sfq and so the applications here
are interesting it's also
high-performance computing but also
cryogenic control electronics and we
have an active very active research area
here I showing a side cut of an 8 layer
our sfq wafer ok so we make a wafer we
grow eight wiring layers and there's
junctions in there and resistors all the
things you need to build circuits this
is the most advanced process in the
world as far
I know we've demonstrated circuits that
have 70,000 junctions operating at high
speeds very important and the yield
presently is limited by the designs and
the fact is in the past people haven't
had fabrication facilities able to make
these types of devices so we haven't
been able to turn the crank too many
times on the designs but now we can and
so this is a very exciting result for us
the densities were achieving here are
one to two million junctions per square
centimeter now using that same process
we can make low-noise amplifiers these
are Josephson base traveling wave
parametric amplifiers amplifiers which
have decent gain and the amount of noise
they add it's at the quantum limit it's
limited by the rules of quantum
mechanics so I just have a few pictures
on this on the left here is a five by
five millimeter chip if we zoom in to
the Red Square you can see the
transmission line I'll show this in a
moment and then there's some resonators
inductors and capacitors to do what's
called phase matching but this is what
it is essentially it's a it's a
Telegraph's equation if you look at our
telegraph line in the upper left you can
approximate a 50 ohm impedance line by
elements of inductors and capacitors and
dr. capacitor repeated over and over and
in this case again the Josephson
Junction is a nonlinear inductor which
provides the non-linearity for this
amplifier so what's nice is that this is
a 50 ohm impedance match device but it
provides gain and it does so by what's
called Chi 3 non-linearity it means that
you have a pump in a signal photon that
come in and what comes out is an
amplified signal two photons and it's a
broadband device it's not resonant it's
5000 matched right so we can actually
think about frequency multiplexing many
many qubits together sending them to the
same amplifier and then you know D
multiplexing so just to show some
numbers the gain is greater than 20 DB
over about four or four and a half
gigahertz of bandwidth and this is
incredible you know a year or two ago
the best you could do is these kinds of
gains over maybe 10 or 20 megahertz
and in terms of its noise temperature it
has a noise temperature of 0.4 Kelvin
and to give an idea that that that's a
quantum efficiency of about 80 percent
we're a hundred percent would be at the
limit that quantum mechanics allows so
these are very good amplifiers and we
hopefully hopefully will get it
published very soon I should mention and
I think I had it on the previous yeah
Ted white in the Santa Barbara group has
also made an amplifier at this type now
and so finally you know our concept of
course is to integrate these and so we
have a qubit chip that we will flip chip
on - so that's the qubit plane and that
gets flipped chipped on to the control
and readout plane using things like this
superconducting multi chip module
coaxial through-silicon vias etc and
these are all things that we're working
on so the last last point I'd like to
make is we've succeeded in flipped
chipping and measuring qubits and so
what's shown in number one is the qubit
side of this the qubit plane and it has
a capacitive leash on it flux qubit on
it and number two is the other side the
control plane and you flip chip it over
and connect it with indium bumps so this
is what it looks like so there's two
chips here once five by five millimeters
the other is five by two-and-a-half
millimeters and so you flip it over it's
really this easy yeah you flip it over
and you push it down and indium bumps
make electrical contact and so you can
pass signals between the two planes as
you need to this is what it looks like
when they're packaged and these are
preliminary results but let me say that
we've measured several qubits now and
they have T ones between 10 and 15
microseconds so not not our best t1
times but they're pretty good doing this
process we found didn't didn't harm the
t1 dramatically and in fact you know the
next step is to assess what we can do to
bring that t1 back up and so let me
conclude not by just repeating
everything I just said but by saying
look the coming decade is now the past
decade was all about trying to take this
Laboratory Curiosity and make it better
and this this coming too
okay now is going to be about
engineering quantum systems thank you
very much so I mean it was very
interesting to see your 90 microsecond
flux qubit but your coupling we did
through resonators right that's how you
couple the qubit so this would be for
the gate model assume yeah so so this
was you're right that that what we
demonstrated was two qubits coupled via
resonator but that in fact is not the
way that we want to couple two qubits
together either for gate based or for
quantum annealing and the way that we
want to do this is to have a separate
entity which we would call a coupler
between the two qubits and that tunable
that coupler would allow tunable
coupling you can turn it on or turn it
off magnetic there was a biggest I mean
you put them big a big loop that's your
capacitor charge and I was wondering how
do you want to do actually coupled them
but you say you have a way yeah so we've
been thinking about this the geometry of
the squares you know prohibits entry
let's say but once you go to a three
dimensional world right you don't
necessarily need to come in from the
sides thank you on the level of the
architecture for an annealer one of the
key figures of Merit there's of course
there's a degree of connectivity of the
graphs that connects the qubits could
you maybe address this a little bit what
you think may be achievable in terms of
how high of a degree in the connectivity
graph we could get so I don't I can tell
you what we would like to do and at this
point this is all just ball-and-stick
diagrams but we think we have a way to
get a connect connectivity of maybe one
to forty or one to fifty but that has to
be demonstrated at this point it's just
you know a drawing on a piece of paper
so but if we could get something like
that I think that would be great for a
first test bed yeah
and we'll see how close we can get so
there is also another requirement for a
quantum annealer that you can embed
interesting computational problem is
that like a local interactions do you
have any idea how to do it like a tree
for local interaction oh yeah yeah so we
have some ideas along these lines but we
haven't been able to demonstrate it yet
so we're in the process of trying to
demonstrate a third-order for you know
three body or four body interaction I
don't know if it's gonna work so maybe
in six months we can say yeah it worked
or it didn't work I was wondering how
many qubits you think it would be
possible to be able within a decade what
we're saying now is that you know in
this deck it is gonna be engineering of
these lab curiosities and taking them to
an industrial level yes I was wondering
if you were to dream a number of how
many cubes do you think we will seen in
a device in a working device within the
next decade oh yeah it's always so
dangerous they answer these questions
let me let me answer with a factual
statement okay so we fabricate on 200
millimeter wafers okay and on a 200
millimeter wafer we're achieving one to
two million junctions per square
centimeter and that's with very what I
would say lazy levels of integration so
I don't think that the challenge is
going to be the I think the lithographic
scalability is straightforward what's
really challenging of course is going to
be maintaining coherence amongst those
qubits and maintaining controllability
and also the readout of those qubits and
there okay there's much less visibility
and what we can do in the next decade
but I'm I'm optimistic because we've
made so much progress over the past
decade in terms of coherence and also
you know this recent work that we've
done with flip chip and 3d integration
and through substrate through-silicon
vias so
I don't know the answer but it'll be a
big number because I've found quite
exciting that you have see flip-chip
technique already working and that you
had took first t1 t2 time measurements
actually a singer only solves a t1 time
you have t2 measurements already -
they're similar in fact I didn't show
them but we do now have t2 times
measured and it's on the order of t1 so
yeah in fact the echo time is twice t1
and I think that because t1 came down a
little bit we can get in that code time
to be twice - you on with no problem and
in our best qubits you know t1 is maybe
50 microseconds and we get close to an
echo time of 90 microseconds so just shy
of twice do you want but in these qubits
where we flip chip them it's really
twice do you want AV people just say
that there are some questions from
people on the other side of say video
conferencing system so if there are some
questions that will face you in so you
can ask
I see Eddie's there on the screen yeah I
have a question
so how general an interaction can you
get between qubits so the more than
Sigma Z Sigma Z and say you know it's
and Sigma X is what how general can you
be yeah so the the idea or the scheme
that we have now that we're trying to
demonstrate would be able to do an
arbitrary interaction between two qubits
where you can think of an angle that
we're tuning between Sigma X Sigma X and
Sigma Z Sigma Z so we can we can you
know on paper we can do it and I think
now we need to demonstrate it thank you
yeah so you can turn on those with
arbitrary strengths you know between the
two Lou thank you for a very thank you
very much appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
