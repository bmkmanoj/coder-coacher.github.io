thank you all for checking the time I
would like to introduce the speaker
today balaji Parker is a professor at
Stanford University he teaches computer
networking and a lot of related stuff he
he has done a lot of groundbreaking work
in the and lately he has digressed into
the field of traffic jams and how
incentives can be used to to prevent
some of those traffic jams and he's done
an actual experiment so which has been
fairly successful and he's going to
review the results of that experiment it
was done in bangalore india which is
pretty much the worst egg traffic is the
example out there today so without
taking much of your time i'll hand over
the mic to biology thank you abba shake
thank you all for coming the good thing
is that you can think about this as
you're going home today there's gonna be
some extra time on the road for you
quick we all normal traffic jams and how
bad it can be but do you know how
traffic looks in bangalore do you have a
sense for it the people who travel to
bangalore we heard horror stories okay
it's probably like a bee shake sad you
know the one on the top two worst
traffic um yeah
sports on the planet this is not this is
a very fast-moving and speed it up video
of hyderabad and bangalore is way worse
there isn't an appropriate video to show
you just how bad traffic is and why it
is that way it's just people just
driving as they please and things work I
mean there are you know 20 km/h you can
afford to do things like this but
anything more and you're in trouble so
this is sort of what you know happens
under the newspapers in India are all
about how bad traffic looks and so let
me start off into my talk on incentive
mechanisms okay so this is joint work
with 90 Gomes and Deepak guru who are
here and Rama from infosys technologies
in Bangalore and many people from
infosys and Kadena krishna whose student
or Stanford what did we do well we came
up with some incentive mechanisms and
tried them out but what's the there's a
broader theme to the work I've sort of
observed in the last year I want to
sketch it out for you why is it that for
computer science and electrical
engineering or economics type people
that a topic like this is interesting so
let's consider this societal networks
right societal networks are networks
like this that we use in society like
transportation networks electricity
networks and recycling systems you can
throw in sewage systems and utility
systems and all of these as well and for
an operational definition of these
networks let's go you know let's give it
a sort of a an engineering style
definition something we can do something
with so here's my attempt at it so
societal networks are a network that
enables society to consume the resources
they need
through a combination of technological
mechanisms and you under lie on their
efficiency on the correctness of human
actions so whether we choose to turn off
the lights whether we choose to recycle
or not as a big impact on how efficient
the systems are so for us say computer
scientists the interesting areas to
engage our this technology can be a lot
better you know North's very
surprisingly lot of these networks
retain an architecture and a method of
deployment that's at least 50 years old
okay and they haven't you know we talked
about ossification of the Internet in
computer networks research how it's
difficult to do anything for the
internet without you know being worried
about retrofitting your solution it's
way worse than these kind of networks so
their people don't touch these things
right for fear of you know getting into
work again so it's really important for
us to consider this is better technology
and you know if we can build all we want
if it's not correct users not made of it
then it can be very inefficient so just
to give you an example I was giving a
talk like this in Bangalore and the
energy secretary for the state of
Karnataka where bangalore to which
bangor belongs mentioned this problem of
irrigation so the electrical networks
feed this arable land where these
farmers get water supplied to them or
the electricity that pumps that
generates that the runs the electric
pumps that that feeder line is you know
the electricity board turns it on at
four in the morning and so then you can
irrigate your lands at four in the
morning the water doesn't evaporate
immediately so you know it's better use
of the water but of course for in the
morning is very early farmers are all
still bad but of course the previous
night every farmer has left the pump in
the on position right and then gone to
bed now you see what happens right a
circuit breakers trip keep doing this a
few times
and it's a big headache it's a problem
where everything had everybody has the
right intention and yet it just seems
like a massive you know focused learning
problem that we were just manufactured
right and he was asking what incentive
mechanisms will you deploy here I'm
saying well this is true i mean
technologically it's trivial because you
just have a randomized the timer at
every pump it's it's completely easy
problem for any you know person to do so
this is sort of thing you could do and
it's a big deal you can just simply you
know engaging in this many examples many
situations where problems that seem out
of one's control actually become very
amenable to a treatment so let me just
start off with this pop quiz this is
intended for everybody in particular for
students so you'll see this you know
we've all seen places like that Texas
Transportation Institute has a study and
they put out this number what do you
think is the number that captures the
total wasted dollars in time and fuel in
2005 its cost in the sense that all the
fuel that's burnt waiting in traffic
it's definitely a waste it could have
been avoided if congestion wasn't there
right so d yep sir obviously it's like a
big number but if we calibrated against
other big numbers we've seen recently
it's like you give 25 billion to the
auto guys so they can bail them out and
then they build cars and you know blue
80 billion right this is this is 2005
gas prices by the way right so it's
three billion gas gallons wasted in
congestion according to the study it's a
study of foreign and 37 you know urban /
semi-urban sort of centers in the US but
what a three billion gallons mean it's
all the fuel is consumed in the US over
six days okay this is a pretty serious
amount of wastage da you know in
concurring
now similarly let's look at recycling
systems in California you get five cents
for returning soda cans or bottles of
water oh you know plastic or bottle if
they're less than 22 ounces and then
it's ten cents if is bigger how many
states in the u.s. do you think have the
so-called bottle bill or container
deposition law where you do get a refund
you want to just guess five well it
turns out to be 11 slightly better but
very far from 50 right that's the point
right and seven states are still
campaigning and if you wanna know what
the states are the green ones have it
the blue ones are in the waitlist but
why why why why is there a wait list and
why isn't it just spontaneous everybody
can do it well part of the problem is of
course not how many of you go and
collect the five cents zero right sir
it's cost to you so the beverage
manufacturers understand this long you
know if I sell a can of whatever soda
for fifty cents and you pay me five
cents extra for this law that is ten
percent of the cost and you know your
ongoing claim it well then I'm gonna be
not interested in getting the charge put
on it right so it's so there's there's
things to worry about you know what's
the right way to do it can we make
recycling simple and easy and effective
right I'm sure you know we have some
ideas and we're happy to discuss this
with you offline but let me get to the
oh here's an interesting thing how many
cans do you think we consumed in 2008
just can't is no bottles or plastic or
anything see well this is a trick
question such as sneaky professors are
in the habit of asking why is bigger
than ten times bigger than you thought
right so it's a staggering number if
everything I had five cents on it that's
four billion dollar stuck in I'm you
know recycling recyclables right so and
it costs 20 times the energy to make
aluminum can from or
than to just reuse or recycle sing
aluminum can somebody needs to we were
just dialing can you please mute ok so
don't like there's a recycling facility
that I went to recently and then you
know or there's all this aluminum cans
that get magnetized in the fly off the
conveyor belt is a very interesting
process it's been around for many years
perhaps we can even improve the
efficiency of these kind of things so
that's all I'm going to do by way of
general background so let me get into
transportation and congestion pricing
which is the theme of my talk right and
this is a one slice summary of what our
whole approaches about so for those of
us who are familiar with computer
network some of these teams are we've
already been through this in the
telephone and computer networks or
dichotomy in the lay in the late 80s and
early 90s so conditioned pricing in this
there's good economic arguments in favor
of it the most common goes back to
William victory in 69 and it's a
so-called tragedy of Commons if you give
away a good like Road use for free then
it's going to suffer from overuse okay
and therefore you need to price it and
congestion prices have been levied in
these places like London Stockholm
Singapore and they're effective in
addressing congestion I mean to various
degrees and but then they also not
unpopular unpopular for the not popular
for various reasons like you know a
citizen's complaint that whiny just call
it yet another tax and that's all it is
and it's undemocratic in the sense that
it favors the rich and it's expensive
deploy you know it takes a lot to figure
out whether people have paid or not
right there's no turnstile which opens
if you enter London you're just driving
around and you could be someone who
hasn't paid how do I know that well I
scan your license plate numbers then I
check against my record so it's a pretty
intense video surveillance program in
London and in Stockholm okay singapore
uses an rfid tags
so it's a pretty expensive system this
is reminiscent to us of the telephone
network type in our system where all
intelligences inside the network the end
systems are done one could consider
flipping that like we did in the
internet put intelligence in the way
khals that's one thing we could do and
for example cell phone gps type things
exist now but on the economic side we're
saying let's make it a market let's
charge the congestion and pay the Deacon
jesters right and the system gets to
keep some money to run it selves but you
know the main goal of congestion pricing
is actually to get rid of congestion and
to encourage people who helped to
decongest okay and so that's one major
sort of theme and then this how to
deploy it and perhaps if we you know
we've seen that we could deploy it
incrementally it's not necessary for
everybody if you if you declare a
behavior incentive for your congestion
pricing scheme then you're just saying
I'm gonna induce a behavior in the
commuter that leads to D congestion I'm
not going to promise to reduce
congestion itself there's a little again
like the internet you know best effort
service what's that promise is nothing
right so it can actually take off the
contrasted to the other systems other
other types and networks that people are
considering like ATM for example it was
promising too much right so congestion
is not an easy thing to get rid of you
can promise how you haunt it's not very
easy to deliver on it so we're saying
let's bless this lesson the goals okay
so there are three things make it a
market put their intelligence in the
vehicles consider lessening the goal
from getting rid of congestion to you
know increasing decongesting behavior
okay so let's see how this all worked
out in a particular deployment and
you'll see that it's very context
dependent right so that's why
experimental economics is different from
experimental physics because they're on
the same experiment on different days
different places you're different
answers and there's nothing wrong with
it as a science that's what you suppose
that's how authorities right so please
you know feel free to ask me questions
or otherwise you know
orient the discussion so there are two
main ideas that we have one of which
I've already mentioned to you which is
this right to congest can be made into a
tradable commodity and this is incentive
compatible in the sense that the
congestion and the decongest about
encouraged to participate registering
encounters reduced congestion and the
deccan gesture is you know paid for
yielding the road to the congestive ok
and again sort of you know going on with
this networking analogy if you look at
the the delay versus load curve in any
network system we always see this sort
of you know when the when the load is
small delay is small but as Lord
approaches capacity which is normalized
to be one here you see the delay goes to
infinity right this is canonical and so
if you go to a congested network and
reduce the load by about five percent
then the corresponding reduction in
delay is a lot more than five percent I
because sort of just quickly saturates
now the question is which five percent
are going to drop out well let the
market decide it ok so that's all in all
we aiming for some five percent you just
volunteer right that's what we want so
let's see how that you know can be
caused a second thesis that will use
what's you know there used to be a lemma
here and I think I've taken it out just
you know I just noticed it but it's a
there's a statement in this in the
theory of expected utility maximization
which says that in the game with low
stakes players are more risk seeking so
the point is if the market decides the
condition price is actually not eight
pounds like it's in London but perhaps
twenty five pence or fifty pence who's
gonna yield the road for 50 / humph
who's expected I mean how do you expect
anybody to travel you know half an hour
earlier half not later just on the
promises of fifty pence that's just two
smaller sum of money right so don't give
them fifty pounds put it into a lottery
and then draw and then pay them you know
I 100 pounds or thousand pounds or
whatever right well advertised lottery
scheme
and that's the auxiliary thesis right so
is every ok this what I just said that
that that this is something else we use
because sums of money can just
dramatically come down then what do you
do right so how do you keep the deccan
gesture interested well first of all
they should benefit from from the
decongesting behavior it's not like a
decongest is gonna be happy with some
small arts lottery if they basically you
know don't get to come here at all right
so so that's the sort of thing we tried
now will tell you how it went there's a
lot of related literature like I said
I'm going to skip over this this is from
a conference that we just had last week
natural economics conference last week
or two weeks ago and it's just you know
FYI in case you want to look at it the
notable paper is by victory here is the
so-called quantity of Commons phenomenon
where free goods tend to get over over
this is the grazing that he was talking
about the grounds the Commons where
cattle can graze for free belongs to the
entire village but then it usually
suffer from over grazing okay so that
was the starting point and then it so it
went let me just get into this project
the instant project here is the for
those of you who haven't been to
Bangalore or don't know how it looks
geographically this is how it looks now
it's also changed his name to Bengaluru
and what it what's happened is that
there's something that used to be called
Kolb angular which is very small in area
226 quite kilometers now there's a
greater bangalore because the city's
just grown dramatically almost doubled
in in its population over the last 15
years and so the greater banglar area is
that bigger circle most people live here
but they work in this place called be
down there bees electronic city I hope
you can read it but I'll point it out
you this is electronic city which is an
economic development zone so it's
cheaper to have your big companies there
so Infosys is there others like wipro
siemens HP they're all over there and
this 15 kilometer road
infamous 15 collaborative road it's a
national highway you can see the
national highway number seven it's
called hustle road and everybody you
know lives inside that red ellipse and
commutes down so it's a little bit of a
funnel right it's like you know there's
a congestion and it's all about crossing
you know leaving there's there's a road
show you in a different map you have to
cross this point just essentially here
before 730am if that's the case you had
a great day it's a fantastic commute day
for you if you stuck on the other side
inside the red ellipse at seven-thirty
then you come here now just went a
factor of two two and a half times
longer okay so that's the problem it's a
very where it's not it's not very
different from the Bay Bridge problem
this crowd that comes from Sacramento on
eastbay just in baybridge similar this
is like a phase transition right that's
well known problem and you can replace
the names of these you know things and
sort of morph it into a problem here
it's also similar to the problem from
New Jersey to New York for example you
know commuters face this so so you know
you can sort of weave this as a problem
of a general time yes do they have HOV
lanes no they don't ah they barely have
lanes right meaning it's not even clear
there's a lane sometimes right sir
certainly nobody drives like there's a
link right sir so here's a one slide
synopsis of the instant project or
instant stands for infosys Stanford
traffic project okay and what synopsis
is that was launched on october sixth as
a pilot we ran it for six months until
april 10th and the results are
summarized as there are a total of
twenty thousand people working at
infosys in bangalore of which 14,000
were eligible for the scheme because the
others were either based that the base
was not bangalore's they belong the
Bangalore payroll system
and they weren't alone to the banger
office or little contractors right so
these people who aren't eligible
everybody else was eligible whether you
took the company buses so you drove
yourself in our public transport
whatever you're eligible so of the
14,000 employees we will see that
essentially the number of people
traveling a design congested time of
earlier and then 730 crossing the point
i will show you very precisely what the
times were doubled okay compared to the
historical data and the total of you
know when you have 14,000 employees
certainly you can't pay them all if all
of them choose to come early there isn't
enough money to go around to make it
interesting so we paid this this lottery
style thing and the average winner the
average money taken by the window was
twenty-eight dollars if we had
essentially doled this out as a constant
amount of money to split the jackpot
that is then it ruined her amounted to
more than ten rupees okay which is an
interesting nobody's gonna wake up like
half an hour earlier to just get like
ten rupees that's there's not even a cup
of coffee okay so we'll see exactly what
sums of money were involved okay so
quickly then the Infosys bus fleet
consists of around 240 buses into
fluctuates 220-240 seasonal and and and
and you know size of commuter population
dependent and they have actually does
january 2005 that commuting data is
available in this very nice detailed
form for many years we looked at 2005
january 2008 june but if you look at
this spreadsheet bus number 54 on a
certain day and this is available for
every day picked up at 7am from this
place called j nagar fourth block 18th
main that that's the intersection it
came into Infosys at seven thirty two am
so it's 32 minute commute time the bus
has 49 seats but there were 61 people so
12 people are standing okay other buses
had spared
pacity so empty seats okay she got
journey time and occupancy numbers okay
so now if you look at the commuters what
buses they chose to take over the data
the duration of the data we looked at
the total number of commuters went up
that's the green line but more and more
people are preferring to come in in the
later buses right that they're the wrong
number of early commuters was going down
so you had this sort of trance for
traveling at the later time which is the
heavily congested time now what happened
of course was that you know these buses
were crowded in the later times and
commuters were demanding that more buses
be deployed this is true for any public
transport system as well I mean
everybody goes in the peak time when the
peak time you know there's just isn't
enough room and big complaint from the
commuters is have more way khals and so
all public transport systems are
capacitated for just peek right so if
you go to the pecan drop it by five
percent that's just five percent savings
in the fleet for the public transport
entity okay so they can't run them fast
enough okay so that's happening here
happened here and if you look inside the
buses this is showing you how many buses
on the y-axis had how many people okay
so the blue bars correspond to the early
buses so this number here means for
example now this means like roughly five
or six buses in the month of June had
between 41 and 45 people when the total
capacity is 49 okay now this is these
red bars of showing you that these buses
are over capacity and in fact there are
50 50 buses that had more than you know
seven or eight people beyond capacity
that's the average monthly average and
so you know these buses had all these
come you know people standing and
unfortunately for them they were
standing for an extra long period of
time this shows you the commute times
again monthly averages from this place j
nagar which is popular that is a lot of
commuters come from here
and if you left her the 615 am time so
there's not exactly once lot of time but
you know there's a range but let's call
it 615 that was the earliest time so you
you basically had a 30-minute commute
time okay that is that's the propagation
delay okay but if you love to sound 45
is still okay you got a 40 or minute
commute time but then later it's 475
that's the average and the variance
numbers are pretty huge at these times
and not so bad here I mean there's a
paper that has the variance numbers in
case you want to look at it so you sat
in crowded buses and you had a longer
commute time and this is also true for
other popular starting points like the
others garden and this minerva circle
same thing so we showed this to the
commuters at the end of the june two
thousand eight so deeper cause who had
access to this data just collect all
this result so sure it and said now that
you see that is you will have a more
comfortable ride in a shorter ride you
will all get up early tomorrow and then
just we thought this was happening to
happen right obviously didn't and the
reasons were interesting the reasons
were at least will some of the
complaints we heard were it's a
team-oriented type of work therefore
there's no point in me coming at eight
thirty in the morning with the rest of
my teams coming at ten right that's one
of the things the other thing was i may
need to stay longer in the evening to
make a phone call overseas therefore
i'll be coming in later tomorrow the
next day and then this persists you come
in late you go late you come you know so
this is kind of things we heard but it
is young workforce you know the average
a is pretty small they have a lot of
income so you know late nights and
sleeping in it's like grad students at
lots of money right so why wouldn't you
know you'll enjoy life as it wha so we
said okay and then and then they were
sort of also skeptical so you i come in
early like 830 or 8 9am but no matter
when I go home I'm gonna be stuck in bad
traffic right
banglore after 730am the traffic only
drops at 9pm or 10pm so what's the point
of so the perception was right this is
people have very intuitive feeling of
congestion they they come in with like
personal strong personal opinions so we
said when we just stick some GPS device
and see actually what the actual times
look like right so we ran this I'm gonna
not show you the video data there's
already something you've seen right
Larry deeper than I was seeing this bus
and we showed what the road looks like
at 630am or 7am people hadn't seen this
right a lot of them were just hadn't
seen what's our name looks like so we
showed them right this one was something
i'm just going to show you the gps and
what we're going to do is just race
these two buses there's a 615 am busting
815 am boss and they were both starting
at the same place and coming to the same
place and we're gonna race them like
this so the blue dog and the yellow dot
are going to the same place just at
different times so as you can see one
guy is just already reached but that has
about this this category commuters about
fifteen percent of the population right
the remaining eighty-five percent are
stuck over there quite far away from the
destination this actually had a chilling
effect right people are like everybody's
looking at themselves sitting in a bus
so you know its 29th minute commuting
time versus 82 then when this evening
numbers were also fairly revealing so if
you left at 5pm you're on your way home
on the guys just over there we heard a
lot of things from commuters like you
know the the ransom their own
optimization algorithms exist where this
this this place this road this bend in
the road is infamous it's called silk
board or BTM layout and various unit
tests and it's a massive bottleneck and
we were sitting this bus and around this
bender like seven or eight infosys buses
where you can see around been like over
there is another person and a height of
them is another bus and so on so this
commuter basically told us like you know
if you get off
just bus walk over the bus over there
that's 30 seconds of walking time yeah
but you'll save about 10 minutes journey
time right so if I'm late for a meeting
I'll jump out of this bus and run over
the bus that's all okay great now this
is an optimization that they've all come
up with right so so you can see you know
again you know you save about 45 or
minutes in the evening and similar time
in the morning so we just ran this and
then it was a little bit more it was
long large town hall meetings right
she's very interactive people you know
were telling us what they thought so we
ran this and it was a little bit more
conviction if first of all in US but
also they were a little bit more
convinced so the summary of this whole
data is a long time no seat and what I'm
handing out is pamphlets so if you can
just look at it and return them you know
we advertise the scheme the buses you're
gonna see there so this is the very bus
on which they commute ok so the photo of
the vehicle that they're commuting and
we ran this scheme explaining all this
benefits in a website that you know you
can have shorter commute times you have
more comfortable rights you save a lot
of fuel costs fuel cost savings exist
and so perhaps one way to subsidize
monetize this whole incentive mechanism
is to take that fuel costs and apply and
give it back to the commuters that is
does that come and the uncongested times
so this is a lot in a lottery in a sort
of the incentive mechanism we ran and so
the way it works is let's look at the
commuters arrival time and if their
arrival time happened to me before a
tame then they earned one and a half
credits on that day and if they arrived
between eight and eight-thirty aim then
they earned a one credit and you'd there
for her a credit history it's like a
frequent flyer program ok it's lie no
he's earned a credit history and your
credit history every week this was used
to choose winners I inside the mechanism
got your credit history and then it had
the money you know given to it
and so the Pyramid of rewards looks like
this we had ninety six thousand rupees
which is around 2000 2003 no dollars
depending on exchange rates available to
us so the pyramid looks like this in the
sense that the bottom level requires at
least three credits for your qualified
at the bottom level and you could earn
five hundred rupees as a reward if you
won over here and there are 48 such
crises available and at the topmost
level is twelve thousand rupees and
there were two such prizes and you
needed at least 20 points to get into
that top level okay so this is how we
had the Pyramid of rewards yes right I
think they will but one of the reasons
we wanted something for everybody was to
climb to the top of 14,000 it's a long
way so we didn't want people to not even
start right so you know many people
started as you see during the the
history the histogram of this thing is
after three months people began to sort
of join and change their behavior so we
wanted something for them that's that's
the bottom level but we're relaunching
this well enforce assists are announced
well at least let us know that they want
to now do this sort of permanently but
in all of their eight development
centers in india so one of the things
that's come up is people who have been
consistently coming early and doing the
right thing losing out just by the luck
of the draw to other people and it's
very irritating it's like you know how
come this are the person that i know
started three months ago suddenly is
winning an hour has one or and i haven't
won at all right so we would like to
make a little bit of what you're saying
give some deterministic choices non non
random amounts out to the absolute top
but then the rest are encouraged to
participate now this is the way we did
it was
you know imagine that this is how people
stacked up with the different levels for
example there are three people this week
at the top level qualified for the top
level and two for the second level and
so on the way the scheme worked was the
goals were that the more you the more
points you had the higher the prices you
could win which is clearly true by the
nature experiment process the better the
odds that you want something at all okay
so we will draw from the top two of
those three were picked out and given
this twelve thousand rupee prizes and
just to calibrate twelve thousand rupees
are around a third or a half of a
month's salary for the the the grades of
employment in the bottom grade where a
lot of the employees were there were a
lot of employees this translates 12,000
translates tomorrow a third a half of
the monthly salary roughly speaking okay
so wasn't it wasn't insubstantial so
they were happy to win that and the
person who did not win at the top level
and in our societal networks you never
say loser there's there is you say known
winner right it's like the right this
sunday right in computer networks we do
all sorts of things to pack a semi we
drop them me we scramble them the
feelings don't get hurt right he hardly
a little bit more sensitive right so I
learnt not that I said anything but it's
you know you sort of understand that
this is so the people who didn't win at
the top were automatically qualified for
the next level so we drew them for the
second level of prices and you know in
this case it so happens there are few
people in prizes so which never happened
but you know it can so you give them the
prizes and push the money down and then
keep going then these people are
automatically qualified for the next
level keep going and so at the end of
the week straw you had a list of winners
and you had a list of non-winners and
you subtracted points from the winners
by some amount and from the losers by
some other smaller amount and just
reached you know when to gain that's it
right it's a little like redeeming your
frequent flyer miles that's it so you're
congo DR bunch of points that's
basically it ok so r you ok with this ok
so as you can see that that's it you
wanna cheer all our goals with the
scheme of like you know trying to reward
the more consistent be you know early
commuter but of course it's a randomness
element which we're gonna address the
results are historical data is here and
the end of the experiment is here ok so
the experiment was launched around here
ok 6th or october and compare the
historical data we more or less double
the number of early comers in every
category meaning 8am before 8am before
813 before nine so for example let's
look before nine around 4200 or 4500
people are coming before nine in the
historical data and that's now up to
nine thousand or so and so this is sort
of a trend that you know sustained but
there was a fantastic social aspect of
this it's line you know because in the
company you know who typically you know
you know if your body is one and that
made people will aspire to win and all
the other reasons like you know what's
the point of me coming early if the rest
of my teams come in he hate with this
scheme it was more like well i hope i
come early and everybody else comes late
right so then you know so it sort of
because the game theoretic aspect kicks
in right so it's a lot of these things
just went away and then people could
break the cycle of having stayed back
late one or two days either for phone
calls or for you know this project
related you know walk and and then
shifting their pattern from a morning
person to an evening person they could
break back into the so there were
various sort of consequences okay now if
you look at the average commute time on
the y-axis versus the months during
which we ran the scheme it came down
from our 70 and a half minutes
around 54 minutes averaged across the
entire bus commuter population and so
the person are saved you know there are
the numbers and it's not that the
company's got it nor the commuters got
it but it's Camilla has it in you know
for their life right that is they could
they could devote this time into their
own personal you know for their own
personal benefit so this is one thing we
saw then of course the interesting
question is what happens after the
scheme discontinued okay so there's a
sticky aspect to having the price we
have made available so it sort of
bounced back right a little bit as of me
we haven't unpaired the numbers but the
good good news is that in a sense is
that the same commuters have complained
about crowded buses in the later times
and a redeployment of the fleet towards
the later time now began to insist or
demand the buses come earlier right so
we had a number of letters mailed to us
or email sent to us and and the
Transportation Department where they
were complaining about how some drivers
are just too slow or the too chatty they
talked to their colleagues in the bus
depot wasting time while there could be
like getting these guys early so they
can swipe in right and we got complaints
from the drivers saying you know these
people used to come and just like sleep
in the bus or text or whatever you know
listen to their music now like the guy
is like that outside my cabin like
banging on the thing and saying look at
745-8 can you step on it because we need
to go and swipe in and things like this
and we also got an email saying my
building is further away from the depot
so I can be a tame is my swipe in time
it should be 805 am right cuz I need
extra walking time otherwise it's not
fair things like this right so people
began to really care about the minutes
of that day and so I have a letter here
which is you know if I have time at the
end I'll read it out to you it's like it
was a fun fun email for us to receive
because it's like that the guy's taken
like three fourths of a page just to
complain
what is one driver okay who he doesn't
like and then he prefers his other
driver I'll reader I mean it's all about
just get me into work so I can swipe in
right so and then when card readers
weren't working we got all sorts of
complaints so the interesting project
very different from the other kind of
things that we've been doing so here
that I just wants the bus schedule as of
februari this is how many buses got
advanced by how much time so there were
some buses that will move by five
minutes this is a 757 arrival became a
sound 52 arrival giving people more time
that sort of thing and some by 10
minutes son by 15 and the blast
categories these buses used to arrive
after 830am but they all moved arrive
before a 30m so more people could
participate in this instance scheme okay
so this is somehow a permanent fix right
this is there I mean because this takes
about a month there negotiator the bus
company they have to reschedule their
fleet and it's like it's some it takes
I'm doing ok so I'll conclude the talk
the presentation what are the next steps
well well first of all you know this is
a one of the nice fun experiments that
you know but shows this it is worth
considering a market approach to
congestion pricing and it's more widely
applicable in the sense that there are
these other entities that we've spoken
to what Stanford's problem I don't know
if you know this Stanford is a huge
problem with it the number of people
that arrive into Stanford and depart
from Stanford is it's supposed to be a
very precisely you know there's a cap on
it the county of santa clara beats us up
by refusing to issue permits for
buildings and other things because we're
not allowed to bring in people or take
them out in excess of some number and
that there's a the worst one hour in the
morning and the worst one hour in the
evening cannot have more than I think
it's 5,300 or people entering or exiting
ok
so you know all these campaigns in the
back of a Stanford bus that's a parking
lot so we have the Provost's office
spends a fair amount of money on this
and it's pretty open loop at the moment
it's like you know build it or give
people free bus passes or give them
money if they give up obtaining a
parking permit it's called clean air
cash so it's not usage-based there's no
more you know monitoring of how people
are doing various things so one thing
we're considering is moving to a RFID
sort of parking tags and then figuring
out how the when people are coming and
then giving back some money from the
parking fees because you all know
parking fees are like a big thing in the
university right parking for faculty is
this is dissolved the great american
university needs to have beer for
students sports for alumni i'm parking
for faculty right this is the great sort
of this oral this is what every
president sort of you know has in their
mind when they assume the office at a
university right so this parking is a
big revenue generating thing but we're
happy to give back some money let's say
you know ten to send twenty percent
depending on how infrequently of travel
during peak times okay and there's other
entities like cambridge UK has the
county of Cambridge has been told by the
UK government that if they give
themselves a what they call it demand
management scheme which is the euphemism
for pricing scheme they will get 500
million pounds right to deploy and
there's a lot of interesting reasons why
Cambridge is facing this problem most
notably the Londoners has moved into
Cambridge and sort of taken up a lot of
property then and driven the prices are
so the regulars people who live and
teach the university and live in city of
Cambridge have been pushed out the
commute this is driven congestion levels
higher and they find the sort of an
incentive approach possibly more humane
right our oh it's an easy it's a more
politically expedient order at any rate
it's people politicians find it easier
to say
we're gonna be like the Robin Hood's
right we're gonna charge the congested
and give the Deacon justice money back
so that's that's the and this now not in
fall 2009 but spring 2010 i'm going to
teach a course on no tour of course i'll
share with networking sorry we are
algorithms right so we interesting to
see how this goes should be fun finally
you know there's a discussion we want to
have what google this is an interesting
the last project here listed here is an
interesting oh there's a banger bus
service folks are potentially going to
use the scheme starting october to reap
load balance their bus fleet you know
this for those of you seen like the
caricature the typical image of the
indian train or bus is like people on
the roof people like coming out of the
windows bus early you know swaying under
the weight of the people that's not you
know once like in six months or
something it happens every day and this
load which is one hundred sixty percent
during peak time needs to be shifted
somewhat to the off-peak time and why
would the share I mean it's just first
of all safer it's blah blah but why
would people shift well just because
we're gonna give them incentive right
sir there's this fleet called a big ten
bus service which was launched in
February and they might do this it also
allows the public transportation folks
to put introduce the peak size you know
for the size of the fleet potentially
right so that's an interesting
experiment but this could be another one
where you for the general that's you
know we talked about a private in a
large private corporation or or entity
like Infosys or Stanford we've talked
about the public system public
transportation system of their problems
what about the typical commuter or
citizen of a certain place well they
could get into a commuter program where
we will monitor their Road use and make
recommendations as to when they could
travel this allows us potentially to be
able to schedule people by knowing
everybody's preferences an urban
commuting or our urban congestion is all
about the same people making two trips
right one in the morning from home to
work and the other way around at the
same time so if all we you know if you
could stagger this a bit and stick an
incentive so that our recommendations
are taken oh you know then all we
looking for the five percent to just
shift themselves right so we'll see how
that goes okay that's about it thank you
very much right so the congested they
have a monthly bus pass fee the question
is harder the congested get charged okay
the month there was a monthly bus pass
fee and the seven rupees that I put down
per week is the cool and amount of money
in here the charge an extra amount of
money to each for each to each bus pass
the bus pass fees are around thousand
rupees a month right now so that went up
two thousand twenty five thousand thirty
that's one possible way but the way the
experiment ran was that we had you know
been given the money from some bus pass
surplus or something that's infosys
money but looking into the future
because of all the incidental benefits
that the scheme was had the commuters
are more happy to come in early they had
been demanding not just the redeployment
of the fleet to later times / also
keeping the cafeteria is open for
breakfast infosys is not different from
google in the style of campus nice
pretty campus lot of cafeterias right
but they're closed for breakfast or 930
and then so as to be able to open for
lunch 1130 now they were demanding that
the CAF just be kept open longer and
various other things like this right so
looking forward is possible in the
Infosys case the company is gonna do it
whereas at Stanford for example you're
already paying the parking fees we're
just gonna return some a portion of
money back to you and it's possible that
a small amount of fee increase takes
place I was having lunch with your oh
there is how okay and he just told me
this thing where
howler needs to be in Berkeley is a
professor now he's he's a wreckin amidst
here and he was saying hi house I'm just
telling them you're the story that he
told me about how if if a university
professor salary I'm parking rates
increases the same rate but in ten years
harlington percent of your salary equals
your parking fees right so right so this
is exactly right so so you see that this
is you know there exists methods that
are straight forward like this so charge
a little bit more everybody and then pay
out as a lottery or or or even just
deterministically if we return two
hundred dollars from your parking fees
that'll be very valuable
at the moment I'm encouraged more than
not right one year ago Deepak and I were
just having a very precise conversation
like this like we have no clue right so
this is the experimental economics sort
of world where you have no clue what
people are gonna do and just because it
worked at infosys in bangalore doesn't
mean is gonna work or Stanford or
somewhere here but to give you an idea I
had a conversation last week in Seattle
with the Washington State Department of
Transportation people and there's the
same problem right there's Redmond
Redmond in the east and Seattle in the
west and this 520 this this is two
bridges connecting these places
massively congested and there's a move
to having toll charge but differential
toe so it's there's a toll for just
collecting money to maintain the bridges
but differentials us the congestion
whose effects are sort of reflected in
the tools so peak time is higher than
off big time but they can't do more than
a factor one and a half or two
differential because it's just it's
difficult to charge twenty dollars a
peak time and then two dollars the
off-peak time so it doesn't make much of
a sense right so it's not clear how much
traction they'll get both with the
population and we'll put in with
politicians right so with an incentive
mechanism something simple like you know
like 10 coffees and affluent one is free
so you come 10 times let's say across
the bay here 10 times on dumbarton or
something and during the uncongested
time on the 11th time is free for
example is going to have a response
because you're going to cross the road
anyway always saying is do it half an
hour earlier right because not like the
Seattle people don't have to go to
redmond to what they have to go the same
story in bangalore right it's a
necessary commute we just having stagger
it
right uh not not no the Sanford scheme
you get if you don't get a parking if
you don't get a parking permit its
purchase a parking permit then they will
give you this what's called clean air
cash and is equal to something like
three hundred dollars which is the cost
of the lowest parking lowest you know
parking greater parking sticker right so
it's just because you go and then they
give free they give bus pass bus passes
for free and Caltrans tickets as well or
passes right so there are for sure those
kind of things in place and this is just
saying for sure people are going to
still come you no matter what people
have vehicles they're gonna drive
basically right it's a tragedy of
Commons problem if you don't address it
it's gonna just give us
so
right so why do people need an incentive
and what aspect of the incentive is
interesting to them that's that's the
question so we as you know at the
beginning of the early part of the talk
like I said that you know we did try to
explain to people that if you come
earlier it's better for you nothing
happened and the I think the typical
reason is simply that people are
accustomed to your time there's a rhythm
to everybody's lives right and you know
and the bus is like they're not driving
themselves so it felt it feels okay
although the feeling is it's taking away
time from their lives and so on right so
nothing happened in other words until
the incentive mechanism was put in place
and as you saw after this mechanism was
removed people did in a revert so and
that since that's true around the world
we may assume that there's just a human
thing is nothing to do with people in a
certain place or whatever right now in
terms of what is it that people liked we
interviewed some other winners and we
also asked about what the impression was
butter sums of money involved in the
pyramid what if the top prize was
slightly less and so on right so how
much the money is actually interesting
many the money is interesting okay first
of all but it isn't the case that they
were just gonna commute early purely for
the money it's actually the recognizer
it's not that if going after the money
that's are changing the behavior that
it's actually they deliberate an hour
for themselves every day and so there's
that aspect to it as well but it is true
i think there's the social aspect needs
to be better understood thought it
seemed like at the end of the third or
fourth week when the third week the
money from the first week's winners the
first week's winner was discerned in the
early part of the second week and the
money hit the bank account in the third
week or so right suddenly there's an
uptick you know no matter how much
better tized earlier and everything the
fact that now money's going out through
the scheme it became like just
incredibly well known in the company
okay and then you know one guy who won
said that not only derive when after I
won the guy too
because from me started to come early
and he also ended up winning so it's
like great ok so I think people tend to
you know overestimate their probability
of winning if the null winner right
suddenly if we like well if he can win
it's not like a state lottery where I've
no idea who won right and and it's most
likely never gonna be me right here it's
like I know who won right so so there's
not a speck which we need to understand
a little better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
