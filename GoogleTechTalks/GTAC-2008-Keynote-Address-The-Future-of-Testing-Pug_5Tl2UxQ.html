of Microsoft he spent his career in
software testing he was an early thought
leader in model-based testing where his
PhD dissertation sorry James from the
University of Tennessee became a
standard reference on the subject while
a professor at Florida Tech he founded
the world's largest academic software
testing research center and help make
testing a degree track for
undergraduates before he left Florida
Tech his research group had grown to
over 60 students and faculty and had
secured 12 million in research awards
and contracts during his tenure at fi t
he wrote how to break software in the
series follow ups his research team also
developed the highly acclaimed runtime
fault injection to a holodeck and had
marketed it through their startup
security innovation James is a frequent
keynote speaker and has won numerous
presentation awards James Whittaker come
on vista oh the microphones on alright
thank you for the welcome let me just
get comfortable here hi I'm James
Whittaker I'm from Microsoft be nice to
me I will install on your laptop
Lydia thanks for the introduction I have
known you're going to read the whole
thing I might have put something
different in there but here we have it
I'm going to talk to you today about the
future of testing as I see it one of my
favorite quotes is that the best way to
predict the future is to invent the
future so I'm going to invent it today
see man how many of you all I can get to
help me work on this this is my second
favorite quote because I like magic I
think the idea that our industry
produces magic is incredibly accurate
and according to this definition we've
done things that most people consider to
be magic for example in 1953 these two
guys recognize that DNA had this double
helix structure and they modeled it
using the medium of Lincoln Logs now
once software was applied to this
starting in about nineteen ninety a
human genome project started I was
fortunate enough to be a graduate
student at the University of Tennessee
that had one of the first grants from
the NIH on this software was applied to
this problem and that's where the real
magic occurred right the entire genetic
structure of the human being between the
in these 13 years was mapped in its
entirety there's bits of it that are
wrong right there were competing models
Markov chains versus neural networks
versus genetic algorithms but the entire
human genome mapped within a 13-year
period this is magic the number of
diseases that will be cured because of
this the religious controversy this is a
wonderful thing and it was brought to
you by Matt by the magic of software you
know the human genome the DNA structure
was a nice invention but it took
software to apply the magic planetary
exploration the impact of software on
this has been absolutely phenomenal in
1969 was that some people have been been
speculating about planets orbiting
around other stars for
right all the way back to Newton and
Galileo in 1969 peter van de Kamp
explained wobbles in barnard star by the
presence of a planet 1.6 times a
jupiter-sized of Jupiter nowt he was
wrong and we didn't find out he was
wrong until 2000 about the year 2000 we
began to have very clear evidence that
there really is something out there
right there's something orbiting these
stars and by in 2003 the first one was
confirmed right how did we get there
from there might be something out there
to there definitely is something out
there it was software the software that
was used to design better telescopes and
scientific instruments and the software
that was used to look at the data on the
way back so in 2003 the first one was it
was discovered by 2006 because of the
magic of software over 200 exoplanets
were confirmed right not speculated
confirm this is software doing this I
just checked this morning 313 have now
been discovered as of 642 a.m. this
morning 313 exoplanets confirmed and it
will be software most experts agree
within our lifetime within our lifetime
or maybe maybe some of the younger
people in the audience
we'll lift today where my software
models will show that there is an
earth-like planet out there pretty
phenomenal kicks off we're out of the
equation we're still back to guessing
speculation like they were doing in 1969
this is a picture of an autistic girl I
don't know if you've seen this video on
YouTube watch it do yourself a favor I'm
at the link in the next slide so experts
have always agreed that the behavior of
autistic people is unpredictable random
and they've got problems right there
uncommunicative well it turns out that
this girl proved them all wrong by
producing her own youtube video about
what the language of autism means
through the magic of software we were
able to design a keyboard that she could
communicate with and interpret the half
an hour she spends playing with the
water and the faucet and what that means
what she's feeling she built this video
all the experts agree she shouldn't be
capable of doing that her mental
capacity should not allow her to be able
to do this it's been independently
verified by several different research
and news agencies she did this there's a
link look at this watch this video and
tell me that the magic of software isn't
real we have problems that we have yet
to solve we have global warming ok you
might disagree on how its cause but
everybody seems to agree plan is getting
hotter and you look at pictures like
this from all over the globe we have a
problem write it the computer models are
showing this is a situation that's
incompatible with human existence how
are we going to solve this except
without soft without software we have if
we have proposals on the table right now
how about we spray the atmosphere of the
planet with a chemical that will deflect
sunlight and if it deflects enough
sunlight the planet will cool and
everything will be ok
right well we're pretty good at spraying
chemicals into the atmosphere what is it
that we're going to use to figure out
the what-ifs and the maybes and the O's
and even the oche it's right because you
don't want one of those moments after
you sprayed the chemical you would
rather have that moment before you
sprayed the chemical alternate energy
all of the pieces of equipment that you
see here were designed using software
they were optimized using software they
were made better using software and the
next generation of alternate energy
sources take software out of the
equation go tell the people who are
researching this guy's you can't have
your computers or you can just have the
computers but you can never change the
software that's it take that tool off
the table and they'd all give up it's
the most powerful tool my except for the
human brain the most powerful tool that
these people have global finance is
injured Lydia is your your your quotes
were very interesting up there software
models predicted the kind of the current
situation that we're in now problem is
there is no history to believe them
because we haven't hit this before but
most major economic software models
predicted the situation that we're in
now so now we have precedent let's
listen to our software because software
has the unique capability of taking all
of these variables right consumer
spending habits the money supply blah
blah blah blah blah all of these
different variables that they affect the
economy there's one thing that has the
power of seeing through the data and its
software take software out of the
equation it's a lot harder to do curing
disease again tell the disease
researchers you can't have your software
you can't have your simulation you can't
do this we there are diseases that have
been eradicated from this planet because
of the existence of software there will
be diseases we have yet to see and
diseases that are right now human life
will be extended dozens and dozens of
years partly because of the brains
the medical researchers and partly
because software helping those medical
researchers do their job you take
software out of the equation and we have
a really serious problem software is a
one tool we need to save ourselves but
then there's the follow-on what's going
to save us from software now I could
stop talked about the fact that software
has been responsible for the loss of
human life I actually used to count
these in the papers i wrote for academia
i stopped counting when i got up to a
hundred thousand in a very quick sort of
review i I think it's easy to say we
could add another zero to that right to
the loss of human life not as a
byproduct of software but as a direct
result of software but that's too
depressing I don't want to talk about
that the loss of money and the loss of
life and all that stuff I want to look
at pictures this is a nice bug I like
this bug I mean you don't have to be
Norwegian to know that this route sucks
how do you say daddy are we there yet in
Norwegian I don't know what is it that's
going on here right denied is there a
I'd like a pub crawl through England
starting and Newcastle feature to this
or oh the wife's in the car don't drive
through Amsterdam you this is a great
way to deflect people to a competitor's
product
this microphone really is on isn't it so
I don't know what happened to your data
there's three pieces of it in Row one so
you can kind of remember what you lost
right it looks sort of like this do you
miss it and the menus are categorically
unhelpful and helping you retrieve said
data so this is a good one anybody
staying in a hotel what right so watch
carefully I've taken pieces out of this
to make the guilty more scared do you
see it see that little CGI parameter
it's called let me spell it out for you
it's called fee and it has 895 as a
parameter I don't know feed let's see
might that be the amount they're
charging me for internet access maybe
maybe they should have called it free
because we're in a testing conference
seems like I'm being overcharged for
that what if I just change it all right
now that's not you all our testers what
value are you really gonna enter here a
negative number right William Shatner's
right you really can't get a good deal
on a hotel this one's still active
ladies and gentlemen all right now I
remove some personal information from
this but this laptop likes to slide so
if it falls the talks over all right so
picture this this is Microsoft this is
my inbox on what does it say sep tember
14 2006 right we have this internal
conference we call blue hat in fact it
was just last week we invite the best
hackers in the world they come into
Microsoft and they hack our stuff live
Ryan shows show us what they can do what
kind of nastiness they can do well the
person who owns the blue hat mailing
alias which has 1275 people on it at
this time sent out a save-the-date blue
hats coming because microsoft is love
this stuff and this thing sells out
quicker maybe even quicker than gtech I
don't know maybe not
save the date sends it go to blue hat
calm for more details send right and
then realize this oh it's not blue hat
calm it's an internal website http whack
whack blue hat uses this message recall
functionality and outlook have you ever
done that Lydia's done it I'll bet right
your boss pisses you off you send this
nasty email right so yeah it's
registering in it and and you regret it
immediately and you recall it so if you
recall it what happens when you press
the recall is is if that message has
made it all the way to two Pat's inbox
in this case then you'll get back an
email that says message recall failure
because outlook won't take it out of
someone's inbox but if just made it to
the exchange server then it will and
you'll get back an email says message
recall succeeds so Lydia knows whether
or not Pat actually solve it the mail or
not so that's what happened here except
the problem was the person who sent this
sent it from the distribution list he
was logged on as the DL so he sends out
1275 emails realizes oh wrong recall so
twelve hundred and seventy-five recalls
go out 1275 message recall success or
failures come back to the aliases blast
them out the governor's any five people
so 1275 people get 1,275 emails through
math it's a lot for two hours that
morning we had to exchange service at
Microsoft doing nothing but edits goes
here this go see it this cuz it is here
yep yep yep right now that's not the bad
part so the entire company sort of slow
1275 people have this it's 175 people
going delete delete delete delete delete
but we're Microsoft we're too clever for
that someone you're in the middle of
deleting you're thinking maybe I should
write a script but you get an email
because there's always somebody faster
Microsoft and you are and the email says
run this script it'll clean your inbox
he said oh right and you run the script
but the script is software and it was
written by an idiot
and it didn't really did actually made
it worse this was eight hours this was
eight hours of my day right everybody
else is pissed off I'm loving this right
thank you know this is a great story and
then there's outlook again telling you
this one drives me crazy you gotta
delete the original appointment to get
rid of it I've been reminded about this
particular event which happened in April
over and over and over again see there
it is this is not an ok button this is
an ok button I'm sorry I'm boring I'm
taking that one personally now I don't
know what happened to monitor number one
but monitor number two has got some
serious resolution you talk about bad
advice yeah you just go ahead and close
that and see how successful you are
installing installing your app sometimes
our error messages lack a certain
specificity and just when we think
they've gotten the least specific
possible we make them less specific just
to kind of throw things sometimes
they're too specific right this one's a
hint to hacker you're getting close
right Marco Polo and then if the hackers
not quite bright enough to figure it out
we'll tell them where the overflow is
it's right here you found it
congratulations this download may take a
little longer then you'd be willing to
spend and okay we're tired you're tired
of this aren't your testers hate all
this stuff just I can't even read this
one anymore my mind just goes into this
tailspin I fear for the space-time
continuum this is live meeting and I can
a human being type this individual
studio I could picture the error report
I would have loved to have written this
bug report but Adam Shostak found it
first and I can picture the look on the
developers face reading their report and
saying oh yeah you're right i forgot the
period at the end of the sentence
ok so that's yesterday's software oops
I'm doing something wrong that's
yesterday's software what about
tomorrow's this is a video from
PowerPoint come on them be nice to me be
nice to me come on this is a video from
Microsoft's envisioning project i'm
going to show you and it is a video of
tomorrow's software
it turns red so you know that that's
when they're fun to take
and even the floor is a computer just in
case she gets lost now there's a couple
of things that bother me about this the
first of all first thing that bothers me
is that everyone in the future seems to
be fit and beautiful and I'm just not so
sure that I've got a role to play in
this future second thing that bothers me
is I should mute the microphone here is
that don't they kind of look like max
right all the computers and and the
third thing that bothers me let me
describe the third thing that bothers me
when this video first debuted our Vice
present we had an all-hands meeting I'm
in the developer division i build tools
visual studio and such we're watching
this video right and our senior vice
president is up there and everybody's
cutting Wow looking at this and oh not
this is what we're going to build this
kind of vision and I'm sitting in the
back row because that's where I sit and
there's a guy in the back row next to me
and I look at him and he's smiling and I
find myself smiling and I'm wondering
why I'm smiling and I elbow the guy and
I said you're a tester aren't you any
smiling and he says and I quote this
shit's never gonna work
because it's software right I can I can
picture it I can picture it all right
she's got the little computer around
she's in the medical experiment or
whatever right and she's got her little
computer running and she's and and her
fit little high knees running around and
and and it's sending his be means Datak
software being be me data and the
medical researchers got software and
he's looking at the date and he says
right cuz its software you know it's
gonna go something's gonna go wrong and
he says oh my god she's having a heart
attack and so using software he
dispatches an ambulance and in just as
she's going across the crosswalk when
the ambulance sent a saber turns into
roadkill because it's software it's not
gonna work like the video what do we
need to do to make it work like the
video that's what I want to talk about
what is a vision of the future how do we
have to innovate and I think this
innovation should be drawn driven by
software testers because we're the ones
there at the time of the bug right a
time of the crime so I want to talk
about the future that we need to invent
to do this and this is my eight-point
vision of the future I've been blogging
about this recently for those of you who
who read it I don't have time to talk
about all eight you can go to my blog
and and see what I've written about all
8 i'm going to talk about three today
and if you've seen this talk in the past
I always talk about a different 3 i've
always got virtualization in there
because that's the greatest hit and one
of the people say that they they like
the most i've never talked publicly
about test sourcing so I've added that
one to it today I want to talk to you
about that one first so test sourcing is
the first point of my eight-point vision
of the future of software testing and in
order to talk about test sourcing I want
to go in the past a little bit and talk
about what we've been doing that it's
led up to this point so I'm going to
talk about four generations of testing
one is the one and two or our past and
in some ways our present number three is
our current horizon present and number
four is the future and what I
specifically want to talk about in this
is the role of the vendors
the testing vendors of the planet in
each of these stages so the first stage
is in sourcing when the first software
was written in the 70s and 80s and even
in the early 90s we basically hired our
own testers so we had developers we had
testers and we tested our own stuff
that's in sourcing and in this model
vendors provide tools to the in
sorcerer's to help them do their testing
better the second generation was
outsourcing let's hire somebody else to
do it and big companies small companies
medium-sized companies popped up some of
them in the same country as a
development some of them in a different
country as a development and we provided
outsourcing now the role the vendors
here was to provide testing itself not
just a tool you we're not going to tell
you tools so you can do your own testing
will do the testing right will consume
the tools will do the testing and we
will deliver testing to you as a service
now the third generation is going on now
and it's called crowdsourcing and the
pioneers in this are you test calm now
what happens in crowdsourcing is you
basically develop your stuff and you
throw it over the wall to the crowd
right crowdsourcing has been done and
lots of different things social
networking photography there's a lot of
different t-shirt making right the
crowdsourcing has worked in a lot of
industries will it work for software
testers they got about 10,000 12,000
software testers all over the planet
signed up to do crowdsourcing so you
develop a mobile phone app you want it
tested you write your mobile phone app
how many mobile phones can you get you
know in-house to test on I don't know
five ten fifteen twenty throw it out to
the crowd and you've probably got all
the mobile phones on the planet that
exists so it's a really nice model for
certain types of applications and in
this model the role of the vendors isn't
to provide tools or testing but to
provide the testers themselves right we
keep going up a layer of abstraction at
the same time going down to more
concrete work there they're doing the
people who are writing software doing
less and less and less work you Tess has
an interesting model it's really cheap
because it's paid out a bug instead of
pay pay for effort we'll see if it works
I think I find it very compelling so
this is going on now
this is the near term horizon what I
think's in happening in the future is
what I call test sourcing itself so the
role of the vendors here let me explain
this bike by taking it up another layer
is the vendors will provide the testing
itself all right so what I want to be
able to do is I want to start I've
developed this application surely that
something like this has already been
tested or you can take bits of the
application and I just wrote this
interface this functionality someone on
the planet has tested it before
someone's got manual test cases
someone's got automated test cases
someone's built an infrastructure that
applies to my app why can't I just buy
the infrastructure that's what's going
to happen in the future we're going to
the entire testing is going to be to the
point where we just buy the test itself
now how do we get there well let's talk
about how do we get there because in
order to get to this vision of the
future we need two things we need
reusable test assets and we ain't got
that now you know if I write a test and
Keith Keith works for the same company i
do if i write a test and Keith looks at
my test and so you know what that
applies to my app give me your test I
give Keith my test it doesn't run
because I tied it into my environment my
infrastructure maybe I've got some
automation dll somebody's custom written
and keep them have all that stuff so it
doesn't work for him we're going to need
to solve this we need test assets so we
can just move around works on that
machine works on that machine works on
that machine works everywhere and we
need shareable environments we need to
get to the point where we can run tests
in lots of different environments
anywhere the crowdsourcing has an answer
to this the crowd owns the environments
and you pay them to test and find bugs
in those environments I need the
environments themselves to be there
because when I go out and buy my testing
I'd like to say okay I need I need all
these sorts of tests and I need it to
run on you know I need it run on windows
and even on openbsd and it on Linux I
needed on all these different platforms
I needed to run in all these different
browsers I all that stuff needs to be
able to be pre packaged and sold to me
as a software development organization
so that I can use those tests assets so
how do we get there and that's the
second step and that's what i call
virtualization virtualization technology
is so real now even like it wasn't last
year at this time it's real it's cheap
it's powerful and what can we do with it
we can do a lot with it what I want to
do with it is I want to solve three
specifically hard problems first hard
problem I want to solve with
virtualization is the repro problem
stuff doesn't repro now I find a bug on
my machine or in my test lab you know do
you ever find a bug in you just smile
knowing oh this is a good one right I'm
going to write my review based on this
bug and you go into your developers
office you don't want to be too arrogant
right you actually you do you want to go
in there and say press that button and
they do and it works right because it's
their machine and you're thinking damn I
just look really stupid right now we got
to solve this problem bugs need to be
transferable from machine to machine
there's something special about my
environment that causes it to fail in
that circumstance virtualization solves
this press a button shrink that test
case all the environment up send one
file over my developer and say run that
they unpack it which all occurs in
seconds now they unpack it run it and it
works perfectly right virtualization
helps with that is Microsoft has these
people these creatures called poems I
think it stands for product unit manager
and we have this thing called a poem
effect right we we do lots of automation
Microsoft I mean millions billions I
don't we do a lot of automation we get
we get the product ready we test the
hell out of it with automation and then
the pom wants to demo it to the VP so we
give the product to the palm the pom
does demo and the software breaks why
what happened
this happens over and over and over
again that's why we gave it the name
virtualization helps with this because
we can build things in virtual closed
environments we can pretty much
guarantee that the bugs that they might
run into an a demo don't exist in that
virtual environment and then the Vista
lesson oh gosh I'm on film aren't I what
happened with vista I don't know of a
single I've never been part of a single
product that got more testing than vista
and we know what happened right we're
all grown-ups here we can talk about
this got a less than stellar review when
it was released why right how is it that
we can go through hundreds of millions
of automated test cases we can dog food
it internally within the windows org of
X number of thousands of people and we
can say it's working in this right and
then we can give it to the rest of
Microsoft X tens of thousands of people
and they use it for months and it works
and then we give it to a beta community
and they can use it for months and
months and months and months and it
works and then we have the early
adopters who come in buy this stuff and
they lose it for months and months and
months and months and it works and then
it gets out to the broad general
availability and people look at it and
say ah yuck how can that happen what
happened in all that well what happened
in all that just between us testers is
the operational profile changed right
the windows testers the windows dog food
errs do Microsoft dog food errs the beta
uses the early adopters they were all
doing the same thing and we didn't know
because we had no way of measuring the
difference in the environments that we
were actually testing our software in we
need to be able to measure that so we
would have known when we release this
thing on these other environments it's
not been tested in specifically for
those environments we really don't know
what's going to happen we could capture
the environment measure the environment
we would know we're going to release
this and it's going to get used in ways
that we don't we knew that we knew it
was going to be used in ways that we had
in test
all software gets used in ways you
haven't tested virtualization will allow
us to know which was which was tested
for these it wasn't tested for these and
maybe in the future the software will be
aware of that itself so the solution
control the environment it's easier said
than done until 2008 virtual machines
are everywhere I'd like to see virtual
machines on every user's machine right
this is like dr. Watson you know the sin
don't send something happened it's bad
and send it to Microsoft and we'll fix
it well so that's nice Microsoft gets
his nice bug report and there's sky
named Vince and Vince reads the bug
report and figures it out and simulates
and debug zit and then finds a developer
responsible works for them to get fixed
fixed goes in Windows Update and
everybody's happy right well that's not
quite good enough I want better
virtualization could give me foolproof
debugging because poor Vince has to
debug these things based on stack traces
and static data what if when they hit
press send bug report it shrinks up the
virtual machine Oh privacy advocates
don't like this we'll figure out a way
to take their social security number out
of the data it's okay it's a that's a
technical problem we can solve that stop
complaining and packaged up that whole
vm and send it and then Vince gets it
and voila he's got debug traces while
the bug was occurring in the exact
environment it was occurring in we
should be able to automate the debugging
and fixing of these applications over
time we could have users press a button
occasionally create a virtual
environment of what I'm doing now on the
cellphone create a virtual environment
now they get paid eight cents ten cents
right the Google model google makes
their billions four cents at a time they
get paid they have a reason to give us
their environments virtual machine
technology big labs storage amount we
could get to the point where we store
hundreds of millions of variations of
every possible environment out there in
some lab and some American will figure
out that there's a value to this and
they'll start selling those virtual
machines to the testers of the world
right you want your you want your
software to run
on 200 million machines with with a
thousand billion test cases no problem
we'll see on tuesday right we should be
able to do this there is no
technological leap necessary for this
vision to come to pass same thing for
testers machines I would like to see the
point where I have an entire virtualized
test library just add the application
right where we're testing the same
applications over and over and over
again right you got search we got search
we want to test search we're constantly
updating search we have this virtualized
test environment plop in the new app
boom everything just happens and the web
applications right why couldn't we have
a virtual environment for cross-site
scripting cross-site scripting is the
same for every application it identify
where the string inputs go we can do
that automatically attack surface
analysis easy why can't we just have a
virtualized cross-site scripting
environment pop in any web app BAM 100
million test cases four hundred thousand
different environments and it's done in
two days this is what we need you want
to see what you want the future of that
saw that future is being built
Microsoft's not the only company
building that future it's happening how
are we going to test it this is one way
I think we have to test it right the
idea is environment carrying tests test
case carrick test cases carry along the
parts of the environment that they need
to execute all you need to do is find
the application that that test is
applicable to and say go test me now
this is going to develop a new test
market it's going to be buying and
selling of virtual machines by them sell
them rent them create them and sell
those to the companies that are that are
selling these things so testing is no
longer about testing we may end up
getting to a world where we don't write
test cases anymore that software testers
are designers of tests that my job as a
software tester would be say okay here's
the code you wrote it's got these
interfaces these testing requirements I
need these sorts of environments and I
need these sorts of test cases I go out
on the market by those environments by
those tests
asus put it all together and press test
me now and it happens right so testers
are raised up a level in the food chain
we're not down there mucking around with
the individual parts of the test case in
writing hand automation were much higher
level designing the entire test and what
it should look like the execution is for
free in my future one more visualization
my father worked for Ford Motor Company
for 30 years and he has the arthritis to
prove it and he worked in quality
control for the last four right and and
I would ask him questions because I was
getting into testing at the time saying
you know how do you when you find a bug
do you find your car designer saying
that's not a bug it's a feature you ever
heard that he said no you know I mean
the car is missing a bumper we can all
sort of say it's missing a bumper and
then the conversation is sort of like
yeah let's put a bumper on it and then
my father would go back and say it's got
the bumper now we're done and that's the
way the conversation goes right so
what's the difference or people from
Ford Motor Company just smarter than
people from Microsoft don't compare us
on our stock we can't see software
that's the advantage that they have
building any other sort of product you
can see it right you know the bridge
isn't complete until the structures that
you know the posts are under you you've
got this visual image that the entire
team shares all the stakeholders share
the managers see the car the designers
see the car the repair guys see the car
the assemblers see the car even the
freakin robot see the car everybody sees
the car they all agree that's what we're
trying to build what a software look
like do we even know are we ninety
percent complete is it just a bumpers
that we have
to stick on this thing or is it missing
a steering wheel and an entire
drivetrain how do you know how do we
know ship days this is the Royal we the
industry we not the Microsoft we how do
we know ship dates we gasps we know ship
dates because somebody more important
than us comes in and says we're shipping
on this day all right so our job isn't
to figure out if we're ship worthy or to
get us our job is damage control right
we've got to figure out how this thing
can stink less by this day because we
don't really know if it's done so let
see software and I think in the future
we're going to need to see software i
think in the future if we can't see
software we're going to be in big
trouble because software is getting a
lot more complicated so here's the thing
that I'd like to be able to see I'd like
to be this is software to me software is
input output data flow control flow
modules so that structure right
architecture dependencies between those
things environment stuff that bothers me
as software things that might change my
execution path files interfaces and of
course bugs right this is software so
what is a visualization that makes that
makes sense I don't know but I'm going
to show you a few ideas that that we
have and we're working on this is a
visualization that we found especially
useful in Windows Vista is quite large
you know there's a big mystery how many
lines of code is it 50 million is it 100
million I don't even think we know it
once you'd count so high the South
accounting software is just like dude
it's big so this is a visualization of
certain aspects of the Vista codebase so
two aspects in in particular size right
so the bigger these squares each square
represents some mod code module in vista
some assembly this larger the square the
more lines of code it has the darker the
square the more complex complexity it
has and the complexity is measured in
fan and fan arc density of the source
code right and you can it's we've got
this tool that we've got a bunch of
different things that we can pivot on
and you can see a certain aspect this
one I found good when i started at
microsoft i was in vista was almost
ready to ship and they said well you're
you're a tester so why don't you go find
some bugs and and this is what i use is
my guide right the bigger and the
greener the square the more i'm going to
test it and it turned out to be an
absolute goldmine all right when they
when they threaten to take this tool
away from you as a software tester you
know you got a good tool and and you can
vary on a lot of different things so now
the job the task is this was sort of
proven in practice on this to now the
tab these are called heat maps they've
been around for a long time Microsoft
didn't invent it we just made it real on
the largest codebase perhaps in the
world you can vary on a lot of different
things so the question is which ones are
interesting right which ones allow us to
see the bumpers which ones allow us to
see the bugs which ones allow us to see
data flow through the system xbox is an
interesting test group at microsoft i'm
going to have to leave this conference
early because we have a little internal
event where the xbox guys are presenting
the next generation of this stock how do
you test the next box game well there's
a lot of stuff you can do for automation
but they do a lot of manual testing they
hire college students high school
students put them in a lab and say play
and then they got software that monitors
the way they play and then you can't
just say they're you know let them play
they realize that quickly because they
will play right i'm going to defeat this
monster i'm going to feed this monster
it's not about the monster it's about
the bugs stop fighting the monster start
finding the bugs so how do we do that
how do we provide them tools that allow
them to do this because games are very
visual lots of artwork you see objects
you see artwork but you don't see code
you don't see bugs there's really not a
lot of dependency the artwork you don't
see the dependencies between the
background because it's a seamless user
experience so this is a gooey map I
think this is Project Gotham Racing or
something like that that allows you to
as a as a tester to figure out where you
are in the app so this is running on the
side you're playing your game here and
you can see I've just gone into this
part of the world which has a whole
bunch of different arcs here there's
going to be a lot of stuff to test here
or if you've driven into a part of the
application where there's nothing you
see it you're on one of those nodes
where there's no real only one exit arc
so you know it kind of gives you this
you're in an interesting place and it
works really well this is a fable I
think there's a low rendering at
resolution for a testing tool where are
you in the game now this is what it
tells you you're the red dot that's
where your character is press a button
show me all the testable objects within
a 20 yard radius of my character those
are the green dots and then you can
teleport to each one of them and test
those objects instead of just walking
around the game overnight changes so
what's happening here is the game revs
overnight a lot of our games are
developed outside of the United States
and tested in redmond and so you come in
in the morning there's been a lot of new
code i added a lot of things that have
changed you press a button give me all
the objects whose code revd overnight
those are the red ones and again you can
teleport to each of those and test them
when they turn green you know you hit
the code that got changed very very
useful so this is a take the entire test
lab now you got all these manual testers
doing all this testing and we collect
all this stuff render it in a
low-resolution image from the game 1 dot
means a tester was here for a certain
amount of time the darker the dot the
black dots more testing more testers the
yellow dots not so much to green dots
not not so much a couple of things this
tells us is the black stuff is tested
stopped and we did some interesting
things you look at this and say all
right why is everybody collecting right
there on the docks it turns out there is
a wishing well why is everybody finding
this I mean we're glad it's compelling
we want the game to be fun but stop
testing the wishing well please and they
didn't and they kept getting darker and
darker and darker so somebody won a
developer went in and ripped
wishing well out of the game
redistributed those bits to the testers
and then all of a sudden all the other
stuff started getting darker it was
really powerful thing the other thing
there was interesting why is no one on
the boats the boats were boring there
was no good reason for any gamer to go
on the boat so we went back to the
developers and said guys you got to make
the boat more compelling for our users
and they did and then those those
numbers went up as well so so that's the
idea all right visualization is like
Dungeons and Dragons did you play this
when you were younger right dungeons and
dragons with the old cardboard screen
and the dice right all you needed was a
bong hit and a good dungeon master and
you could visualize everything right but
if you didn't have those two things you
are sort of people would sit and say
this is a stupid game right because what
is it you're sitting behind the screen
and you're rolling dice if you couldn't
get the game in your head right if you
couldn't visualize Dungeons and Dragons
you hated it if you could visualize it
it was a blast there's a great game to
play so now we've built Dungeons and
Dragons it's online right there's world
of warcraft there's D&amp;amp;D there's
runescape there's we've built it a
thousand times and there's millions of
users all over the planet that no longer
need that bong hit to really understand
the game can we do the same thing for
software testing right we've all taken
our we've all got our testing bong and
we can figure this out how do we figure
it out in a large-scale going to go
through these quick what a software look
like for us if the dungeons and dragons
people can code this stuff surely we can
to software does it look like this is it
some kind of document tree map where I
can zoom in on a specific thing that I
want and really see the software is it
to the point where I can say all right
show me the code coverage and it
overlays it I think it is I think this
is the future of software can we get to
the point where we have a cockpit it
shows us everything we need to know
about this project here's the software
here's what it looks like you can pay
true it here's the people I'm working
with here are all the different things
in this environment that have to do with
this software right this software
it looks like this and it's kind of
round and and we can play with it and we
can fiddle with it and when it's changed
we know it and we can see it and when
it's done it turns green if the dungeons
and dragons people can make that game
that complex game so real that they've
taken the bong out of the equation we
can do the same thing too you're going
to remember this because of the bong
aren't you all of other ideas and what
it's going to be that it's going to be
that ok so I think I'm winding down here
my conclusion so I painted a vision of
the future I painted three of the eight
points go to my blog and read they read
the other five if you'd like there's a
kind of a controversy swirling on there
now i'm going to buy time i'm going to
blog again about that today but this is
what I I want right I want software to
just work I want it to get to the point
where late cycle heroics go away this
annoys me when I go into a project and I
think okay all these people got promoted
and they got promoted because they
relate cycle heroes this bothers me when
the vice president is saying when you're
going to ship when you're going to ship
when you going to ship you're thinking I
don't know I don't know I don't know but
you're saying next week next week next
week and everybody's there nobody's
sleeping everybody's on pound pound
pound Go Go code test test test yeah we
did it we're heroes promote them don't
promote them fire them fire them all we
don't need heroes we need engineers why
is it that all that activity wasn't at
the front when we were designing this
thing why isn't all that activity sort
of spread over the whole project that's
the sort of future I want to software
all those late cycle heroes fire them go
to work for somebody else we don't need
you we want software that just works I
want my users to be so damn surprised
when they see a bug oh my god it failed
can you believe that look at this this
is incredible I've never seen this
before that's what I would like instead
of hiding to see
is my wife on the computer before I go
in right because if she's on the
computer I ain't going inside I'm going
to go to the pub and wait because as
soon as I walk in she's going to say oh
there you are this thing sucks i'm sorry
i missed the spot i want innovation to
be absolutely epidemic I want people to
take software quality for granted and if
I seem a little over the top and my
passion about this I don't apologize for
that because I think it's going to take
not just people of passion to make this
happen but an entire industry that's
passionate about this this is this is
enough people are depending on this
right we've met the freaking human
genome and we can't make a calculator
that doesn't crash rockets right the
Aryan 5 blew up because of a calculator
problem basically this is not right
right they can build bridges that last
for hundreds of years we build software
that falls down in the first five
minutes we're better than this our
industry is better than this and the
world needs us the global warming people
need is right you like to breathe good
write better code I would like it to be
the point that some researcher in the
year 2030 looks back and maybe picks up
a copy of my book and says can you
believe this they actually had people
dedicated to finding bugs and that weird
I would like that to be just so odd in
the future that they look back and say
wow this is weird right like we were we
look back on data entry people can you
believe that just 20 years ago some data
started its life on paper and then we
had hundreds of thousands of people all
over the planet whose job it was to take
that data that's on paper and injure it
through a freakin keyboard into a
computer that was their job and there
were hundreds of thousands of them
that's weird in 2008 I can explain that
to my 14 year old daughter and she's
like well that's weird right because
data doesn't do that anymore it starts
out on the computer it is born digital
and it lives its entire life digitally
we've solved that we've taken that
entire aspect of our discipline
completely off the table we need to do
the same thing with bugs there are hard
problems that we are dealing with now
every single day and at conferences like
this are discussing every single week it
seems like there's a new testing
conference which of these hard problems
will simply cease to be because us the
people of our time stood up and said you
know what we are tired of painting lines
around sticks in the road we will be the
generation that gets our lazy ass out of
the line painting machine and moves the
stick thank you very much that's all I
have
do I have time for questions are there
any questions no thank you very much are
there any questions I'm not serious i
could yes sir would be part of that or
it's not like both incoming rates but
more about taking a holistic view of the
software itself great great question
what's your name and what company do you
work for do you and it's like one of
those plants and softballs here you go
James get ready i'm glad you work for
microsoft so it's none of the metrics
that we're looking at today right i
don't think mttf and all these things
that we simply don't have the data to
compute and we might not ever have the
day by the way the international
symposium of software reliability is in
redmond washington in two or three weeks
and that is the largest metrics and
measurements conference in the world if
you're interested in that if you ISS re
2008 search for that in a search engine
of your choice and and you'll probably
find the the site for that so what I
think it's going to be the metric i
would like to design is how many test
cases didn't get run and the future that
i paint we can do that now the future i
paint we can because i think if we can
really exploit virtualization technology
we can start counting lydia made the
comment that they're almost infinite
there these things are countably
infinite right they're not infinite
they're countably infinite you said near
infinite so i accept that but i like
countably infinite because i took a math
class once and then and they said
countably infinite and I thought what a
cool term they're countably infinite all
right there are measures we can apply to
all possible test cases all possible
environment you know the list i showed
of this is what software is I wish I
knew what it looked like that that list
those are things we need to count every
metric has to
me how far I've gotten on one of those
things I think that list is complete one
of those things those are the metrics I
want questions yes sir it seems you want
to describe yeah measure what a defect
looks like my looking at understanding
having our tests knowing what our tests
are doing it may be that goes to your
environment we contain test that you
have to know what the tests are doing
target and knowing the target I guess it
developed on the statics I could be your
precision god what a good wish you work
for Microsoft what a great insight so so
as you're testing what's going on in the
software do you know I mean okay so you
run a few tests and you can do a code
coverage report or you can look at you I
coverage but what about while I'm doing
it I would like to i would like to see
you know my interface chess so this is
one of the ones i didn't talk about this
is information a blog about it but this
is one of the ones i didn't talk about
information right in gaming terms they
have a heads-up display so you're
playing the game and if I don't know
time you play World of Warcraft might my
11 year old son plays it and I'm pretty
good at hacking it so he's like really
good at this game and he you know the
heads up display I like to go and just
hit f11 and turn his heads off heads up
display off and he's like Oh I can't
play the game without it right because
it always reminds me of the fact that
information right how are we itself if
he won't play an online role-playing
game without his heads up display heads
up display meaning you know you got a
little mini map of the app you got you
got information about you your health
your weapons your that you know your
target out there that you might want to
fight something like that I don't have
that for software I'd like to have it
I'd like to have when I go into the
interface I'd like to be able to see
every piece of interface it hasn't been
touched I'd like it to be read and when
I tested I'd like it to turn different
colors based on its contribution to be
able to hover over a control and have it
show me the JavaScript and I'd like to
you know show me the source code of the
flash component or whatever it happens
to be
right I want all that information
surface me just like you want
dynamically while I'm testing that was
once I see you got a short version of
that when there's a bonus canceled and
David parnis one of the most famous
computer scientists in the world moved
to Canada because of that I think the
gamers have it down I think they've got
a concept we can mimic it's not gonna be
the same right but a heads-up display
for testing i call it thud right testers
heads-up display thud it so I'm working
on it it's a spare time spare time
project I know what I want it to look
like I just have encoded it all yet yes
sir state sucks I mean it's one of the
reasons that software testing is so
difficult you can apply all these inputs
but they were applied when the software
was in state a you to put the software
in state B and you haven't tested all
those inputs right it's completely and
totally different so being able to
visualize and map data flow and state
changes to the application is absolutely
crucial was one on the list it was on
the list right and that's one of the
things that that is part of this so
whenever we get a solution and someone
says alright this is a solution it
solves part of the problem and this is
going to be part of the future of
testing that's the litmus test what does
it do for input what does it do for
state what does it do for code pads what
does it do for data flow what does it do
for environment covers what does it do
for all of these things it's an
excellent litmus test to know that any
proposal that we make any tool that we
develop if you're not making progress on
one of those axes we don't need it save
ourselves for trouble yes sir Lydia stop
me when it's when it's okay okay okay
cool
heatmat yep some dude and Cambridge
wrote it seriously one of our
researchers Brendan Murphy and I don't
know so go to is rebe cuz he's the
program chair for is reedus year and ask
him he's a little English guy start
talking to him about football but act
like not like the football this sort of
weird shape at the round one he'll he'll
tell you everything you want to know but
no that's a custom internal internal app
MSR gives away a lot of their tools i
don't know if that's one that they they
do ya HEA t heat map you know what were
the hot spots yeah yeah heat map sorry
yeah from the South man of the problem
old time any more questions yes sir in
the back you're a tester
dude you took that bong comment a little
too seriously man you need to sober up
for you come to these events I don't
know so I mean that is the development
approach to it and there are developers
that are almost as smart as we are that
are working on this problem from the
other other end right and they and they
see it as a as a component ization there
have been attempts right patterns
designed by contract object orientation
harness modules you harness modules have
their 1968 I think he published the
paper on the system to decompose systems
and the modules or something like that
they've been talking about this for a
long time they haven't been doing it we
still have this cowboy culture in
software development worldwide we call
it agile right agile is shorthand for
doing whatever the hell we want to do
because we're agile it's it's a
different approach to the problem i am
going to i would like to be able to
enforce those behaviors because the
metrics tell you that it's easier to get
to completion if you do it this way as
opposed to let's do it this way and see
if it helps us any we've been doing that
for decades and hasn't worked so i'm i'm
pushing this from the test angle i mean
if you look at my future of testing it's
a it's a disguise we can talk right
we're all testers we can talk this is
not the future of testing this is the
future of software development but it's
a future of software development from
being pushed from the testing angle so I
specifically don't want to take that
tack because that's pushing from the
development angle and it hadn't worked
in the past it might work I don't know
but it's it's a race yes sir where are
you from now wet paint Wow nice name
preach is that what I'm doing my
preaching how do you preach the
possibility of perfection just like I
did it all right ah stop well I do it
all the time I mean I've on the
executive briefing staff what do we
cover there's a bunch of people at
Microsoft that talk ebc Alan's here
somewhere outside we talk to external
people all the time and we talked about
this and so sometimes it's not fair
because you know some of these stuff
we're pioneering at Microsoft some of
the stuff we're dropping the ball on to
be perfectly honest I like my customers
to hear this because I like to raise the
expectations of my customers because
that's the way you get to the senior
executives right the customer looks at
something and says you know what as
unacceptable sorry we don't like it
that's the strongest message you can
send so the more we educate the
consumers of software and like column
users it sounds to my sex yeah the
consumers of software I think the more
pressure we get on our executives and
Microsoft that's nice but you know the
partners in our company get compensated
based on customer satisfaction metrics
so the size of their bonuses depend on
how happy our customers are so if I'm
out preaching to our customers telling
them expect things to improve I kind of
like that tagged any more questions yes
ma'am and who are you and where you're
from ah good luck with that it's hard
work
okay so it's not this is absolutely
categorically not the same path so I
started a degree track program when I
was a professor at Florida Tech it
called software testing you could
actually get a degree in software
testing from my university the campaign
are still maintaining it somewhat but
it's struggling a bit since I left but
Steve Ballmer actually threatened to
fire me two weeks ago because he felt
like Microsoft was better off with me as
a professor than an employee and I
wasn't sure if it was a compliment or
not you go home and wife says how was
work well Steve Ballmer threatened to
fire me today oh you so I'm trying to do
this now I'm trying to drive the
education not just an academia but down
to the high school level as well and we
got my daughter is 14 and she creates
you know Facebook and MySpace pages and
and I tried to interest her and you know
how that works right right click on that
look do you know view source watch that
see that you know see the frog jumping
you want to make the frog jump higher
you want to make the Frog a sheep you
want to make the Sheep pink against late
yeah how do I do that right so I started
or slow like all right let's take the
source code and let's just change
parameters nothing else ignore all that
other magic let's just change parameters
right so she got to the point where she
could do that she figured out which
parameter was which and and now the
sudden she's riding silverlight code and
flash code and she's she's fairly decent
at it and she's 14 so then you know it
but you know you we've got to get them
the thing we're doing wrong now is we're
actually waiting for them to graduate
from university we're hiring them and
then we're retraining am alan page is
here where's Alan Alan is the
Microsoft's that he's the guy that
teaches our new testers how to test and
I think Alan would agree with me when I
say they all come in not knowing
anything about and we have to retrain
him and that's expensive i mean we pay
alan way too much and and he you know
that he's not writing code on a
day-to-day basis that we ship he's
training people to find to find bugs and
you know we got to do better than that
we gotta
shit down into the universities that
means you know the stuff that we do we
need more how many academics are here
that's not enough right you know I'd
like to talk to everybody who raised
their hand I would please introduce
yourself to me sometime throughout the
day I'd like to talk to you about what
what we can do to help you we meaning
the stuff I can steal from my company to
