sure yeah so this is structural
improvisation using automated paddle
discovery I'm actually a researcher in
computer security so so if you take
umbrage with any of my definitions
please hit a little bit easier so so my
claim is that essentially the
maintenance that's pervasive in modern
culture and so my kind of reduced
definition of remixes that we have some
existing material and we subtract add or
adjust it until something novel emerges
and so the person doing the remix thing
plays a lot of different roles they head
back as a sculptor or a curator an
engineer and and many others I'm sure we
can think of so what if the rement
remixer was actually the song itself and
that's kind of that semi philosophical
question I want to explore so a really
informal evolution of these ideas can be
traced with the remix can they trace
back to Dada's and
I generated these random poems from kind
of the bank words and that was a big
influence for William s Burroughs and
his literary
cut-ups when he would take pre-existing
text and chop them up into words or
sentences and then rearrange them to
make about the stories and of course the
pervasive phenomena who remix modern pop
music is hip hop and sampling taking
that one step further into mashups
so artists like Danger Mouse with the
great album where you have backing
sounds from the Evo's white album and
vocals from jay-z's black album or an
arts like Girl Talk feels very
comfortable mashing up the holes of
James Chandler with Dirty South rap yes
so the idea here is that there's this
spectrum of structures so we have you
know random pieces like rows cut-ups or
some of stock cousins pieces then we
have you know some intentionally often
more predictable techno non-silent
techno and then maybe in the extreme
case the most predictable music might be
an example of the cages for 33
so obviously if there's a spectrum of
between you know totally random and
totally pretty cool music and so that's
kind of what I wanted to explore in this
is this the spectrum in between so
there's this interplay between you know
structure and order and chaos so one way
I sometimes think about music is this
perceptual information channel kind of a
Shannon information channel from the
Creator to the consumer and so outside
of kind of philosophical points to most
people both of those extremes become
interesting if we're just listening to
the same note over and over and over ad
infinitum or you know we're listening to
something totally chaotic that we cannot
go to predict most people those extremes
aren't super interesting so an
researchers started to measure that this
balance of familiar familiarity and
surprise kind of maximizes people's
appreciation so this has a lot to do
with how complex is a song and so so
there's two components to this there's
how random is a signal so random meaning
you know unpretty cool their concepts of
surprise and anticipation or
expectations and those expectations
being violated and also how structured
is the source so if we think of a
selling in a sense is a kind of
stochastic process what is an
interpretive structure we need to
express the randomness and that signal
introduces and so there's dozens and
dozens of different definitions of
complexity so I'll just go over to here
so there's the KC complexity which is
also new
it's the deterministic complexity and a
string s is the length of the shortest
universal Turing machine program that
produces us so in this notion of
complexity we're kind of associating
randomness with complexity so if we have
a uniform random bit screen we can't
really compress that so the shortest
universal Turing machine program is
essentially gonna have to store that
string to explicitly reproduce it so in
that sense it's a student associated
with complexity so there's this
alternate notion of statistical
complexity so it's if we want to give up
our need to exactly reproduce the string
we can produce a new screen with the
same statistics and so in that sentence
before the same assertion with structure
with complexity so here where we have
the uniform random stream in this and
with high complexity here it's gonna
have low complexity because we can
essentially have a single state machine
model of problems like transitions which
basically models a coin being flipped
and that's essentially the same
complexity as a totally periodic okay so
what I think is interesting about this
notion of complexity is it kind of
captures this this notion that I was
talking about that between these two
extremes there's this structure and that
means to offer some more enjoyment
so obviously this is contingent on kind
of exploring these ideas and how do we
actually measure complexity so one way
of measuring the complexity of a signal
is Jan's entropy rate and one way that's
often approximated is by the Lempel Ziv
algorithms so implemented by something
like gzip and there's less people argue
that that's not really a good
approximation that's but also the
complexity of the source so again if we
think of the source that generates these
these nodes as some sort of strategic
stochastic process what's the complexity
needed to produce information in a
particular entropy rate so the model
that we're using is this minimal causal
representation from statistical physics
and absolution and that can directly
calculate the entropy rate H nu and the
statistical and so this is what we're
referring to in the title was fun made a
pattern discovery so just to kind of
unobstructed from its
this physics usage it it'll be more
familiar to people in machine learning
and it's basically a special kind of
hidden Markov model with an edge of
meeting in the Markov model with the
term mystic transitions and we have
special States called causal states
which are equivalence classes of
histories with the same next simple
prediction and the number of states in
the nation am is confirmed directly from
the data and so having to specify the
topology and so these are an aluminum
infinite data the claim for epsilon
machines that they're minimally sized
operating corrective model of the
stationary stochastic process so here's
two really simple epsilon machines so
this is a period to process we have two
states and we have labels on the
transitions so on the right hand side of
the label is the symbol that's being
emitted so zero and one and on the left
hand side is the probability of that
transition taken so here we just found
mapping or can generate 0 1 0 0 here's a
slightly more involved epsilon machine
where basically we're producing binary
strings where there's a restriction that
no two consecutive zeros up here so this
thing we basically have a coin flip we
can produce a 1 or a 0 with some bias
but if we do produce a 0 we're in state
B and we have to follow that up with
immortal ok so that's another simple
epsilon machine and of course they can
be more involved
and they'll get much hairier than that
so we're kind of exploring these
trade-offs with this very simple
algorithm that we're calling hot
agreements so idea again is that we
allow some to remix itself for various
levels of granularity so this work we
focus on needs and so the idea is that
we essentially have some wave form we
run a beat detection algorithm on it and
we cluster similar beads together and
we'll have a time series of cluster IDs
and we'll infer this epsilon machine of
the time series of plus edges and then
we didn't use the epsilon machine to
generate a new time series here and walk
on the epsilon machine so essentially
we're treating the song as a stochastic
process and the clustering allows us to
adjust so I kind of went over this
already but this is just a really simple
example so we have our waveform we run a
beat detection algorithm on it and say
we have some sample with four different
leads in it and we'll run some
clustering so say just standard k-means
and we'll group these first two beats
into one cluster and the second two
beats into a different cluster and then
we'll infer an epsilon machine in that
and we'll do a random walk on the
epsilon machine and we'll sample from
this first cluster and you can see we
end up with four beats again we're
sampling from this first cluster we can
either pick eats one or two for that and
this time you chose a two here we have
cluster ID one we can sample either of
those two beats and this time they chose
one and so on so we did in kind of a
shuffle version of the hustle
so kind of the limiting cases are we
tending to choose the same number of
clusters as our beats in the song and so
every beat gets assigned to another
cluster and as we decrease the number of
clusters then some beads are going to be
forced into clusters with other needs
and so we're going to be able to
increase the randomness about but as you
can see if you backed off through the
number of clusters so so we also look at
finding the space of these have some
machines according to the entropy rate
and the statistical complexity and so so
this is a figure from a different piece
of work but the idea is that we can
actually run this kind of analysis and
look at say we're you know a piece by 5e
or a piece by Beethoven might be or we
can also look at how where the machines
for a particular the same song can vary
as we change these different number of
clusters or different writers and so
they might diffuse vocally around these
kind of semi-stable subspaces
so just to kind of summarize the ideas
to treat a song is a stochastic process
and allowing a song remix itself through
this automated pattern discovery
technique based on have science and so
we will explore the trade-offs between
structural randomness in the signal and
the source and we think maybe there
there might be some applications for
this to quantify the perception of these
trade-offs using information so just to
give a little more detail all this was
done in Python and use the echo nest and
you can access DK or the detection for
the features for clustering we initially
started off using fft coefficients and
also tried wavelets but we ended up
getting the best of all these little
seasoning and fcc's using the knife a
library for clustering sorry about using
the initial just a simple painting 200
and a few minute inside pi and we also
tried the finicky propagation and means
plus plus and it's like it's not
learning package and using means plus
plus and to entrap slot machines being
in computational and it's a Python
library so I actually have kind of a
sample of a song here that was remix
using
technique and so I chose the number of
clusters to be half the number of beats
so roughly half the beats are going to
be coarse to be stuffed into a cluster
of another beats when we take a random
walk model we're going to get some
randomness and because it's hard to kind
of especially with a piece of music that
you don't know I kind of unrolled the
epsilon machine to preserve the temporal
structure of the song and so what you're
mostly going to be hearing here is a lot
of the word preserve you can hear the
effect of the cluster and so it
shouldn't sound too jarring but once in
a while you hear a sound that is a
little hopefully telling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
