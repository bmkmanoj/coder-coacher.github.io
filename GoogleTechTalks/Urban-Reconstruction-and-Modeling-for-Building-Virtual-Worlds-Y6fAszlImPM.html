Pascal Miller Peter is an old friend we
went to Georgia Tech together he was a
postdoc and I was a student then he's
now an assistant professor at Arizona
State University
Pascal he was a former researcher at ETH
Zurich and now he's the CEO and
co-founder of the new and exciting
company procedural Inc so take it away
thanks for Vic so we're gonna split the
talk and I'm gonna give the first part
of the talk yeah my name is Peter Wonka
and I'm we're gonna talk about urban
reconstruction modeling for building
virtual worlds so yes our talk is
structured like any talk you've seen
before with some introduction into
beginning results at the end but so in
the middle will be gonna talk to you
about is the concept of modeling
architectural content with shape
grammars so this is an academic concept
that Bhaskar and I we collaborated over
the last years worked on and we honor
what you're going to see those results
of one specific system that was
implemented and this is what the
postcard is going to release in May 2008
with his company which is called City
Engine and so the two parts that we're
going to talk about this first just
building virtual worlds everything
virtual and then in the second part of
the talk we're going to talk about how
can we maybe use this concept of shape
grammars for something more along the
lines of reconstruction the overall
problem that we try to address is the
content challenge and so we would argue
that over the last maybe 10 years in
computer graphics that the actual
rendering part became less and less of a
bottleneck but that the art and content
was taking over as the major problem so
now you have all these really powerful
rendering engines down to these really
cheap platforms for playing games
and the question now is where do all
these detailed models and all the
content come from
so that interesting things can be
generated and and out of all the content
that can possibly be generated or that
is important what we focus on is
architectural content like cities
buildings and in interiors and and we we
hope that most of you believe us that
architectural content is actually
extremely important and then you can
probably from your own experience see
that a lot of maybe movies and games and
other products
they include architectural content and
we also think that there is a big
problem in efficiently generating a
detailed content and we're going to
propose a solution to that and the
solution is procedural modeling and
procedural modeling somehow because it's
similar to maybe scripting or
programming so we're gonna maybe program
a building and how this looks like is we
want to somehow and cold architectural
knowledge so we want to encode knowledge
in this procedural way so that we have
information about spatial structural
relating relationships about semantics
for architecture and now this the idea
is that this encoding of our contextual
knowledge is fairly small and compact
but with this smaller and compact
representation we then can go out and
procedurally generate like vast
cityscape so so then this is where the
efficiency comes from like we have this
smaller encoding of architectural
knowledge but we can create a huge
amount of very detailed content and the
applications that we go to primarily are
entertainment like games and movies but
we also had successful collaborations
with architecture archeology urban
planning as you will see later on in the
talk so if you want to start modeling a
city then what we suggest is a top-down
approach and this is something that
Bhaskar
worked on for his master thesis in 2001
where the idea was you still want to
design a city you have absolutely
nothing so you might want to start out
by painting some maps were loaded
downloading them downloading them or you
know taking them from Google Google Maps
for example so you might start with it
land water map you might want to start
with a hand painted population density
map with a map for terrain elevation and
then if you have these maps you can
start out by growing a city as you see
on the left side with an l-system like
process and so one of the concepts that
were suggested is to actually grow major
streets first and then try to fill in
the minor streets and you know while the
machinery is similar to using L system
for trees of course in the details
everything is different and we have to
kind of encode the inherent properties
of street networks to make it look
fairly realistic and on the right you
see a model of virtual Manhattan I guess
it's the land water map of Manhattan so
now you have two Street Network so maybe
there are two more examples so what you
see here are two possible
interpretations of sewerage so starting
from a land water map of sewage you see
the beautiful lake here in the middle
you can by controlling the parameters
make it look more like a Western pattern
what you see on the left or you can make
it you can generate some radial patterns
what you see on the right and on the
bottom you see a rendering of that so
what we have now is a street graph with
intersections of vertices and then there
are some polylines and the procedural
model also generates some attributes for
these polylines and one of the most
important attributes is there other ones
is the street with and
this representation that you see to the
left of this slide then there are some
procedural modeling steps to generate
the full-blown street geometry and so we
want to place all the signs and we want
to place street lighting and traffic
lights and mail boxes and all that which
works fairly nice
procedurally with the shape grammars
that we develop so then then we can add
on with the streets and then we proceed
further top-down so the next thing is
the division into law so if you start at
the left side of this slide then here
you see the street graph again and then
after we model 3d geometry I mean a bit
of this the streets take some more space
but after the streets have been extended
then then still there there's some what
we call parcels left and then the next
question is how can we subdivide these
parcels into individual building Lots so
into into which individual property that
you could go and buy and yeah so here we
also use again a concept of shape
grammars but you know they're these
constraints so we have to respect your
metric constraints like building Lots
should be mainly rectangular so that you
can build a house on them we can't have
organically shaped building Lots or
something there's subdivision according
to population and land use and also
typically if you buy a piece of property
to build your house on you you would
love to have some street access because
otherwise now you have some major
problems so now we have the Lord sent
and the next step is we want to put some
buildings on the lot so and what you see
here is an example where we actually
started developing a shape grammar for
one specific type of architecture
inspired by one specific type of
building that can be found in Surrey and
so this is a this is a to the right side
you see more there may be that you
really want to go into a lot of details
in this virtual world so you see a lot
of the ornaments are modeled by geometry
and to the left side you see a bit more
of the structure so we have some
now but if you're in the in the city
like New York there's not much else you
have streets buildings but if you move
to the suburbs we also want to place
other objects so what you see on this
slide is some examples of using this
shape grammar to place other objects
that are important so if you have your
piece of property you might want to
procedurally generate a fence and there
are also procedural rules for the
placement of vegetation so if you look
at these examples
we're actually not in the business of
tree modeling itself we're just in the
we just tried to procedurally generate
the patterns of how these these trees
and this other vegetation is placed so
you see very regular patterns for
example on this side of the street where
it's more all the trees i acree distant
and then you have some same irregular
patterns maybe everything's around the
fence but but then that the distance is
a bit more chaotic or just a totally
free placement of vegetation as in a
forest and you know you not only see the
vegetation but there's also modeling of
swimming pools and of pathways and fans
and driveways and things like that now
this is more or less the pipeline high
on a high level let's look at some
example projects that we took on and
over the last years and what you see
here this is a reconstruction of Pompeii
that allegedly was destroyed by a
volcano and and the thing is Pompeii is
a very nice case study for a geology
because a lot of information is there so
what we try to do is through
collaboration with some archaeologists
come up with a reasonable interpretation
how Pompeii might have looked like 2,000
years ago
and we want to do that with an extreme
amount of detail so this is one of the
largest models we've created it's not
only large in size but it's really a
huge amount of detail per building so if
you look at some of these buildings
maybe
the one at the front you see that really
each individual roof break is modeled
with polygons and you get up to maybe a
few hundred thousand polygons for each
individual building so then the whole
model goes up to maybe a billion of
polygons now and that creates all sorts
of problem so you cannot expect us to
just render a billion polygons so what
we have to do here is also integrate
some level of detail notion and use some
simple geometry in the back this is
another example and this one kind of
shows how this technology could be used
in urban planning so this collaboration
was was done with urban planners they
looked at in the place in Singapore and
the question was how can we can I show a
reasonable interpretation how the city
would develop in the future and we don't
only want to show some maybe density
maps in 2d of the population but we want
to capture the essence of the geometry
that is already there and cannot try to
extend this type and flavor of urban
structure out to the new places where
the city is going to be extend yeah
another example some also in
collaboration with archaeology may be so
when I started to take courses in
architecture you typically start by
studying antique ancient or the like
temples and you know if you also took
some classes you remember like the Doric
and yannick and Corinthian order and the
really nice part of this ancient
architecture is that on the one hand
it's it's very structured so there seem
to be at least a lot of rules it's it's
very good for modeling with shape
grammars but on the other hand there are
also lots of exceptions to the rules and
only maybe the authors in trying to
simplify the architecture they they only
create the illusion of rules so so we
have a lot of regularity but still
enough challenges to make their modeling
problem interesting so and again this is
a model that's fairly heavy I think
several million polygons so if you would
just go with a
regular polygonal modeling tool kitten
eventually you might not even be able to
move the model around much because
there's so many more polygons in the
details so this example should show that
maybe a novice user can generate you
know this is modern architecture can you
can generate interesting current content
in in in very short time so we had
someone experiment with CT engine that
had some design background I guess and
you know this is something they could
get maybe after a day so this is
starting from scratch no idea but
experiencing modeling and generating a
city this is another example from
archaeology to show also a bit breadth
of what we do so this is my and
architecture also some older
architecture and and so we worked with
archaeologists to come up with some
rules that capture the specific type of
architecture and so so the main part
here is we're not in the business of
placing keys we're not modeling these
very elaborate ornaments that you see
here so these would have to be generated
by an artist or a modeler in traditional
modeling packages but what we can do is
we can occur and we can encode the
placement and the spatial layout and the
dimensions of all these individual
elements so now after these examples I'd
like to give some at least high-level
overview of how modeling with this shape
grammar works so that what we do would
be did is in 2006 we introduced this
shape grammar that we call CGA shape and
so the idea is we have human readable
rules you'll see some examples soon with
a notation like L systems we will show
some examples on how can we model
facades but also mass models
we don't want to impose very unrealistic
restrictions but we also don't want to
go overboard to make it a totally
general modeling package and yeah let's
let's look at some example here so we
want a model basically top-down so we do
rule driven modification and replacement
of individual shapes so if you look to
the left of this slide then you see a
temple model starting out with four
basic shapes and then we iteratively
evolve the design by this rule driven
replacements will always take one shape
let's say maybe the roof shape further
along it then we replace this shape with
multiple other shapes and so on so you
also see how the columns start to
develop and then the columns get broken
down into individual parts and the more
and more details are generated and and
while this is not always the case you
see that if your model carefully or in a
lot of models the intermediate modeling
steps are also some reasonable higher
level interpretation of what this temple
could look like so you could not only
use the last image shown here on the
slide but you also could use the
second-to-last as a fairly good model
some parts and then how are they related
in any way can you just add a to replace
everything there something any
constraint
so when so typically we want to take one
part and take out and and and and mainly
try to do a local replacement however
we'll see later on that there has to be
some the rules have to ask a bit about
the context so what we'll what I'll show
in five five minutes or so are two
concepts that we use to query the
context in the rules but pretty much the
easy modeling works if every shape is by
itself does that so so how does is how
each individual shape and coded or rule
so so maybe let's start of start with
how this rules look like so the main
thing is that a rule has a predecessor
just is a shape that is going to be
replaced and there's a condition and
some probability but then the main thing
is the predecessor shape is going to be
replaced and then there's some encoding
of the successor so this one shape can
be replaced with either no shapes so
it's gonna get killed more or less it
can be replaced with a modified shape or
very often it's actually being replaced
with multiple other typically smaller
shapes in the end an individual shape
you see this example here in this slide
so we need some identifiers or they
might have a name then it has some
geometry and we also use this concept
which is an extension to this oriented
coordinate system that is a very popular
entry modeling we call it scope so we
not only have an or at this coordinate
system in space but along each axis we
also have a size so that gives somehow a
box in space which is often the bounding
box of the shape now let's look at some
of the shape rules that we use and
they're going to be several examples so
the first one which is typically used
for mass modeling are transformations
that you know most of you probably very
familiar with such as translation scale
and rotation
so if you look at the example on the
bottom of the slide you see some rules
of how one shape you could imagine it as
a one bigger box gets replaced by two
smaller boxes and the cylinder and this
would be a rule to maybe start some more
interesting mass model and you see for
it before each shape like these two
cubes or cylinders are placed they
always get translated and scaled into
the appropriate position now then if you
want a model facades the thing that we
found the most helpful is is to use
actually also a top-down splitting to to
model facade so what what you see here
is you see one facade which is a
rectangle and this facade is being split
in five individual elements so you have
the first floor and legends and three
other floors and the key here is to
somehow and coat the rule so that it is
valid for a larger range of rectangles
so independent of how big this input
rectangle input facade is we always have
to come up with some reasonably
proportion split but in this example
there's always only gonna be a split
along the up axis and then we're gonna
have five other elements and another
split that you see here is something
more along the lines of repeating
elements and this type of split would
say something like okay you have a floor
maybe now place as many windows as as
they are spaced and you know each window
should be sized to approximately so
let's hopefully see how it looks like so
you have you know this one type of rule
it's not only this one up there so you
see how this would work out and how the
designs that we go after our size
independent so they can be applied to a
larger range of facades now the
interesting concept is the component
split and so what we explore in the
framework is switching dimensions so we
can start with three dimensional shapes
but then we also can kind of split down
to two dimensional shapes maybe the
faces or one dimensional we can split
down two points and but then
we have these lower dimensional shapes
we still try to keep this or oriented
coordinates this system so that once
we're down to 1d later on we might get
back up to 3d to actually place 3d
geometry and this is helpful for may be
placing ornaments or placing tiles on a
roof or modelling two facades and and
then we need to manage a lot of assets
and I mean this goes a lot into software
engineering but apart from just the
geometry we also need you know we need I
mean we need to load meshes textures
shaders and do all that so you see an
example of maybe several textures for a
window so now given these rules the
question is the rules are only one thing
we still need to shemar give some idea
of how to model with these rules and as
I indicated before so if you want a
model facades then we typically go in
the following order that is we want to
start with the facade as a rectangle
then split it into maybe floors or
ledges and then these floors itself
we're going to split into a concept that
the invented because we didn't find any
appropriate thing in architecture so
we're pretty sure someone has a name for
it but we just reinvented it so this is
the concept of a tile in the tile this
is what you see to the left of this
slide is somehow a window a door plus
the surrounding wall and why we need
this tile is because we want to have a
clean split of a floor into only tiles
so then when we split into what we call
tiles we can really get a clean
subdivision and then later on these
tiles are going to be broken down into
wall window other ornaments and so on
there's a another example just to show
you maybe the complexity of encoding
some architecture so this is a temple
that
Carl either photographed on his vacation
trips or downloaded from the internet
and so this is we wanted to remodel that
and what you see to the left is some of
these are the main rules that you need
to encode this architecture and we'll be
going to leave out in this example is
the exact dimensions and the placement
of textures and materials but in
principle you see that the description
of this sample here will be pretty short
and from this description you can then
go on and create the family of temples
so then we talked about facades before
but typically if you want to go into
mass modeling
actually the splitting we try it it's
very as much simple but it's actually
not that successful it turns out that if
you want to create mass models you
basically want to assemble some basic
solids such as cylinders and blocks and
you want to take them and kind of stick
them into together so to kind of create
the mass model and you not only need
these basic blocks as you see on the top
here but we also need some basic blocks
for roof shapes Indic but again actually
a lot of these more complex roofs if you
go into geometry it's pretty much a
nightmare right but if you take some
basic solids and stick them together you
can get some very complex roofs that are
actually pretty much exactly how that
buildings are created um this is an
example for mass modelling and so the
main thing we want to show here is that
this mass this this whole example was
generated with four rules only so we
have four rules of a few so basically
four basic mass model Center rules don't
have some stochastic variation to them
and all each of these rules just start
with a building law there's an axiom and
so if you set the parameters well so you
can get you know fairly large and we
could extend that fairly wide fairly
large and release
the urban mall Leslie's from for the for
the masses so then there are some
technical issues because this concept of
how to modeling facades and how to model
mass the building mass doesn't totally
trivially work together so what you see
on this example is that if we now take
all these solids let's say we take seven
boxes you stick them together somehow
you can generate a really interesting
mass model but then if each box or shape
goes off by itself and kind of splits
down some facades you get lots of
unwanted intersection so if you look at
this example here typically you will see
all these windows at the top of one
shape or cut off and all these windows
here cut off and if I actually show you
a rendering of city in flyover pretty
fast it's a really high chance you're
not going to notice but you know if it
is something more like an interactive
game application then there can be huge
complaints so what we do is we we can
introduce two concepts to kind of handle
this scenario and you can only on a very
high level so we kind of use this
concept of dominant construction lines
of a shape or of a design so that shapes
can a snap to these dominant
construction lines and the second
concept that we include is that that
that shapes and rules can query
intersection with other shapes to kinda
have some context sensitive design now
the the the problem is geometrically is
extremely or it's reasonably simple
right so when you just say oh I wanna
have the perfect triangulation of only
the free space on the facade I mean you
can get the medium complexity geometric
program into it but if you just solve it
geometrically there's actually no no way
you can do a lot of design with it so
the real challenge here is how can we
have the rules still be simple
so that we can design something but
generate fairly complex designs so this
is an example so we use this a lot for
office buildings how this snapping and
intersection or occlusion I can be used
to generate some results now this is
where I'm gonna turn it over to plus KY
and he's going to talk more about
modeling in the context of
reconstruction welcome so I'm gonna talk
about the reconstruction based on on
photographs so the idea of of this of
the method which I which I'm gonna
introduce is a is the that we are in the
pipeline
after the photogrammetric guys have
acquired the what they I think they call
it shoe boxes so means they they have
all these solids the mass models and if
they have ground-based or image or
airborne imagery and they have they have
these mass models with the kind of
textures on these mass models so that's
that's where we think they are we come
into play so we look now at these
textures which are rectified on and on
the on the facets so you see here's such
a texture and the idea is now that we
that we detect the structure of the
first side so see here first so we we
split it into the single tiles and
afterwards we subdivide each tile so
it's are really the basic concepts which
which Peter showed before
so we reverse this concept and
and can find automatically such
structures so what we do then non
automatically you can see here is the
adjustment of the death of the of the of
the of the elements of the architectural
elements so at the end you have created
a representation in about a facet
representation which kind of really
looks good in about two to three minutes
so in and this this work was represented
at last year SIGGRAPH so so I'm gonna
show a few slides about it how it is
done so the first idea was we have to
find out the symmetry so we use the
symmetry detection algorithm called a
mutual information the idea is you have
to a two dimensional search base so we
are looking for where is the best
symmetry axis and where is the and and
where where is the best range where is
symmetry so you see it here so we do
that iteratively again and again and at
the end we receive something which we
call the irreducible facet so then on
this facet we we have to find splitting
lines and here it's it's kind of a basic
concept so it's a nature tection trying
to find edges for for example horizontal
splitting lines are where or where we
have horizontal edges and no vertical
edges we get in some candidates and at
the end we have to find also concerning
our floor height ranges etc so we have
we have an optimization problem which
can be solved quite easy at the end we
expand this grid back onto the facet and
the good thing is now we have we have
these these numbers in here or
lost their IDs so you see here so all
these all these classes are detected as
same structure so and you see we have
here now six different tiles and that
helps now a lot in the next step which
is the local the local split detection
so here the idea is we we try to find HS
and are going from the outside to the
inside and and we always take the best
edge and sometimes we can take two edges
if there are the same of same size so at
the end what we get is a is a is a
representation like like a split grammar
and the problem is now as you can see
it's you always iteration so it's it's
it's computer vision so it's it's always
not very very correct and so actually
here here's what what comes out just for
for the first step and all tiles but now
we have what what we found before is we
have all the symmetry information and on
each on each step we make use of the
symmetry information and because of that
we can synchronize the different tiles
and then at the end it looks quite quite
quite correct everywhere so the only
problem what you have is if you have
tiles like this where you just have one
representation there is like the typical
computer vision problems means you have
to tune thresholds etc so but as soon as
you have a tile which which is about
which which has more than three three
different instances of this really
looking similar looking then the thing
gets fairly stable
so the next step we try to fit our
assets into into into this into the
found elements so it's the same asset
library which Peter presented before you
can see here so it's not exactly the
same as a library it's a what we did is
we we took that asset library and we
rendered 2d representations out of it so
we have for each asset we have also two
different presentations these are these
can be seen here these are the 2d
representations so this is also done
automatically with a with a my ml script
so quite easy then we again Luis mutant
information to compare these 2d
representations with the with with the
texture and if you find some some one
some then we take it again we can use
this this for the whole symmetry
detection helps to make it stable so now
but the cool thing is now that after we
have found this representation we can go
back to to the rule set so we can
convert the found model into a rule set
so what you see here is a see the shape
facet which now is going to be replaced
by a subdivision in two floors and the
floor tool for example is is replaced by
a subdivision into a tile and the repeat
of tile for the tile for this is
subdivided into other regions and for
example this region is staying at the
end is an asset which means just a wall
shader actually so so means we have we
have to we have the semantics for floor
styles and the and the elements on the
ground floor
and on the on the leaf the Leafs of the
of the of the shape of the shape tree so
and another cool thing is that
implicitly the the rules are size
independence of means you can you can
apply them on different sized facets or
you can you can of course you also can
copy/paste the the design or change
change the design whatever so here are
some results so on the left you see the
input on the right the reconstruction so
a good thing is also even when we are
doing this this element matching with
the assets we also can use the shaders
of the assets so that that's the reason
why there there's on the right side
there's reflection cetera so each of
these facets was created in in in about
three minutes
and as you can see this has been all all
ground-based imagery so one of the good
thing is that our algorithm works also
on on low res imagery so what you can
see here is a airborne imagery which has
about the resolution of thirty to forty
centimeters and so yeah you a Google
Earth you know it the textures are our
menu are on street level it's the
resolution you have resolution problems
also it's actually I think it's it's a
it's more bandwidth problem I don't know
if you can can type through all all
textures or stream all textures in in 3d
environment and so what we have here is
a is a representation which is which is
a way more way more compact and and of
course you can you can go where we very
near and yeah so this is a modeling
session this is all life done so here
and I shot it shortly noted it so we can
use this these representations to to
accelerate the rendering for example we
took the death map factorized them and
unsolved them in real time during
rendering so what you see here on the
right is a is it's not just just because
of PowerPoint but these are this is
really a massive massive scene and and
if it's not in PowerPoint it's really
it's more than 60 frames per seconds and
really fast on
on a standard modern PC and these are
representations excuse me so we have two
different them which we take different
the death maps and we can we can it's
like in single view
so one repetition is that that we don't
like that map and the other one is the
material index map and then we also need
to compress acceleration to have
structures for the photo reference so
livid like a single value that
composition so you try to capture like a
few clusters with this major
posterization here to go start locally
modulus all the reconstructed offline
so now we come to the results section of
the after talk I'm gonna show some
procedural modeling examples what we
have done with the city engine and that
cetera so as people already said
implemented all the stuff in in in the
program called city engine and and
that's that's what I'm now doing after
my PhD is commercializing this thing and
we have it we planned to release it in
May
so what you see here is a it's a
screenshot of the prototype so when you
have a procedural modeling solution it's
very important that you have lots of
different OpenGL views so means it's a
it's a computational design system and
and often because you're you are really
modeling on a high level it's sometimes
very hard to understand what's going on
so we have to really visually debug be
able to visually debug your your models
and your rules and what this it's also a
little GIS little GIS editor is is
integrated to handle large-scale scenes
and what's also very important is the is
the whole interactive editing stuff so
so everything has to be interactive and
so what you see here is for example a
stochastic rule so you can just the
Pompeii rules have been so fast ik means
when you are not happy with the building
you just can click on it and and just
change the random seed which generates
the building and then it creates you in
another building and this can be done
also in real time and we also offer a
visual authoring tools that you can
visually edit the rules and and modify
the windows etc the but I found most
important of this work was actually the
what is the workflow behind procedural
modeling especially when you want to
we had virtual worlds one thing was the
whole reconstruction thing where we use
image based methods then it's kind of
clear what you have to do but when you
want to create a virtual world or some
new architectural buildings or whatever
then the main problem was not to encode
the design as was not to learn the
design to learn the shape grammar and
decode it with it
the main problem was to analyze the
architecture and understand the
understands the parameter of the
architecture because at the end
architecture is also kind of an art and
and there it's it's highly subjective
subjective and and yeah so but
afterwards after you have understands
the parameters etc then the process is
really easy to do and can be done very
fast
so what you see here is an example see
here on the Left the conceptual design
we got from from artists that that was
for a short movie and then they they
created we created here two drafts and
what what was now we very interesting
for us was a touring production day they
decided to change the urban layout here
on the right they wanted to have more
like a megacity urban layout and if you
are in with traditional methods
something like this is kind of
impossible you cannot change you cannot
do such a major design change during
during production and but that's one of
the big advantages of procedural
modeling we just could apply this we
just had to change the mass models which
took about two days and then reapply all
this all these things
so some some results the petronas tower
was one of the first buildings we did
wish to see a shape grammar and actually
i think it's quite cool as you can
create without if you leave about seven
to ten rules you can create a building
like this
consisting of of half a million of
polygons and of course i have to say the
the petronas tower is a very formalized
and rule-based
building yeah
another example you can see here that's
that was our test scenario to to to
check if the if the shape interaction
means the occlusion to snapping which
peter talked about is working well
so at the end we liked it so much we we
rendered it properly and so what we
animated here we animated the mass model
manually and what do you and at the end
it looked like this so what you see here
is a you can for any configuration we do
not care what what special configuration
you have the design is working always
inherently so that's a that's really
really practical so you can change the
things and everything is always always
like each other
other things you can do with the if the
grammar is you can create floor plans
you can see here so that was for project
in dubai they they are changing the the
so so that the ground area is changing
of the floor plan the ratios are
changing etc and then you see the
which is which is of course static then
the Pompeii mode to Pompeii example you
see here this is this is the input data
which which archaeologists gave us here
on the left is the is the population
density here is the H map land-use map
and here's just topology furthermore
there are colleges told us a lot about
how the how the architecture there
looked like so they told us things like
they had huge doors and they gave us
measurements and paintings etc and we
then had had tasks to encode this
knowledge into into rule sets and we
ended up having having a rule set
consisting of about more than hundred
and thirty I think rules and here's the
animation so what you see here we
created this this in about one month and
I think with traditional methods it
would take you about six months to
reconstruct such a massive model and
yeah it's also as Peter said we have
different level of we have level of
details so we are we are using it also
in in for especially the Pompeii model
for for real-time environments so we
have for example this this project
called cyber walk which is kind of like
like the holodeck in in Star Trek means
it's an only direct omnidirectional
treadmill where you can walk around
we're so and then you have HMDs with
with this Pompeii model so you can
really walk around in Pompeii stuff like
this so this is one of the projects we
are doing and there we are there we have
to use a level of detail of course all
the stuff here which we are doing is a
we are placing crowds in cars
it is this is this can be done very
easily because we have so many so much
information about our cities we have all
this all this all this semantic
information like it sounds simple but
for example we know where the doors are
and and we know the windows we have we
have all the older land that the land
use land use map so we know where this
this might be a bakery or or or another
another shop so we have all this
information I give a short so this was
done together with EPFL Daniel that tall
man's group
again everything in real time
and further
so for example and what they did is a so
we have different areas rich and poor
area and then different different
targets and and people are behaving so
behaviors so so for example people go
into a bakery and buy a bread and come
out with a bread I don't know maybe it's
not here here they all come out they go
in without bread and come out with a
bread it's really yeah so did this is
work in progress
you see another example here's a but I
think what is really important is when
you and you have urban urban scenes is a
is all this is the vegetation I think it
it makes this these these regions in in
the 3d space and so here we have applied
it onto onto a suburban scene for
example we also had to apply the the
grammar took to place the swimming pools
and yeah and everything and other thing
which we are currently working on is is
interactive urban simulation means we
want to simulate the growth of cities as
we will see real real urban simulation
but interactive and there you can also
play around with different parameters so
you can create your own cities which
which pop up and so that was one of my
students did that with with this with
this urban simulation system so it was
so what you see here is a is a is a city
which which which grows in about several
years and it's for the computer
animation festival so it's it's really a
arty
era the different different colors are
represent different land users
- siesta it's a logo
here are the finals
here's some more results and so this is
stuff which which we have done with the
short movies so we created for example
the backgrounds for short movies so that
was the actual one of my main
motivations when I when I begin with the
city engine and so this is this is
Venice that was done in one day and so
it was done in one day because it's it's
it's very low resolution so it's not
very detailed resolution but the cool
thing there for example was we did not
had access to the to the to the land and
to the to the to the street network so
what what we just created some kind of
distribution with by generating the
streets etc and then we just projected
two satellite image onto it and I think
that's that's quite nice for all flights
etc so as I said that you're really
really efficient in modeling here that's
a project which we did again with to buy
and so that was for the world Island I
don't know if you have heard of it this
is crazy
Dubai project and so architects they
calculated building envelopes for this
look for this world island and and then
more or less one day before the they had
to show it to the shack these this
building envelopes they they found out
the Shia Sheikh wants to see some some
Tweety he want to see some some kind of
abstract ideas of buildings so what we
had to do was a we had to create English
envelopes kind of this strange looking
buildings what is the city engine is
also very can be used for creating
science fiction cities like this
which i think is awesome so this one was
involved by inspired by Fifth Element
here
here's another city the last one that
was also for for further movie short
movie until the director told me make a
really really big city and at the end it
was too big so he cut it out yeah so
maybe short discussion but I think what
we're precision modeling is going to I
definitely think now if with all the new
user interaction techniques and
paradigms and especially with
multi-touch sketch-based etc and in
combination with with with procedural
modeling I think this is going to be the
tools which which allow to create and
publish 3d 3d content for non-expert
users and really make make 3d available
to make 3d content creation available to
the masses I think it's it's a little
bit and another thinking which is which
is needed here a little bit of
Technology evangelism maybe because it's
but what we do here is a we really
encode the design with the being code to
design knowledge in the computer so it's
not like that the computer is just just
a pen or like in CAD for example and CAD
what you do is actually same thing you
chicken
with a pen more or less and and and yeah
so I think computers more than then also
just calculating similes simulation and
optimization so it's really a it really
gives you new possibilities how you can
how you can create content when you
bring in your your your design knowledge
into with with for example grammars into
into the computer I think it gives you
all new levels of artistic director
ability etc so these are the people
which we'd like to thank and so that was
it for the talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
