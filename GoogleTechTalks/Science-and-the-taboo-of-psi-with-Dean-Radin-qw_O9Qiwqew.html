Dean Radin is a researcher and an author
in the field of parapsychology he is
senior scientists at the Institute of
noetic Sciences in Petaluma California
and a four-time former president of the
parapsychological Association he has
held appointments at Princeton
University Edinburgh University
University of Nevada Las Vegas s RI
International interval Research
Corporation and the boundary Institute
at these facilities Dean was engaged in
basic research on exceptional human
capacities principally SCI phenomenon I
think many of us would groups I
phenomenon such as ESP clairvoyance
precognition and telekinesis in the
realm of science fiction as opposed to
science despite there being little
support for this research in academia I
was surprised to learn how much there
actually was the Princeton engineering
anomalies research lab spent three
decades working on this research SR I
international has funded a large body of
research in this area governments around
the world have funded these studies for
potential military applications and
other uses my curiosity about this led
me to Dean Radin I met Dean at a
conference a few months ago I was
impressed with Dean and I wanted to give
him a chance to speak in front of this
audience in particular well this type of
research brings an incredible amount of
skepticism I respect both Dean
scientific background and his
intellectual honesty
enough to listen with the discerning but
ultimately open mind thank you very much
Jessica science and the sigh taboo I'm
going to read a story here one Thursday
morning about 4:00 a.m. I jumped out of
bed feeling as if I was dying I felt as
if blood or something was pouring down
from my head choking me and I was trying
desperately to get my breath I grew very
weak I thought it must really be drying
dying my husband put me down in the bed
were arrested but felt so all gone oops
let's restart that leader then I thought
my son had called saying oh mama helped
me in such anguish that was February
10th and on the 12th who received a
telegram saying our son was killed by
gunshot
in the head at one o'clock on February
10th there is a nine hour difference in
time I feel he called me as it was
happening as it happened and I heard his
groan and felt his dying this was
published a few days ago in the Journal
of cognitive neuroscience the original
story comes out of a collection of such
cases by Louisa Rhine who was JB Ryan's
wife in 1981 well what do we do with
such stories or of course called psychic
phenomena that abbreviated SCI there's a
number of people who will consider it
superstitious nonsense
I suspect typically in technical
audiences that percentage is higher than
in a general population but it depends
on whether you're asking people publicly
or privately which is part of this
nature of the taboo and this topic so
there's some people say it's
superstitious nonsense there are lots of
other people who would say well no my
experience actually doesn't agree with
that my experience is more consistent
with the kind of story that I just read
as a real experience than what what you
may think so of course there's plenty of
reaction to these kinds of things
there's lots of skeptical comments that
basically say that there are billions of
people out there with trillions of
experiences and so we hear the weird
stuff occasionally there's going to be
an unusual coincidence and those are the
things that bubble up to the top and so
while the experience that I just read
which is a true experience maybe it's a
one in a trillion chance but it's
because there's all these other
experiences that we don't hear about so
that's a possible explanation it's
probably true to some extent and there
are lots of other explanations that can
be used to look at stories like this and
try to understand why is it that people
have these experiences on the other hand
it doesn't take very long to realize
that popular culture is saturated with
this topic it forms the base of an
enduring topic that almost everywhere
you look within novels - TV - you name
it there's something out there all the
time it's a compelling topic and so the
question is why is that and I will say
that
one of the things that we run into again
and again as a scientist studying this
is a taboo
well the taboo in science as it doesn't
any realm it restricts the nature of
inquiry and it also restricts what ideas
are acceptable and as a tad taboo it's
this is not very good in science because
science rests on informed consent or it
can inform consensus if an informed
consensus is constrained because of a
taboo it means that science can't really
make up a good decision about what's
going on it means it also will create
distortions and how the topic is
reported because especially among
skeptical journalists you don't want to
be caught with their pants down so it's
extremely difficult to get accurate
reporting on this topic in the science
media and I'll show an example in a
minute all this means is that the taboo
is sustained and this taboo has been
sustained for over a hundred years so
it's a really good one so this showed up
yesterday on the Boston Globe brain scan
tests failed to support validity of ESP
and the the journalist said research in
parapsychology is largely taboo in
academia but now two Harvard scientists
have set out to settle once and for all
does it exist the study was the first
used cutting-edge brain scanning called
functional MRI well here's our first
mistake because in fact it wasn't the
first it's the fifth and the previous
for which you guys can find out very
quickly now because of the the nice
Google Scholar engine you can find for
others published three of which are in
mainstream medical journals of which all
four of the previous MRI studies are
successful have you ever heard of them
no but this one which turns out that
it's not quite as unsuccessful as they
claim that's one you do hear about if
ESP were real the brain shoves responded
differently to ESP than to non ESP but
they found in all cases no evidence for
ESP but that's actually not what the
paper says the paper says he tested 16
couples of which one couple showed
extremely significant results of the
type that they predicted but then they
go through great pains to explain a way
that result is a possible artifact
in which case my response writing to
this journalist was well if you can take
the results you're looking for and
explain it away as an artifact well
doesn't that mean that the study design
was flawed because it means you
potentially could have explained
everything away as an artifact and
finally the the person who did this is a
grad student at Harvard who got a prize
for his best thesis when he was an
undergraduate looking at I believe
looking at some kind of power
psychological effect but now he's
abandoning his interest because a
professional peril well that's the
definition almost of the taboo the taboo
is that as a grad student it's kind of
okay to do this but absolutely don't do
it for your doctoral dissertation
because the likelihood of going on to
get a real job
is much lowered and that's because of
the taboo the topic itself so my
interest all along has been like a lot
of people I've heard stories over the
years I never heard anything about this
in my scientific training but I was
curious could there be they are there is
there a kernel of truth and all of this
saturation that we have in popular
culture could there be something really
going on well we can't rely on anecdotes
because they're not controlled but there
are scientific tests that have been
controlled well one place to look for
what science has to say about this is to
look for what scientific oversight
panels have concluded and there during
the Cold War there were four open
reviews and a number of classified
reviews about what what happens and you
take people who are proponents and
people who are skeptical and people in
the middle bring them together for a
week or so to review the evidence what
do they conclude these were four studies
that were done there that are in the
open literature all four concluded that
something interesting was going on they
weren't willing in all cases to come out
and say yes we believe that psychic
effects a real but they all did say
including the skeptics something's going
on that we can't account for so here's
an example of a review of remote viewing
evidence that was done for the CIA in
1995 just as the the formerly classified
program became unclassified Jessica Utz
is a professor of statistics and also is
now on the Executive Council of
the Triple A s her conclusion was using
the standards applied to any other area
of science it has concluded that psychic
functioning has been well established so
jessica is a world-renowned
methodologist besides being a
statistician one would think that she
knows what she's talking about the other
person was Ray Hyman of we're very well
known skeptic professor of psychology
from the University of Oregon now
retired his conclusion was well these
results the experiments and remote
viewing were free of methodological
weaknesses and the effect sizes are too
large and consistent to be dismissed as
statistical flukes so something
interesting was going on at Jessica and
Ray disagreed about what to call this
like Ray is not going to say he believes
in psychic phenomena no matter what
nevertheless in terms of the actual
evidence he agreed something interesting
seems to be going on so the bottom line
is that if you begin to look at
scientific oversight committees and
review articles and so on over the past
hundred and thirty years you find
increasingly sophisticated methods where
effects don't disappear even under
scrutiny with the latest techniques so
for example I just mentioned the the
fMRI study you can get results with an
fMRI something interesting appears to be
going on well why didn't you learn this
in college why don't you ever hear about
this in the mainstream science media
it's because of that it's it's this boo
taboo some people think that there
aren't there are no taboos in science
like science is supposed to be open and
freewheeling and so on and of course
this is not the case there are 17,500
institutions of higher learning around
the world there are roughly 50 academics
in the world who were openly interested
in SCI and that includes both proponents
and skeptics 50 which means that the
academic interest level is approximately
0.3% 99.7% of all academia in the world
don't have a single person identified
for their interest pro or con
that's a tablet well over 90% of the
population is interested about 60% of
the popular
believes in the probability or the
certainty that psychic effects are real
the rest of the population is interested
some are very strongly against it others
are sort of mildly for it but the point
is that a lot of people are at least
interested usually for interesting
topics you have academic programs that
are discussing in some way 0.3% why is
that well imagine that you can put
consciousness on a continuum on the the
bottom axis is where is consciousness
and we say well that maybe it's local or
maybe it's not so local and the vertical
axis to say well what is consciousness
is it something that is caused or
something that is causal down here in
the bottom we have all is matter it's a
material monism under this model the
mind and the brain are identical this is
the assumption of the neurosciences when
you start moving up here I don't want to
restart my computer and you start moving
up on this scale you've you bump into
things that the neurosciences have
difficulty and dealing with things like
creativity intuition and especially
genius you look in the literature to
find out what neuroscientists think
about genius and we're talking about
Mozart level genius there is absolutely
no response to that we don't know how
that can be you go further up the scale
towards non-local you end up with things
like sigh these strange experiences that
people talk about and then further up
mysticism and now models that start to
look like mind is not identical to brain
it's correlated with but not identical
and all the way at the top is a mental
monism or idealism well here's Western
Sciences down here it assumes that
things are material that we use
objective methods and a mind in fact is
equal to the brain appear roughly as
Eastern Sciences interested more in
energetic or informational aspects of
the world rather than material
subjectivity is held in high regard and
mind is not equal to brain so these two
ways of looking at the world create
theoretical boundaries and you notice
that I stuck psy into the Eastern
Sciences because it is compatible
at that level whereas in the Western
Sciences there's no room for it and
that's what sustains the taboo from
trained as a Western scientists you look
at these phenomena and you cannot
imagine any conceivable way that it can
fit within the worldview that you were
trained to understand
and obviously that method is very
powerful you guys wouldn't have a job
here it wouldn't be no building here or
anything if Western science wasn't
extremely powerful and so it's seductive
in his power but maybe Eastern Sciences
haven't been of all that far off the
mark either so we both have our
different tools the tools in Western
science have used fancy machines like an
MRI to look inside the brain to look at
the material part of it and in the
Eastern Sciences are based more in
contemplative practice interior and we
both have our mandalas our mandalas in
the West are these pretty pictures that
come out of the brain and mandalas in
the East or other kinds of pretty
pictures so in the West and we look at
that object and we say well how does
that thing work our tendency is to take
it apart since that's what reductionism
is good for well what if it wasn't a
brain that we were looking at but more
like that it's this object so from the
West we look at this object which is
playing music and so how do we go about
understanding that well the first thing
is we imagine that there's music there's
somebody inside there creating the music
so we look for Led Zeppelin inside we
take it apart and we look for them and
we can't find them in there what we find
is said our circuits and as their
methods get better and better we find
that our ability to detect better and
better circuitry it's better and this is
what we see in the neurosciences as our
pictures assume that we're seeing
reflections of the thing which is
generating the music somebody from the
east would say don't know you've
completely misconstrued what's going on
here the object is not generating music
it's receiving it and now the important
point here is that both sides might be
right what we see in the neurosciences
are correlations well even in the east
what we talk about are correlations that
are going on not and we if we assume the
direction of causation based on our
theoretical assumptions so which one of
these two are right I'm not so sure it's
a brain generate the mind
or there's a brain receive or filter out
something about some large mind out
there let's look now at experiences
these are the sorts of things that
people report and one and you have
mundane events that occur all the time
the other side you have profound events
and on this axis how often they're
reported from common to rare so we have
things like this down at the common
mundane level most people report that
sort of stuff as you move up here you
start having things which have a much
greater impact in terms of how it
affects an individual and also whether
or not they're rare all the way up to
mystical Union so who reports that
everyone that is down here at this level
of gut feelings feeling of being stared
at roughly 70 percent of the population
including populations of skeptics will
admit that sometimes they get got
feelings sometimes they have the feeling
of being stared at as we move up here we
start using different labels and this is
where for scientists your hair starts
standing up because these words can can
push you until you get even further up
into genius and prodigy and at this
level we start running into something
interesting because we have the the
Saints the great scientists great
political leaders and so on and so up
there we have rare experiences presently
beyond the reach of science to
understand but very well accepted its
well accepted because of those people
and those ideas are what shaped
civilization and shape history and
shaped science and by contrast the other
end of the spectrum we have common
experiences that are completely amenable
to scientific study but it's highly
controversial
I think the when presented in this way
it looks like a paradox and it is kind
of a paradox and in fact I'll show you
the reason for the controversy really is
the taboo it is not the data what are we
talking about we're talking about three
kinds of ways in which information seems
to flow when information flows between
Minds we call it telepathy when it flows
from a mind out into the environment in
some way we call it psychokinesis or
mind matter interaction if information
flows from the environment into the
person's mind we call it clairvoyance
and if it slips in time we call it
precognition that's basically the
phenomena the
we're dealing with well the first rule
in studying these kinds of effects is to
recognize the human performance varies
you're looking here at the base hit rate
for Mickey Mantle from 1951 to 1968
well how do you know that Mickey Mantle
was a good base hitter because if you
look at his overall average it's
basically a 30% that's good to get it
bad on thirty thirty percent of the time
actually get on base is exceptionally
difficult so we know that Mickey Mantle
was good even though on a year-to-year
basis his ability to hit actually
fluctuated quite a bit so humid
performance varies even at the level of
expertise the second is that
experimental results will vary which is
a logical outcome of individual
performance varying and so this looks at
twenty five studies that were conducted
to see whether taking aspirin prevents a
second heart attack no heart attack
above the the ratio of one and heart
attacks below and you can see that if
you take the overall average that it
actually makes a small effect it does
prevent second heart attacks the effect
size here is really small so the first
effect size 0.03 I'll show you in
comparison to some other things in a
minute but the point double oh six is
the percentage of variance accounted for
by aspirin preventing second heart
attacks 0.6% which means ninety nine
point four percent of the variants in
these studies is not accounted for by
aspirin nevertheless even with a really
small effect it is real real small
effects are still real if it wasn't for
statistics we may never know that but
nevertheless that's what statistics are
for we can find that things are real so
here's an example I some years ago
silicone implants breast implants to
remove the market because sometimes it
caused connective tissue disease the
effect size is less than point zero zero
the amount of the variance accounted for
is less than point zero zero zero really
tiny and yet real enough to be taken off
the market another example is asked from
which I just said it it prevents heart
attacks but the effect size is really
tiny
it's
but still real enough for Bayer Aspirin
to get approval from the FDA to be able
to say and sell aspirin a lot of people
take aspirin now to prevent heart
attacks to thin the blood and so on
aspirin can reduce the risk of death
have taken as directed by a doctor as
soon as a heart attack is suspected
that's on the basis of really small
effect sizes but real by comparison
telepathy experiments have an effect
size which is five times greater and
somehow that's not considered real and
the fourth rule is many experiences are
in fact not psychic
so when the skeptic will say what you're
with these anecdotes that we hear are
the result of selective memory in
wishful thinking and coincidence and
misperception and so on all of that is
completely correct and in fact if you do
a survey take a whole bunch of case
studies and you start winnowing out the
ones which are probably due to these
kinds of effects you'll probably get 80%
maybe a little bit more but it leaves a
residual of roughly 10 to 20 percent of
cases where you can really cannot
explain why these effects are there and
it's not these sorts of things so how
would you test for telepathy so the
typical case of telepathy is something
like that somebody is thinking of
somebody else even if they haven't
thought of them in a long time and the
other person just a fleeting thought
goes to their head I wonder why this
person's thinking of me this sort of
thing is reported and actually Rupert
Sheldrake has been studying specifically
telephone telepathy which is the idea
that the phone rings you pick it up and
you haven't looked at the caller idea
and you just know who it is it happens
more often than you might think so the
way this has been studied in the
laboratory ISM through a method called
the ganzfeld the gods fel is a German
word meaning whole field and so what you
do is you'd have a sender and a receiver
the receiver you sit down and put them
under a red light and you take two
ping-pong balls and cut them in half and
you put them over their eyes and you ask
them to keep their eyes open
now you can imagine that if you're under
a red light your eyes are open but all
you can see is a uniform redness then
after a few minutes your brain starts to
get starved for information and you
begin to project hallucinations visual
hallucinations
let's see so you also want to encourage
people to get audio hallucination so you
put white noise through headphones and
you have them wear the headphones and
they sit in a comfy chair and after 15
minutes of this kind of stimulation on
pattern stimulation you begin to hear
things and see things very much like in
a dream state and that's the purpose of
this method to put somebody in a near
dream state very quickly and now you
isolate them from the rest of the world
and you get a sender and the sender's
task is to think of something and try to
inject those thoughts into this person
this experience and you encourage a
person to speak aloud the the technical
term is to mint 8 there mint ating
whatever's going on inside their head
and a mentation is taken by one-way
audio link back to the to the sender to
help to send to revise their mental
sending strategy so that the other
person will begin to get with what the
person is sending so how do we choose a
target the target is to chosen randomly
from a pool of targets which are is
different from each other as you can get
so in this case we might have randomly
chosen a target of an elephant so the
sender is seized an elephant and then I
was trying to think elephant like
thoughts and inject it into the mind of
the receiver and if you're lucky the
person will start talking about things
like big animals and maybe Africa and so
on after about 30 minutes of that you
take the sender the receiver out of the
ganzfeld condition and you show them
four targets and you may play back to
them anything that they said so that
they may have been talking about a big
animal in Africa and now you simply ask
them to choose which one of these four
best corresponds to their experience so
by chance they will choose the right one
one and four times and so we've
collapsed an hour's worth of experiment
into a single data point and we do this
for statistical reasons and also for
clarity a chance of getting it right is
one and for 25% these are places that
have done this kind of experiment from
about the 1920s until today
the cumulative results of somewhat over
3,000 such sessions from about 25 labs
around the world there's chance of 25
percent the actual hit rate is about 32
percent cumulative ly the error bars
show one standard error 88 experiments
the odds against chance are 29
quintillion to 1 this this topic has
been discussed in great gory detail and
a technical literature and also in
Psychological bulletin and a couple of
articles well this is all subjects
combined over 3,000 studies typically
College sophomores people who are
available interested just anybody but if
you look at special populations in
particular creative populations or
siblings where people have very high
openness traits which is a psychological
trait or have reported previous
experience the things like telepathy you
find that their hit rate is not 32
percent but it's actually way up here
more like 65 percent so what kind of
explanations are possible here besides
the real telepathy explanation you have
things like it was a recording mistake
randomization problem sensory leakage on
and on on the one that has been looked
at that in most detail is the
possibility of selective reporting as
maybe there are 3,000 known studies but
there's 50,000 unknown studies if you
stir them into the mix then it would all
go away but as it turns out there are
ways of testing or an estimating how
much missing data there actually is and
I'm not going to go into it because
that's a whole talk unto itself but the
bottom line is that selective reporting
is not a plausible explanation for the
results that we see what happens when
people review this data will help in
1985 Chuck honorton was one of the
principal researchers did a
meta-analysis and he concluded that the
results looked like there really was
telepathy going on in 1985 also Ray
Hyman who we've already met looked at
the same data and he concluded no he
wasn't convinced ten psychologists and
statisticians were then asked to comment
on both what Hyman and honored
had written and none agreed with Hyman
including for people who had had no
previously known opinion about the topic
1994 Daryl Bam and Chuck honorton
published in Psychological bulletin and
they concluded yes something was going
on
1999 Milton and Wiseman published a
another meta-analysis on new data which
had been collected up to that point what
they reported was know as my I say that
he reported as no but it turns out that
their analysis is incorrect if I used
the same analysis a very simple analysis
on based on hits and miss as everybody
else had done actually they did find a
significant effect 2001 storm and airtel
did another update yes so the bottom
line here is that when you go through
the meta analyses that people
republished the only person who wasn't
convinced as Ray Hyman the at bottom
what typically happens though is you say
well meta analyses have their own
problems what happens when skeptical
researchers try the same experiment 2005
this very interesting article was
published in the humanistic psychologist
by two skeptical psychologists who did
eight guns felt studies of the type that
I've just described and after eight
studies we had a overall statistically
significant hit rate of thirty two
percent which turns out to be exactly
the same overall hit rate that you find
in the meta analyses they then said that
well this was precariously close to
demonstrating that humans do have
psychic powers so they ran one more
experiment using an ad hoc model of how
they think psychic stuff would work
which no one had previously tested and
they got a significantly negative result
on that one study so they concluded that
due to this last dataset we do not
believe that humans possess telepathic
powers further the approximately 32%
correct figure obtained an enormous
number of size studies remains
perplexing perhaps is 7 percent
phenomena is comparable to meals crud
factor so I wrote a letter to the editor
saying well I'm not sure that crud
factor is actually a very good
explanation but what it does do is again
show a very clear indicator of the kind
of
that we're dealing with because if you
come into this as a skeptic you run
eight studies and get an overall
significant result which is the same as
everyone else had been reporting and
then you're compelled to say that well
this is precariously close to
demonstrating something I don't believe
well why do people do that I would have
stopped after eight studies and said
well looks pretty good to me but some
people are not willing to do that to
which I respond if they don't like our
evidence I'll show them the kittens
because everybody likes kittens this
expresses some of my frustration and the
frustration of my colleagues who after
showing a huge amount of evidence which
is reasonably consistent over long
periods of time
you can't convince people if they don't
like the kittens so sometimes you have
to bring them out if all the proceeding
was true then it probably is also true
that there should be correlations
between people's brains who are isolated
and so you can do an experiment of the
following type you have to take two
people you isolate them you have them
think about each other you get some sort
of a light flashing stimulus to create
evoke potentials in one person's brain
and you look in the other person's brain
and see whether you get an effect very
simple so here's how we did it up at the
Institute of noetic sciences we have our
fancy shielded room we put the receiver
and there and measured a single single
cortical measure it's easy centers at a
distance the centers room is normally
dark but for the purposes of taking a
picture it has a flasher so she's in a
dark where I'm looking at a blank screen
and every so often the face of the other
person pops up for a few seconds and
then it goes away so that does two
things it does a visual stimulus it
creates a light flash which will create
an Evoque potential in her brain and it
also reminds her what the nature of the
task is namely you're trying to connect
to your friend at a distance so the
experimental data looks like this is
based on 13 couples the centers brain
gets a big provoked response just about
at the right time scale that you'd
expect and the receivers brain also
showed a peak at that point if you do a
correlation and do the proper statistics
you end up with a statistically
significant correlation in time between
the two brains
now this is the center's brain of course
is completely expected the receivers
brain is not because the receivers
sitting in a dark room and nothing's
happening and by the way the receiver
never reports anything either
in this case the receivers not reporting
seeing weird flickering lights or
anything she reports nothing this is
published another study was published by
some colleagues at the University of
Edinburgh where they looked at overall
level of activation in the brain using a
topological map and you can see here
that when the light flashed see if it
points it yeah so light flashes here
roughly 200 milliseconds later there's a
lot of activity in the brain sort of
dies away what's happening in the
composite brain of the receivers as it
turns out there's an interesting
activation that rises in the receivers
which Peaks around 200 milliseconds as
well again the receivers don't report
anything here this is all unconscious
but nevertheless their central nervous
system is running in in time sync
apparently with what's going on in there
in the centres and the out the centers
there are lots of other studies of this
type I could talk about but I'm going to
skip over them and go directly into the
other fMRI studies so here's a study
done by Liana Standish and her
colleagues up at Bastyr University in
Washington University they did a study
involving 30 couples who had been
selected for having practiced a dyad
meditation this isn't two people
meditate with each other and on each
other so they had been practicing this
for a long time
they took those 30 couples ran an EEG
study and selected the three top couples
who seemed to show an EEG conduction and
then ran at the top one of them in this
study and the fMRI so this is one couple
pre-selected out of a group of 30 people
and what you see here is in the
receivers brain while the center at a
distance is looking at a flickering
checkerboard pattern that the occipital
lobe and in particular the visual cortex
of the receiver lit up and time sink and
to a highly significant degree so that
was published in 2001 as far as I can
tell it was never reported anywhere
other than in the journal like no
science media picked it up this was
repeated a few years later with the same
couple
Richards as at the University of
Washington again the same couple this
time in both of the payer they would run
it run the pair first one is receiver
one is the center and then flip them in
this case both of them showed in effect
we're going to jump now to something
completely different we've been talking
about is a possibility of telepathy
which is consistent both in terms of
conscious rapport and central nervous
system reports and also turns out
autonomic nervous system reports there's
a lot of data suggesting that people
connect with each other in some way that
doesn't look like ordinary physics what
about the color fie effect this is a
well-known effect in visual perception
if you look at a time scale where you
have a blue dot and a little bit later
you have a red dot and you just loop
around it around so you're seeing blue
red blue red flashing back and forth you
ask people what do they perceive what
they perceive is that the blue dot about
halfway through changes into a red dot
and this is an interesting illusion
because the conscious experience
precedes the actual stimulus itself so
what could account for that well Daniel
Dennett says this about the color fie
effect unless there's precognition in
the brain thus illusory content cannot
be created until after some
identification of the second spot occurs
in the brain and so it leads to ideas
like tape delays and retro diction and
words that say that the brain is able to
backward infer what happened unless it
really is evidence for precognition in
which case this changes interpretation
quite significantly so I call
presentment an unconscious form of
precognition a feeling about an event in
the future or a vague sense of impending
doom
here's how you do the experiment you sit
somebody down in front of a blank screen
and you record some measure I typically
have used autonomic measures but as
you'll see you could use other measures
as well skin conductance is a good one
they press a button three to five
seconds goes by while the screen remains
blank the computer randomly selects one
picture out of a huge pool of pictures
and the computer chose the picture for
three seconds it's either calm or it's
emotional and then the screen goes blank
for a while to let the person calm down
and then you repeat this 30 or 40 times
so the whole experiment is over in 20
minutes the pictures that I've used most
often are called the International
effective picture system these are
developed by the for the NIH at the
University of Florida and there's an
international standard of pictures that
evoke emotion and to what degree they
evoke the emotion so examples are this
this is a low effect picture not
emotional picture this is a positive F
positive valence high emotion picture
for certain people and the same for
certain other people and then there's
also negative valence positive or
emotional and the the in each category
here they're the go to extremes so in
the really extreme case of a negative
emotional picture these are pictures you
really don't want to see and what they
get in your head you sort of wish you
hadn't seen them it's that kind of a
picture not so much on the erotic side
and the erotic side you look at the
pictures and you really want to see them
again and again that's a different story
so here's what what the actual data
looks like this is skin conductance and
somebody who saw a sequence of comp
issues randomly selected so they might
see a picture like that in a picture
like that and as you see there's a
certain degree of anticipation waiting
for the picture you see it and relax
this happens again and again but this is
a real case where an emotional picture
arose and the presentiments n is this
anomaly that there is a greater degree
of anticipation before that one picture
than there was before the preceding
pictures so when you do this as a formal
experiment you end up with something
like this is the average of all of the
emotional pictures before during and
after
it was shown and for the comp is here's
where you press the button to begin the
trial here's where the stimulus is
randomly selected so when you press the
button and your weight in your
physiology is being recorded the
stimulus has not been selected yet it's
still in the future that difference is a
presentiment difference it it suggests
that there's something about the future
which is pulling your present so you can
do a statistical analysis in this case
one person with 30 trials ended up with
a statistically significant difference
suggesting that somehow they knew what
was about to occur in 19 starting in
1995 I guess I started running a series
of studies this was one I ran here in
Silicon Valley when I was working at
interval research there's this is the
button press here's where the stimulus
occurs there's the presentiments which
turned out to be highly statistically
significant and most of the participants
in this test turned out to be people
like you because I was working in an
environment very much like this and I
needed subjects and I basically would
walk around and say oh they have 20
minutes to spare and found people to do
the test so overall I did 133 people
about 4,500 trials and got a
statistically significant effect along
the line suggesting that there's
something that is giving you a cue about
what's coming up so what sort of
explanations can we use for this other
than precognition well it is a long
laundry list as in any experiment of
this type we always go through
alternative explanations that are more
conventional and so you go through all
of these and turns out that none of them
are very plausible partially because of
the way we designed it also because of
the way we analyze it and even more
explanations the bottom line always is
is it independently replicable and the
answer is yes shortly after I presented
my first study dick Biermann at the
University of Amsterdam did an almost
identical study using his hardware and
his people of course and he reported
basically the same kind of result that I
did he didn't actually think it was
going to work I did it anyway and got an
interesting result
this was unrepeated well there was a
significant result
mr. defeated by Chester wildly at the
University of Texas
he's an electrical engineering student
who built his own skin conductance meter
as part of his master's thesis and then
used it for this experiment and there's
the presentiments he also used both
people and earthworms yes he number is a
probability of the result well in this
but in these particular cases of that
the difference highlighted in yellow is
due to chance that's this is not the way
a statistician would report it but in a
popular way of thinking of it's the
probability that the result you're
looking at is chance so if you get a
probability which is really small it's
very likely not due to chance
so so Chester did this study with people
and earthworms that got almost
significant results significant here by
the way is by convention and behavioral
science is 0.05 is it is at the
threshold where you start to think
something's going on and it's a
completely arbitrary number but
nevertheless it acts as a kind of a
magic icon within the behavioral and
social sciences so we've got a point oh
six result then my colleagues ed May and
James Spottiswoode didn't study using
simply audio startled tones you'd sit
there with headphones on and about once
a minute you hear a real loud noise
randomly and sometimes you'd hear
nothing and so this is looking at the
difference between hearing sound and
hearing silence and they got a
significant effect this is a hundred and
twenty five people that they ran just
once just the first time this was
unrepeated by a colleague of his and
hungry using new equipment new
population so on again a significant
result rollin mccraty at the institute
of heart math in Boulder Creek did the
same kind of study with using pictures
like I had used he found similar results
in the heart rate which is his main
interest so there's a stimulus to
different conditions before and after
meditation those yellow areas are both
significant and then let's see what
about presentiments in the brain most of
what we've looked at so far is presented
in the autonomic nervous system it's
partially because it's easy to measure
there but what about in the central
nervous system so we did an experiment
where we looked at presentiments in the
brain in a very simple test where you
basically sit down in a dark environment
you wear glasses that have LEDs in them
and every so often they flash in fact
you you're asked to press a button see
you press a button and you know that
four seconds later you will either see a
flash or you won't see a flash that's
the nature of the experiment and each
person did one hundred trials the
flashes are determined completely
randomly using a true random number
generator so this is the results shown
for women this is the median EEG in the
two conditions there's a button is
pressed there's where the stimulus
occurs which is either a flash of light
or no flash
that difference one second before the
flash and remember in all of these
experiments the stimulus is determined
immediately before it's shown so the
physiological result that you see here
is happening before the stimulus has
been determined it's not like it's a
clairvoyant experiment where somebody
knows what the answer is nobody knows
what the answer is determined on the fly
right before it appears so the women in
this experiment got that's the
interesting result they got a
significant result two-tailed and the
men did not men got a point 1/2
probability so interesting but nothin
nothin if ik n't well here's something
that looks kind of similar there's a
stimulus there are 3 different kinds of
pictures calm violent a neurotic for
both the erotic and violent pictures
there was a rise as the resentiment type
rise female has got significant result
for both erotic and violent and males
for erotic pictures only what you see
actually fairly often in this males
become a nerd two pictures of violence
and we also have a different reaction
when we see a picture of violence we
sort of shout it we shut in you know we
don't get all emotional about it
females in general don't act that way
and you actually see in these results
what we're looking at here is not skin
conductance but we're actually looking
at hemodynamics we're looking at an fMRI
so even in an fMRI you can do this study
and you can see where is the effect
showing up in the brain the effect the
primary effect showed up in the visual
cortex which is not - not too surprising
because we're dealing with visual
stimuli here but nevertheless there is
something different in the brain and the
visual cortex if you're just about to
see an emotional picture versus a comp
ixr this by the way was the fourth fMRI
study looking at an ESP phenomena what
about in pupil dilation pupil dilation
is a very interesting thing to study
because it's reflects a balance between
the two aspects of the autonomic nervous
system between the sympathetic and the
parasympathetic and if you ever look at
your eye you sort of see a fluctuating a
lot the fluctuation is showing the
balance between the
ambient light but also whether you're
sympathetic or parasympathetic part of
your nervous system is more dominant to
that moment so it actually turns out to
be a really good lie detector and a
really good way of seeing how people are
responding emotionally to what they're
seeing so we do this experiment we did
this in the lab with a nice little eye
tracker and what you can see the
experimenter can see what she's looking
at so I saw that she's looking at this
this picture and I see what how bigger
her pupil is and I also know exactly
where she's looking and we get 60
samples per second on this so using the
same kind of designs as before we have
emotional picture average on the top
calm pictures on the bottom get a highly
significant result this is based on 36
people most of the result turns out to
be in women not so much in men this is a
very nice study to do with an eye
tracker because one of the problems in
doing eye tracking research is that the
amount of illumination and the picture
itself will cause the pupil to change
you have a bright picture people get
stopped down but all of the action that
we're interested in is while they're
looking at a blank screen so they're
always guaranteed that while looking at
a blank screen that's where we want to
see whether there's a difference in
their pupil dilation and it turns out
that there is exactly the same sort of
response that we saw in the other
measures so the summary for
presentiments studies is a fairly new
kind of study I'd know of 19 done to
date of which 10 are significant for 10
studies to be significant out of 19 is
whopping ly significant overall we
incepting interesting is going on what
about mine matter interaction well this
is about a two-hour talk so all I can
tell you is that this kind of phenomena
has been looked at in great gory detail
everything from random events properties
of metal bacteria plants animal health
animal behavior animal intention human
health human behavior human physiology
water food and photons most recent study
is individual or actually small groups
of photons under conditions where you're
doing the equivalent of a double slit
experiment and you want to see whether
or not there
is the equivalent of a quantum observer
effect except without looking at it with
your eye looking at it with some kind of
internal intuitive eye we ask somebody
to imagine that they could see something
happening at a distance as it turns out
this article is published today and
waiting for this to come out
it's Explorer is an Elsevier journal I
wrote this in terms of testing intuitive
knowledge and the intuitive knowledge
here is if you may know that within a
double-slit experiment if you gain or
any quantum optics experiment if you
gain which path information about which
where the photons are going you'll
always see something that looks
particularly and if you don't get that
information you'll get interference
patterns who get things that look
wave-like so this experiment was one to
use a double slit type of design
actually used a Michelson interferometer
where I asked people to use their
intuitive knowledge to gain which path
information put your eye at a distance
in the apparatus at a distance and gain
which path information try to see the
photon and then we looked at the
interference pattern to see what
happened and it turned out we got a
significant result so you can look that
up today extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence I agree with that
but extraordinary with regard to what is
the question that usually doesn't come
up our sigh experiences extraordinary
well know it permeates permeates culture
history all educational levels about the
same number of college professors when
asked about their belief in psychic
phenomena is the same as the general
public you'll get a different response
if you ask them to say aloud what it is
but if you do anonymous surveys you get
the same result is it extraordinary in
terms of empirical evidence I think the
answer there also it's not extraordinary
we're seeing repeatable converging
evidence over a long period of time
suggesting that some of the things that
people talk about are probably real not
all what about extraordinary with regard
to theory well here with regard to what
many people imagine as Western science
theory about what's allowable yes it
looks like it's extraordinary
but on the other hand our existing
theory is complete I don't think so at
least I hope not and if they're not
complete it leaves open a plausibility
door well maybe we'll learn something
new at some point and then it will no
longer be extraordinary what about an
ontological view again this is our
worldview what how do we think the world
is actually constructed I would say that
psy is compatible with what we've
learned about nonlocality
and physics this doesn't mean that I
automatically will equate quantum
entanglement for example our nonlocality
with psy what I do say is that it opens
the door it creates a vector pointing in
a direction which is consistent which is
at least allowable for these phenomena
to occur and one of the things that that
non-local phenomena has done is take our
previous classical worldview and really
expand it a lot and it has expanded it
so much that most people are not deeply
involved in understanding what
nonlocality means just don't think about
it it's very difficult to think about
these things especially since
nonlocality is not just in space but in
time as well so we live in a weird
fabric of reality which has connections
at both transcends space and time so I
would claim the psy claims are actually
pretty ordinary
they certainly happen often enough we
can dismiss maybe 80 to 90 percent using
the usual cognitive biases and
coincidences and so on but we can't
dismiss 100% and I go back to what
Jessica OTT said that using the
standards applied to any other area of
science has concluded that psychic
functioning has been well-established
and one thing that ray hyman agreed to
with this statement was it is for at
least four remote viewing and you
probably would agree for telepathy tests
as well there is no need to do
additional studies that are proof
oriented we have enough proof oriented
studies what we need now are studies
they're trying to get more at the
question of why do we get these
anomalies is it really psychic that's
hard to say because we don't know yet
exactly what psychic means but we see
the results in the experiments they look
a lot like what people report in real
life well why does any of this matter
well one reason is that I think it's
just interesting my personal read
that I've spent the last 25 years doing
this as a scientist is because I think
it's curious it's very curious why would
you not want to study this another thing
is that I think it enhances public
interest in science when you have
something where 90% of the people are
interested in a phenomena but the
mainstream reaction to it is essentially
you're stupid you don't understand how
science works that creates the kind of
context where people get turned off by
science and you see in the NSF and other
places that are concern about literacy
in science among the u.s. population
everyone is concerned because people
believe all kinds of weird stuff
unfortunately these phenomena which are
empirically testable are lumped in to
weird stuff in general which i think is
not warranted this in some respects
augments who and what we think we are if
telepathy is true it means that you're
what you think of as private thoughts
aren't so private after all it means
that you have to think of your mind as
mostly located in here but spread out a
little bit in both space and time and if
it's spread out in space and time it
means that your thoughts and other
people's thoughts commingle at some
stage that creates a very dramatic
change in terms of our personal ontology
about who and what we think we are
another thing is that it challenges the
worldview that says we're we are
completely isolated we live in a
mechanistic world we're mind is brain
and a completely pointless existence you
see this sometimes for people who have
been into the neurosciences for a while
especially as students they become
really depressed because the worldview
that is presented is you are a
meaningless zombie there's nothing going
on and everything is pointless there's
no meaning for anything or as Francis
Crick wrote in his book you're nothing
but a pack of neurons well my sense is
that the neurosciences are correct
they're just not completely correct and
if it's not completely correct what's
the part that's missing am i nothing but
a pack of neurons plus something else
well if so I want to know what -
something else is and here's why science
reacts badly to
anomalies because what I presented to
you from a Western science point of view
are anomalies what you see is an anomaly
like here is some kind of weird result
having to do with intention on
physiology and here's another weird
result of attention on photons and here
it is on random events and there is
telepathy what do you do with this stuff
well you don't know what to do with it
there's another one EEG correlations but
if I showed you a way of thinking about
it and you looked at this for 10 seconds
and now you look at the same pattern now
you can't not see the explanation that
he just gave you in fact if you see this
10 years from now you'll still see the
couple dancing so once you have a
framework for a way to begin to take
what looks like anomalies and what I'm
talking about here basically is a
combination of theory and probably an
expansion of our worldview that all of
the stuff will make perfect sense and
the frustrating thing for me is we know
historically that when anomalies arise
and they proceed the theory that once
the theory arises everything falls into
place and everybody instantly forgets
that it was controversial it's like it's
some sort of weird cultural amnesia that
you forget that things which we accept
now were once so controversial that it
got people burnt at the stake or
equivalent so for more information on
all this stuff these are books I
recommend my two books on the left there
are a bunch of other books I brought six
copies of entangled lines which was came
out last year or two years ago now
conscious universe I wrote 97 they
complement each other
extraordinary knowing is a view of these
kinds of phenomena from the point of
view of a psychotherapist I thought we
did a very good job parapsychology and
the skeptics goes into much more detail
on how skeptics have responded to these
issues over the past century or so
irreducible mind is a great book which
looks at is is the neuroscience
assumption that everything is reducible
down to neurons or below is that viable
they make a very strong case I believe
where the answer is no just the one
example I gave was genius no one has any
idea how to explain genius
outside the gates of science is written
by a science fiction writer who tried to
take his order is standard skeptical
approach as a journalist and a science
fiction author to this phenomena could
it be real and you can see that as you
read through the book that he goes
through enormous amounts of churning in
his head to come out with some kind of
conclusion then he concludes that he
thinks it is it does look real sigh Wars
is a combination of skeptical and
proponent essays from the Journal of
consciousness studies and varieties of
anomalous experience was published by
the American Psychological Association
and include SCI as one of these strange
anomalies that happens in the mind and
so I'll end right there and I don't know
we have a few minutes for questions okay
questions and I put this one back up so
you can look at that question in the
baptists going forward in the
useful work especially like usually
things that we think of there actually
existed
learn how to harvest so I'm wondering
has there been any sign which I'm trying
to find the people with extraordinary
abilities in observe that we try to find
to find what they do over that well that
question be heard or do I didn't show
you repeat it repeat it so the question
is to boil it down have technological
demonstrations or uses of these
phenomena been been tried and the answer
for technology in the form of computing
technology probably not I've been
looking into that issue for a long time
one of my degrees is in electrical
engineering and so it immediately comes
to mind that maybe you can create not a
brain-computer interface put a mind
computer interface I think something
like that is possible but we're not
quite smart enough you have to figure
out how to do it but in terms of other
kinds of technologies like like the use
of remote viewing for psychic spying or
for archeology for those sorts of things
that has been used successfully and
continues to be used so in terms of a
skill yes there are practical
applications in terms of a
technologically augmented skill as in
what the DARPA is doing for augmented
cognition I don't think we're quite
there yet but we're getting close and
part of the reason that we're not closer
is because we really don't yet have a
good theory about what exactly is going
on one just to show what how difficult
the problem is there is some inkling
that environmental factors strongly
influence these effects
so James Spottiswoode and how a few
others have looked at the role of the
geomagnetic field and in people's
performance in these kinds of tasks and
it turns out the geomagnetic field makes
a big difference a huge difference
possibly the lunar cycle does as well
consider the lunar cycle and geomagnetic
field are linked possibly the local
sidereal time also makes a difference so
these are all physical correlates that
seem to modulate these effects shouldn't
be too surprising because those same
Varian the same variables also modulate
other aspects of human behavior so maybe
we're looking at something which are
effects which modulate the nervous
systems ability to attend and if we can
figure out ways of optimizing that well
maybe we can get effects which are
strong enough to be able to be used in
technological circumstances David you
had your hand up test test
is this on no I apologize I arrived a
little late so if you covered this
earlier I apologize but I saw four
experiments the ganzfeld the EEG
correlation presentiment and the last
one interferometer and it seemed to me
they all shared some characteristics
that they could be repeated that they
had an outcome that could be predicted
ahead of time and that outcome is
statistically different from chance and
that there was no rational explanation
for that outcome the agree that they
meet those well yeah that's the most
experiments or setup not so much that
there's no rational explanation but yes
no yes yeah so it seems to me that any
one of those four could easily win the
James Randi million-dollar prize for
establishing sight phenomena and
therefore get a foothold in the
establishment to further investigation
these so why do you think that in the
ten years nobody has won the prize or
even tested for it well as Ray Hyman
said and Ray Hyman said that no
scientist would ever accept a phenomenon
based on one shot so that's one reason
so as a scientist perhaps but as I
showed here that the because experiments
vary in human performance varies that
you have to do a power analysis to find
out how many trials you need to do in
order to be able to get a result at a
certain effect so I went through this
exercise how many trials are necessary
to get an effect which would convince
somebody to hand over a million dollars
you probably need a probability maybe
one in a hundred million to get that if
you want say a 90 percent or 99 percent
chance of getting an effect that's 100
million and you do the power analysis it
turns out it would take somebody roughly
four to eight years of running these
experiments every single day
in order to get the result which would
reach that level and if you calculate
how much money you need in order to do
that turns out as more than a million
dollars so the answer is it's not a
cost-effective challenge the other thing
is that the reason why I don't like
challenges that are open-ended I mean
this is a very different kind of
challenge than the first private or
commercial rocket that goes a certain
distance it's a very clear challenge you
know in advance what you need to do
would you be one - absolutely and by the
way it's not the case that not me but
some colleagues of mine have actually
suggested that the presentment
experiment would be an interesting one
to use for this because it seems to have
a pretty big effect size the challenge
went out no response ever came back so
you know what do you do yep
if it is I guess one thing that you
could expect is that people who are
entangled maybe their connection
pretending to the tissue over time as I
mean supposing with the brains interact
with the environment is to do expect a
security
right
the question is is on whether if there
is something may be analogous to
entanglement between brains would it
decline with time and I think the answer
it probably is yes it would but on the
other hand the the kind of entanglement
that we're working with here is a
dynamic entanglement as the if you
imagine if you use as a metaphor or
something like entanglement you're
dealing with people who you're with a
lot you're constantly being reimagined
like people you're very close to have a
certain degree of entanglement and that
talking quantum entanglement but some
sort of psychological entanglement
people you don't tend to be around very
much with you have a smaller degree
because it indicates people you're never
around at all you might have some
because of some background entanglement
resulting from the Big Bang but it would
be really tiny so that kind of a model
can be used to predict that when people
report telepathic type experiences they
ought to be stronger among the people
you know the best and little bit less
and so on and that is the course what
you see oh it was her question you had a
question
he said something smart said that one of
the reasons why scientists like this
argument that theory then theories
science are very kind but all the Neo
students explain parts of Isis or
Instagram so all these terms that you
mentioned are actually very interesting
and they're statistically very correct
they're missing a key ingredient of
science which is in the scientific
method the other theory that makes the
prediction that you make an experiment
that could falsify theory and the
written experiment there is a prediction
when there is no
right so the question is that one of the
things that is a part of the power of
science is that they're both theories
where you can make predictions you do
experiments and so on there's a balance
between theory and experimentation
that's true for what we might call
amateur science but at the leading edge
of science the way that all Sciences
begin is somebody making an observation
of a weird thing and at that point you
don't have a theory yet all of this is
pre theoretic that doesn't make it not
science it's the beginning of science
it's where where you look at repeated
effects throughout history and you say
well what do we do with this
the usual way that it's dealt with which
gives rise to the taboo is to say you
know what there's no Theory there for
that observation can't be what it
appears to be
that's where theory goes wrong it's like
why theory sometimes is not such a good
thing to come in on with because of your
if you're carrying your theory along
with you it changes your way of
perceiving the world the way the world
actually is and if you look at the
history of science you see again and
again somebody reports a strange
observation which is dismissed because
it doesn't fit and it takes sometimes a
hundred years for people to for theory
to have evolved to the point where now
it's okay so I give a number of examples
of that in the conscious universe and
there are many examples where theory can
act as a blinding for us so it also is a
temperamental difference I have friends
who are basically theorists they don't
think about empiricism at all and so
they think in terms of explanatory the
world must be explained that's what
they're good at I'm not a very good
theorist I've spent most of my career
doing empirical things looking at what
the world actually is trying to tell me
and I don't really care that much about
theory the reason why my book is called
entangled Minds and when I talk about
quantum entanglement is partially
because of the question that you just
said Kalman comes up so often where
sometimes people are not even willing to
entertain the evidence unless there's
some explanation so I said okay I'll
come up
something well here's a good thing and
tell them it's good you know it sort of
sounds like that
well maybe it's completely wrong but
nevertheless at least gives some way of
conceiving what's going on and so in a
sense what I'm doing is challenging
theorists by saying ok you guys a huge
body of data it has certain degree of
internal consistency over a long period
of time we can make predictions that if
we see it happening like telepathy and
conscious experience we ought to be able
to see it in unconscious physiological
states as well so we go do the
experiment and we see it so the hope
then is when I give a talk and in a
technical environment is to spark the
mind of somebody who's thinking about
theory all the time and have them think
well ok maybe maybe there's microtubules
in the head which are quantum
oscillators and blah blah blah and they
come up with some kind of reason that
would would advance the state of the
science so I completely agree we need
theories if anybody comes up with a good
idea let me know or publish it first yes
scientific questions so I'm a little
skeptical
because I'm not sure what the apartment
appliance is for example in the
experiment with the elephant when you
have the four pictures you feel like the
bias
I don't know whether or not thanks to
that let me answer that now before you
continue in the case of the ganzfeld the
order in which the pictures are
presented to the subject at the end are
randomized so maybe it was the first
picture maybe not so over thousands of
such studies the order should not make
any difference in fact when you look at
the the vast majority of studies of this
type it doesn't make any difference and
that so that is tracked
well it that's a good question
the it's difficult to convey in a sort
of broad-based
presentation like this what actually
goes on in these experiments I have a
talk on the ganzfeld alone which is a
couple of hours and part of the the
midpoint of that talk talks about the
due diligence that goes on to make sure
that you're not dealing with an ordinary
explanation like a sensory queue or like
an electromagnetic pulse coming out of
the stimulator device things of that
sort this has been discussed to such
great detail that you wouldn't believe
and one of the reasons that is that it's
both the people pay attention to it and
it's discussed in great detail is
because of the skepticism and rightly so
so people are saying you know I'm not
sure I believe this because maybe it was
that imagine now a hundred and thirty
years of those comments so somebody does
one of these experiments now you come
with a huge long list of things that you
have to nail down tight because if you
don't nail it down tight your colleagues
will kill you because they don't want
bad evidence going out either so in the
case of something like the guns felt how
do we know well besides being in rooms
which are typically 10 to 30 meters
apart at least one of the rooms will be
a Faraday cage typically like in our
case it's a double steel walled
commercial Faraday room you do pre
testing and you see if if you make
sounds you make make noise you in our
case we tested vibration we tested audio
tones like flashing a bunch of things of
that sort to see whether it's
perceivable either consciously or
unconsciously through physiological
testing on the receiving side and we're
talking about tones for example from the
sender's room to the receivers room
using a coastguard horn so in the
sender's room we use a coastguard horn
which is over 100 DB it's really loud
and you blast it and you see if the
other person can hear it you make audio
measurements to see whether there's any
discernible difference and the answer is
no but as we learned you what you
actually attract the fire department
because we were blasting the horn quite
a bit and
fire department came because they
thought we were having a problem so
these are the kinds of Hoops that we we
jump through in fact one of the reasons
we have a very fancy electromagnetically
shielded room is exactly for reasons of
being able to describe to somebody how
do we know that there was no ordinary
signal getting in well that's how we
know we test it and we use means that
are known for for getting rid of such
stuff dangerously close correlation
versus causation of the fallacy because
I feel like saying that there's like a
point oh five percent chance that
something happens
states that you know dislike unlikely
event has happened but I feel like
you're going further in stating that
because that happened it means that you
know there is a possibility of it being
true and I'm wondering how you address
that because or that exists
well it is true the results we see in
these experiments and in fact almost all
experiments and any domain their
correlations that's what we see we infer
the arrow of causation in this case I'm
willing to take the next step and say
that yes the experiments show
correlations but because we set it up in
such a way that we we think we know what
we're doing
I will infer that the arrow of causation
comes from that person to this person
but we don't really know that so that is
true one of the reasons that we don't
know yet which direction the arrow of
causation goes or in fact maybe there is
no direction of causation maybe we're
dealing with something which is a purely
correlative phenomenon which is possible
we don't have theories yet which would
say that we should be able to predict
that you'll get a correlation phenomenon
versus a causal one that's what we're
waiting for so technically you're
correct we're dealing with correlations
we know that the correlations are not
chance so something is giving rise to
the correlation when I do an experiment
of this type typically the way the way I
assign the arrow of causation is because
I tell somebody I want you to do this
and then they presumably they do that in
their head well that's one side of the
correlation the other person is very
passive they're sitting there in a dark
room doing nothing and yet their brain
sort of hopping along with what the
other person is doing who I gave the
instruction to do something so it looks
like the error of causation is going
from the person who I asked to do
something to the other person but you
can't actually see that in the data
itself that's true yes
forgive me for you
things that she herself performed the
gospel experiment in the 70s and with
negative result she went on to
investigate the rafters the other
commented people doing that as incentive
she found sort of severe methodological
problems and lots of places in the
experiment great so and then she goes on
to say that you know link of it it seems
like that designing the sort of
experiment is actually incredibly hard
with this uh there all these colleges
about other perimeters mentioned
sometimes people might pick the first
nation it's a randomization
it makes a difference I know that at
least according to this some of the
early experiments actually had
interaction between someone who's
actually interviewing the person who
gets out of the chamber and that person
who's interviewing them it's the same
person throughout would be visual cues
from that great so for instance if I
don't know if this is the way the
experiments actually scientist knows so
the interesting thing to me is it seems
like this sort of made a statistical
technique he's really in serious danger
nor any sort of that this type of
methodological flaws I don't know if
it's true or not like a but it seems
like to me the cleaning these accounts
of this and maybe how complicated this
experiment is looking at a graph of sort
people who've done that result over time
and looking at their results and then
sort of lumping those together and sort
of one cohort it seems really dangerous
it seems like that you know they're a
lot if you continue to just Google
you'll find other articles and you will
find that this question has been
addressed in great detail and in
particular the studies that sue
Blackmore said that she found a problem
with which by the way was never proven
just her opinion if you take those
studies out you get exactly the same
result all the experiments I mean
under strong navigator men of course any
experiment might have a problem and the
reason why we rely on independent
replication is because we hope that know
that people are not making the same
mistake over and over again experiments
in logical problems and you somehow end
up with the same results from both the
thing that one of them is better with
every evidence that the factors I see an
underlying problem again if you you
spend a little more time in Korea
you'll find that that questions in
addressed as well this is the question
about is the quality of the experiment
the assess quality methodological
quality related to the result of the
experiment in a way that would make you
predict that the better the experiment
the worse the results and the answer is
not and so in other words you can
address I mean all of the these
questions have been thrashed out for so
many years in so many different ways
though in virtually every case you can
think of there is a way of addressing
either analytically or experimentally
whether the result is what it appears to
be scientists or subject
but if the evidence is as strong as you
say I would be it just seems like
unbelievable that you know somebody else
and sort of produce the same results
and like you know I think that but I
find this it seems like the most of
people davidians people sort of have a
daughter of Isis is like that's why I
show the results of the two highly
skeptical professors who did the
experiment and got exactly the same
today according to their description is
is an experiment that they did that
failed use the different method and
actually didn't feel about a
significantly negative result so it's a
valid concern of do people believe in a
result or not one of the problems with
that as a criticism is you see this
actually happening in the data somebody
comes along who is skeptical they do an
experiment and it works they publish it
they are no longer perceived as
skeptical which is ridiculous I'm as
skeptical as any of anybody else
I give fact you have to be skeptical
much more skeptical than you would
imagine when you do these experiments
because if you're not it'll be
transparently obvious to anybody else
looking at it that you made a mistake
there are fundamental biases and purity
see this inserting the Ramos scientific
scans so I mean I guess like here I can
do some before research I guess it sort
of sounds like that it's awfully
suspicious to me that most the people
out there pitching so that people who
already believe and it seems like that
they're people who start out with a move
inside and then go to conduct
experiments disappear as except as I
said we have a very serious problem in
that take myself for example did I start
out as a believer the answer is no
there's no one in my family or myself
who ever reported anything psychic had
no reason no a priori reason to believe
any of it it was only through doing
repeated experiments where it began to
convince myself through the data that it
looks like something was going on and if
you if you then it casts it out into a
wider net then it really does mean that
you will end up with people who are
converted in a sense by their own
experience by the nature of the data and
that's the camp that I put myself into
and the the continuing distrust of bias
and experimenters is a valid concern and
one of the reasons why I have write and
talk about this stuff is to try to
interest somebody else to actually do
the experiment so just to give you an
example in 1994 in Psychological
bulletin this meta-analysis came out
that said it looks like there's a real
effect going on in the gods field James
Allcock was a well-known skeptic said
well if there was a real effect going on
than the parapsychologists who
constitute a very small number of
scientists they would be trampled by
thousands of people in academic
psychology who want to go ahead and test
this and the result was a resounding
silence it is not the case that you can
find lots of skeptics out there who are
actually willing to go ahead and try
these experiments that's why I'm
actually I'm very encouraged by the
studies of the two folks that I
mentioned that published an article in
the humanistic psychologist because they
were extremely skeptical and remain
extremely skeptical even though they got
the same results at everybody else
reports here's the question
so as part of those in control or say
there's receiver manova center so you
have the room TV that's showing image
there's nobody in there does the
receivers condition the results are
ambiguous it's it's not clear that one
condition is better than the other there
is a smidgen a smidgen of evidence
suggesting that it helps to have a
distant sender and this of course is
under condition where the receiver
doesn't know if there's somebody sending
or not there's a little bit of evidence
suggesting that it makes a difference
the stronger evidence is among the EEG
correlation studies because they're what
I've done and some colleagues have done
is to look in the sender's brain to see
if they actually have a revoked response
because sometimes the center's fall
asleep in which case their brain goes to
sleep too and they don't show a response
so if you partition the data according
to whether the sender is actually
showing a response versus not you get a
really get a positive correlation when
they are responding and you get no
correlation when they're not responding
suggesting that at least in that kind of
design that it appears as though you can
make the correlation appear and
disappear by what is actually going on
at the level of the sender so that's one
answer yes
Oh what do you say the reversal of the
you say they're all you know vast body
at least a good number of very
statistically significant studies and
yet on the other hand you told the
gentleman in the front that it takes
eight years of continuous study to
actually show this effect and you're
asking us to believe this then long on
something much less than eight years of
continuous study I'm going to ask what
exactly does statistical significance
mean the difference here is if you want
to do a single study you're going for a
prize and you need result of a hundred
million to one and you need to set up
all of the conditions in advance in
order to get that you can calculate
statistically exactly how many trials
you need that would take a long time
take a lot of data to do that we're
looking at in a meta-analysis which is
accumulation graph that I showed
that's not a single study that's a
result of 30 years of other people's
studies and the value of the graph is
that it shows that over time you begin
to converge on a value so that's like
the general population value but that's
an open-ended experiment that will keep
going on as long as new data comes in so
the difference then is when you do a
meta-analysis you're simply asking a
question of is this seem to be real and
as it repeatable so we can tell that on
the basis of these studies it looks like
the answer is yes and we know how big
the effect is so now if we say okay we
need a hundred million to one odds in
order to win a prize you turn the crank
and you come out with well what does
that study need to be need to look like
and you end up with a really big study a
huge study it's probably done if you
take them in all tied together what is
the actual probability
is it ten to one a thousand to one over
the console is twenty-nine quintillion
to one twenty nine million trillion or
billion trillion to one that doesn't
seem like it should take eight years of
continuous study to me to now show the
existence of this the difference is it
has to do it has to do with the concept
of statistical power if you're going to
if you have one one chance to do this
right and there's a lot of variance in
one study to the next so you can't
really predict very well if you're going
to get a real good result unless you
have enough power statistical power so
normally when you're doing an experiment
like this type you say well if you end
up with the overall probability of say
0.05 we'll consider that as success when
you need far fewer trials for that we
need to say it with a 90% chance of
getting a point O 5 result in this
experiment you need something like 600
or 700 trials that'll take a little
while but it won't take all that long
but if now saying I want a 99% chance to
get odds of a hundred million to one
that's a completely different ballgame
you need a huge amount of data in order
to guarantee that you're going to get a
successful result at that very low level
of probability so it's basically it's
the mathematics that determine this
differs from one study
it sounds like what you're doing is
you're taking a study that shows a very
small probability and they're saying
because there was some call the
litigation this is one and you're
getting the 929 continued number buying
by some of the powers that would whereas
had you have simply taken all the
samples and done it up and you find a
number of much small terms I thought
that yourself I mean just look into the
statistics especially look up
statistical power and read about it and
you'll see that the statistical power
curves deviate very quickly as soon as
your requirement for success goes up a
lot that's one thing you many many more
trials you noticing that when the this
the cumulative graph with three thousand
seven trials on it there was no a priori
saying well we had to get a result of
this number this is simply the
accumulation of all data that's
extremely different than setting up an
experiment it's a it's a different
animal the difference of an important
difference because when you set up an
experiment and you know you want it to
win you want it to be a successful
experiment at a certain level that's
it's no longer accumulating old stuff is
now a prospective study and and it
requires much more data it's just just
the way that the statistics fall out it
also answers different questions to a
different question that's being asked
yes free well
and Rico seems to be very intrinsic to
human consciousness so my question to
you is that I prefer to use that even if
in fact what you're saying these
experiments are evidence of is true we
can't really understand it he's not Marv
for consciousness that we normally
experience where we experience people
how you resolve this conflict and what
you're trying to uncover assuming that
precognition is true it doesn't actually
miss it doesn't necessarily mean that
there is no free will because
precognition may be of potential futures
you know maybe if multiple worlds
hypothesis is correct that at any given
moment in time you have many possible
directions you can go and which case of
precognition is returning information
about probable future states if you want
to assume all Hyperdimension two
parallel universes and saw malice
theories get even crazier all saying
right that's a concern right and you can
even investigate those sorts of things
in other orthogonal dimension
you try and look for these extra
dimension we physicists do this physics
theories they call for hyper dimensions
that we don't seem to be able to see
with what we know means I'm sorry when
you're showing us like you know ECGs and
then measurements of potential and skin
conductivity and so forth and yet you
know you're also acknowledging that
you're invoking some very concentrated
notions of science of the areas I don't
think it's unsubstantiated at all in
fact of the various phenomena probably
the easiest one to accept as
precognition as strange as that sounds
and the reason is that the fundamental
laws of classical mechanics quantum
mechanics
they're completely time-symmetric there
is no reason and I mean it oftentimes
people will say well these stuff can't
be true because it violates the laws of
science to which I respond tell me
exactly what's being violated because
the answer is nothing is being violated
okay but but you're actually claiming
the 3wa might exist amid your invoking
war what are the ways to get around
security seniors enemies within the
neurosciences most neuroscientists will
say that there is no free will that that
is an illusion so are they right well I
think I have reweld hood maybe they are
right so I don't I don't know how to
answer this question this is where it's
a difficult theoretical problem again as
an empiricist I simply say well look is
the experiment done correctly or not the
result is what it is we need to be
smarter in order to figure out how to
fit it into our understanding of the
world
rather than a priori saying well it
doesn't fit any existing theory
therefore I won't pay attention to it
yes what kind of random number
generators have you used second
difficult thing about rent the global
consciousness project so the random
number generator I typically use are
called Orion it's a circuit made in the
Netherlands it's a truly random
generator based on noise at of Zener
diodes it's past the die hard sweet and
so on it's been used for many years I've
also used a random generator coming out
of geese ins group at the University of
Geneva which is based on when a photon
hits
a half-silvered mirror it will go one
way or the other I can be measured which
one which path it took so it's based on
on a quantum optics effect I use that
one sometimes too
in terms of the global consciousness
project that's that's a two-hour lecture
as well so I've been involved in that
since the beginning I'm one of the
analysts on the project
I probably shouldn't get into it because
it it's just too complex takes too long
to describe but but for those of you may
wonder what we're talking about we're
talking about something that looks like
a global form of my matter interaction
that's what it looks like
yes
so the question the question basically
is centrally using a random number
generator and presentiments studies
could somebody out guess the sequence
somehow and guess that maybe the next
ones emotional and third one is calm and
so on so one way to address this issue
is to look at the actual sequence that
comes up and looking for auto
correlations in it that might say well
just accidentally the random generator
every third time gave a random an
emotional picture so we can check that
and it turns out that the random
generators are real good
they don't have significant auto
correlations in them could it happen on
an individual basis that maybe a small
sequence could look non-random well of
course any not any finite sequence can
look non random and we're always dealing
with finite sequences nevertheless the
generators that we use are all tested
beforehand for true randomness as good
as we can get and the sequence is used
in the actual experiment are tested as
well so in these experiments we don't
find evidence that people are somehow
out guessing the random sequence
in most cases we have one person doing
one test typically about twenty to
thirty trials so if you if there's a
possibility if you have a really crappy
random number generator you have 20
trials to figure it out and there's no
evidence even within single runs that
people are figuring out what's about to
happen so the other thing is that in
early experiments we use dichotomous
samples we use just emotional and just
calm and I stopped doing that after a
while because even though this the
random sequences were good it still
encouraged people to do a statistical
counting in their head whereas what I've
been doing for the last eight years or
so is picking pictures at random from
the entire pool so it's a huge range of
emotionality and then it becomes
virtually impossible to know what the
next picture is going to be like because
maybe it's a little bit calmer than the
one you just saw are a lot more
emotional it could be all over the map
and then at the end I'd do an analytical
cut on the data where I look at only the
results of the data for the most calm
and the most emotional cut across people
and that's where you see this big effect
so in any given run of maybe 20 or 30
trials maybe I only end up using two of
them out of the sequence that that
person saw but nevertheless when you do
that kind of partitioning on the data
you you end up with these results I
think we're done thank you all for
coming
