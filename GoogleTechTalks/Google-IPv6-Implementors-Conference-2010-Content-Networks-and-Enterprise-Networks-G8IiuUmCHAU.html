limelight here Tom coffee from limelight
was it just me or did vint cerf berra
disturbing resemblance to dr breen from
half-life 2 anybody else noticed that ok
I'll just uh I'll go over briefly what
what limelight has done with v6 to this
point I was here last year and we had
just turned up v6 in the core and that
was prior to us engaging in a
proof-of-concept demonstration of v6
content with Netflix since then I'd hope
to have a lot more progress to report
but limelight is in a relatively awkward
position of basically having to wait on
the content developers and the content
providers to generate demand that
compels us to then support v6 I've done
as much as I've been able to do as sort
of our official evangelists within the
organization to get people excited about
v6 in the organization and recognize
that the technical challenges that that
we're going to face and adopting it are
better approached earlier than later as
we learned with the deploying in the
core and getting the v6 Netflix demo up
and I think it's a common story for
folks who've done it to this point I
mean Facebook great example you
definitely I detected the notice of a
bit of shock that it was you know as
easy as as it turned out to be we had
the same type of experience with with
much of what we did initially things
that just worked right out of the box
things that required a very minimal
amount of configuration change and all
that so basically all the low-hanging
fruit is you know it has been grabbed at
this point but going forward we're
really at a point where until we
actually get some of the the business
demand driving v6 adoption within the
organization there's not a whole lot of
resources that I can sort of get to get
pushed in the direction of
of of getting additional v6 services up
and running what we have to this point
though just to go over the slide quickly
ipv6 on the core we've had that for a
little over a year we'd like to think
that we have minimal time to
provisioning v6 at the CD and edge that
it's something that will be able to
offer any customers that come along and
say you know we definitely need this
today again it hasn't that the demand
hasn't necessarily been there so it's
it's it's tough to see word where this
will fall over if anywhere when tested
we have v6 transit to actually this
sliding's to be updated we have v6
transit to for providers peering with
critical networks obviously as a content
delivery network with its own backbone
peering is pretty critical to us to get
traffic offloaded as quickly as possible
we've had quite a bit of luck with
providers who've been willing to peer v6
with us and I don't anticipate that's
that's really going to be a problem
going forward the issues aren't
necessarily in the core as far as
getting folks aware of the need to to
get v6 up and running we're currently
using a parallel DNS architecture that
allows us to serve Netflix over v6 we
did that as as a requirement to keep RV
for production networks table to make
sure that we didn't have any issues with
with our DNS architecture that provides
the secret sauce for our content
customers and that's something that that
ultimately we need to to synthesize into
into one dns architecture for reasons of
performance and it's something that that
again until we actually have more demand
for v6 services from customers it's
unlikely to happen we're delivering v6
traffic to eyeballs today and providing
v6 transit today to several customers
and and obviously being here represents
close engagement with other industry
ipv6 early adopters and something I
certainly hope to take away from this is
some ideas of where to go next in the
absence of about actually having true
demand
from from our customers so some things
that remain to be done for us and again
until we have that pressure from the
business side it's it's it's a real it's
sort of a really open question as to how
quickly these will be addressed and in
what order ipv6 functionality for all
standard CD and products the the CDN
product offering for limelight is pretty
vast there's a lot of services that that
are sort of either represent corner
cases for customers where we've built a
custom service or perhaps there's a
portion of the service that well in any
case again it remains to be seen how
much additional work there will be to
enable v6 for for a lot of the product
offerings that we have for each silo
within our organization we've got a sort
of mixed bag in terms of by off on see
on v6 adoption and in terms of status if
they've bought off like actually where
they are in terms of adopting and
deploying most critical to this is
probably on the Finance and billing end
of things we're a lot of our back office
systems some of which are a sort of
homegrown and hacked together and others
are you know more turnkey and appliance
and software package type things it's
it's really a big question as to how
much additional effort is going to have
to go into those systems to allow us to
fully build and support v6 for the
customers when they show up so that's
something that we're still struggling
with a little bit and then something
that that I'm trying to get a handle on
is exactly what is driving v6 adoption
where customers are asking about it and
if they're not asking about it why they
aren't asking about it we're in other
words we're trying to get our sales
force engaged to the point where they
know how to articulate Lee asked you
know what what's driving customer either
interest in adoption or lack of interest
in adoption and I think those data
points will be helpful for us to try to
push things from the other direction in
terms of encouraging customers to to
think about what v6 adoption is going to
entail for their own organizations
so it's kind of backwards in the process
but you know I hope that that there's an
opportunity there to you know to really
sort of drive things from a different
end and get more customers interested in
tackling the v6 problem up front which
will in turn really put pressure on our
own adoption efforts to see where the
weak spots are where things that we
haven't actually taken care of and
gotten working yet cetera and ultimately
okay so yeah you know things like that
we've been talking about such as an
add-on the core you know been talking
about over the last year for much longer
than that Matt in the core broken
geolocation broken dns resolution things
that will negatively affect existing
services i'm hoping that some of that
will be sussed out by you know an effort
to find out why customers are interested
in adoption when they win and if they
are and then ultimately the goal is v6
functionality for any limelight network
product or equivalent v4 workaround so
you know obviously we just want things
to work and v6 is one solution to to
certain challenges that we're going to
face collectively you know my as I
evangelize within the organization I try
to make that point as frequently as
possible that you know v6 is what we
have to do to make v6 work is one
possible solution if we can you know if
there are things that we do to make
before you know get the job done and you
know perhaps a Facebook success with
Lisp is an example of that and in terms
of a you know very small v6 footprint
current projects v6 limelight networks
com that stuff and running we're trying
to get v6 SSL working for Netflix in
particular we've got issues with the
load balancer that we're currently using
and that's something that we're in the
process of trying to tackle with the
vendor synthesizing the v 4v 6 dns
architecture as i mentioned doing things
like getting v6 enabled on corporate LAN
segments and then looking forward to at
some point actually white listing all of
our our space for access to v6 services
over google an geo location for IP
six we're testing the the cova database
currently and have had some luck with
that it remains to be seen how quickly
we can get existing products that are
relying on Clova our cova database
implementation to actually use the v6
geolocation piece that they're offering
and then finally you know may be of some
interest to folks here would be the
amount of traffic that we're actually
seeing over v6 being that we're
delivering it to clients this is a quote
that caught my eye from Martin a little
while back and I thought what was what
was rather amusing about the quote was
the the 30 times ratio that he mentions
without necessarily providing a base
number to apply that ratio to so in the
spirit of that that particular quote
here's some graphs probably without
without the actual y-axis being provided
there what's of most interest is is the
fact that the traffic is still very
bursty we don't really have sustained v6
traffic levels those are all single
sessions and people accessing Netflix
over v6 yeah it is that's right yeah so
you can you can interpolate from that
and I mean that's basically it if
anybody has any questions would be happy
to attempt to answer them at this point
thank you we have we have five minutes
for questions or so I have a question go
ahead please no I was going to say I
died early and I don't really understand
the interface between CDN and its
customers so who who has to deal with
like blogs analysis for v6 addresses
like if you just started serving I mean
like oh yes that's they have to audit
their systems as well as you know that's
so that's a service that we definitely
provide and that's you know there's a
big question mark as to what amount of
effort will be required to support log
collection we know that we can do it
today successfully but the question as
with many of the v6 services that we've
turned up as to what do
we will at scale it's a question that's
impossible to answer just based on the
lack of actual v6 traffic and the lack
of v6 customers so again you know once
once things start to ramp up their their
their actual portions of our offering
that seem to work very well today that
were you know not necessarily a hundred
percent confident will scale so I hope
that answers your yeah the same exam
thank you that's it hmm thank you Tom
but for those who don't know Lorenzo is
the tech lead for ipv6 here oh is that
working yeah that's all right now we've
been at it for the last two and a half
almost three years 30 years only feels
like longer than that but a September
august if 2007 oh yeah okay so um I
think a lot of you will have seen and
heard me speak before so I'll just
touching a few key points of what I
think are the most important issues that
we're facing number one I still I still
see in many other networks especially
content networks because access networks
seem to be now saying oh dear no this is
really really bad we need to fix it and
they're coming to content providers and
saying when can you give us your stuff
and we don't know so so again why is
this we know all this we know this this
is a nice way to present it right we had
you know we had fifty percent of the
space free ten years ago now we have
well it said ten percent now no Takashi
sounds counter says six percent so this
is it the writing's on the wall right so
I don't think anyone disputes this
anymore but what are the implications so
people are going to buy addresses or
they're going to do double net and
donuts expensive it's hard to manage it
creases
racial costs but you know for for a
content provider that the major points
of the ones that Jason already made
right so what is that what's the
semantics of an IP address well how did
you locate it how do you block abuse if
somebody ends up on some blacklisted is
it does he take out all his neighbors
and and if you don't want to take out
all his neighbors then how do you build
your infrastructure to detect and
intelligently moderate those those
spikes so that it doesn't sort of dos
your your back-end systems then you know
point exhaustion one I think he didn't
mention was port exhaustion HTTP
intercept so when the user runs out of
ports the I think the broadband forum
recommendations for that are to
intercept HTTP connections and put a
helpful warning message juga you have
one out of ports please contact your isp
you may have a virus and while that's
nice to the user it's not nice for
people that want to deliver content or
or or advertising or you name it so
these are bad things and so there there
are you know strong reason for content
provider and and these are the reasons
that drove us essentially to implement
ipv6 so oh and also the the lack of the
force base and the and the pressure on
port exhaustion if if nobody does v6 the
pressure on port space will go up higher
and higher Mike because assume that no
one's no one's moved to v6 the
transition is somehow failed this is a
sort of extreme scenario but what
happens then so the pressure on ports
price goes higher and higher we we crank
up the use of one IP address more and
more more and more users are behind that
IP address what happens your timeouts
you and that time let's have to get
shorter and shorter what happens on the
content side oh my ajax applications not
working let me crank up the keeper lives
and so basically you went up in an arms
race where the application sort of stops
working at some point because you the
connectivity just isn't there anymore so
this is you know when you this is you
know 10 years 20 years away or whatever
it is in internet time it's probably
more like 10 years but if we don't move
to v6 this will become a problem
so you can do not but you can you can
only do it so far right so ultimately we
have to move to something else if you
look at the population curve I have the
graph on my other computer of course but
the dog ate it but it you know there's
this nice little curve of world
population and there's this lie sital
flatline that's about just over half way
that's the number of IP addresses in the
hole on it all before internet right and
the number of addresses lower than the
number of people so ultimately that will
be a problem so okay technical
constraints v6 how many deployments mr.
Byrne there is eager to do v6 only there
are various things that can't be
numbered out of leesport before spacing
more because there's just too many of
them dri ours are being reasonably
strict about handing out before block so
it's not very easy and networks have
been numbering there there set-top boxes
out of private space for a while now so
if you want to get your content onto the
set top boxes then you need to be able
to speak v6 any applications yes it's
not clear to me how this will pan out we
it would be nice to think that v6 will
restore and to end for that we need
either people not to firewall or we need
a solid protocol to open holes and
firewalls now to me a protocol for
opening holes and firewalls and no
firewalls is effectively the same I
don't understand the difference but
maybe somebody does no there is no
killer application for v6 or other
there's one yes it's called the internet
if we want it to keep working this is
what we need to do so we can't enable v6
for wo com you know that if you're at
home you do host IP 60 google com you
don't get an address from here you might
you do that's right you do here we do so
and this is this is where I sort of say
this is what pretty much how we think it
should work where we know we're pretty
close to it so you you know you
you have w google com it's your stack
and you can you know you can you can
ping it you can connect to it you can
run tcp dumps and it's three
milliseconds away because it's in the
same place as before us right so right
so this is what we want to reach a
situation where the content side is
ready for before v6 in the same way
provides the same same level of SLA and
of course we're not there yet especially
you know there's there's a lot of Wild
West type situations in home networks
where we just can't provide this level
of service but this is the goal and this
is what we need really for a successful
transition so I don't know if any of you
have seen this before you can do it on
your own laptops just connect to Google
gas v6 and you know get a glimpse of the
future if you will let's see if I can I
mean the demo gods I'm sure will be
against me if I remember if I remember
my password right yeah that's not gonna
work come on okay so all right oh dear
there's a lot of traffic already um see
that's my favorite expression anyway so
if you wait
okay so I mean ideally you should be
able to just do this and just see the
packets flowing right you and and again
this is this a seamless to the user it
just works so this is what we need right
if the package is flow the application
keeps working and it'll work you know
and five years from now it'll work
better on b6 and on before but that's
only because we've done the backend work
right to make it happen YouTube is the
same if we I mean if Eric had ran had
run the the vent video with the TCP dump
behind it he would have seen the packets
well over v6 so that that's what we
think is the way forward and end the
only way forward really because there's
just too much variety out there to have
a single model week we have to provide
both services for you know years years
and maybe decades anyway to get back to
her to my point so we we we can enable
it there is no technical restriction on
our side can you see this not really
there is no technical research on our
site or or even at this point scaling
restriction to providing the service for
everyone what is what is holding us back
is that we know that we're about again
the numbers are one in 2001 2000 years
won't be able to get to us anymore if we
do this for the whole internet and that
is a high price to pay and it's it's
it's in it's unacceptable at this point
right so this is why we started with
white listing and then many of you know
how it works basically if your resolver
has is in our magic list it will get V 6
addresses for all our properties just
like you do here today people like it
but the problem is that some people turn
it on and then their users say oh I
can't get to Google anymore and did you
call your SP no I didn't call my XP
because it's only Google that's broken
so I must be google problem and so this
is a problem for us so we and and and
this is the reason why we have to be
very very careful in turning a service
on because we don't want to provide a
lower SLA for our users and because our
users might not
know anything at all about what went
wrong so this this is really the big
challenge that we have at the moment and
so you know everything else works they
won't call their eyes p they'll just go
somewhere else which is which is not
what you want if you're a contra
provider so we'll talk about that
tomorrow we'll talk about what our
numbers are like what the causes are you
know what we know we don't know that
much yet but we do have some pretty
solid date at this point on sort of you
know millions of data points a day so we
do have some knowledge so we'll talk
about that tomorrow something from the
network comes some lessons learned just
from our experience I mean we've been at
this for a while and we we have pretty
solid infrastructure at this point the
implementations do mostly work but they
do have bugs because nobody's really
kicked the tires right you you you run
it and there are some bugs on the next
slide that you think well but how could
I found that so yeah don't expect
something to work just because it
supported that's something that you know
as network engineers one thing that's
useful that we've found useful is if you
find a bug in the lab you report it and
you keep going because you need to find
the next ten bucks and what was useful
for us is find the ten bugs report them
all at the same time so they all get
fixed in the next release you don't have
to wait one bug / release and because
then you'll never qualify and some
people have been saying oh I'm trying to
qualify I won't say the version number
because it would give away the vendor
but I'm trying to qualify version X and
this is my third try and it's not
working and every time I find me bug so
don't do that try to find all the bus at
the same time and then get them fixed in
the same release and and when one thing
that you might want to consider is if
you can work around the bug in some in
some way that will survive production
use trial it because I guarantee that
once you try it you will find another
bug and this bug will be very strange so
here's some examples so if a firewall
filter has a 1-bit match in bits 32 to
64 and then just after that a two-bit
match in bit 64 296 then the second
match will not work how do you find this
in the lab you get very lucky or you put
it into production and you see what
happens
so in particular circumstances the FIB
and the rib may get out of sync due to
race conditions when pushing updates are
you going to find that in lab there's a
better chance of that yes but maybe
still because you need particular
flapping scenarios one one of my
favorites is if you if you loop a link
for a backbone testing if your circuit
van de loops links you triggered add
duplicate address detection your
interface goes down is is points that
way because the the shortest path is
that way and your traffic gets black
hole because it fails neighbor discovery
what happens you can't shut down the
interface because that doesn't fix a
problem you have to Deacon figure the
interface now so what do you do well
luckily we in the in the release that we
are running you can disable duplicate
address detection so you can do that but
if you're running a release that doesn't
allow you to do that you're stuck so oh
and if linux get some a packet too big
message on a receive-only interface with
no root pointing out of it it ignores it
how are you going to find that well
again you might find it in lab if you're
lucky but the the race condition of the
fib updates we found that after months
in production on a you know reasonable
number of data centers so it's in likely
it's unlikely enough that you might not
seen in the lab at all and it is enough
to break your v6 routing and to break
your service so test and trial if you
can so yeah this is I think at this you
know by that at this point our strategy
was it was warmer than we started with
the band of volunteers or my band of
volunteers we use our twenty percent
time and then somehow we managed to get
something out there and to sort of snow
get a snowball effect and I think in you
know what the last step management got
involved this might not work for you it
did work for us because Google is a very
engineering driven company but your
mileage may vary but ultimately
management involvement is necessary so
you do need by him and I think these the
reasons that I was talking about earlier
those are the reasons why we really need
be six to keep stuff to keep stop
working alright it's a business
continuity issue
and yes don't don't go out and buy gear
for v6 just fold it into your normal
upgrade cycles we ok we started in
mid-2007 we had all our services running
in late two thousand eight only 2009 we
turned on the white listing program and
then we turned on maps we turned on
YouTube took a little longer to get
those services done youtube in
particular was a hardware issue
particular vendor gear just didn't thin
do v6 and hardware it fell over 100
megabits and it's not acceptable and
there's a lot of work since then that
has gone on behind the scenes to make
the implementation more solid but one of
the luxuries we had is that as an early
adopter is that you don't need to be as
careful when you're not throwing a
hundred percent of your traffic at just
a few statistics these are I don't I
haven't looked at these recently but I
think they're still pretty much accurate
v6 is growing it's very small Oh point2
% 0 point three percent it's all in
France because the French is the French
thought of six already first and they
said hey let's deploy it and they have a
few hundred thousand users opted in and
they all come in every day they clock in
/ v6 and it's fine I think going toward
we'll be talking about this tomorrow
please don't use 64 please don't use
torito please invent a time machine and
sort of remove it from from from GRC
list or something it is a real problem
especially 624 especially
implementations that's why 64 before v6
there before before and this is our
graph as you can see it's a little bit
this was the launch date that is lunch
time as you see we turn it on them when
we still ok we'll go to lunch now
because can't possibly break can it
that's not true but anyway this is the
this is the graph you can see the
traffic when you turn on qua days since
since a negative replies aren't
cacheable the traffic just goes up
straight it BAM our graph is a little
bit more smooth so there that there of
course we don't have axes either but
there's me there's but there's an smooth
aggregated
you can see that from the graph and
that's it as I said we will be talking
about whitelisting more tomorrow and
then looking at the challenges we face
and what our data looks like and what
what we think the problems are and we
don't have the answer at the moment and
we hope that you know discussion will
stimulate you know answers for us as
well thank you got time for questions
martin lee hurricane electric um in a
purist world we could all agree with
your 64 statement but in a real world we
can't it exists it's out there and as
you and I have discussed we've spent a
lot of time trying to at least correct
what's out there it can never be perfect
the sucks less comment is a more
negative way of saying it but at least
it's getting better how can you how can
you convince more and more service
providers to at least do some form of
624 work earlier we have this discussion
with john from comcast earlier but how
can you convince them to do more work in
order to improve things and at least
deal with their own users when in a way
you're trying to sort of say let this
problem go away by not discussing it so
the problem is that 624 is that so and
the question is why it for example and
one of the you know follow-up questions
so that was why why do you not run your
own relays right and the problem is that
with six to four it's it's the last mile
it's the last link that's the problem
you get these packets coming out of 64
and they just die so that's why I said
it's an access providers issue this is
something John understood at comcast and
other people have slowly started to
understand so at least dealing with this
traffic arm has improved things it may
be in some cases dramatically there's an
awful lot of traffic being relayed I
know we are and other people are doing
it as
but it's not a case as a as a Content
play it's not your responsibility to run
a 64 relay oh it is it would be it would
go into a very slight extent compared to
access met well not a relay okay but our
own Reuters yes so why not arm take a
different approach and sort of instead
of trying to get it ignored why not go
out and use your arm if I can use it
pulpit to to convince more and more
access providers to actually focus on
this so i can convince the OS
manufacturers to disable it by default
that history doesn't work i know that's
the only way that's the only way we can
get past this problem because there are
there are gateways out there in home
networks that are announcing Ras and
that black hole packets and they've been
sold and there in the field and nobody
is going to upgrade them and nobody is
going to replace them and that's the one
in two thousand users and that will not
change the only way to get around that
is to is to it is to you know you can't
make it work you have to replace the cpe
if somebody has a vendor Xbox in his
home network that doesn't do v6 oh sorry
the dud that says oh here I'm a v6 river
for you and I'm going to black hole your
packets real well what do you do you
tell the user somehow you find them and
you tell them please upgrade your box
how do they going to do that you tell
them that the most you could say perhaps
is here's a new box but that's not
something we can fix right but the US
manufacturers could fix it
right that so the question was on any
given day how much broken this on before
do you have the answer the the easy
answer and the sort of the easy answer
is we don't know but that's not actually
true because we do see flakiness and our
measurements are good enough at this
point that we do see nonzero broken the
silver before but I can tell you that
there's a nice measurable difference
there and when you're trying to make
when you're trying to make when you're
trying to go to a service owner right
and say we can do this v6 thing and it's
about five times less reliable than
before what's the service are going to
say so so and with that said I agree
that you know 624 exists and we should
run our own Reuters it various things
make it hard for us I think we should do
it frankly from the front ends instead
of doing relay traffic but that's just
arranging the deck chairs right right um
I yeah that's so about the percentage of
the ipv6 uses it for me it's not
surprising it's there's more because we
are now trying to solve chicken and egg
programs but I'm curious about whether
other Google people understand or hobby
Lea longer-term view for the nittany for
the year migration do you mean does our
management understand that we have to do
this engineer not focusing on network
related issues what awareness is
spreading its its it that's certainly a
challenge because typically application
developers may not have specific
knowledge of networking especially when
you start to become a large company they
focus on their applications and they
have clear boundaries between you know
their applications and the rest of the
world and the packet is coming in
through magic and I send my packet here
and it goes out through magic right
and there's a lot that can be done
especially if you have a sort of common
source space that everyone can access
there's a lot that can be done by
priding shim layers inside your code or
by protecting pieces of code that no may
not be v6 ready the Steiners going to
talk about all of that and so you don't
necessarily need awareness before you
provide cell providing services you need
awareness for the last you know 10
percent or even one percent oh my
crystal needs about the weather if they
just don't need to care about that that
fine but if they even try to dorp the
idea of migration due to the earth more
apposite abusive that's what I'm afraid
of much you make it clear that that's
not acceptable that this is not going to
go away and and and i think that message
is has come around at least at Google
and it's clear to people and and that's
why I say ultimately you need management
management by infamous because
ultimately once management knows that
this is not going to why it just becomes
a matter of time write it it will happen
and so that's one of the ways to attack
the problem and the other way of course
is if you if you get a service serving
v6 traffic and they and you pass them
live traffic and they they insert
introduce a regression that breaks their
service they're going to find out real
quick and they're going to roll it back
so that there's that aspect as well okay
so on the issue about you know 624
whether it's a good or a bad thing I'd
like to offer an alternative view that
says that it's actually a very good
thing because it's causing a lot of
angst and a lot of urgency to get things
fixed that might not otherwise have
occurred right um you know to Martin's
point you know service providers can fix
this your issue really is that an
unmanaged thing is getting in the way of
your managed service and the managed
services of the last mile delivery well
as long as people are doing managed
services the 64 never comes into play
it's the fact that you don't have the
managed service that you want
and this automated thing is out there
it's creating a little bit of urgency
that I think you know so it's actually a
good thing because it's causing people
to wake up and pay attention in ways
they might not otherwise have paid
attention well it's not closing the
users to wake up and pay attention and
then the uses the ones that own these
boxes but sure I suppose every cloud has
a silver lining yeah the the point I was
going to make Tony half of your point
was my point that the best way to fix
the 624 problem is for the service
provider to provide a v6 managed service
whether it's you know six rd dual stack
or what have you because then the hosts
won't try the 64 anymore not really not
really because because my my d a senior
network engineer at at at Google
happened to why one of these gateways
and noticed because he's a network
engineer that he wasn't using his
hurricane tunnel and he didn't know why
and then you run us their phone he said
oh but this box is sending me b6 river
advertisements and my machine is picking
them do do because they're the most
recent ones the most recent I don't know
why but he was using he was using it he
was using family phone OS and I get a 64
and global the source selection policies
I think in the English choose the global
the the router advertisement rides you
with two pieces of information one is
the route before I p address of the
default gateway which is linked local
and another is a prefix those int that
information is not necessarily tied
together you know that right it's it's
the RA gives you default lifetime and
this is my link local address and then
it says these are your prefixes so this
fact simply says well I mean these two
pieces of information are not
necessarily correlated i'll use the
lowest voter ID which is what most
implementations do right or the the new
the most recent one and of course he
went into the control panel and somebody
reported on that ugh here's how you turn
it off you go to this hidden weapon and
you go to I forget what it was system
dot extension and and you click here you
unset windows vista ultimate
compatibility and your 624 goes
but he did that and there's no such page
so he can't turn it off so his only
recourse and he knows what he's doing is
to replace that box okay the host you
need to be fixed the host to take about
it so Cameron burn t-mobile so the
problem that we're trying to solve here
is that there's not enough internet
addresses 624 doesn't solve that problem
kind of generates ipv6 packets or reach
ability to some degree but the growth in
IP addresses largely comes from the
mobile space and the mobile space is
largely private address space and bogans
that don't work with 624 anyways so did
I say did I say that the Gateway needs a
public address to generate
advertisements we have seen we have
implementations that do that we have
implementation yeah absolutely and
that's a substantial source of
brokenness in 624 but this is say you
know where's the solutions whether the
fixes and how they match up if IP
addresses are being consumed in mobile
mobile is using predominantly
non-routable addresses non-routable
addresses don't work with 624 I block
them into my network because they create
a lot of invalid half open sessions in
the cgm that's already in place so it
doesn't work yeah so if you're saying
our mobile networks working then that's
good and will you know will our data
will show it which means that we'll be
able to turn it on right the only
comment I'll make and enforce your mark
this is John results from comcast mark
mark walked away I think unfortunately
what will happen with 624 even enabling
need of IP 6 or some other form be six
isn't initially going to make the 64
traffic dropped as a matter of fact I
think it'll get it'll increase before it
goes away some of the stuff that I had
seen a few months ago have given me very
good reason to believe that because
there are some things out there that are
not there these traffic is not always
destined to Google or Facebook or
whatever it's going to someplace else
like a like some some other host in the
network and and native ipcc connectivity
will look attractive soon as
applications until you reach the point
where there are more native hosts or six
rd hosts on the network will that
traffic
then start to drop oh yeah I wasn't
suggesting that the the relays can go
away far from it if the relays go away
it's going to get worse because the pack
is going to get dropped I'm totally
agree with you two years to bottom line
right and and yeah as you said I think
Martin was saying that half the traffic
on the relay is 64 to torito and it's
you know machines with public addresses
talking to machines with private
addresses because the app happens to
support v6 no that's not a good state to
be in but thank you hate them hate them
sorry I say hey them is responsible for
a huge percentage of our our corporate
ipv6 deployment if not nearly a hundred
percent the reason that we have v6 to
our desktops and to the wireless yes so
I'm part of the corporate network
engineering can't Google maybe you are
aware or not Google Ron Corbett as
similar as an enterprise network and
content network as a broad backbone they
run independently but there are part of
the same group eventually so the
deployment for ipv6 motivation i think
is clear for anyone the main purpose for
it in google actually is to provide the
engineers ability to connect to 36
backbone and be able to support
obligation and test and validate the
features on the v6 network obviously
that's also will come with the benefit
added feature it will be innovation and
l adoption of features and support of be
able to lead the way and discover the
new tool on learning technology so what
is actually the google enterprise
network is a content of distributed
offices around the globe are those
number maybe not
but I think there are more than 19,000
users around 70 offices distributed in
33 countries on five continents we use
multi vendors equipment every when the
network and we will talk about the
vendor support on the issue we
discovered during the implementations
initially the break started in 2008 by
my colleague hearing mountain view kk
was not around thing today but in
summary it started as any major google
project start with twenty percent
deployment initial small lab deployment
where we have a host connect directly
with manuel dr eternal to a single
router in obvious is not scalable very
limited support and thus was the
earliest stage and then we move to the
dicated lab and the lab was a gr8 tunnel
2624 routers as 624 he mean six
connected to a four backbone and move
away to to dual stack the actual network
inside the office and run the gr ii from
the leading edge router that the second
phase when one provider was not
supporting v6 who does basically
basically was in TDM phase and then till
we go to the phase 3 where we managed to
stall stuck all the way to the upstream
providers the upstream provider hear
from our backbone network beside the
MPLS provider recently and several eyes
peace so dividing the addressing plan as
recommended / 64 for each subnet even
for point-to-point link that will help
the mobile IP also the address
allocation is not limited so
why not we are signed / 56 parish
building imagine every building in this
compost huh / 56 and aggregate that / 50
62 / 48 and advertises / 48 on the edge
we have acquired from Czar from the
registration the local registration / 32
now in a background / 40 in arian
certain brutal colleges are bv to work
like a charm so as soon as you enable
stand by version to you be able to have
host a host-based redundancy always beef
ospf version 3 as an IG B and M BB EB
and for addressing and we still using
auto auto configuration stateless
because we discover the ncb v6s had very
limited supporting multiple OS windows
XP mark even linux on the current
release on the dscp i think is unit
upgrade to future version so still not
stable routing policy is very simple
advertise except default from your web
stream provider or ask for default if
you don't need the whole routing table
and advertise office aggregate so yeah
what is the main challenge we faced so
far I think the hardware vendor platform
or hardware support and software support
is challenged in general certain vendors
may support certain features / v4 only
or support ipv6 feature on the software
on the box so thus will have scalability
impact on your support service providers
when you talk to any service provider on
awesome about ipv6 certain response
like a g6 we don't have it yet or we can
give you the six but the SLA will be
very it doesn't match the v4 so you
either deployment will take longer or
you will not get the same service level
agreement I fill the ISP are not
motivated okay not motivated because of
the za revenue generated from the v6 my
not much what they have when they go to
enable a new circuit okay that's money
we have a couple minutes for questions
yeah um do you service internet from
each campus or do you do from just a few
hub campuses or we served as a internet
from each office individually
individually they have a separate
relationship with different ISPs it here
on yes and ambulance provider on our
transit I spezia and then between your
campuses you just leasing private lines
from carriers or inside the combos
network we're on inside the combi
snuggling campuses are between campuses
we run MBL s and M BBN but I mean what
are you purchasing from carriers to
interconnect your campus okay we we have
three vendors one of them is uh mpls VPN
and transit RSP so you're using IP
finger carrier or leave your private
lines oh oh we but we will both we use a
private lines private lines here okay
okay but we do know quick question how
do you manage private extension Alice's
do you are allow the use of private
privacy extensions yeah we use privacy
extensions yeah so do you have any
problems Troy think that our horse that
using some
and other sis at the v6 addresses oh yes
we had the problem with the private
extensions in certain costs but we
managed to fix it by changing the
configuration on the host I look there
was another object another problem as
well we were allowing privacy addresses
and then when you we use kerberos so
trying to authenticate the Kerberos it
would put all of the addresses that it
has in its ticket including everything
that's expired or is it a deprecated
state and only valid for that would
never be used for a new connection
anyway so it would send off you know a
UDP packet it was way too big and have
16 privacy addresses in it no it was you
also it caused another problem on the
Association table on the wireless where
is a private extension being counted on
the user's table on cause of don't have
service on one of the licenses on the
wireless providers so yeah that's thank
you so when was question I have a
question and do you have any statistics
about the traffic volume our percentages
are not with me here ok I can chat with
you if you want yeah I'm just curious
like a major thuggish llege after only a
small fraction of people are using uh is
not as I think it is less than 2% of 3%
we still are I think the internet
connectivity still over before but the
v6 to the external is quite substantial
I like you want last question did you
pick you might have just answered that I
was trying to get an idea of on
internally because I assume you have a
lot of v6 enabled hosts you have the
campuses v6 in 80 your users internally
probably use google services a lot what
percentage which is basics enable you're
probably the ideal case for campus it's
got a lot of v6 running on it yes but
the static sure they don't have it with
me here but we have substantial traffic
going on v6 as Lorenzo show so you will
have enabled
so quad-a and the air and you will see
it a lot of traffic going to the
internal with external google services
on internal but i don't have the number
exactly on my head do you imagine any
time in your purse evil horizon having
one of your site's be v6 only it's going
to be hard for two reasons he's still
going to have someone who's gonna run
over before and he still have to knock
to them or access them selecting which
approxi the whole internet right yes
that's yeah that's one problem and the
second thing is actually trying to get
everything to talk over with six even
inside the corporate network is
challenging I don't want to mention
vendors name there's a lot that a lot of
them who are a lot of vendors who don't
have even a plant support v6 yet and
well no no sorry we are not in a
business of defamation we're trying to
get a dresser we are trying to address a
problem right so if I need to support
all the applications to my end user and
this is the key aspect of my role I have
to run before till all the vendors in
the world or all the vendor I use at
least one v6 natively once that done I
can't turn off before I will be happy to
do that because I I think that's the way
forward anyway does that answer your
question almost I could go a little bit
further but I think we're running out of
time oh yeah we need to get to get
around you thank you but but thank you
very much
we were lucky enough last year to have
Ron from dhiren come give us to talk
about the Navy's ipv6 deployment and
he's been great enough to travel at the
last possible opportunity to come back
and do it again let's see here so mr.
partner okay so a little bit of
introduction we've had a project for
quite a few years now to aggressively
deploy ipv6 in our research engineering
networks inside the Department of
Defense and we're doing case study here
of one of the major enterprise customers
of that wide area network spawar which
is a navy IT organizations supporting
most the rest the Navy exists that it
probably about a dozen locations around
the world doesn't large campuses so
that's kind of the context of who we're
looking at and this initiative what I'm
talking about today is probably a little
bit different than some of the other
ones or other presentations because it's
it's real production stuff it's not just
a test bed it isn't just an ISP view of
the world or just a campus view or a
system or application view it's kind of
all of the above it's in it's an
end-to-end study the systems and the
users that are the customers in this
environment or pretty much all
autonomous a lot of separate projects
it's not like it's one big enterprise
environment all controlled by Active
Directory it's a lot of little
independent things it's very
heterogeneous there's about every
operating system under the Sun that you
can imagine in a research environment
and it's not just a few systems it's
everything on the network that where
we're trying to turn on ipv6 so the
goals were pushed the envelope with ipv6
deployment see what's possible see
what's missing see what's broken and try
to get it fixed dual stack everywhere is
our approach and where we can do ipv6
only so places
we don't have to talk to the Internet we
actually doing ipv6 only or trying to
and we want to share lessons learned but
mostly we want to learn from this
experience because we feel we need to
figure out all the issues on our
research networks before we deploy this
on the DoD operational networks because
there is something's broken lives are at
stake so that is one of our motivators
so here's some of our progress and kind
of in the order of how we attacked this
over the years since about nineteen
ninety nine and then really aggressively
starting in about two thousand and three
wide area network is Google stack
everywhere all of our peering is dual
stack wherever we can we do unicast and
multicast all of our lands and wireless
LANs are all fully v6 enabled we turn it
on on every router interface with an
address we ended up renumber for
addresses took us about three years to
do it because it gives us some better
congruence and makes it some of the
operational issues a lot easier reducing
complexity because you add complexity
when you turn on v6 so you know we're
looking at the OM tail here
infrastructure services all our
recursive DNS ntp smtp all the standard
things we enabled soon by dual stacking
all of those then all support services
the triple-a services authentication
directory services Kerberos etc all dual
stack across the infrastructure then the
public-facing services how we you know
everything that faces the outside world
the authoritative dns mail exchangers
WWE p etc security stack was the really
hard one how do we get this deployed
into our secure enclaves firewall was a
challenge because it took a long time to
find a really robust firewall that did
dual stack for a long time we had
duplicate firewalls at a lot of sites
the intrusion detection system was hard
we had an IDs that was written inside
DoD so of course we had to do the
upgrade to the code to make it dual
stack capable so we run a lot of snort
so we did all the code upgrades to snort
gave it back to the to the owner of that
code IPS the product we were using was
tipping point took us four years and
about two or three
generations of product hardware to get
something that truly did dual stack
natively in hardware at line rate and so
we're pretty pleased with how that's
coming so all of those pieces were very
hard was a lot of work over a lot of
years then the security services just a
couple examples we use Windows WSS for
updating all our windows system we have
that all running over v6 now all of our
clients calling it over v6 also inside
DoD there's a mandated application that
every DoD system has to run is called
the host based security system and it's
actually McAfee EPO is the product and
we recently got that all working over
ipv6 which pretty much amazed the mcafee
people because they said nobody else is
actually trying this and we have it
working pretty well and then over the
last year we've had a major push for all
the servers desktop laptops basically
everything on the network trying to get
a dual stack had a large XP environment
and so it takes things like if we go out
manually visiting every machine to try
to get it turned on so that that's kind
of some of the background people like
utilization slides here's one of the
sites and compares the v4 traffic to the
v6 traffic and we're at about ten
percent now a year ago I would say we
are more like one percent a year before
that we're at point one percent and
normally you'd think that you know the
amount of traffic is sort of the ratios
are going to be equivalent to the
product of how much of your client base
the present' of your client base that's
a v6 enabled versus how much of the
internet is v6 enabled so when we're
close to a hundred percent internally
it's surprising that we would have ten
percent of our traffic being over v6 to
the outside world because that would
sort of imply that ten percent of the
internet is v6 reachable which is not
the reason is YouTube this we were at
about two percent until YouTube got
turned on and then we went right up to
ten percent so it was kind of
interesting so here's some of our
perspective after doing a lot of this
it's really not that hard a lot of
people think
you
you need- the organization from the cio
the network operators the network
engineering the people that run the web
servers the IT shop the security group
everywhere has to permeate the
organization the too many places there's
a few that get it and others don't and
you can't make progress unless you have
it be a corporate culture you don't want
to wait until it's a crisis you just
roll it out gradually as part of normal
tech refresh it was one of our major
lessons learned you don't have to like
ask for a ton of money to do forklift
upgrades if you haven't started yet
you're already behind because if you do
it as part of tech refresh it's like a
five year cycle but we're going to be
running out addresses you know before
addresses here in a couple of years and
so it's going to be a crisis for some of
you and you're gonna have to do this
expensive forklift upgrades if you
haven't been working on it I say don't
be afraid to break some glass here and
talk about all the worries about SLA s
and those few people that can't get to
it our attitude is if you if you're
willing to break some glass things get
fixed a lot faster and that's been our
experience and we don't buy from vendors
unless they support b6 and if you do
talk to your vendors beg for feature
parity between v4 and v6 features
because it's just really missing out
there and we also when we talk to
vendors especially when they come and
say hey we got this great product for
you the first thing we do is say let's
go to your website let's see if we can
reach you beef with v6 if we can't it's
call me back when you can it is a great
filter let me tell you and it's a good
incentive and you know they go off and
scramble and eventually get it fixed so
we always like to do these surveys to
about you know how many of the vendors
out there really are dueling v6
especially the ones that claim they are
so a couple weeks ago was the Rocky
Mountain ipv6 summit so we did the thing
we looked at all the sponsors now you
would think the sponsors of a summit
would be the ipv6 evangelist and have v6
enabled all their public content
internally and it's still pretty bad out
there and so if we've seen this thing
that the vendors aren't eating their own
dog food they just want to check the v6
box and sell you stuff here there are a
few notable exceptions for again
yay got almost greens across the board
there's a few others so we like to see
that but it's still to read and I think
that's one thing we need to fix so at
last year's meeting here talked about a
number of things so I won't repeat that
but you can certainly go back to last
year's slides and see we talked about
one thing we did was trying to get all
our DNS zone transfers using ipv6
transport also we moved our entire BTC
network to ipv6 only our management land
seems like a good candidate to make ipv6
only and we ran into a lot of challenges
there and are still working on it the
radius Kerberos ldap all that stuff
getting it to work over b6 pretty much
worked out of the box except we ran into
things like the ldap client issue where
the one of the very important modules is
not v6 ready challenges with mainstream
VPN clients a big one for us was
automating the populating of DNS with v6
resource records you don't want to do it
manually a lot of the other schemes
don't work because dhcpv6 isn't there
yet but we we wrote a tool so that if
you already have it have v4 populated in
DNS with a and n PTR records there's a
way to automatically populate it using
dynamic updates to populate with all the
v6 records and so problem goes away
creating incentives for customers we
have a lot of customers that there's no
way to mandate it and so we have to use
incentives to get them to turn on ipv6
in their projects and on their on their
desktops and laptops and so forth so in
the last year we've had this effort to
really really try to dual stack all of
the systems out there that we don't
control we saw in january of last year
about 5% of our systems had v6 enabled
we're dual stacked before that I mean it
was only half of that so we made some
progress but still this was way too slow
for us so we had a major internal
campaign to try to convince all the
systems administrators all the projects
everybody who had a computer please turn
on v6 and it took some education as well
because for all the windows XP machines
you have to tell them
what command to run you have to have the
helpdesk trains for all the places it
doesn't work because it'll get calls and
so what we had to do was lots of nagging
lots of emails we set up contest between
different groups to see which one which
group is ahead of another group in some
of our servers internally we remove the
a records and so you could only get to
it with ipv6 and then the real good one
was when we blocked ipv4 to Google
because I knew this would get a reality
so that's the v4 brokenness we see in
our measurements is it people blocking
us know this don't do that don't do that
this is a controlled environment so but
this has the canary in the coalmine
effect for us when there's something
broke you find out instantly and so
that's been very very helpful to point
those out and it's a great incentive so
we're here's one of those pages we put
up for all our users showing by
organizational code how you can see how
your group is comparing to your
neighbors group and so this is what
we've worked on getting our numbers up
over the last year this is just just one
of the sites so why can't we get those
last five percent or why was it
challenging for some of those there were
things like all the VMware machines had
to be upgraded all the ESX machines get
up to 40 and get it turned on and trying
to convince the all the VMware operators
to actually do this it's like my stuff's
going to break you know these are the
the large servers that providing
services in our data center and so they
were very nervous about that and so it
took a lot of convincing all the windows
2000 users we got it still about one
percent of our machines or Windows 2000
luckily we can outlaw them next year
because there's a there's a DOD
directive that says if it's no longer
supported by the vendor and for us July
13 is a great date because Windows 2000
as long no longer supported and so we
can actually kick them all off our
network and have the policy that allows
us to do that printers it's just kind of
too hard right now and so but what we're
doing with all our HP printers are
buying all the new jet direct cards that
support v6 and
trying to get as many up on v6 as we can
and then there's just lots of appliances
out there everything under the Sun
widgets of devices and so forth a lot of
little things you just don't support v6
that we're just sort of punting on that
for now and we'll get to them later a
lot of other little challenges we ran
into we were wondering like you know
once we duel stacked all the machines
why were the people not doing email over
v6y was all the outlook traffic not
doing v6 well the older versions just
don't do it you have to upgrade the
office 2007 or later a lot of groups
have systems that are under
configuration control it's it's part of
some DoD project and has to look just
like the operational networks and aren't
allowed to turn on v6 and so there's
just nothing we can do about those
there's a lot of system administrators
that just say I'm too busy I can't turn
it on right now and we have to convince
them no no you just run install ipv6
it's real simple and they just don't
want to mess with it and so lots of
convincing work there we've had problems
like all the rogue 624 relays sending
Ras the problem is all the people who
have ICS turned on and windows because
just the minute you do that turns those
boxes into a relay and they start doing
our arrays and suddenly all the you know
they suck all the traffic the workaround
temporarily as you set the router
priority on your primary routers bump it
too high and so hopefully there are
preferred because the windows machines
will set it to medium the long term
fixes are a guard we really need to get
that implemented in various products I
see lots of hand waving here yeah right
yeah and part yeah hey in the first one
of the the router vendors we were using
actually didn't have a way to set that
and so we had to wait for a feature
request to come through and actually
implement that there's various DNS
brokenness out there in the world that
we have to get around there's also we
found out the blackberry stuff okay
doesn't work in a v6 environment and so
that broke some of our users Oracle lack
of v6 support has been a long-term
problem so
of our backend stuff can't be v6 enabled
and then netapp appliances for doing all
our NFS and and SMB stuff sift stuff try
to make that over v6 but every time we
turn it on mounts failed although I
heard last night that they turned it on
again and they think they have it
working this time so there's problems
like you know you'll notice java never
uses v6 and it's because by default they
have it you know the this preference set
default so you have to go around to all
your apps and change this to true which
is is not very scalable there's issues
with picking the wrong tunnel metrics so
we see some of our internal machines
going to the going through is't app
instead of native when they have it has
to do with some of the windows
implementations not having the right
metrics privacy addresses somebody just
asked me about this a minute ago it's
horrible we hate it it breaks our
environment there's no central way to
for us to turn it off you know we've
been wishing for like you know another
bit in the router advertisements that
says don't do privacy there's got to be
some way essentially turn this off
because it's just killing us we have to
visit every Windows machine and manually
turn it off it's a huge pain snow
leopard has been killing us because it
doesn't do address election right in the
DNS response is because of how they
switch to mdns responder and it only
listens to the first answer so I've got
some references at the bottom if you
want to go read the bug report this is
not fixed yet and it's a killer for us
and Java on Mac OS the other fix I
pointed out earlier for getting around
job it doesn't even work on Mac OS X
printers you find you can't put an ipv6
address in a Mac saying go to this ipv6
printer and you put in a bug report and
they said that's the way it's supposed
to work you can only put names in there
you have to learn it via bonjour or DNS
so it's expected behavior which seems a
little bit weird but that's the answer
we'll go to that one so we're still
working on this network management
project but just basically we're trying
to do everything with network management
on a separate management land mostly out
of band to all of our infrastructure
devices and we can we're almost there
almost everything works the thing we're
still waiting for is we have one
application that relies on cdpe or ftp
to learn to pology information and that
the tables supported their only ipv4
addresses and so we're waiting for lldpe
that supports v6 and then we'll be able
to actually turn off before but you can
get an example here's one of our tools
we use in maan for a lot of the s flow
tracking and so forth and you can see
under the IP address column most of them
are you la addresses what's cool about
this is the addresses are shorter than
v4 and so there's less typing for people
actually have to type the address so one
of the winds of v6 also notice there's a
few things that still have to use ipv4
addresses like the Google Search
Appliance which doesn't yet support v6
so plug there so freeradius to a lot of
people think that you can't make radio
this do duels both before and b6 because
of things that are in the notes and if
you search the internet a lot of people
say it just doesn't work you have to run
two instances that's actually not true
you can just create to listen clauses
and it works and so I point that out
because a lot business tripped up a lot
of folks part of the management land we
have to manage all the UPS is out of the
network this is really a one of the one
of the appliances we had an issue with
but we found that the new APC network
management cards actually support ipv6
so we're replacing all the management
cards and getting rid of all non APC
UPS's and so you know we really put our
you know money where our mouth is and
get rid of products that don't support
b6 and are investing in things that do
new approach to training we've learned
over many years where we're doing like
the you know multi-day classes
everything you want to know about ipv6
didn't help at all people would go home
by time they got around to it they
forgot everything or it seems way too
complex we totally changed it around and
said v6 is easy get there in five easy
steps and also we pre-configure all the
interfaces on the wet on the land
customer interfaces and we lay out some
best practices because a lot of people
were asking about how should I do this
how do i do an address plan and so we
just say read my lips forget about being
conservative like ipv4 all subnet source
last 64 and the discussion don't encode
v4 subnet values into the bottom 64 bits
because we saw a lot of people doing
that we just said don't do it
and don't do NAT which is another huge
argument we have in the DoD because a
lot of people think NAT is a security
thing so it's big argument so this is
really helped because now it looks
simple because even in the Phi's easy
steps it's here's a copy of the email
you need to send it the NOC that says
please turn it on and give me my prefix
so a lot of help so anyway quick summary
our biggest issue right now is lack of
feature parity there's just too many
places where an important feature is
just not the v6 support is just not
there and it's it's not these are the
things that aren't covered by rfcs it's
the this vendor secret sauce and that's
why we went to that vendor in the first
place and if that those features on tree
6 enabled then it's a problem for us we
think the highest priority for all
organizations is to ipv6 enable their
public facing services for a lot of the
reasons you've heard here are ready and
so we're trying to push that in DoD and
even make it a national agenda item dual
stacking networks works well as a
transition mechanism in our opinion and
we're trying to turn off all the other
tunneling and six to four and two rato
and all that stuff we just absolutely
block it in our network and but there's
still work to do before we can turn off
before we've tried we're looking for
ways to turn off before in our
environments but there's still too many
pieces that need before so that's it wow
thank you amazing we got questions
please Ralph Wallace with command
control Ron we've been talking for years
yeah interesting point though with the
deer and as you know we're currently
under contract was paid Ward to build a
commanding Navy command and control
system on top of v6 integrator with a
solo framework and also do all the
security engineering involved with that
to make sure that we are also in
compliance with a certification and
accreditation process you and I know it
is dai-kam right you're running
production networks now and you had to
get your authority to operate through
that authority right at spawar pacific
in order to do that going through the
workflow what was your main challenges
nor to get that because that's where
we're doing the same thing in Charleston
okay for the ipv6 integration lab that
we're building for the command and
control system were designing because
we're in charge of the security of it
too so what was your challenge is on the
RV what we do yeah the in all the
doctrine the policy and everything about
how you do accreditation secure the
networks and so forth we just reread all
the language in terms of I know they
talk meant ipv4 but how would you do it
with ipv6 and made sure there was an
equivalent for every single thing
demonstrated that to the DA a and got
the DA to sign off on it thank you it's
nice to know that we're doing the same
thing okay yep Dave Hankins I see I
don't to make a quick note you mentioned
that there's no DTV 6 client for mac OS
x but actually if you download is GD h
before you can install that on a mac OS
x box and use that as a client now
that's a nice first step what we'd like
to also do is produce a like in the old
days of the first days of the internet
you had an install disk with your eyes p
that would go and install whatever PPP
clock will keep the peace offer their
edges hanging on that sort of thing we
want to sort of do the same thing with
mac OS x there so you can just download
that and and go and run so there's
progress being made there good good be
nice to have it come with a vendor I
mean we don't want to have to visit the
machines it should just be turn it on
and go so but I her side I don't work
for Apple but I've heard the people that
work for Apple speak of microphones
saying we will never implement each you
dhcp address of various things so yeah
mm-hmm okay craigory Leibowitz juniper
networks clearly you had what we heard
is one of the key things management
support right I mean it's obvious right
you look at how much stuff you did and
how quickly you did it mm-hm so beyond
just the governmental mandate which is
you know a lot of people could ignore
that if they wanted to do especially in
the budget times we've had recently in
the US what was the trick that you guys
used to get this sort of total
hierarchical push down about the v6
mandate and second how big was the
dedicated staff that was working on just
v6 projects
not talking about people who were on a
virtual team from the network
engineering team who had to help a
little bit with a v6 project but people
who were full-time dedicated staff to
making all this transition stuff work
okay I think the one real key thing was
in 2003 when the DoD CIO put out the
directive to try to get there by 2008
deiran was selected as the official DoD
pilot and so that was one of the good
incentives I think for the people
working on it it was just something new
and interesting because they're all
engineer types I wanted to make it
happen because we had the DoD you know
selected as the pilot we had to prove
results and so we had the the management
buy-in from the from the highest levels
and that made it easy to get the other
by and elsewhere in the organization so
top-down is a lot easier than bottom up
so did it answer all the questions I
think Oh staff no dedicated staff this
was as people had time and interest
there is not a single dedicated person
to that it just it's a lot a little bit
of time over a long period rather than a
huge amount of time by just a few people
I have two questions actually number one
is what do you do for HTTP proxies
because the one the ones we use and the
ones everyone uses don't deport me see
so what do you run as an HTTP proxy
don't well we don't proxy the v6 code I
mean v6 traffic outbound I mean we're
not a content provider chip I mean we
have a few websites but so most of its
our customers going out to the internet
so we do have a proxy but it's only for
v4 traffic and that's mostly to do local
caching and to block access to certain
sites v6 traffic we just let go through
so that so basically it's the host that
makes the decision yes okay that's the
problem um the second your um your
statement to you when you go to vendors
you say we want feature party yeah
that's what I say as well and it's not
working for me right so I go to vendors
and
they feature party what do you want and
I say well you know I want you know
every feature you have for before it has
to work for me six in the same way and
they say no but we can't do that that's
like boiling the ocean we need to
prioritize so how do you fix it yeah
yeah two things we have the conversation
with the vendors and they say well how
do we do that and I say go have someone
go through your entire documentation and
everything in your documentation make
sure it says here's how you do this in
v4 and here's how you do it in v6 and a
number of are going through that
exercise and coming up with a
spreadsheet and looking for the feature
parity the other thing is we just have
entered in a into a cooperative research
and development agreement with one of
the defense contractors where I said I
want to figure out how to solve this
problem of feature parity and so we're
going to sort of you know Reese you know
turn it into a real research project
talk to vendors see how we could
approach that better because it is a big
problem because we've noticed that I
mean we have in DoD there's a number of
efforts to come up with like you know
what's the profile of all the RFC's that
have to be complied with what are all
the mandates what's all the testing is a
there's organizations like jeddak at
Fort Huachuca and other you know logo
programs and other things those are
necessary but they're not sufficient
that's what we found and so what's how
did we get the extra piece and that's
working with vendors and so we're
looking at how best to do that okay that
very can I Eric's on about feature
parity we get a lot of questions about
that so the answer from our side is
there which ones do you want first so
that's that's that's the kind of list
the cost of course feature parity means
feature parity that means every teacher
right should this should be parity
between all of them so right but like
there's some implementation issue here
we can use go absolutely never so which
ones do you want first that's that's my
statement here and then about being able
to your public services Eric some is
hosted on Akamai's so maybe we should
edit our customer as a customer there
man
hey when are you going to exactly six
and a final question I realize I'm
talking to a defense organization here
but do you have any numbers on opec's
operation expense which you are you
going to save any money on this and or
is it are going to save money when you
turn off be4 or are you already saving
money on on dual stack okay let me let
me try to answer it or so in reverse
order effects we don't have hard numbers
on that it is not double the amount of
work to support dual stack but it is a
you know between you know 1 and 2 X
certainly because the additional
complexity but I don't have hard numbers
on that yet the other question was the
feature parity thing absolutely
prioritisation is a key and usually when
the vendors come up with that matrix and
they say here's all the things that
don't do v6 yet that's the first thing
they ask us what's the priority and
we'll prioritize because it's based on
operational need and then what was your
second question no that was I was mainly
which you could refer to are you do you
think you will spend some some opex when
you turn off ipv4 because you said you
kind of hinted that it was like one
times something more expensive to do
dual stack not to 22 times right so it's
like is the v4 part the fraction there
or is it the one so you kind of expect
to get lower it's why we went through
all the effort to do things like
congruence in the network and changing
our v4 dresses so that the effects would
be lower so it's not to get to sleep
through the weekends or not to get what
to sleep through the weekend it's not
being able to support your customers
there so yeah no it'sit's okay
understand okay thanks okay good thank
you very much
