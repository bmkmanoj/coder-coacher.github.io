think this factor will be very
interesting especially for all of us
very googley eye can see like just
waiting for the top everybody laptops
out there and they were like checking
and they connect it not to kill anyone
into putting it on top so my name is
Carolyn out I'm a software engineer at
Google and I'm part of a team that helps
his day constantly connected to
everything so I feel another
responsibility to also help you stay
calm while dealing all the input that's
just flying into you right now and get
to help us if that is sorry God hammer
so sorry Ms entrepreneur tacky and
meditator he was a project director for
Richard year's charity healing the
device and he was also the founder of
the lineage project in New York which
offers stress reduction programs for
at-risk and incarcerated teams which one
the mayor's voluntary action award he
also co-founded xulio which creates
embeddable widget stew up live
user-generated content he he's an author
of several books including just say oh
and he's currently working on his next
book title wisdom to point out stress
relief for the creative and constantly
connected so here to help us stay
stress-free so sorry so please join me
in welcoming him thanks for the
introduction so after working for about
three years in New York City juvenile
halls teaching meditation and things to
incarcerated kids in the bronx and
harlem decided to try something a little
more challenging and practice meditation
mindfulness with technology which i've
actually discovered is as most of you
know as much as I love technology and
love to be connected at times the impact
on my health and my well-being becomes
such that I'm actually not as productive
as i would like to be and i want to
start out by telling a Zen stories i
think they're set in the flyer there
were going to be some Zen stories told
so i thought i could start with one and
i think this kind of encompasses some of
what the
team I want to explore today and the Zen
story begins as many as n stories do in
Japan and with the young man who was
quite despondent and unsatisfied with
his life and so he decides maybe I'll go
to the Zen Center and see if I can learn
some things about Zen maybe that will
help me find more meaning more purpose
in my life so he goes to locals in Zen
Center and he meets the abbot in the
Abbott says tell me a little bit about
yourself and the young man starts
telling him a little bit about himself
and the Zen master says so what are you
good at what are your interests on the
young man says well you know I I don't
really have any skills i'm actually
pretty quite worthless I was raised rich
and I never had to work and I really
have nothing you should know I really
there's really nothing I can do very
well at all and then master says well
surely there must be something some
interest you have and the students is
well pretty good at chess I've always
enjoyed chess so the Zen master looks
over to his assistant and said fetch me
a chessboard and a very large sharp
sword the guys thinking I understand the
chessboard heart but the sword like
what's up with that so the assistant
goes back and he gets the chessboard and
the sword and the Zen master instruction
that says you're going to you to the
assistant and the young man are going to
play a chess game together and he holds
up the sword and he says to assistant if
you lose I'm going to cut your head off
but don't worry you're going to be
reborn in paradise because of your trust
and commitment and then he looks at the
other young man and he says if you lose
I'm gonna cut off your head and I don't
know what's going to happen to you but
you're going to deserve it you're
worthless if you can't win a single game
of chess you know what uses are in you
so they're looking at the old man and
going out to eat for real or what's
going on and he looked serious you know
he looks like somewhat maniacal but
maniacal Zen master so they start
playing the game in the young man
budding Zen students attention is
totally focused on the game because if
you lose
he might die so he's completely present
with the game his attention isn't
worried about the path to the future
what his career is going to be what his
projects going to be what is this was
going to be everything it's right in the
moment and as such he can see moves and
he can he can see where the game is
going and he starts to take the lead and
he's looking like he's going to win in a
few moves and but then it hits him that
if he wins it means the other guy is
going to die and he starts thinking
about this other guy and thinks what
enormous courage this young assistant
has to play this game and to trust his
master that if he cuts off it said he's
going to go he's going to go to to
paradise and so he begins to have
compassion for his opponent and then he
thinks you know maybe maybe I should die
I mean I don't I haven't really had much
of a life I think I'll let him win so
the young man starts intentionally
making mistakes so that his opponent can
take the advantage and as he does so the
Zen master comes and knocks aboard off
the off the table and they both look at
him like not sure you know what's going
to happen and the Zen master says he
says no one's going to die here today
and he said you learned the two most
important lessons about studying Zen you
had complete concentration and you had
complete compassion those are the two
most essential things he says come you
can study as the story goes a Zen Zen
story goes everybody gets enlightened in
the end but I tell that story partly
because it feels like our world is in a
little similar game of life and death
although the holder of the sword over
our head isn't isn't a Zen master but
it's all these challenges that could
lead to our destruction whether its
global global warming or poverty or lack
of food or lack of water there's these
challenges that are mounting in our
world today and that we can either
respond creatively and effectively to
them or we can respond stressfully with
anxiety and so when I talk about stress
relief kind of for the creative and
constantly connected I'm talking about
those of us who who are for sure going
to be connected that's not a question
the question is are we going to be
stressfully connected or creatively
connected are we going to be consciously
connected or is our connection going to
help us actually
some of these challenges that we're
facing whether it's personal challenges
family challenges are actually the
larger global challenges and how do we
meet that how do we meet that how do we
meet that challenge and I came to this
after years of kind of Buddhist practice
of meditation and teaching stress
reduction and then finding myself with
kind of what I might call the path of
wisdom and then I found myself
completely emerged in technology and
social network than every all the cool
things that we all know exists and I
found that the more constantly connected
I was the more stressed I was the hard
it was to sleep at night the more I was
kind of anxious somewhere I was eating
my meals in front of my screen and
harder to digest food I just kind of
felt the impact on my body in a very
kind of negative way and I began to
realize it for me to survive constantly
connected I kind of had to merge my to
interest areas so one would be the path
of wisdom and the other may be the path
of technology and how do those come
together now can I be like a den student
in front of my computer inter and access
what we might call Zen mind or
beginner's mind or kind of creative mind
and so often the often when we live very
kind of tends to stress lives we kind of
have this sense that I have to do this
if I don't do this I'm not going to be
nearly as productive right that's often
a voice that's kind of their fine if I
slow down I'm not going to get as much
done and so what I want to present today
is let's say that's not bad but let's
say that's kind of work one point oh and
that there's a potential work 2 point 0
which is that the more our system is
aligned the more we're connected with
ourselves the more balanced our mind and
body and heart is that more likely the
better results were going to get and
more likely that the best those results
are actually going to be more effective
for the world so that's what I'm going
to present you may not believe that but
just for this next 45 minutes ago let's
kind of hold that possibility that there
is that new we cuddle consciousness or
whatever we could call it new kind of
pattern that's happening that says that
the more that we're aligned and the more
our work is aligned that we're going to
create a better world and that if we're
relating from stress and from anxiety
and from fear and we're bringing that
energy into our work most likely the
repercussions of that are going to have
negative repercussions on our system on
our relationships on our families
on our work and so it all comes back
again to consciousness or word that I
like to consciousness how where are we
of our state of mind and so the first
tool that I want to offer I want to kind
of offer maybe a handful of tools today
for you to think about and consider and
maybe use and one of the first that I
realized was the importance of what we
may call what's connected so first it's
really cool particularly get a new
technology and new software that were
connected you know we love that there's
this technology that connects us but
that's what's often missed in that is
the quality of our state of mind is a
consciousness with which is engaging
that so for example you can see
consciousness is kind of like the the
power system to any technology you know
so a grew an iphone is wonderful but if
it doesn't have a power source it's kind
of a nice paperweight but it doesn't
really do much and same with any kind of
computer or system it needs a power
source that fuels it and the stronger
that power source is the more that
technology can do and if we look at
ourselves off often we're relating or I
should say I and I think others relating
to technology in a way in which the
power source is not very strong the
consciousness with which we're engaging
is actually quite low so as such we're
not able to get as much time we're not
able to be as more effective so rather
than focusing on that on that we're
engaged one of the tools is to focus on
what's engaged what is our state of mind
in this moment is that anxiety as it
fears at rest this is a worry that are
if we don't do this our manager is going
to get on us and upset and competitive
or is it calm and is it ease and is it
clarity how are we approaching how we
approaching our work when we sit down
are we sitting down like this are we
sitting down like this and open to the
kind of creative energy that's happening
and that I found in my life the more I
connected the more I can notice that as
soon as I get a cell call or as soon as
I get an email or soon my energy around
it was habitual and that as such oh is
getting less done so the first tool i
want to offer is this kind of interest
in what's engaged particularly when you
feel like your attention is low and
you're working what is it that's engaged
not in a way of judging what's engaged
but just inquiring what's the state of
my mind
what's the power source with the level
of the power source that's engaged right
now and then once we've become aware of
that we can make whatever changes feel
necessary we could go for a walk we
could go get some food we could do a
variety of different things that would
then feed the power source such that our
work is more productive and effective
however often when when I do these talks
and want to talk to people about this
subject there is often this confusion
sometimes between what we might call
consciousness and then what we might
call the judging mind so for example i'm
sure there's all of us have them some
patterns that we might not find that
skillful so maybe we eat a lot of
doritos nacho cheese chips while we're
working on the computer or maybe we
maybe we drink you know five cappuccinos
a day and it doesn't quite feel right
and so the change that I'm talking about
is how do we make a change to a more
conscious relationship but that that
change happen what through what I might
call awareness rather than change
through judgment so for example if we if
we're working and we noticed that we
noticed that our we're doing a
particular pattern often the judging
mind comes in and says that's bad you
shouldn't do that and then we top that
pattern for well write and think okay
I'm good now I'm meditating or I'm doing
these things and then solve with then
we've gone from a bad person to a good
person but inevitably that that shifts
and then we go back and we kind of go
back and forth between this good pattern
that pattern so the one other tool that
can be useful is to think of change
through awareness so what might this
mean one thing that this might mean is
that the Buddha had said that um if
you're holding once you realize how
painful it is to hold on to something
you'll let it go so let's say you're
holding on to a burning ember once you
realize how painful it is to hold on to
that you'll let it go now someone can
come up to you and say research research
shows that people who hold burning
embers in their hand after five years
have this kind of and they can show your
brain holding a burning ember and they
can tell you what my friend held but but
but the real change happens is when
you you feel that and you feel the pain
of it and you want to let it go it's not
because you're bad because you're
holding it and good because you don't
but because it lets go on itself and it
lets go because you're more sensitive to
to the process because you are more
aware of where your mind body state is
so often when we when I talk about this
kind of consciousness what I'm talking
about is a greater kind of sensitivity
rather than a judge a judging mine so
the judging mind comes in and says
you're bad because I don't know want to
use the example of coffee to me I don't
care for some drinks however many cups
of coffee they want but I know that for
some people that's something that feels
like it doesn't it's not that it's bad
that we drink whatever coffee we drink
but but it feels like there is an inner
alignment that either actions have or
they don't have you know so for someone
that inner alignment maybe you know what
it feels good to have two cups of coffee
but they notice themselves drinking
seven and so there's this friction in
their life or they notice themselves you
know we all have these kind of patterns
I'll often it's around eating or it's
around you know putting 12-hour days in
on the computer so we have these power
these patterns and so then how do we
shift these patterns and so the at least
from the Buddhist perspective how you
shift them is you pay attention to
what's happening in the moment you're
holding that pattern that makes sense
you feel you feel the burning ember in
your hand and then the letting go
happens not because we not because our
mind is telling us let this go it's our
whole body or whole system telling us to
let this go so so in this kind of
consciousness that we're talking about
it's not a matter of of judging
ourselves you know if trying to be a
good person in the sense of you see this
a lot with sometimes people who may be
lived very unconsciously and then all of
a sudden they be a conscious person but
the conscious person becomes more of an
identity than actually a lived
experience so they start dressing like a
conscious person talking like a
conscious person they start kind of
taking on a certain mode and and rather
than that rather than kind of changed my
identity one of the more powerful ways
is to let the change happen through this
kind of deepening of consciousness of
actually feeling what's happening in
that moment so it's not like don't do
this do this with awareness and then see
what it feels like and then tune into
your system and just see if does that
feel genuine or does it feel like some
other kind of change wants to come from
that that kind of makes sense through
this through so it's we could call to
change through awareness rather than a
change through three things change your
judgement because often people will
begin as they begin to get more
conscious or more aware of their actions
that they actually become more
judgmental themselves how could you be
doing eating that at that time how could
you be doing this how they did it at it
a visitor and so in this process I think
we want we want to be aware of how that
judging mind works and that rather than
kind of stain there to move to a deep a
deeper knowing that's based on
unconsciousness so that our whole system
actually makes makes the changes that we
want to make so so in this tool or in
these kind of tools that I want to offer
what matters is the energy in which in
which we're approaching our tasks so
often when we think of stress relief or
we think of anything stressful people
say yeah you know what stressful is is
my colleague you know he's he's never on
time he's never doing things the way
he's supposed to do that stressful if I
could just get him to change that stress
relief or my system is just keeps
malfunctioning done it if I could get my
system my computer my network to change
then I would have stress relief or they
would think some other kind of exterior
event if I can just get this person to
do this differently you know I would be
I would be I would be fine and another
way to approach it and this is kind of
the Buddha's perspective to where he
said that he said nothing can hurt you
more nothing no amount of of angry
customers or rude emails or anything can
hurt you more than your own mind your
own thoughts nothing causes us more
stress than our own
is that and he also said that nothing
actually can bring us more happiness
that our own thoughts no fame no matter
well no amount of esteem no amount of
anything that we can imagine can
actually bring us more satisfaction than
our own thoughts and so when I when I
kind of think of stress relief what I
think about is this way in which we're
conscious of the thoughts that we bring
in and we hold them differently so for
example let's say that anger arises in
someone you know you're stressed you're
frustrated and all of a sudden that
anger arises in terms of stress relief
the anger is actually not the problem or
not the issue the issue is how that is
held and one image that's often used is
if you imagine a couple drops of blue
dye and if you put this blue dye and a
cup of water what happens to the cup cup
turns blue and if you put this same blue
dye and you put it in an ocean vast
ocean what happens to the ocean nothing
quality is the same dye is the same
state of mind is the same the container
is vastly different and the less impact
on the on the there's less impact on the
ocean because the volume is so large and
the same is actually true as a lot of
the qualities that lead to our stress
it's not fear it's not anger its how
that anger is held so for example one
person can have the quality of anger in
their mind and all of a sudden be
absorbed and and completely immersed and
lost in the anger and yelling and people
and complaining people and you know just
making a havoc or which is what we call
reaction or the other way sometimes
anger will rise in someone in the person
because it counters their identity of
themselves they'll push it away they'll
say no I'm not angry you know I'm fine
and yet the anger still there so we
could say that in that when there's
little space for our experience we have
what we might call cut mind right there
there's a quality that's existing and
that we're relating to it in a very
small way another way we could say is
that same state arises and all of a
sudden we allow space for it we allow it
to be this anger present we
see it we allow it and that through this
there still may be a challenge but all
of a sudden the level of our stress
lessons because we're no longer fighting
what's true with that given moment but
we're allowing it and we're bringing
awareness to it so we could say that
actually we created more space so one
way to look at stress relief is not so
much how do I decrease all this stuff
from coming my way but actually how am i
holding that how am I hell am i carrying
that so often the energy that what
Daniel Goleman calls destructive
emotions or maybe we call stressful
emotions make is in part how we either
resist or react to them so for example
let's say that you're going to give a
big presentation in front of a group and
you go into it and you think i'm gonna
i'm going to be completely confident and
I'm going to be completely fearless and
I'm just going to give my presentation
and I'm going to do great and then often
what happens is that we become we resist
a certain quality right so often people
think that to be fearless is to actually
have a mind where fear does not arise
right so they say I'm going to go in and
I'm not going to let fear rise I'm going
to look confident and essentially what
happens is we become afraid of qualities
of mind so in this sense we become
afraid of fear so it's actually not fear
that's a problem it's our fear of fear
that's a problem if that makes sense
it's our resisting so that when we do
give that speech if fear does arise it's
a huge it's a huge huge issue there's
very little space for it rather than I'm
going to present and I'm just going to
be open to what is and I'm going to be a
container that can hold whatever
whatever happens if fear rises if anger
Rises if whatever quality arises I'm
actually going to be a container that
can hold that so as you walk in to give
that presentation one way would be to
walk in and to be trying to present
trying to prevent fear from arising as
such we become afraid of fear
essentially another one is to actually
not be afraid of fear and this would I
would be offer would be actually the
more true confidence or true
fearlessness it's not a mind then which
fear never enters but it's a mind
that one sphere does enter it it doesn't
have its its its its met in an ocean
rather than a cup and thus the stress
and the impact that it has is actually
less is minimal if that is if that is
kind of making any sense so when you
think of stress really for sure it
really helps to get our colleague to put
things on time to get someone else to
our manager to stop talking to us so
meanly and to get all these things
happen this is wonderful you know if we
can do it but inevitably what it comes
down to is our own mind body and heart
into the degree that we're relating to
that situation and one of the things
that can be very helpful is this again
this quality of presents our
consciousness so let's say that let's
have a morning let's say you wake up one
morning and all of a sudden almost
before your foot touches the ground
you're hit with your to-do list right
this happens to all of us I'm sure
you've got to call this person you've
got to finish that report you got to do
this you gotta do that and all of a
sudden just before our foot hitches even
touches the ground on the way to the
bathroom the to-do list like you know
comes in begins to kind of absorb us so
we hurry up we're kind of feeling that
this sense of behind you know I've gotta
hurry up i got to kind of deal with my
to-do list i gotta i gotta catch up i
gotta doo doo doo doo and so as such we
bring this energy into our work so when
we're calling that when we're doing our
to-do list and we call that person who
might that customer that we need to call
we call that person on the phone and you
probably can you can feel this too when
other people have this energy there's
this weight to the conversation you know
there's this sense of like do you know
how many things I've got to do we've got
to hurry up we've got to make this
happen fast because I've got all these
other things going on and so it happens
we kind of bring this to do list around
with us wherever we go and when we bring
it into our conversations it actually
adds kind of an extra weight for an
extra tension to the conversations and
so as such the conversations don't go as
well so it actually takes us longer to
complete our to-do list because the
energy that we're bringing into that to
do lift is is is so heavy so one of the
ways to try and counter
um there's this old story about a
samurai the samurai had all these skills
that he was quite quite a felt quite
good about he could defeat a hundred men
in battle and he could jump from the
ground up to on top of a building and he
had all these great powers that he had
developed in his ears and but he kept
hearing about this Zen master again a
Zen master who was lived down the way
that everyone was always talking about
with such a steam and admiration so he's
thinking but you know I'm this like top
samurai what's what's up with this
little monk you know why is he getting
all the attention when I should get all
the attention because of all the great
things i can do so one day he decides to
go and talk to the mom to see like why
was your reputation so good so he goes
in to talk to the monk or to the Zen
master and he says he says he expects
going through the list of all the powers
he has did you know I can defeat a
hundred people in battle did you know I
can jump on top of buildings and I can
do all these amazing feats says well
what can you do what are your powers
what what makes you so cool and the Zen
master the story goes replies when I eat
I just eat when I walk I just walk when
I talk I just talk
and that that skill is actually probably
one of the more challenging skills that
we can all have is it when we're when
we're doing something what is the level
again of consciousness that we're
bringing to that action are we walking
just walking are we walking with our
to-do list and doing 10 other things at
once and no judgment on it you know in
terms of however we want to live but if
we're looking at kind of this whole
field of consciously connected then that
really matters what's the level of
consciousness we're bringing to the
action it doesn't mean that there's a
kind of a god of the internet or of
technology so this is bad and this you
know there's like a list of good and
Bad's but there's this sense that as our
attention becomes more and more
distracted with all these different
things we're doing at the same time
there's actually less presence that we
actually bring to the rest of our life
so if we bring what we might call
scattered mind if scattered mind is
really present during the day we'll
probably really notice it at night when
we try to go to bed and the thing about
scattered mine is if you tell it to shut
up it doesn't really shut up if you
heard tried this before you're trying to
go to sleep in the mind is just kind of
racing with this to-do lists and all
those things he shut up you know and it
doesn't it doesn't follow it doesn't
follow that we can't quite command it in
that same way shut up but often we hear
we've experienced that kind of scattered
or caffeine mind or anxious mind at
night because it actually kind of stayed
with us during the day because it was
cultivated and it continued during that
I see even though we can take something
at night that might help us ease it the
real challenge is to actually address it
in the day so I have a little tool that
I want to offer around this and the
tools called expand time and i
discovered this tool because I was
realizing how many nights I was going to
sleep and I had that state of mind with
me and I was realizing like how did this
happen during the day when did this come
about and I realized it was a lot of it
was in my relationship to time you know
I say what's your wedding i'd have a
relationship with time I didn't even
know so my relationship time is the way
that I describe it I say you how to
really you're having a really
today tons of things you need to do tons
of lists in your head and you're just
about to walk to a meeting and someone
stops you in the hall and says how can I
have two minutes I just need two minutes
of your time now how do we relate to
this person they just need to miss over
time let's say that we have two minutes
so one way that we can relate to this
person is to think Jesus I have so
little time already why are you trying
to take my time okay and you we say okay
sure I've got two minutes hurry up the
consciousness that we're bringing to
that situation hurry up yeah yeah yeahs
is such that during those two minutes
we're probably not likely to take in
much of what that person says and we're
probably not be able to hear or actually
address the situation because how we're
viewing them is reviewing as someone
taking away our time as kind of a
distraction that shouldn't be happening
and so time in that sense becomes
actually quite narrow because our state
of mind becomes quite narrow another way
would be if we had two minutes and that
person comes up in this can I have two
minutes and then you say yeah please
I've got a full two minutes and there's
a softening and there's an allowing and
there's a there's an opening the two
minutes hasn't changed at all you
there's not like but you've expand we
could say you've expanded time within
the time that you have so rather than
those two minutes being yeah hurry up
yeah okay hurry up and then you walk
with that mindset to your meeting and
it's hurry up of the meeting and hurry
up at home and hurry up to do in a hurry
up and hurry up and then you get to bed
and say hurry up and go to sleep and the
mind says what so so rather than kind of
continuing that pattern what would it be
like during the day rather than that
tightening around those moments come on
can I have this yeah I got two full
minutes here you here I am for those two
full minutes and to change our
orientation to those kinds of events
during the day so actually that what we
cultivate is the quality of patience and
ease and so after that two minute
discussion we will show up at our
meeting to discuss topics with our
colleagues what shows up it's more
likely going to be patience and
awareness was present in the
interruption most likely patience and
awareness is going to be present at the
meeting to discuss ideas
but it all kind of happens when there's
something happening often and we at
first we want to fight it and we want to
say no you know we want to kind of like
tell the person why are you trying to
take away my time and it could be
actually and sometimes we actually don't
have any time but how do we say we don't
have any time I don't have any time I do
not have any time and the two ways are
vastly different and it'll it'll depend
and that will actually how we relate to
that moment is actually how we're going
to relate to the moment where we're
going to bed at night and this is also
very true for interruptions if you've
noticed that you're working really hard
and you're trying to do something and
you're like I right I'm getting stuff
done and all of a sudden interruption
happens and at first the interruptions
like damn it why are you interrupting me
you know least with me it's like if I'm
working like damn it why are you
interrupting me and I'll deal with the
interruption but it'll be with damn it
and then when I return back to bring my
attention to the work damn it is still
there you know I I brought it I brought
it back with me and the more that I with
the interruption and the interruption
happens and I see that my job is to is
my job isn't to do more my job isn't to
make more things happen my job is
actually to to respond creatively to
whatever is so if my job is to respond
creatively to whatever is that
interruption isn't a mistake of the
universe shouldn't be happening it's an
opportunity to respond creatively to
what is so if I respond creatively to
what is and when that interruption
happens the question I'm asking is it's
not leaving the hell alone why are you
doing this is how do I respond
creatively to you how do I relate to
this in a creative way and I find that
the more that I bring that energy into
the interruption first of all the the
sooner the problem the issue is solved
the need that they have is solved but
more importantly when I then bring my
attention back to my work I'm building
what we might call a creative momentum
so the momentum that I've started in the
day is creative creative creative and so
when I go to my work guess what's
present it's more creative now if I
start the day and I start with
frustration frustration frustration when
I sit down in front of my computer and
push
the power button on most likely what's
going to be present as frustration and
it might take a while for that
frustration to subside but that's going
to be this each each one each moment
conditions the next so if I really care
about my state of mind then whatever is
whether it's an interruption or someone
asking me for my time that that Mike my
ability to create a truly respond to
that moment conditions how I'm going to
respond creatively to every other moment
in the day so that why in the sense of
our in some ways our idea of what it
means to be creative or productive and
useful actually get in the way of us
being productive and useful because then
we label things and we don't necessarily
pay attention to what's the energy
that's coming what's the energy that I'm
bringing and so what interests me is how
these two worlds both the sense of when
we're kind of stressed but then also in
the sense of productivity and what we
may call creative mine or Zen mind
sometimes beginner's mind the
relationship between these two and the
possibility that as our system is more
aligned and as our mind and body and
heart are more aligned that actually we
can access what we might call the
creative mind better in our work that it
shows up more you know and so most of us
have some work that involves creativity
we're not just sticking pegs together
you know or not we're dealing we're
creating products we're dealing with
customers we're working on teams and
that there's this some element of this
they called the zone in sports you know
sometimes with this this feeling of
where how much creative energy is in
this moment how much am I accessing this
kind of intuitive or creative knowing
and that as as one that the these two
have a relationship and it stress
decreases the other increases so I want
to talk a little bit about kind of what
we might call this creative or Zen mind
or beginner's mind and years ago I was
interviewing this guy named George
Mumford who Georgia is kind of if you
had to put a title him he's probably
like someone called teacher of the zone
so he worked with Michael Jordan and and
those guys in the Chicago Bulls
when they're in their championship area
and coach Jackson was with them and then
he moved with them and he worked with
Kobe and Shaq in them on the late when
they played for the lakers during their
championship era and so what they would
bring George to do is they'd bring in
jorge to actually do some what of this
is to look at the mental state in which
players engage in the game because coach
Jackson knew that he could have the
greatest player who's physically fit and
can jump high and can do all these great
things but if if that players mind isn't
in the game if his presence isn't in the
game then they're pretty useless you
know one little shot and all of a sudden
they get off we knew that what's
important was actually what they call
being in the zone so so this guy Mumford
would come in George Weber would come in
and he would do a short meditation
sometimes before the game and he would
work on this kind of quality of ease and
say how do we be in the floor and the
flow in the game and when I was talking
to him and interviewing him he says I
said so how do you how do you work with
the players he says well the first thing
I tell them is if you try to get in the
zone in the zone if you try to get in
the zone you can't so of course the
players are like what we're hiring you
to come tell me how to get in the zone
you tell him you don't try since if you
try to get in the zone you can't you may
have noticed this you're you're you're
behind on a project and you're like all
right I'm gonna I'm going to sit down
I'm gonna be creative I'm gonna produce
I'm gonna you know and you're going
there and you're you're you know you're
kind of psyching yourself up that one
actually sit down it doesn't guarantee
that access to that state so I said well
if you don't if you don't tell him
tonight if you know if you say if you
try to kittens oh and you can't what do
you do with them right and he says he
says I can't remember his exact words
but he says um if your present if your
present the zone happens it's a
byproduct you try to get in the zone you
can but if your present the zone happens
as a by-product so what is this presence
so this presence would be if a player is
on the court and the same is true for we
think a player on the court or us in
front of our
our computer if but if a players on the
court and he's thinking I need to get in
the zone I have to get in the zone where
is that zone I need to be in the zone
duh did it at all this kind of mental
activity adding mental activity to the
situation that that that distances us
actually from the creative mind and the
different players on the court and and
they're they're aware of their body and
they feel their breath and there where
sounds and they're there in a quality of
presence then the what we might call the
zone or the creative mine or the Zen
mine is more likely is kind of more
inviting to come through so if we try to
be in the zone we can't but through
presents the zone happens more more
often as a by-product so I'll just offer
that to you and you can explore and
experiment yourself walk up to your
computer you know and think I'm going to
get in the zone I'm going to get in the
zone all right I'm going to do this and
do that and then walk up to your
computer in the sense of presence so in
the presence how would we sit if we were
present I don't know just kind of
explore if I was to bring presents to my
work this next hour what would that look
like ok I might sit this way or mites it
that way how would my breath be how
would my what is what is my direct
experience in front of this computer and
see what that might be like for an hour
just as a test what would it be like to
bring presents into our actions and
since a lot of our actions is with
computers and mine too it's been much am
I day looking at a screen then how does
this presents get good expressed in
there and so it's not a matter of we
could say that it's actually a matter of
a balance with effort so there's an old
story about this young man and he
decides that he's going to be the
greatest martial artist in the whole
land and so he tells his parents since
apparently ok and he hears about this
teacher way off in the north of Japan is
supposedly the the teacher of teachers
if you're going to be the greatest you
got to study with him so he goes to the
story goes and he's on a train for three
days and he's on a bus for three days
you have to hike
mountain for three days and you know I
used to do all that stuff so finally he
arrives at the to meet with the this
teacher great martial arts teacher and
the martial arts teacher says what do
you want to learn and the student says I
want to be the greatest martial artist
in the area the whole country this is
okay this is how long must I study yes
yes the teacher hey guys is owed for the
V the best seven years at least minimum
seven years and teachers and the
students thinking seven year it's like I
was kind of hoping to get this done and
maybe five you know I got other things I
want to do with my life so this is what
if I work twice as hard as everybody
else and Zen master says then it'll take
you about 15 years and if do it says
what if I work twice as hard and day and
night he says mmm probably bout 30 years
in and the students you know it's like
perplexed and he's like why is it that
every time I tell you I'll work harder
you tell me it'll take longer and the
the teacher says the answer is simple
with one eye focused on the destination
there's only one I left to find the way
and so we could say is a student in the
story had a great great deal of effort
right but we could say the efforts
actually just kind of one side of the
coin that the other side of corn is what
we might call patience and that the to
kind of balance each other out and when
we talk about being the zone within the
zone on our computer in the zone and the
basketball court this is not just trying
it's not just effort that actually
determines the success or not a success
of it but the quality of that effort is
that effort coming with with a patient
effort is there a balance of these two
qualities and so if you explore this
with your in your work and explore
sometimes when you're feeling frustrated
and it's just not happening what needs
to happen if you have too much effort
and you need more patience that's
usually my case or is there actually two
little patience and not enough effort is
there too little kind of sitting around
and not enough not enough effort that
you're kind of bringing to it but that
these two qualities when we think of
kind of engaging the creative mind can
be very helpful just to inquire what's
present now what's the quality of my
effort is my efforts trained or is my
effort and thinking that with this and
you know
often when the effort is strained
there's some story we're telling
ourselves when I finish this this is
going to be and the story usually has a
really happy ending or a really horrible
ending but but this is going to bring me
or do me or help so my manager is just
going to think the world of me or my
manager is going to hate me there's some
story that's often around our effort and
what would it be like to drop the story
and to really put our attention in the
process to put two eyes into the process
so that actually we're less or less kind
of back and forth between the past and
the future and we're more with the
processes is happening and this is kind
of what they're what they're beginning
to learn in sports and I think it's
really the same true for all of us who
are working in any capacity is that
there is this balancing of effort and
patience that's needed and there's
quality of consciousness that we can
bring and if we can bring that into it
our systems change our businesses change
and hopefully our world will change
because because it was infused with this
with with his consciousness and this
quality of attention and then from that
everything who knows what the world we
can actually change this change the
system in very very positive ways
through it through art and it all starts
though with the attention that we're
bringing to our actions so I see the
things I hand up I have no idea how much
time we've spent or how much time we
have but go ahead Oh
so it seems we have to have at least
some attention towards a goal otherwise
you go for work the basketball mode I'm
in the zone I'm completely the zone
dribbling yeah and everyone standing
there watching waited for me to actually
dribble down court and take the shot
because the goal is there's a goal that
I am actually in this process too is
there do you have a sense on how to
balance the process versus the goal of
the process yeah yeah my um my
experience I guess I don't need the mic
my experience is um is that some of it
to me in my experiences around how much
of this how much of what I call is
there's a story around the event so if
I'm if I'm doing this if I'm doing this
and of course we have to produce right
for our for our managers and other
people we have results that we're
seeking and so that's very true and and
yet the more I can hold that without
visiting that the more likely i can
actually stay attuned to the process but
if if half my attention is on what's
going to happen when the results you
know what a great player i'm going to be
and what the world is going to think of
me that that that has a different energy
about it versus rather than this is my
goal and i'm going to stay focused on
the goal i think that's a good point but
but so the goal would still be present
but i think our energy would be more
directed towards towards actually
reaching it and less directed towards
the story that we're telling ourselves
of what's going to happen when we do and
that story happens I mean we tell you
can tell we you may know that we all
tell each other we tell ourselves I mean
we'd love to read the top news stories
you know of course on whatever new site
we do whether it's big or Yahoo or
whatever or google news but we also have
our own stories that we tell ourselves
of course our own top stories our top
stories about who or what we're going to
become and who or what we're going to be
and it's so story sometimes I think that
can get in the way of our kind of
creative process because our creative
process really needs room to room to
flow and to to expand beyond whatever
our hopes our fears my
any other questions yeah um so so you're
saying you know if you're concentrating
this energy and so forth left might vary
takes a lot of energy to concentrate the
way you're talking so it seems like it's
kind of a chicken and egg problem giving
there yeah any comments make them yeah
well I see it it's like I'm if you have
a there's water flowing there's water
flowing down a path and the water is
going to go where there's the least
blockage right it's the gravity is going
to take it and it's just going to find
whatever crevasses is the least blockage
and initially where it flows the easiest
is maybe down patterns and done pathways
that there's a least blockage but it's
actually not that helpful so initially
it's actually more work to to create the
pathway that we feel more aligned with
that we actually feel more helpful with
so it so it feels like there's more work
because because that pathway hasn't been
attended to let's say but that over time
the more that pathway is attended to the
more the water just naturally kind of
flows there in the beginning but but
that's why I like I'm like the example
the burning ember I gave before is that
some people some people begin to feel
this and they feel like that it should
be pleasant all the time you know and
that that it's not a that the work at
least in my perspective is opening up
those channels and so over time those
channels become more fluid for the water
to go through but initially if that if
that path hasn't been worked on it this
is going to be a lot of blockage weeds
you need to pull out rocks to remove but
over time that that works and again it
works if but sometimes that can happen
is it's not a quality of should or a
pressure and I don't know what you're
feeling in those moments but that's
another thing where that can happen is
that people kind of feel like I need to
be creative I have to try to be creative
act to try to be calm and of course
trying to become is just usually much
more tense you know trying to try and I
gotta try got to bring it rather than
i'm just going to allow and flow so i
don't know if that's helpful at all but
but if you see it that's kind of how i
see it is this opening this channel
and it takes some work to open those
channels but in the end the time that if
we can open those channels if we can
think that our our system is going to do
better we're going to sleep better we're
going to eat better we're going to feel
better about ourselves then we're going
to more and more that's going to come
into our come into our work I think any
other pressure dots or questions are you
at the beginning we talked about change
through awareness instead of change
through the judgment judgment and you
gave the example of the burning ember in
your hand which actually hurts you and
you want to drop it but for your other
example of drinking seven cups of coffee
a day for for instance that doesn't
really hurt you doesn't instinctively
make you feel bad and want to drop it
right how you gain this awareness okay
so so one way would be so for me there's
like two different voices that often if
here so if let's say I have my hand over
a fire and the heat comes up there's
just this voice that says move your hand
you know because I can feel the heat and
it's just it's just this voice it's just
like this is just what needs to happen
in this moment move your hand and it
feels like it's not a voice that says
you're bad if you hold your hand there
you really shouldn't hold your hand you
know it's not that kind of a voice it's
just a voice it's like move your hand
and so there's that voice and then
there's that other voice that's more of
a berating or more of a judgmental voice
so often when people say to me well I
should I should stop doing this action
what I generally say to them is why
don't you just be present for the action
so I for someone drinking seven cups of
coffee could be fine I don't make any
judgment on that but for people who say
it doesn't feel right for me to drink
seven cups of coffee then i would say
bring more awareness to that process so
what so feel what it's like after
drinking the seven cups of coffee take
the time to actually tune in to that is
it painful and is it not so how we how
we might do that would be just to sit
with ourselves and bring attention to
our body house is sitting in my stomach
what is my whether it's my state of mind
what is the direct experience of this
and then from that see if some change
wants to happen does that make sense
somewhat but it's through a full
experience of that and then the system
it's not your mind it's the system just
feels like life wants to move in this
direction rather than a good bad you
know the whole good/bad thing that is
bad to do this and it's good to do that
so another tool that we can I know we're
kind of their time but one tool that I
want to offer is
some is is is and this was a tool when
the guy was telling you about worked
with the Lakers and stuff often what he
would have them do is what was called
mindfulness of breathing so even if you
just kind of sit now you don't have to
change your hast or anything but just
feel your breath as it comes and goes
you don't need to change you don't you
do anything about it but all of a sudden
you're kind of tapping into your body
and for most of us were in our heads
most of the day as I am too and that and
we can that's a great intelligence
source these wonderful things the mind
and the brain can do but we also have an
intelligence source in our body and it's
always nice to have multiple forms of
intelligence and so by catching into the
breath a couple even just a couple times
a day all the system were accessing
another level of intelligence so all of
a sudden you're going to get your coffee
and you're waiting in line your fester
why is this line so long ah the breath
what are you what are we cultivated in
that moment and we always have something
that we can actually come back to we're
waiting for a computer to boot some some
some were we're waiting and so we don't
actually have to set up more time in our
life but we can actually use that time
in one effective way is just to tune in
to the breath you're working on your
computer you're frustrated with how the
projects going you can feel the
difference I can feel the difference
just as we're doing it now you're aware
of the breath but you're also aware of
the environment and sometimes that
really helps to kind of come back from
kind of this to uh to a more kind of
spacious awareness so as we as we
practice mindfulness and we're looking
at our goals some a place that I get
stuck is the goal is out in the future
and yet mindful
is here in the present and life then
seems like a series of goals that are
out there in the future and trying to
bring it back to the present and I don't
know what here yeah I've play with that
one to one of the phrases that I use is
this moments never going to get any
better and I like that phrase because my
mind hates it this moment's never gonna
get any better it's what I often play
with what if this moment was it this is
it this is like you know and then often
the the condition no no this can't be it
the it happens when i get this position
i get this i get that i get whatever the
story is what if this moment actually
was it now from that there's still goals
and things that we can achieve but we
can we work towards them from from a
sense of fullness rather than lack and
that's kind of what i find most
interesting and why that phrase really
helps me this moment is never going to
get any better now on the surface level
this moment could get quite better if we
have pain at the surface level this
moment could be another moment could be
free of pain and we could say that
that's been better but what if at the
very foundation nothing changes and you
can talk to this if you talk to people
who've made billions or who've done
these things there's something that
changes with all the money and fame and
everything else and there's something
that doesn't change at all are people
who have had great illness and great
tragedy there's something that changes
and there's something that never changes
and if we can tap into that which never
changes then it feels like our movement
can our movement toward to create things
and to do things come from fullness and
expression and fun and creativity rather
than a feeling of like lack so that's
how I work with that and I just I don't
know that phrase this one was never
gonna get any but it works for me i I
reminds me to kind of come back and go
all right you know this moment if this
talk goes wonderfully or poorly this
moment ever going to get any better or
if this whatever it goes wonderfully or
poorly this moment is never good and so
I find that very actually helpful you
can you can take that if you want
this sort of leads into what you are
saying which is I have a chronic pain
condition and my experience is that when
I start being mindful in my body the
pain gets worse and so to function on a
daily basis I have to sort of shock the
pain to one side but it does get in the
way of meditation and I know a Zen
master would say you know experience the
pain be the pain but that's a lot of
pain to be you don't have any thoughts
yeah I have house had a various physical
challenges and ailments in my life and
one of the things again I noticed is how
much the judging mind can actually then
come in to and say you should be doing
this so you should be more mindful or
you should be able to solve this or so
for me it's been very helpful to be
aware of that voice and then to Jen work
with whatever I can work with and I was
interested when I heard this talk
recently to this guy Eckhart Tolle whoo
hoo I was listening to and he talked
about the importance of actually going
out in nature and just getting life
energy from nature and feeling like
positive bringing kind of positive
energy into our life and I realize that
something that I've actually found very
helpful is it can I be out in nature and
can i bring kind of positive energy into
my system but in terms of the in terms
of like the the pain when it's happening
I think one thing is to be very mindful
of the energy in which is coming at it
and can there be a quality of acceptance
and even even though it may sound
strange actually equality forgiveness to
it you know that the self-hatred around
someone who's in as someone who is in
been paying the frustration the anger
that I'm in pain that that often is
actually more painful then actually the
pain is a story of you shouldn't be in
pain how could you be you should have
solved this by now you know all that is
actually the real pain of the pain and
then when I can be aware of that and see
and let that go by and then it's more
manageable for me
any other last ones before yeah you were
talking earlier on where the exam master
stories where you're saying when I eat I
eat when I walk it walk were your
thoughts of how that can fit in with
lifestyle like I think a lot of us have
is and I'm trying to answer it a little
bit fuller then there's balances I know
their history that's the heck out of me
when I can sort of if I can achieve them
when I walk I walk it means that I don't
have enough physical time in a day to
take care of some other things so I
think we're sort of forced with we're
probably all trying to do more than we
can in a day and that's where the
balance answer comes in but I don't
think we can achieve both that how can I
productively use that walking time to
calmly take her some of these other
things I have to do that would be you
know I don't want to be as I master i
would be as screwed as i can at what I'm
doing yeah I had it how to be combined
those two yeah yeah I think it's an art
I have a few ideas but I think it's a I
think it's an art and I think it's what
we're all creating I think what we're
all creating is we're tired of a
stressful connected life we don't we
don't want that anymore and yet we're
not willing to let it to let go and go
to the woods and retire in a hut so
somehow we got to come together and say
let's marry these two let's be
consciously connected and what is that
going to look like and so and and I feel
like that's kind of what's emerging in
this world now is all of us saying we
want we want this it's not enough to be
connected we want consciousness to be
connected with us now saying that some
tools that I helpful with is one is is
how I begin an end today so the middle
of my day may be totally stressful and I
can't really do much about it it's
really hard to bring consciousness in
there's all these deadlines but what I
can usually do is I can make the first
hour and the last hour conscious so when
I wake up in the morning what's my first
thought who sent me email what do I got
to do or is my first thought what's my
state of mind and can i spend that first
hour doing whatever practices
you feel whether it's a walk meditation
or whatever you feel like it's helpful
and then can I spend that last hour
doing the same thing I turn off the
technology I turn off any kind of
sensory input I don't I don't spend that
time absorbing and taking in more
information actually spend that time
working on the container so for example
we often think of ourselves it's like
just information you know throw as much
information in there and maybe something
will stick and it's almost like pouring
the best wine in a glass it's that has a
hole in it it just goes right out
because the container isn't isn't
conducive to hold it and I feel like
that's something that happens a lot of
our society is like we're throwing stuff
in Stefan's the Soviet and the container
actually has a hole in it so to spend
that first hour and that last hour
addressing the container and will
however that would look whether it's
reading some books but but make sure
that those times add that quality and
then to trust it naturally that's going
to infiltrate your day in certain ways
and then and you're an experimenter your
I mean we're creating this together I
don't but I do know that that's
something we can all do we can make that
first hour in that last hour and then we
can we can see what creative ways you
find you know to bring it in and then
you can also just find one task so let's
say you walk to the bathroom every day
I'm gonna walk to the bathroom and I'm
gonna walk to the bathroom it's gonna be
my one task when I walk to the bathroom
I'm going to walk to the best I'm gonna
I'm gonna just walk so it's not like
I've got to do this all the time but
there's maybe one or two experiences
before I eat my food I'm going to take
three breaths and I must stabilize so
that what eats is is not the hurried
mind but that the hurried mind is kind
of subsides for a minute so three
breaths and then I'm going to eat my
food and what that does is it just kind
of reconditioned that energy that's kind
of like this towards an energy that's a
little bit different so that so that
could be helpful yeah but you're you're
you're a unique I feel like we're all
like you know creating this sense
together there's a lot of us who are
kind of coming together and kind of
saying all right we want to be connected
and what we become
what does this all look like for us to
do it together so thank you um I we're
gonna have some lunch and I'm gonna be
around and spend the day here I think so
if you see me I'm happy to talk but
thank you for coming cuz I know that um
my guess is there was two voices when
you thought of coming to this event the
one voice that you've got so much do you
don't have time for it and the other boy
said here you might be able to use that
so I'm thankful that you listen to the
one voice and I hope both voices found
