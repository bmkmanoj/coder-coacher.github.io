Gambon talking about a new automated
cross-platform and multi device API test
framework I've ran out of breath trying
to to say the title of it okay thank you
hello afternoon everyone
money ATM being down from in terms of
the VR service group today I will
introduce our Chancellor from work at a
medical cross planful and multi device
API test of work the name is a ITF what
is the IDF is interactive API tester
from work currently it is used for
entire collaborations wait forever DC so
Polavaram ever see how many you famers
with web a DC or no the entire economy
since wait forever DC so the end of this
nice and your guys you not only know the
way very safe but also know the
corresponding API framework web RTC it's
web-based the real-time communication it
is open standard and now the browser
browser or prior to application enable
real-time communication without
extension of Naga aim to each adoption
this webociti technology the intel has
provider real-time pointer end-to-end
solution and her collaboration suite for
everything the suite include the
internal cells for every conference
server it enabled not only peer-to-peer
communication but also per welcome i'm
still best conferencing in additional it
also provide comprehensive Client SDK
such Android SDK or the windows native
SDK Java SDK as native SDK and our suite
also provider interface for basically it
a neighbor of the communication with the
traditional a disease system currently
the angel has built a girls in encoding
of entire operations with forever DC
hundreds of eternal dairyman's from
about nineteen countries and regions and
our cooperation covers areas areas since
education medical industry cloud social
media and on my podcast in telecom
rubber and so on if you guys have more
interesting about our product please
access our official website what is a
dot intercom okay look at nice nice nice
and then you can see the peer-to-peer
with your communications nine a scenario
definite cattle clinic leg to our
peer-to-peer server and we do audio or
data transported by each other directly
well the signaling messages that has
both casting and something like that it
goes through our peer-to-peer server
here it's MCO based the Mattie party
with your conference communication Marge
all kinds of a test client it can
connect to our MSU server and not only
video audio but come other singin on a
server or council uder at is a server so
the tested our server of the provider
Rooter or mixture solution so that has
the kind can our client conservative
avoid string from other peers or a
subsidy makes the stream from our server
it can reduce computing overhead on
client machine so we can see the rapids
supported platform SDK make our Crispina
form API testing or interactive API
testing effort increase the exposure
name
the medical testing the interpreting
across those super of SDK on different
program cheap and plentiful with
different program it's big a problem
look at our challenges the first of all
is interaction and a dependence from
about scenario you can see even a single
scenario maybe neither corporation by
different has declined our tester steps
in a single test the case wrong at a
different device with different program
language tested steps are tied and a
dependent to other steps the second one
our test the target is an arch and inner
application testing our tacit is a suite
of AP ice with a different program
language so we cannot depend on existing
UI automation framework and currently we
we know there is a so many good single
pendulum API testing from work and a
cross-platform application test
framework but no automation framework
exactly support design and around that
kind of interactive API test I think
this is not our unique challenge but
it's also channel for cross uniformity
device game or masti or Anna MAHT II
need Amati gyro communication when acted
estiga testing now look at our idea of
design philosophy the first one is
cross-platform support we support the
preneur the test case automatically on
different test platform Android as
Windows Linux etc second is cross device
communication we support real-time
status sharing and control okay the next
one extension bar we not develop road
the new API for
with Tesla make the test the developer
can easily integrate the third party API
test case or so the party tester from
work to our tester from work easily okay
before introduce our framework
architecture nuke typical web as a
peer-to-peer test a scenario a user
enchilada CTS SDK and NGO bobbidi say
Android SDK created a space curve
scenario image alice is deicide and a
bobber is under side at the first are
Android and Bob connect to our server
and Alice in white Bob through the peer
server and Bob accept our invitation
now the attestation are established
so the analyst can create a no-go stream
and a shared bus rule is pure Channel
and Barbara also can create a no-go
stream and share to Alice and Alice and
Bob can also show the order or tax or
data through these artists a channel so
in order to help you better understand
about scenario still and creating this
demonstrate its user and share Webber
said yes SDK to create a simple yet
application and use entire web as a
Android SDK create and Jordan later SDK
okay and I will help me play this video
so okay
okay it's beginning never side is a jet
side and it's a simple break a simple
gesture HTM page Nevada is an enjoy
native application so and it's creating
of string and shear to Bob
but also creates no string to share to
anise because barbicide I will use the
virtual camera because I used under
eliminator so the anise can share the
data to Bob and Bob also Kashia did had
to Alice okay so okay thanks so from
about scenario we can see they are
running on different program language so
in this demonstrate here's another
demonstration I'll use that you show how
to test about peer-to-peer test scenario
with our idea from Rock automatically
okay okay play again
okay our case is beginning running way
down to their browser automatically at
the aside we use the the jessamy with
camera run time and I'm sure Sarah
where's Jen you need firm work you can
say there's some pub a person or girl it
just to show what we are running behind
this page it is optional
okay so okay I think over you know they
have the basic view about our Casa de
scenario and our idea from work
now I introduced the idea of an author
and a federal structure the first ur is
a physical structure our tester
framework in the Whitehead into three
tests the controller has a note and a
test account test the controller is the
master who are from work it responsible
for the nautical control or the status
mention there's by the direction and
communication between the ties of the
continent has a load test controllers in
the country animosity to test note and
are nestling the requirement from that
has a note so we can say that as a note
Tessa note in fact is a physical devices
may be Windows Linux Mac OS so all which
the party the all kinds of attach the
clients at a Steven browser Firefox ie
Chrome or the Android imager iOS
simulator and your phone and drop iPhone
app are collected the test grant a
device under test on which our tester
API waits with different correspondence
the party API from work are running mum
age so here is our North structure it
can be divided into four now the first
of now is the status
status control they used to to control
it will show the control mastery between
that has the control and has a note and
a testicle and Tesla controllers in the
controller master to test node that has
when the test case should we start
which test case should start and the
NASA name the requirement of feedback
from the Tesla note that has with Tesla
kind and died it wearable is running is
finished
and Wilson when single test the case is
finished it's also sent back the finish
the signaling to test the controller we
can see that our controller mast er goes
to the doctor by sake dial Vegas in our
server it's also used for which notify
management now now introduced which
notify Mendham now it is a incisional
for our framework it's responsible for
the car ordinary API call sequence with
the different platform api's in order to
unify the communication between
different has declined with a different
program language we implement cross
burner phone which notify McAlinden with
this mechanism different API running
with different program language with a
different API framework come share the
status between editor and can occur
ordinary and operator with each other we
introduced the implementation for this
they are in the phone is nice and third
now is a test execution this now is
useless to integrate the third party
framework
deploy or build the test case on tested
client and control the core sequence the
National is read out management because
we have a different it has the client so
for when single has the crunch the de
terrible that here did
he'll report the generator by
correspondence to the party API from
work when test case is finished on this
test client it will send the detail
report to the report passer running on
the tested note the report parcel where
analysis their tassel readout and
generates the the summary to the test
the controller so the finally the report
generator were generated a final report
according to different criteria after
the test case are finished on all test
client so this is our general excursion
steps the first one is a test the
building and deployment
it included reading test environment
configuration check the device status
and prepare that has device rate build
and / a test case this need cooperation
between the test the controller and has
a note then a drowning test during the
running test
Tessa steps sequence control is finished
about cross paraffin which notify
mechanism the wife status monitor is
finished by connected tests the note and
she other real-time status between the
test the code and it has the controller
after test case is finished we get a
result and a generated test report it
Cleon the test environment so serious
about Weber cpiotto Piatt has the
scenario we see how the test case
building and deployment at the first
turn country several
stat on our server then the controller
server read the configuration and say
home and has client we should have
connected them connected to
correspondent has a note that has
another way all checked
that has the device tethers and a
propeller that has a device and she
other information to test the controller
so then the cat has a controller raided
the configuration that has the 78 -
works configuration or the Tesla switch
and a cage with the test case should
begin start now so he sent a comment to
the corresponding test node to the node
begin build and the parade has called
test the case to correspond in test
device now the tests the case is running
after case is running the secret
controller method II it goes new the
Tesla Tesla client and attach the server
directly so in order to control the API
call sequence through different Tesla
client with different from language the
Kim problem we should solve is
communication the communication between
different has the client stelios about
pure fiat has a scenario alice is a
deicide he was running i suggest either
running with the jessamine maybe always
come around time and barber is on your
side hisilani with android you need a
firm work we should resolve the
communication between these two
separated tests from work because they
can a communist and others as a diffuser
status and i can cooperate with each
other we should also swap the
communication between the test client
and the test the server
no matter before or running after the
test case test server shouldn't know
that has the client status it's running
it's a finish or it crashed
okay so this is our solution our
solution is provide a plan phone
depending the API another means this
through API is implement by different
program language JavaScript C++ object
we see yes you can choose to buy or use
the party API from work the first or API
is connect even the test client called
connect the function connected to Allah
ITF server the testicle Anna can share
the status between each other can share
the test of the client can also share
the status between the server and flange
the second API is which knock if the
test client call which knock Natomas his
nacht cannot go forward to next step his
waiting for the other parties to running
some API testing the nasty one it's not
notified narc generally speaking if it
has a clinic or notify nog is amazed he
or already finishing some API testing
currently he just wanted to notify other
parties to go forward or just won't
notify the server he was finished or hey
Pascal and it crashed so let's see how
to use a bow straight API to counter to
seperated has declined either Forrester
testicle anyone and it has a can't you
call connected function to connect to
our active server then the client cannot
test the kind of one core which knock
the knock event is wait tube has a kind
one so our server during the test Lenny
- waitin wait nest and the test can be
conducted he cannot go forward to the
next step
now the test decline to finish some API
testing now he does the call notify
knock the knocker event in the Senate to
server and hours of our board casting
this event to all connected test plans
the tester now has a kind of one called
Anna you went and compared even he was
waiting okay it occurred so now the
chance of the canal one become unlocked
so let me let's let's see how to use
about corresponding phone which notify
mechanism to control a packhorse
increase from about WebRTC peer-to-peer
scenario at the freezer Alice and a bob
collector ITF server and honest and the
Barbican forward the next step is a
which knock the knock event instead a
test so the test server now check the or
connect the check the test client status
from okay or test Klein eclectic so he
notified knock okay yo guys can start
testing now senator status the anise and
Barbra call forward and the purpose side
hit the next step is still called which
knock and and inside his begin testing
API
he called in white that is our test API
send invitations through the peer server
to Bob at the same time and it's called
notify nog Sinha notify event to Bob
through our IT server and i bob side
coordinate knocking evened it compared
to the event he would wait it so he can
call he can go forward he maybe check
some corresponding even checking is
correct or not and now Bob is active and
Annie's next step is call which knock so
anise is knocked and Bob is active that
is how to control
separates API for work so there's
another demo will show how to use ITF -
tester peer-to-peer Sandero this in
error is through two separate Android
device okay anyone play okay okay begin
testing now the first device beginning
clang - okay
create a no-go string post an eclair no
string and a share to each other and the
one-sided way you store a real camera
and another sign is a virtual camera
okay okay here is the another demo is
the master page formats nice is if you
want tested the concrete scenarios that
has the our MCU scenarios different plan
form different browser your files and
all the chrome claw get to our MSU
server and a sub squad makes the stream
from the server okay we can see the GS
SDK running faster to end your site okay
wait just wait for and your side finish
the test okay okay
okay
wait finish so now question very good
yeah that was very impressive so first
question can this framework be used to
test other apps not web RTC how does yes
yes if you you test a scenario need set
has covers different program and
different platform maybe need a car
ordinary between each other or can use
our framework because our from not
developer the API from work with just
the making you can use the your own so
the party API test from worker to
integrate our Frank mega Jenkins with
just them how to say the wrong time
maybe something like that magazine can
call communication to each other can
come ordinary to each other to finish
your bow scenario how do you test for
security and vulnerabilities security
kinda no we do not care about a security
because way that is in this framework
care I think maybe another but our
protecting maybe he's neither security
testing but not in this form work you
can let someone else worry about
security what happens if a client that
is active crashes in the lock time out
yeah not a guru question in fact if we
in fact during the testing sometimes
such as an Android phone as a connecting
a part of in fact that he's crashed so
way
have a how to say to never to detect
this crash the first level because
always soccer I'll command if the
circuit I command it is a disconnect
we will trick that this character you
want so the server we have got ok Nanak
NIDA is is died and if you do not if the
another sim which every knock even have
a timeout if the after that timeout is
reached we still do not call the
feedback wasting another device is
crushed mhm
ok any questions in the room
ok I'll keep going
do you use containers or something else
for building and cleaning the
environments in fact in factor for the
condemned the environment our testing
environment include Assad has shut down
the Android device or southern iOS
immature or shut down the running tests
the browser we always used to check the
Congress bounding the process and a
clear data process to make sure the next
test cases have a clean environment we
do not use the containers mm-hmm ok what
about performance testing in fact our
performance testing in 2.0 sedation work
we have another framework if you guys
have an interesting maybe way maybe I
have another vote today
ok ok
and just raise your hand in the room if
you have a question I think we have like
two time for two more questions what
benefit does this orchestrated
concurrent framework have over other
cross-language type frameworks other
it's got a cool yes in fact and don't
know and even compared to other concrete
from work better for us we just just
want we design philosophy is different
with the stove under existing a pet has
a firm work and communication to each
other and we do not ran out on the UI
application in fact I'm set other
concretely from work maybe neither you
have a final application you have a UI
you want to chatter the button we do not
any - mm-hmm okay we're great
I think that's a hard time and thank you
again thank you excellent thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
