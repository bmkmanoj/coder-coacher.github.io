today we're privileged to have with us
dr. carolyn porco who is the leader of
the imaging science team on the Cassini
mission and she is also an imaging
scientist for the New Horizons mission
which is also post that she held as well
for the Voyager mission she's received
her doctorate degree from the California
Institute of Technology in the division
of geological and Planetary Sciences and
she's a tunnel tenured faculty member
with the University of Arizona she's the
editor and creator of the Cassini team
Cyclops website which is where you can
view images from the cassini mission and
she's also the CEO of diamond sky
productions a small company dedicated to
the artful and useful use of planetary
images asteroid number 7231 is named in
her honor and she's responsible for
sending the comains of renowned
planetary geologist eugene Schumacher to
the moon please join me in welcoming dr.
Porco thank you very much is there any
way we can lower the lights in this room
because the pictures will look so much
better if the lights could be lowered
Thank You Leslie for that introduction I
just want to say up in ever since the
ted conference i don't know if you guys
know about the ted conference you must
because it sort of happens in your
backyard where i met Larry and Sergey
and I got invited to come to give a talk
here I've been really looking forward to
coming here and and this place is kind
of legendary the cafes are legendary and
I've now sampled the cafes I know what
that's all about and there's something I
know is going to be legendary soon and I
just sampled it but I never knew about
it and that is your heated toilet seats
you do realize the rest of the world
doesn't live like that okay and I can
tell you that's one perk you're not
going to find at NASA so anyway it's a
thrill it's even more of a thrill than I
thought but to be here I feel that I
have lived a charmed existence to have
grown up during a time when I did I was
a young girl when our country became a
spacefaring nation and images from the
moon and Venus and Mars were being sent
back to earth and being published in the
newspapers of New York which is where I
grew up I was a teenager when Neil
Armstrong first walked on the moon in
1969 I was a young graduate student when
the Viking spacecraft landed on Mars in
1976 and I was a senior graduate student
when the voyager spacecraft first flew
by Saturn in the early 1980s and I a
newly minted PhD I became a part of the
Voyager imaging team 1984 83 and
participated in our first reconnaissance
of the planets Uranus and Neptune and
now I'm extraordinarily privileged to be
part of one of the most dazzling
interplanetary endeavors we have uh
never undertaken and I've got as far as
I'm concerned the best job in the whole
inner solar system I am the leader of
the imaging team on Cassini we are
responsible for taking all those lovely
images of Saturn that you've seen over
the last several years and these
missions of exploration that humankind
has been undertaking for the last 50
years I think you would agree are all
part of a much larger human quest or
human voyage to come to understand
something about our origins and how our
planet and we living on it came to be
and one of the most promising places we
could hope to explore in our solar
system and answer to those questions is
the Saturn system because Saturn with
its complex
system subsystems if you will of
atmosphere magnetosphere rings and moons
all interacting provides the ideal
destination for studying many of the
same physical processes that planetary
scientists today believe were
responsible for the formation of the
solar system and are responsible and
ongoing today for the present-day
dynamics of our solar system and solar
systems around other stars that are
being discovered in our galaxy so aside
from offering splendor and beauty beyond
compare Saturn is one planetary system
whose exploration offers enormous cosmic
reach we of course had been to Saturn
with the Pioneer spacecraft and the
voyages in the early 1980s but our
investigation of this planetary system
began an exquisite detail when in the
summer of 2004 the Cassini spacecraft
flawlessly guide glided into orbit
around Saturn and became at that point
the farthest robotic outpost that
humanity had ever established around the
Sun and for me our return to this
particular planetary system is not only
part of but also a metaphor for that
grander human voyage to come to
understand the interconnectedness of
everything surrounding us so I'm
thrilled to be able to tell you this
afternoon to take you show you how that
that particular this particular leg of
this voyage is grand voyage through the
Saturn system as Cassini is revealing it
to us is how Saturn and everything
around it has been shown to us over the
last 1000 days that Cassini has been in
orbit and to give you a sense in a
decidedly visual one at that for how
this very major exploratory expedition
that Cassini and we are presently
conducting around Saturn is unfolding
the first obvious example of cosmic
reach of course of Saturn's rings they
are a
they're the reason why Saturn is the
icon it is among planets in our solar
system the Rings are a tremendous visual
spectacle they are two hundred eighty
thousand kilometers across that is about
one light-second they would fit in
nicely between the earth and the moon
and they consist of countless orbiting
bodies this is ice particles ranging in
size from the finest know you might ski
on in Utah all the way to the sizes of
small apartment buildings screaming
around Saturn at tens of thousands of
miles per hour yet only very gently
jostling each other they only collide if
and when they do at a few millimeters
per second they are what physicists call
a very equilibrated system any violent
collisions in the system died out a long
time ago and because of that they are
tremendously thin there only one two
three stories in a modern day building
their paper thin they trace out there
very mathematically precise they trace
out the plane of gravitational
equilibrium around the planet and
despite their visual enormity they
contain in fact comparatively speaking
very little mass if you took all the
mass in Saturn's rings and recomposed it
back into a small moon of the proper
density it would be no bigger than this
little moon here and sell it is so a lot
of visual display for very little mass
is there a laser pointer I can get a
hold of somebody okay the processes that
are ongoing in this disk okay that one
thank you there's 47 buttons on this I
hope I hit the right one by the way
these are the shadows of the Rings cast
on the northern hemisphere of the planet
and the processes that are ongoing in
this disk of material are believed to be
similar or identical to the ones that
went on in the nebula from which the Sun
and the planets form this is shown here
in this artist's rendition end in disks
that we are presently seeing around
other stars this is a Hubble Space
Telescope picture of a proto stellar
disk around a very young M dwarf star
and then reaching a trillion times
larger the same processes we see going
on in Saturn's rings occur in the discs
of dust and gas and stars that are the
spiral that are the spiral galaxies so
there is a great deal to be learned in
studying Saturn's rings about disc
systems all throughout the cosmos and in
this sense what we are learning and hope
to learn further with Cassini is truly
universal the Rings exhibit an enormous
variety of structure discovered a long
time ago when the voyages first flew by
we didn't understand where most of it
came from and we're only now getting
glimmers of it with Cassini they break
down some of you may already know into
three main elements this is the a the B
in the C ring the B ring is the most
massive it's the dentist it casts the
deepest darkest shadows on the planet
it's where a lot of this structure is
that we are having a hard time
understanding the a ring is a little bit
more transparent is punctuated by
gravity-driven features that are driven
by the gravity of orbiting moons and
then here is the C ring which is very
diaphanous and is actually populated by
these brought very sharp edge plateaus
of material again we don't know exactly
why we don't know in fact at all why
those plateaus exist and so the subtle
colorations you see here are due to the
contamination of basically what is water
ice by very small amounts she's me other
materials and we're in the process of
working out with the compositions of
that material what the composition is so
Saturn is as you know very far away it's
ten times farther away from the Sun and
the earth is and the Cassini spacecraft
at launch was very massive it with six
metric tons and even launching Cassini
on the largest launch vehicle that we
had at the time which was a Titan for
adding solid rocket motors to it's
trapping those on and putting Cassini on
top of a centaur upper stage this was
about as much you know power as weak
throw at the thing that still wasn't
enough to get Cassini because it was so
massive directly to Saturn so we had to
loop it around the inner solar system
twice we had to send it by Venus twice
we had to send it by the earth once and
then finally on the eve of the year two
thousand and one which I thought was
tremendously poetic we sent it by
Jupiter for a final push on to Saturn
now understand that the object of this
exercise is to get the spacecraft to its
target as quickly as possible so that
those of us who are involved in a
mission is still alive by the time the
spacecraft gets there but that means
that by the time it gets there it is
hauling okay and we actually have to
slow it down in order to allow it to get
captured into Saturn orbit and that was
done in a 90-minute maneuver shown here
in an artist's depiction where we
basically threw the engines in Reverse
actually we didn't do that we just
turned the spacecraft around and we we
burned half of the mass at launch of
Cassini was fuel that was burned in this
maneuver to slow it down okay we didn't
slow the speed down we actually slowed
the acceleration down to allow it to get
captured into orbit and so this maneuver
brought us closer to the Rings than we
had ever been before we'll ever get
again very likely never be as close as
we were during this maneuver ever again
in the course of the mission and so the
scientists for years were clamoring to
be allowed this opportunity to take data
when we were cruising over the Rings and
that's in fact what we did we collected
a beautiful collection of images of the
highest resolution we've ever had on the
Rings and we saw many things I don't
have the time to show you all of them
one thing we saw a lot of was waves in
this picture the smallest thing you
could see the tiniest little pixel there
is only a couple hundred a couple of
several hundred meters so just several
football fields okay these are waves
these are the fingerprints of orbiting
moons that are perturbing the ring
particles you see here something called
a density wave this is where the
perturbed non circular orbits of the
ring particles are all phased in such a
way is to give rise to these regions of
higher than average concentrations of
particles
which in fact spiral all the way around
the planet these are spiral density
waves we're looking incidentally on the
dark side of the Rings so what you see
here is dark is actually bright on them
if you saw it on the lit side so the
highest concentration here the dark
regions they spiral around the planet
these are the kissing cousins of the
spiral arms you see in galaxies same
mathematics was co-opted from galactic
structure the physics of galactic
structure and applied to Saturn's rings
too in fact predict that when Voyager
got there in the early 1980s it would
find these features and in fact it did
with Cassini we got just a very much
better look these are bending waves
these are the vertical equivalent of
density waves this is where it's not the
eccentricities of the orbits that are
perturbed it's the inclinations and so
this is a feature where there are crests
this is like corrugated cardboard the
whole ring plane is warped like
corrugated cardboard and the crests
spiral around the planet okay again
these are due to the perturbations of
orbiting moons this was on the dark side
on the when we crossed over the Rings
and pass on to the lit side and then
turned around and looked up at the Rings
as we were receding we saw these kinds
of things lower resolution picture by
about a factor of 3 but still you could
see lots of waves lots of waves you even
see this thing corduroy structure this
is the perturbations of a moon orbiting
actually within the Rings so lots of
phenomena we got a very good look at
with these pictures and one thing one
remarkable and very telling discovery we
made in this collection of images are
these little propeller features okay
these are the beginnings of gaps that
are being made in the Rings by bigger
than average particles they're about
several kilometers across a few hundred
meters a few hundred meters wide the
pixel scale here is the highest that
ever got for us this is like a half a
football field for pixel and so from the
dimensions of these features we can tell
the size of the bodies that are making
these incipient gaps and they look to be
something like 20 to 60 meters in radius
so
it is a little bit bigger several times
bigger than the largest particle size
okay and this one observation has given
us insight into the particle size
distribution in the Rings and also will
eventually tell us something about the
way the Rings evolved but there are even
bigger bodies that are embedded within
the rings of course and they're having
dramatic and more obvious effects on the
Rings this is the out this is the a ring
this is the famous efrain that is
shepherded by to shepherding satellites
called Prometheus and Pandora this gap
is called the inky gap keep this gap in
mind this is called Aquila gap I'll show
you this later this gap is about 300
kilometers wide it is inhabited by a
moon called pan okay in the next pitch
these by the way are all those density
waves that are created by other moons
orbiting Saturn the next picture is
going to show you a high-resolution view
of this that we got during the Saturn
orbit insertion maneuver and there you
see it it's so beautiful it looks
simulated but it's actually a real image
there are ringlets in this gap remember
this is 300 kilometers wide these are
waves in the edges of the gap that are
created by the perturbations of pan it
excites eccentricities in the orbits of
the particles in the Rings and those
eccentricities again they're all
properly phase that they give rise to
this pattern you can see the streamers
spiraling away from this edge also again
the perturbed motions of particles the
perturbed and phased motions of
particles and here's a view we got later
on in the mission of pan this is the
culprit this satellite is about 30
kilometers across the Rings are only a
few tens of meters so you can see it
protruding up and down it's a beautiful
picture it was very thrilling to finally
get a close-up view of pan we also
looked closely at the Gila gap which is
42 kilometers across and we discovered
deafness this is a little moon only
eight kilometers across it's doing the
same thing on the edges of it it's gaps
it's it's gap it's raising waves and the
study of these systems a moon in a gap
and a disk of material
though i should say these systems
provide the best analogs we have
available to us in our solar system for
the systems that are being discovered at
nowadays every day that is growing
planets or protoplanets in stars in
disks around other stars and the study
of the manner in which these bodies like
pan or deafness open up a gap in their
disk and keep the material at bay
through their gravitational interactions
is going to prove very fruitful for the
study for investigations concerning
planet formation understanding how for
example Jupiter a planet like Jupiter
growing out of the solar nebula
accreting material little by little
getting bigger and bigger finally comes
to get so big it truncates its own
growth by opening up a gap now one of
our main objectives was also to
determine the physical characteristics
of moons that were orbiting near but
near the Rings and also to the physical
characteristics of any moons that we
might discover because we were
suspecting that their physical
characteristics would tell us something
about their origins and that's in fact
exactly what we've done this work has
gone on in my group in Boulder Colorado
and let me first pause here and tell you
our general notions about how rings come
about in case you don't know the common
wisdom says that there was a body very
likely a pre-existing moon in orbit
around Saturn that got bashed up by an
incoming projectile and that material
eventually spread out to form a ring
it's just a simple predictable physical
process it spreads out the former ring
there are collisions the collisions are
very elastic they grind down the
particles but they also flatten the
system into a ring okay a ring that is
as I said
inhabits the the the equator plane of
the planet okay another idea is that the
body that the progenitor body that forms
the Rings make a maybe came in from afar
maybe it was a body that came in from
the Kuiper belt but anyway the idea is a
catastrophic disruption of a
pre-existing body material gets swept up
and encircles the planet well over the
last three years we've accumulated
enough information on the ringed moons
like pan like Daphne's and also like
Atlas this is a body orbiting outside
the outer edge of the a ring this is the
Keeler gap this also is about the size
of pan 30 kilometers across looks like a
flying saucer and also Pandora this is
bigger 81 kilometers across this is one
of the F ring shepherds okay we have now
information on the sizes the shapes the
orbits of these bodies even their masses
and their densities and putting all this
together we have found that these bodies
are shaped like you would expect for a
body formed by accretion so in and of
themselves they are not the remnants of
this collision that formed the Rings but
we think instead that they have grown
around a denser core and that denser
core may be something that dates all the
way back to the original creation of the
Rings so we're getting glimpses of the
chronology of events in the Saturn ring
moon system from Cassini so far and
speaking of moons Saturn is accompanied
by a very large and diverse collection
of them now there's something like fifty
seven moons there may even be more
because I only looked about a month ago
they're being discovered all the time
they range in size from a few kilometers
across to Titan which is Saturn's
largest moon it's as big across as the
US and it's the inner collection of
moons which go out to only a few million
kilometers from Saturn that is the
system that's being investigated by
Cassini in this system is a particular
interest because it is believed because
these moons are all in orbit in the same
plane they're all orbiting in the same
direction around a
big massive central body they are like a
miniature solar system and so we out
goals and studying the Saturn satellite
system this particular component of it
we're not only to come away with
accurate measures of their compositions
and their physical characteristics not
only to further our understanding of
their geological histories and their
thermal histories and so on but also to
study the system as a whole with an eye
towards testing our ideas about
planetary formation both the formation
of our own planets and others we are
discovering today now the Cassini tour
through the Saturn system is
unprecedented it's an enormous in
magnitude calls for 80 to close
satellite flybys within four years all
of them are closer than the flybys that
were conducted by voyager 44 of those
are of titan alone and the remainder of
them were flybys of this handful of
medium-sized moons that are as i said
within a few million kilometers of
Saturn and some of these flybys were
exquisitely close they flew as close to
these moons as the space station flies
above the earth and most of these
exquisitely close flybys were conducted
in the year two thousand and five I
called that the year of the moon that's
when we came up close and personal to
all of these and have come away with
have discovered some remarkable things
about their geology's and physical
characteristics and we've certainly if
you've been paying attention seeing that
we've returned some fantastic images
this is Tet this a moon that's about a
thousand kilometers across that's about
600 miles sports some amazing basins
mounted surface here's it's shown with
the Rings in the background one of our
beautiful images this is ray of fifty
percent bigger than thethis so 1500
kilometers across that's about a
thousand miles okay so we're talking
about something maybe the size of the
south where
us this is raya hiding behind the rings
this is one of our beautiful pictures of
do knee this is about the size of
tempest again about a thousand
kilometers across seen against the globe
of Saturn with the Rings in the
foreground here's another view of dyani
okay taking it very high phase angle as
the Sun was either rising or setting I
don't remember and then here's a
close-up of that okay now I don't know
about you but this calls out for an
astronaut doesn't it don't you want to
see an astronaut walking across the
surface of that actually you wouldn't be
able to resolve an astronaut because the
tyent the smallest pixel here is about a
100 meters so that's about a football
field across this is actually a very big
very large crater and then here's our
death star moon Mimas okay two and a
half times smaller than do knee and then
smaller again about two times smaller
than or have half the size of me misses
Hyperion looking like a great cosmic
sponge and then finally oops i'm going
to show you I app it is my advocacy is a
moon that's half the size of our moon
it's about the size of Raya 1,500 1,400
kilometers across and we have found some
fantastic geology on my appetizers you
can see this is the moon that's half
black on one side half white on the
other have the black and black and white
and here you can see this amazing
landslide at the bottom of a
15-kilometer high cliff okay so it's not
out of the question in my mind that
someday your descendants might be taking
extreme excursions into the Saturn
system and climbing ice climbing on the
cliffs of Iapetus and I envy them I
should say that all of these moons are
made out of water ice that's the most
abundant material in the Saturn system
in the saturn satellite system and water
in at these temperatures is a rock
forming minerals so they're mostly water
ice now you don't have to look too
far whoops on or I should say all you
have to do is look at the created
surface of these bodies to know that
there was a time many many years ago the
early history of the solar system when
there were great many bodies careening
around the solar system and smashing
headlong into the planets and the
forming satellites at tremendous speeds
and these collisions did a great deal to
actually build our solar system and make
it look like it does today they were
responsible for allowing the planets
first and foremost to grow to their
present size it was comet Esmil small
comet like bodies that made up your own
ass at Neptune for example it was a
collision that was responsible for
tilting Uranus on its side it was a
collision with a mars-sized object that
actually created our moon is the soon
after the earth formed a mars-sized
object came and collided with the earth
and pulverized the outer layer throwing
it into space from whence the moon that
material collected in the moon formed
and as I showed you collisions are
responsible for smashing up satellites
and creating ring systems so collisions
in fact are the creators of worlds and
they are the destroyers of worlds and
don't forget it was a collision that
wiped out the dinosaurs and cleared the
way for the eventual development and
evolution of the primates of which we
like to think that humans are the
culmination well put it another way
we've been very hard to invent Google
with the Tyrannosaurus Rex breathing
down your neck so collisions have
actually done a great deal for us and
they have been a tremendous process of
force and sculpting the solar system and
the craters that they create on the
surfaces of these bodies can actually be
studied and examine their morphologies
can be examined to give us information
about the properties of the material
into which they've been placed and to
understand something of the chronology
of events in the Saturn system if you
look at the distribution of craters and
you know something about the projectile
population you can say something about
the order of events that things happened
in this in the system I don't have the
time to go through all that we are
learning
about that right now but i am going to
concentrate on two moons in particular
which have stood out over the last
thousand days and they are Titan which
is Saturn's largest moon about fifty
percent larger than our Moon and then
Enceladus which is a tenth the size of
Titan now Titan has long intrigued
planetary scientists and it's before
Cassini arrived there it was the
greatest single expanse of unexplored
terrain that we had left in our solar
system and was believed to be in many
respects more like its environment
surface environment was it was believed
to be more like the Earth's than any
other that we have in the solar system
like the Earth's its atmosphere is very
thick and it consists largely of
molecular nitrogen like the Earth's its
thermal structure consists of a
troposphere where the temperature
decreases as you go up and then a
stratosphere where you turn around and
the temperature increases as you go
further up like Earth's its atmosphere
has a mild greenhouse effect near the
surface so it surfaces some 20 degrees
warmer than it would be otherwise but
its atmosphere lacks free oxygen and it
is suffused with small but significant
amounts of methane and ethane and
propane and other simple organic
materials containing hydrogen and carbon
which we call hydrocarbons and for all
these reasons titan's atmosphere was
believed to be an analog or at least the
closest analogue we would ever find in
our solar system to the atmosphere that
scientists believe existed on the
surface of the earth prior to the
emergence of life and that's not all the
compounds the organic materials in the
atmosphere form a ubiquitous haze that
is formed by the way from the breakup of
methane high in the atmosphere
separating the carbon and the hydrogen's
the carbons joined together they create
these polymers with which end up being
hazed particles
those haze particles it was suspected
would grow over time and they would fall
over the years over billions of years
they would fall or at least as long as
Titan had an atmosphere would fall down
to the surface and possibly coat the
surface with an organic sludge okay and
some of these compounds methane and
ethane in particular could be liquid at
the surface of Titan despite the
unimaginable cold of minus 300 degrees
Fahrenheit in fact what water does on
earth Titan methane doesn't tighten it
can be in the form of a solid a liquid
or a vapor so all of this opened up a
world literally of bizarre possibilities
first of all you have hundreds of
kilometers of globe envelope in hays
okay surrounding Titan making its days
dark high noon on Titan is as dark as
deep earth Twilight here is is here on
the earth we could have patchy methane
clouds floating above the surface and in
places we might have rain gentle methane
rains falling slowly because the gravity
is less than it is here on earth and
these rains over time could cut gullies
they could form deep canyons they could
form rivers and cataracts and cut
canyons and wash the sludge perhaps off
the high mountains and into having the
drain into low-lying basins and craters
so stop and imagine this environment for
a while you're standing on Titan a moon
in the outer solar system you're
standing on an icy surface a water ice
surface it's very dark it's broad
daylight but it's dark it's cold
impossibly cold it's misty and before
you lies Lake Michigan brimming with
paint thinner okay that is what we
thought existed under the clouds of
under the haze of Titan before Cassini
got there so it was with tremendous
anticipation that we looked forward to
Cassini's exploration of Titan and what
we have haven't
fact found on Titan though different in
detail is every bit as fascinating as
the story that I just described to you
and for those of us involved in this
mission it's been like a Jules Verne
adventure come true titan's atmosphere
is in fact very thick you can clearly
and beautifully see that in this image
that is backlit by the Sun and you can
see the brings and another moon in the
background and just one of another of
our tremendously gorgeous images that
we're taking around Saturn right now but
despite the haze and the impenetrable
atmosphere we do have instruments on
Cassini that can see down to the surface
we outfitted our cameras with filters
that allow us to see in the
near-infrared through spectral channels
that actually allow light to penetrate
through the atmosphere and also there is
a radar instrument on Cassini which is
virtually identical to the instrument
that mapped the surface of Venus with
the Magellan spacecraft in the early
1990s and with all of these we have
finally been able to reckon or the
surface of Titan if you will and open up
this previously unexplored terrain to
view and here's what we first saw of the
surface of Titan from the Cassini
orbiter first you can see bright and you
can see dark okay and that's what it
look like to us not exactly easy to
interpret for planetary geologist to
look at an image like this the first
thing they see is something linear this
looks linear this looks basically linear
that says tectonics there is something
there that's cracking the surface in a
linear fashion like the San Andreas
Fault okay we looked on the other side
of Titan okay I'll excuse me this is a
higher resolution view of the same thing
I just showed you so we see circular
things we don't see too many circular
things okay circular things are craters
we think maybe craters maybe they're
calderas maybe they're volcanoes not
really sure this looks like a caldera we
see things that look like they flowed we
see what we called pull apart features
things that looked tectonically ripped
apart but very hard to
we do see black we do see white then we
look at the other side of Titan we see
again bright and dark even though we
weren't quite sure what we were talking
about we started to call these things
Islands because they looked like Islands
but we didn't know with a regions that
were higher than the surroundings were
they lower than the surroundings we had
no clue it's always a hazy day on Titan
okay so there's no shadows without
shadows it is very difficult to tell
what's up and what's down and so that
left us really bereft of definitive
explanations and there was nothing that
was so unambiguous so clearly a product
of feature or a pattern that we had seen
on earth that we could say up we
understand this we were really at a loss
to know but we did see again on this
side we saw some things that look like
craters and again I said we call these
things Islands we got to call in as
Great Britain this was Ireland this was
France this was Iberia this was
Peloponnesian a geography is not quite
right but it didn't bother us we saw
things that look like they will win
swept okay but not much not much else we
could say but then a remarkable event
happened and it was one that we knew
would be the rosetta stone and help us
interpret our images that we were taking
from orbit and that was about six months
after getting into Saturn orbit came
what many regard is the highlight of
Cassini's explorations of Titan a flying
saucer shaped device which had been
carried by Cassini for seven years was
deployed to the Titan atmosphere and
successfully drifted on a piece of
fabric for two and a half hours through
the hazy atmosphere and came to land on
its surface this was that the deployment
and mission of the Huygens probe the
European built Huygens probe and this I
can tell you was a positively
extraordinary achievement and for those
of us in Darmstadt Germany at the
European Space Operations Center where
this event was monitored it was a very
emotional event it was the day that
humans had landed a device of their own
making in the outer solar system it was
like living science fiction and it I've
come to call this a grown men crying
kind of day because grown men were
disappearing into corners to have their
own little private moments during this
event so that they wouldn't get busted
by their colleagues being seen losing it
because of the you know the overwhelming
emotion of the whole event and it was to
me a an event that was so significant it
should have been celebrated with ticker
tape parades in every city across the US
and Europe and unfortunately that didn't
happen but it was extraordinary for
another reason and that's because the
celebratory presentations during this
event were given in just a host of
accents the English was used but they
were given in English accents and
American accents and French accents and
Dutch and Italian and German accents it
was in fact for me a moving
demonstration of what the words united
nations are supposed to mean and that is
a group of nations joined in a common
cause and in this case it was a massive
undertaking to explore a planetary
system that for all of human history had
been unreachable and now humans had
touched it with something of their own
making it was a very remarkable and
historical day and certainly a day that
I'm not likely to forget I don't think
anyone there will forget it but anyway I
digress the probe the probe took many
measurements of the atmosphere on its
two and a half hour descent down to the
surface including panoramic images and
it's hard to describe what it was like
to see those first images that were
released for public consumption because
it was a shock and this is what we saw
okay this is a mosaic in fact of images
that were taken as the probe descended
and we saw this region here okay and it
was shockingly easy to interpret it was
as you can see a drainage pattern
I could only be produced by a flowing
liquid in fact you can follow the
channels in this drainage pattern and
they actually move away from this
boundary and fall and go down here and
join this tributary and they all drain
into this region right here okay we know
from stereo images taken during this
descent you're looking at something here
that's hi this is about 100 meters
higher than this area the next picture
is just this by the way is taken at 16
kilometers up this picture is taken at
eight kilometers up okay you're looking
at a shoreline okay we weren't sure at
this point was this liquid okay but
you're looking at something that looks
like a shoreline okay now bear in mind
and Islands offshore islands okay bear
in mind 16 kilometers eight kilometers
that's roughly airliner altitude if you
were going to take it in an airline
there in an airplane and fly from San
Francisco to New York you would be
flying at something like 12 11 or 12
kilometers altitude okay so this is the
view you would have out the window of
titanium airlines as you flew across the
surface of Titan and maybe someday
someone will actually get the chance to
do that but anyway all in all I think oh
excuse me and then here finally is the
picture that we collected on the surface
of the Huygens probe took once it landed
okay you can see the horizon in the
background you could see boulders in the
front but they look big but they're
actually no bigger than about 6-12
inches across so they're like stones
almost certainly made out of water ice
these are again stones they look or
pebbles they look very well sorted the
idea is that probably some liquid flute
flowed across this surface at one time
and sorted all these these stones and
pebbles but the probe landed not in
liquid it landed in what is the
equivalent of a Titan mudflat an
unconsolidated ground that is suffused
with liquid methane and very likely made
of the accumulation of the organic
matter that I
falls out of the sky and probably
accumulated in low-lying depressions on
the surface very much like what had been
expected so all told the Huygens mission
was a glorious success in a triumph and
gave us the kind of ground truth that
helped us and is helping us still
interpret our images from orbit but
still at this point this was early 2005
there were no open bodies of liquid we
thought we'd find lots of liquid on the
surface no open bodies of liquid to be
seen anywhere not from Huygens and not
from the orbiter and still of course the
exploration of Titan continued from
orbit we continue to take pictures and
the radar instrument continued to take
its data and it discovered another
unambiguous pattern in the equatorial
region of Titan it discovered that vast
regions were covered with dunes these
dunes are a hundred meters high there
are several kilometres across they go on
for hundreds and hundreds of miles
there's a region that is covered 1,500
kilometers worth of surface areas cover
a surface extent around the equator is
covered with these dunes okay this is an
enormous geological feature on the
surface of Titan and it indicates steady
bi-directional flow of wind or else you
wouldn't get dunes like this and
obviously conditions that are dry enough
to loft particles that's how you create
dunes so no no not only no bodies of
liquid very dry conditions so a great
puzzle we didn't see any liquid we're
still looking for it finally Cassini got
to investigate the polar regions this
was taken picture was taken of the south
polar region that's what this cross is
here and this was the closest we got at
this point to something that looked like
a lake okay it has a shoreline that
looks like it could be Lake a very dark
material inside okay if you fly over
Minnesota and look down at the lakes
they look black okay
so we thought this was probably the
closest we've come to to a lake feature
we thought these other this region here
was dotted maybe with lakes this was
like a lake district actually this is in
absolute size the size of Lake Victoria
but if you scale it relative to the
surface area of Titan which is much
smaller it's more like the size of the
Black Sea on the earth okay so this is
what we saw in the south polar region
but we didn't have any definitive
evidence that this was liquid it could
easily have been argued this is just a
residue maybe there was liquid there at
one point it evaporated this is the
residue that's left behind we didn't
have any definitive evidence and then we
looked in the north polar region just
this past februari and this is what we
saw this is our imaging data and you
could see these regions this is a cloud
feature you could see these dark areas
here okay they look again like features
we saw in the south one of them is very
large it's as large in fact if you scale
it as large as the Mediterranean Sea and
then the radar got images that overlap
and they are interpreting these dark
areas to be liquid because they're the
darkest things that they see with the
radar data so you are looking here at
where it appears the liquids have gone
on Titan these are hydrocarbons we think
you could see some of these shorelines
look like the coast of Maine and not
only do we see big areas lots of big
bodies but we see also smaller regions
excuse me a region that has smaller
features in it that look like the Lake
District that we saw in the south and
here we're cruising over the radar data
here and this is the pole so it appears
that the liquids on Titan at least
during the present season which is
southern summer northern winter have
migrated to the polls and why that
should be the case we don't know
probably says something significant
though about the meteorology of Titan
but all told we have found on
I think you would agree a very
remarkable and even mystical place one
that is exotic an alien but also
strangely earth-like in its geological
formations and processes and just a
fascinating place whose geologic
diversity and complexity and richness is
rivaled by no other body in the solar
system except the earth itself and we
will see more of Titan in the next
thousand days of the Cassini mission but
now in this tale of two moons that I'm
telling you we move on to Enceladus and
Enceladus is very much smaller a tenth
the size of Titan very bright very white
in fact the brightest whitest object we
have in our solar system it's no bigger
than England or the Great Britain and I
don't mean this to be a threat just as a
for size comparison but despite its size
what we have found on and sellers with
Cassini has completely thrown us for a
loop first from a close examination of
its surface and I'm just going to show
you a picture now where the resolution
is ten times better than it is here we
can see a surface that doesn't look at
all like the crater the heavily cratered
surfaces of the other moons this is a
body that has obviously been
geologically active in the past it is
crisscrossed by tectonic fractures at
wild wild angles eat many generations of
cracks and troughs and ridges and so on
very deep chasms mountain folds and so
on a few craters here and there but
other otherwise a very young very
geologically active place and the mother
lode of all the discoveries that we have
made on Enceladus far and away were
found at the South Pole and you're
looking here this is the South Pole of
Enceladus it is circumscribed by these
mountain folds and characterized or
crossed by these very deep fractures
they're about a hundred and thirty-five
kilometers across just a few kilometers
wide this whole region is youthful
there's no craters obviously
does have tectonic features and folds in
it it is characterized by elevated
temperatures this whole region is warmer
than the rest of Enceladus that would be
as bizarre as finding that the whole of
Antarctic the Antarctic is warmer than
the tropics I don't need the atmosphere
I'm talking about the surface the
fractures here are different in color
because they're different in composition
they are coated with simple organic
materials and then more surprising than
all of that is what we saw when we found
ourselves in a geometry to look back in
the direction of the Sun it's what we
call a high phase geometry it's a
geometry that highlights the presence of
very very fine particles okay and this
is what we saw we saw that the surface
from the South Pole of Enceladus and the
South Pole is right here is emerging
these Jets of very fine particles
extending tens of kilometers into space
and feeding if you take a picture like
this and you process the faint light
levels with color to bring out the
contours the faint light levels this is
what you see these Jets are feeding a
huge plume that extends in fact we see
in other pictures extends tens of
thousands of kilometers away from from
Enceladus so this in fact was quite a
surprise it turns out we know now that
these Jets of particles are accompanied
by water vapor and water vapor that is
laced with simple organic materials okay
the analysis of all this information
other pictures we've taken of the Jets
of Enceladus including the information
gathered by other instruments about the
water composition and the composition of
the organics all of this was put
together by my team and I and we have
reached I wouldn't call it necessarily a
conclusion but we think it is possible
that these Jets are erupting from
subsurface reservoirs of liquid water
okay and if we are correct about this
then we have stumbled upon what I've
called the holy grail of modern day
planetary exploration
that is we found an environment that
contains liquid water organic materials
and excess warmth or in other words an
environment that is conducive possibly
conducive to the presence of living
organisms and I don't think I need to
tell you what the discovery of living
organisms our life and our solar system
should that ever happen what the the
kind of implications that that would
have because if we could demonstrate
that life had arisen not once but twice
independently in our solar system then
we can infer that it has occurred a
staggering number of times throughout
the 13.7 billion year history of the
universe Cassini of course can see
continues to orbit Saturn it obeys our
every command it's returning magnificent
image after beautiful image of a
planetary system that I think you would
agree now is rich in beauty and
otherworldly phenomena and I don't think
I have to convince the inventors of
Google Earth of the value of images of
planetary bodies and of the culture
shifting power of images our space
program has led the world and taking
such images and images that have become
cultural icons and I'm going to remind
you of a couple of them those of you who
were alert and coherent during the
1960's I don't know if any of you were
even alive during the 1960's I was
you'll remember this famous picture
taken by the Apollo 11 Apollo 8
astronauts December 29 1968 and this was
a picture that had an enormous impact on
on Earthlings and on our perspective of
our cosmic place and our responsibility
for stewardship of our own planet I
think it's even credited with adding
impetus to the environmental movement
during the 60s well eight months ago we
on Cassini I'm very proud to say caught
sight of something again that no human
had ever seen before it was a total
eclipse of the Sun
seen from the other side of Saturn okay
and you can see in this gorgeous image
the main rings highlighted back lit by
the Sun you can see the refracted image
of the Sun this is the light being vent
around Saturn by the atmosphere you can
see this the whole system is encircled
in this beautiful blue ring which is
coincident with the orbit of Enceladus
this is a ring that is the result of the
exhalations of Enceladus and if you look
closely enough and as if this weren't
brilliant enough within this impossibly
lovely scene you can spot from a billion
miles across interplanetary space our
own planet Earth cradled in the arms of
Saturn's rings and I think it will be a
long time before we see anything so
moving again I believe that nothing has
greater power to alter and correct our
own impression of ourselves and where we
fit into the scheme of things than
seeing ourselves from afar and capturing
a glimpse of our own little blue ocean
planet in the skies over the world and
that changing mindset that changing
world view may in the end be the
greatest legacy of all our
interplanetary travels and the finest
reward that will ever receive for this
hopefully never ending journey of
discovery that was begun 50 years ago
thank
Leslie what do we do now do I take
questions okay questions are there any
questions can we put the lights up
please yes oh that's a good question
that's that's a 64 million dollar
question people are working hard to try
to figure that out it's could be
outgassing that's the that's the
explanation du jour is that it's being
outcast from the interior in volcanic
eruptions perhaps or somehow and then of
course there are those who like to think
that it's bacteria on the surface of
Titan that can live there and produce
methane that's another maybe not so
popular view but that's still there are
holdouts for that point of view any
other questions yes yes Cyclops org
Cyclops org it stands for Cassini
imaging central laboratory for
operations oh PS see I CL 0 PS o RG
that's where we post all the images that
we take with our cameras yes on this
picture explain
why doesn't the ring why service
continuity
do you mean this yeah well okay okay
first you have to know that this picture
was taken I forget now myself it's
either taken over nine hours or taken
over 6 2-3 hours so the spacecraft was
in slightly different positions when it
was taking and it's a mosaic it's not
one picture lots of pictures have gone
into this so when it was taking this
picture here was in a different position
and I was taking that picture there so
that's why it kind of looks funny there
but you're looking at light you're
looking you're above the Rings the Sun
is below so you're actually looking at
the dark side of the Rings but the
sunlight is filtering through the Rings
and you can see in fact where the Rings
are well before I get into that this is
from here down as the southern
hemisphere of the dark side of Saturn
and that looks bright because the light
is hitting the Rings and shining back
onto the southern part of the planet
okay and then against that bright
southern hemisphere even though it's on
the night side of Saturn you are seeing
the silhouettes of the Rings here so
really this rings here and not lit at
all there's no sunlight here at all but
this is a silhouette so you wouldn't see
any ring anything ring like at all were
it not for the fact that you're seeing a
silhouette okay and then because the
Rings orbit in exactly one plane that
plane intersects the planet right there
so no light is getting is getting there
here
that's the shadow shadow
it's the shadow the shadow of Saturn
cast on the Rings yes
the other guesses what it could be just
a matter of statistics you know yes
right now we're looking at we see the
solar system when Saturn happens to be
the planet that has big rings around it
if estimates of the age of the Rings and
this is were also being being debated
among Cassini scientists right now but
going into Cassini our estimates for the
Rings didn't live longer and weren't
older than about a few hundred million
years old so to just calibrate that back
in the days of the dinosaurs Saturn had
no rings okay we just happen to be
seeing it now when a catastrophic
disruption of a preexisting body or
maybe a capture of a body happened it
got broken apart and it formed rings
there are moons around Neptune that
exist within what we call the Roche
limit that is they're close enough to
Neptune that if they got broken up
tomorrow if all of the moons and that
within that region got broken up
tomorrow they would make a ring that was
comparable to the at least the a ring of
Saturn so it just might be timing when
we happen to be here observing if it's
true that rings are just continually
created eroded created and eroded yes
what's the expected lifetime what
Cassini one ug along in the last episode
right an hour you
okay so the real limit you know you know
is politics it's how much money the
American Congress wants to give us to
continue going literally the spacecraft
is in good health it's stabilized on
gyros and there were four of them one of
them was redundant and I think one of
the remaining three has arthritis a
little bit of arthritis but even if the
gyros went we there's still thrusters we
could turn the spacecraft with thrusters
in that case we're using fuel but that
could still be done so we could still
turn hither and thither and take
pictures fuel is a precious commodity
we're planning the extended mission now
so will almost certainly go through 2010
and then after that we're point will
plant through 2012 almost certainly by
then our budgets will be way down
there's nothing on the horizon that
looks like it's going to limit us
mechanically electrically functioning
functionally it's just how long they'll
provide funding for it to go you know
these these missions have a nasty habit
of not dying they can't even kill the
Mars orbit the Mars rovers I think
they've tried to drive them off cliffs
they won't die what's so yes questions
do not have the camera
just because the light levels are low
aurea like the exposure times can be
short not enough to turn the spacecraft
oh I see I see what you're saying okay
let's do one question at a time because
by the time you ask me the first one
I'll forget the next one all I forget
the first we do pan but not not really
because light levels are low it's
generally we do that when we're flying
so close to a body that the relative
motion would give a smear if we didn't
do that so and Cassini is are an amazing
spacecraft it's been programmed so that
we could say to it point to this
latitude and longitude on this satellite
and keep the boresight pointed there and
it knows that it's supposed to you know
as the thing is turning it does this
okay but for light levels all we have to
do it's like a camera on earth all we do
is keep the shutter open longer and
because the spacecraft is so massive
it's enormously stable so we point it
and it just stays there and we can keep
the spit of the shutters open four
minutes and get beautiful images we
could never do that on Voyager on
Voyager we couldn't expose longer than a
few seconds without getting smear so
it's a tremendous improvement that's one
of the reasons why our pictures look a
lot better than voyage of pictures the
other is that we're using a CCD instead
of a silicon vidicon to a selenium
sulphur excuse me vidicon tube which is
what the Voyager cameras were what's
your second question what's the date
data range back to earth
you have to buffer the adjacent space oh
yeah we have to buffer and I don't
remember the data rate isn't that
ridiculous but I don't remember I don't
even want to say because I'll guess and
I'll get it wrong and this is being
filmed and it'll go out there and I'll
forever be wrong so I won't say yes to
tighten service oh there's lots of
discussion right now about what the next
missions are going to be and there's
even a debate because missions are very
hard to get especially missions of the
type that we are conducting now all the
simple things have been done so missions
now are much more complex they have to
carry much many more instruments okay we
want more data rate we want everything
more more more because we want to just
do a better job the next time we go out
and it takes a long time to get out to
the outer solar system so you don't want
to do it piecemeal you want to send a
nice healthy well equipped vehicle out
there to do what you want it to do so
the big missions are few and far between
and there's always debates about what we
should do next so there's a debate going
on right now should the next big mission
be to the Jovian moon Europa okay which
is believed to have a subsurface ocean
but a notion that has something like 10
kilometers worth of ice around it or
with the results of Cassini now have
brought the whole Saturn system to the
fore as an exciting place and an
important scientific place to go I
should say in a place that's
scientifically important to return to
because of Titan and also because of
Enceladus if we are correct and I have
to say that's a big if we still need to
investigate this and it needs to be
looked at it was a lot more detail if
we're correct that the Jets are erupting
from liquid water then Enceladus has
just jumped to the front of the line in
my opinion as a body of astrobiological
interest in our solar system because all
you have to do I keep I'm fond of saying
this all you have to do is land on the
surface look up and stick your tongue
out and you've got what you came for and
you know wouldn't it be amazing if there
were microbes in those ice particles
okay fresh you know flash frozen
so so that would be an exciting place to
go to to but there's though the people
who want to go to Europa then there's
those of us who think we should be going
back to Enceladus and then there's the
people who think well let's go back to
the Saturn system but we really should
concentrate on Titan so there's just a
lot of debate going on right now yes sir
manned mission there's so much good
science being done by unmanned stuff why
is there this push to send someone to
Mars well okay so I'm a person who
obviously is deep and deeply involved in
the robotic side of things and I'm in
favor of sending humans back into space
I don't know if you read my editorial
that I wrote in The New York Times where
I basically pointed out something we've
all known people have been afraid to say
it but I think it's being said more and
more that the previous 25 years of the
human flight program has been a waste
because we've done nothing but go around
and round in circles okay we abandoned
the Apollo program we abandoned the
Saturn 5 which was the biggest most
powerful vehicle the US had ever built
we could have used it we could have been
way ahead of way ahead of where we are
now in the human exploration of the
solar system had we not done that and it
it did not cost less to go with the
shuttle it cost more in the end so but
there has been always this friction
between the human side and the robotic
side and I'm hoping that maybe soon you
know the twain shall meet and and even
the robotic fans of the robotic
exploration will see the benefit of
having at the very least developing
vehicles that would be powerful enough
to send humans to the moon and mars we
could also use those same launch
vehicles to go out to visit a planetary
system like Saturn we could do very much
more if we had those vehicles I just
told you that the tortured path we had
to take to get Cassini six metric tons
to get the Cassini to Saturn okay well
we could have done we could have if we
were going to take a path like that but
had a much larger launch vehicle we
could have carried much more than
Cassini we could have carried a Cassini
orbiter we could have carried
a vehicle with on the orbiter a vehicle
that could have landed on the surface of
Enceladus and a balloon that we could
have deployed to the to tighten to
basically get blown around by the winds
and tighten and investigate the surface
that way we could have done so much more
so I would rather not there be this this
dicota some tension this conflict
between the two I think I think that I
could go on and on about this topic okay
the NASA budget is 15 excuse me 16 17
billion dollars that's point six point
five percent of the amount of money that
the federal government spends ok that's
a minut amount of money for the whole
entire agency okay you could double the
NASA budget and it would go unnoticed
okay except for those agencies that
happen to be in direct conflict when it
comes down to budget committees but you
know put put all that aside you could
double the NASA budget it's a tiny
agency it's a tiny budget we are a
wealthy country we could do both yes
it would be difficult because now you're
talking Titan or Enceladus it matters
because Enceladus is closer to Saturn
it's deeper in the gravitational well
once you get into the gravitational well
and that takes energy just I described
for you what we had to do we had to slow
the spacecraft down you have to have to
you actually have to expend energy to
slow down once you get into the
gravitational well and you got to get
out okay so it's difficult to do that
that would not be the very next thing we
do the very next thing we would do is
send capable enough instrumentation
there to make the kinds of measurements
we think we need to make if you're
talking about Enceladus we'd want to
investigate the properties of the
organic materials what's called a
handedness of it to see if it's organics
that has has had any biological
processing done to it that kind of thing
yes yes
Plus who are alive with the first Mars
flybys where you lookin sit up nothing
there was like a move realized advisor
various leading and frustrating session
over the artists pro
do it now we're going to be dead by the
time it ever happens I mean it you know
there's something that no I mean that's
somewhat of a joke but there's something
to be said for flybys because what would
you know you you do have to recognize it
applies you're going to before you
actually be free to even know what kind
of instrumentation you want to send
their next so that's it wasn't a foolish
thing to do it would have been nice
would have been nice but it wasn't a
foolish thing to do to fly by it would
be it would be a foolish thing to do now
to send flybys to Uranus and Neptune for
example because we've already done that
the next missions to Uranus and Neptune
in my opinion need to be orbiters yet
there are some people who are saying
well we're never going to get enough
money for orbiters let's do more flybys
you see it's this is the the the bane of
living with limited resources
it's difficult actually I mean when you
say it's difficult just to get out there
and I like what it would be possible if
you had you know enough resources yeah
well why do you say that well it's yeah
you need a big rocket to carry a lot of
fuel and so on that's yeah we don't we
don't have the capability now to do it I
didn't know if that's what you were
saying you know you you don't really
mean is it possible you mean is it
practical is it presently practical no
yes so there so yeah I kind of never
understood about NASA and I continue to
not really understand well I probably
don't either they don't have heated
toilet seats oh that yeah that's a
problem so I noticed that most of these
missions are extremely for obvious
reasons front-loaded in time and
resources and research and then
basically at the end of the day we bet
it all on like one and if we're really
lucky two spacecraft whereas the actual
assembly cost in part cost of the
spacecraft is probably a small part or
in this case probe is a small part of
the entire research budget so why not
launch 10 probes in a five of them break
then well whatever at least we don't
have these incidents like you know we're
trying to approach Mars after a 10-year
project all of a sudden you know English
and metric units get messed up and oh
well there goes ten years and fifty
eight billion dollars okay I think
you're under the wrong impression the
the costs of the vehicles the cost of
building the vehicles the
instrumentation okay the cost of
building all the software and so on that
is used to operate the spacecraft and
the instruments is way more than we have
for research that is the vast bulk I
mean this is this is for the scientists
involved this is always a tremendous
frustration we have we have budgets that
allow us to take pictures archive and
put them in the planetary data system
archive and very little money to
actually do research so that's where all
the money goes oh sorry by research I
meant the whole are Indian engineering
effort of actually designing the
spacecraft in the first place so the
idea would be and maybe I'm totally
wrong here but it just seems that the
cost of the physical craft once you've
done all the engineering work and all
the software design is essentially very
small compared to the entire project so
why not
10 probes instead of one well I think
you may be you may be wrong about that
but but that's a philosophy that had
been followed in in the early days of
NASA there was always redundant
spacecraft because they always expected
one to go belly up but we don't do that
anymore because the spacecraft are
getting more and more complex and there
is some recurring costs for building you
know a second a third and a fourth and
beside you got to operate those two it's
a very expensive I mean it's expensive
in people time and that's really where
all the funding is so yes cost plus
bitch off first first to launch another
craft of exactly the same thing but just
a one line of code change I'm sorry I
don't know the answer I don't know I
don't know the exact number
it's really fast real life
that's right but I didn't hear what you
said it's really what job it's a custom
custom job yeah that's right varies from
well well okay so there were good
intentions the Cassini spacecraft was
supposed to be there was a mission
called cref comet rendezvous asteroid
flyby the craft mission and the Cassini
mission was supposed to be identical
spacecraft it was called the Mariner
mark two spacecraft line they were going
to build lots of these vehicles you
design them and then just send one to
Saturn one to a comment one here and one
there and then as always happens budgets
get cut and sew your back just building
one in fact a craft mission got
cancelled so it's a good concept but I
think it's just because things are
getting more and more complex it ends up
being custom because you only do you
only have the budget for one any other
questions okay well thank you for stays
