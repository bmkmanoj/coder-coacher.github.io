and x talk ready to go oh you'll be
talking about jstestdriver and our
presenter is going to be Jeremy Lin fond
angleman oh please enjoy the talk okay
don't that blow the egg yes oh hi I'm
Jeremy and I'm going to talk about
justice rival and I well good with Jess
era obviously river is a JavaScript test
for now now a well-built was to make
JavaScript unique easy and efficient
because we feel that it's not the case
today so yeah why did we write a gesture
driver well we felt that the existing
JavaScript framework are R Kelly clumsy
first it's like you have to go on the
browser you have to go on that URL and
refresh every time you want to run your
tests also the test results are
displayed in there on that same page so
you can't really access them from
anywhere and that feels weird to have to
go I mean my IDE I'm writing some code
and drying it having fun I'm in the zone
and then I have to go on my browser I
need refresh and wait a few seconds and
that cancer takes you out of the flow
also today Ajax application I mean it's
a lot of JavaScript and and and the code
looks more and more like I mean I want
to say almost like Java code I mean we
have my classes I am writing good code
like I need to test it well and why
don't I write my test the same way as I
write my code and then today that the
well thing is that you have that HTML
Anna is that you always need to put in
place and then what you end up doing is
you find the magic few script tags that
you need maybe some CSS tags to our I
think you need does that those are so
CSS to include in your HTML to to have
nice green and red results when you run
and then you end up copying and pasting
that thing too or you're fightin and
that feels kind of clumsy that that HTML
side again the context switching was
also a big problem for a psych yeah yeah
now I mean
clips if I write Java I can just right
click and run my tests and I have a
green or red and MIP and I know what's
going on here again it's like I'm I'm on
my editor and then I mean I know I have
like veal to your desktop so i would
probably go on my second one refresh
wait a few seconds and then go back but
that kind of takes me out of the rhythm
of like coding and then last point just
to hit the nail on the head yeah
it'sit's up so when everything is in the
browser it sound to integrate in your
idea workflow because you need to go to
that browser to see the results oh you
need to write some weird script to
scrape the HTML in some ways and then
it's like more time then you want to
spend on that so the design principles
behind just stays right where are these
so first thing is that we want to
support ed the TDD development and what
I mean by that is an entity you want to
write a lot of small test and you want
to run them really open and you want to
have hundreds of tests that run in like
milliseconds right you don't want to
have to wait five seconds for your tests
to run so that was the first thing it's
like we need to be able in JavaScript to
do that something that's possible with a
unit today and java again i guess that
was kind of a well big mud area it's
like the java experience in jail unit is
actually really good when you're in
eclipse like coming i love it and again
and having hundreds of tests running in
milliseconds that's not possible today
in your browser again you need to
refresh maybe the browser we start to
cash at some point some things but still
I mean it will be longer than having
something that just stream and and gives
you back the results so so yeah usually
you have multiple HTML page so what do
you do do you open multiple tabs with
each you I'll and then go refresh its of
each of them individually I mean that
again that feels clumsy everything
should run the same time we want it to
be super fast again because here we want
we want things to run in the
milliseconds range and what we do here
is that we we will capture a browser for
you
and we will keep it hot so it will
constantly be basically asking for work
and do it as fast as it can and stream
it back to you again and one thing we do
too is that with with your HTML page and
and the JavaScript code today that you
will have to go and and it refresh but
when you hit refresh actually the
browser will probably i don't know the
optimization in place but it's more
likely that you will have to repass the
HTML reevaluate javascript and that's
just timed as I mean it's last time why
why do I need to redo that the page is
already there everything should be fine
so what we're doing just as revised that
we only reevaluate what needs to be
reevaluated as far as JavaScript so if
you don't like 55 but only one of them
changes why reload the 55 right why
reevaluating all the JavaScript we will
reevaluate only what we know as change
so if there were like two or three 50
need a test that I've changed we will
just reiterate those we also want it to
be a pretty easy to set up and here
again with the HTML file and stuff like
usually yeah where I am why I ended up
doing is like I would copy and paste
that big block of script tags and then
CSS tags or whatever I needed then let
that felt clumsy will be with no HTML
honest and just pure JavaScript I mean
we just want people to focus on their
code right we don't want them to think
about other stuff so we try to make the
dough set up for easy and i'm going to
show you that little bit later big thing
we want to be really integrated with
ideas and as i said we want you to be
able to be in eclipse right click just
like genital click on the green button
or whatever on and everything runs and
you don't have to think about it and to
do that again we had to extract these
results that were prisoner of that HTML
page earlier and then be able to get
them and then stream them back to you
wherever you are so it could be on the
command line on your ID oh whatever
other clients you may have
we keep because we we are still using
browsers actually we can still shabaab
the debacle data in place the dose every
day birger a Firebug bank man even
though Firebug i just realized since the
updated we have some trouble with them
that's going to be fixed we also run
your tests all in parallel on all the
different browsers that you up so the
first place in jersey dress that usually
you capture a set of browsers and and
again if you were to do it manually you
might have to go on each window it
refresh gets kind of all here we just
run everything for you as fast as we can
on all the browsers and again we are
like in the middle seconds range we also
have we were really focused oops I'm
sorry we already focused so on on the
command line and the continued to be
like again today is kind of odd if you
have a continuous build to to make it
fail it's like you might have again to
scrape some HTML to try to get the
result are all that might be maybe some
JavaScript object in them it's kind of
complicated when you have a continues
with to do that same thing the results
are on that page I mean that's that's
really a problem here so again because
we're focused on the command line and
the continuous build you can get the
results anywhere and it's easier for you
to integrate with your existing tools
one thing that the HTML page did fairly
well is actually adding Dom elements so
because we're it was HTML so you could
just type your script diagram in your
your tags in there and they will be
available for your test that's one thing
that if we were to write that in
children I script i would take a few
more lines than just writing the tags
down so for that we actually added some
syntactic sugar and it's basically a
magic comment that you can add in your
tests and what that will do is that you
can just type the HTML as you would do
on the web page on and on on a regular
HTML file and that will include these
tags every time your test run and that
will clean at the end of the test and
include the new ones if you have one or
so great thing that we have is that we
actually have code coverage for driver
script we are instrumenting the
and then we can provide you with a with
code coverage data we're using the
alcove format which is like the generic
unix linux one so you can use all the
alcove tools everything should work so
far nobody can generate nice html5
thanks to them now that's a nice picture
and that's basically the architecture of
up just a driver as you can see there's
well really three parts the main part is
the server the server is basically just
an HTTP server really it's kind of smart
but it's it's an HTTP server and the way
it works is that you will start your
place terrible cell and then you will
capture a few browser so you just go on
a magic you I'll on the jss reverse LOL
that will what we say when we say
capture your browser and then make it
very clear slave of just a row and the
world that the browser does from that
point on is just connecting to
jstestdriver the server and ask do I
have anything to do please give me what
I really want to work and that's all it
does we have another file which is the
client and the client can be a
command-line client or we all serve ID
integrations with Eclipse and IntelliJ
and end the client is the one while
giving others to the server and says hey
I need to run my tests run my tests on
all the browsers that you have captured
that comment goes to the server sellout
puts it in the queue of each browser if
Rosa is really good to run these things
run them stream back the result to the
server and the server streams back the
result to the client the client is also
the one responsible through a config
file is responsible of telling the
server what file should be loading in
the browser so the full communication
between the client and the server is
that the current will start by telling
the server hi several I have these files
I want you to load them into which
browsers and the server would be ok fine
upload them to me
that's happening okay I'm loading it in
all the browsers and then the crown can
be okay now run the test and give me
backwards so there was a lot of slides
and that's what I am and now that's the
interesting part of the demo so i'm
going to show you i'm going to stop with
the the command line stuff just to show
you the basic principle yarn and then
i'll demonstrate how we integrate with
eclipse a northerly cute guy but we are
sorry for IntelliJ so first thing I am a
jar and I I'd need to stop the sale as I
said so I'm going to stop the sale where
is it Riddler morning yeah so it's
listening on that for nine eight seven
six and the next step is to actually
capture the browser so I'm going on that
you are so my IP home nine eight six
seven and I just capture and what
happens here is that now the browser of
that page is our object several sleep
and what's happening is that it's
sending XML ship your request to the
server asking give me work so now i also
have good and i have a few tests so i
started by writing my test and I knew
like okay I need I need to test that my
LOL object does what it should do so you
can see the first line and that's the
setup you need to create a test case
which rested right now and basically
just you call that that method test case
and you're like I'm going to have a new
test case sigh need to available what's
return is not an instance of a class
it's the template of the class so then
on it you can add your test methods so
here i have a few tests i have the test
hello creating an object hello world
putting some log just to make sure that
everything is fine and i'm checking that
when i call it oh the string yellow is
retail pretty simple same thing i have
another test hello you I need my hello
world object and I
who I'm just asserting again that when I
Colello you with a parameter it will say
halo me with a ! the last test is
interesting and that's the syntactic
sugar I was talking about so that allows
you to add HTML I mean dome elements
well in yoga so it just that magic I
mean that that that comment that's like
/ Tao Karam duck and from there you can
just write HTML like you would write on
a regular HTML page the Presley cuadras
tells just as well like I you should add
these elements to my document and so
then if you see in my test I can assert
that the element with ID foo is actually
present and it's not not one less piece
that you need so damn in the yellow
welker is fairly straight all right I
have two functions with down in spring
ah and halo you with the string that was
passed in the last piece and so just
disregard the comment about for now you
would it later but that's the
configuration file i was talking about
that the client uses to tell the server
egg you need these files you need to
load this page in the browser for me to
be able to remind us and what I'm saying
there is that I can use some glub glub
the expression to say hey I want you to
load all the J's file italian sauce and
all the J's file italian sausage so here
you can see my in the tree that I have a
source directory with my source file and
have the source / test directory with my
test drives pretty straight for the
configuration file has others other
keywords like you can exclude if you
want some fives if you need to ask that
you don't want to be loaded stuff like
that so now to run the test so i have a
drow well just forget the first part
against god i designed to draw itself
the interesting thing is here is the
server so i'm just telling my client
died we have a server running on
localhost 986 7 you will need to run
your PA's there and then i have a test
flight
and I say what I want to run all of this
that I am so I'm going to press ENTER
and what happened here is that the
client took to the server uploaded all
the files and run and then everything
right as you can see the output is
pretty straightforward dot is success f
is failure fired an arrow there will be
an e it run pretty fast if you've
noticed compared to going on a web
browser and hit refresh any I can see
what I have two ties that passed and I
have one that pain oh my god did I do
wrong so you can also see that I added
some rug in one of my tests we can see
it right there it's also streamed back
from the browser so i know that it was
in Castello i had some like that say hey
so I'm not just to try it look like try
to really well because it worked and
tested oh you fail and it I have the
what happen is like I was expecting
about me but I added on me so extent of
an exclamation point I had a dot and I
know that it's LOL test line 15 where I
had the prime so I can go check my test
and be like okay so i was calling a
celtic quality Lumia indeed I want an
exclamation point i call you know you
and with me but it didn't return what I
expected it's like okay well yeah silly
me I needed an extra mission point you
are instead of the doc and so let's
rerun now and so we rerun again really
fast and now everything passes and I'm
happy and I can go on with my day so
that's the thing and here you can be lie
and you can say a but you said like
going to the browser is really annoying
so why do you go to the common line like
you're right we shouldn't do that and so
we worked on oops killed eclipse we
worked on Rama ID plugin so as I said we
have a plugin for Eclipse and we have a
plug-in for in 30 j2 in 37 seven and
eight I think there was some difference
now that so we have it for seven eight
so in Eclipse
we have so that that plugin so it kind
of looks like a uni we try to make it
look like Jane but there is a little bit
no buttons and maybe just to start the
little mouse type symbol but that's
actually really really straight power so
let me just so here you can see not
running that's that little vocalist is
not running that's actually the server
and that's the status of the server and
so while we probably want to stop and I
mean stop the server so now it's yellow
which means server is running but no
browsers like are captured and it just
gives you the URL you need to use to
capture your browser so you can copy and
paste what everyone but we also have
some nice little buttons here and we can
click on them to capture some other bro
so I'm on a Mac so I'm going to go with
firefox so I'd open the browser lights
capture can see now Firefox icon is nice
leally and because i'm on a mac i also
have safari so let's let's also kept
yourself oh my let's say i never saw the
the bug earlier so it is incorrect it
and now what I need to do is actually
well just like I would do with Jane it
must prioritise like I just going to
right click run as just a driver test
and that run again really fast just like
Jane it it's red something is wrong what
happened you have the same output that
you would get from the common name so we
are swimming it back interesting thing
to notice right now firefox gives us a
little bit more detail we can get stack
traces we can't get them in Safari and I
the thing is that we are thinking of
making that possible thanks to the
actually we're using some of the
coverage code that we have to be able to
actually generate stack traces for any
of the browsers that's a little bit
the future but again so I just like
doing unit I have the same icons i can
see that the tested oh you fail was
expecting you know me but he was with an
examination plan good i had a dot i can
change it save and rerun and now
everything is real so here that's really
the experience we want people to have
when they write JavaScript today again
because the apps become my more complex
and they become rebe apps in JavaScript
like the tool should be as good as what
we have thought you loved or you'll burn
now i'm going to show you something else
and i'm going to show you the courage
luxury so it's it's really interesting
to get coverage data for your project
just do know where you stand and and if
I mean just to check the earth of you of
your project so we are as I said earlier
we are instrumenting the code and then
we can get you the correct from that so
what I need to do here you gave some
degree just so I you can see that the
file we already creating
ok
you go see which of the files appear so
you can see so I'm going to run the
client so the server is still running on
Safari and Firefox and you can see that
by the green Wow if the seller was done
actually the bar with Tom ready to let
you know like either the seller is not
they are you need to restart it and what
I'm going to do actually the first type
is I can reset the browser's just to
make sure that the state is what I want
and then I'm going to run the coverage
so what I'm doing is that I had a flag
to actually create files locally to
create the Elco file you can also run
the coverage without creating that
encode file if you do not do that the
the results of the coverage will appear
on the command line once the process is
done what I want to show you here is
that to use the coverage you actually
need to install a plug-in and that's the
coverage plugin that's also set up in
the configuration file we have plugins
systems on both side if you are
interested in extending just as rival so
we have Java code and we have JavaScript
code and here we have plug-in system on
both sides so you can extend the
JavaScript if you need to run may be
more specific tests all you can run I
mean you can write some Java plug-in to
do master sorry I'm just going to
basically uncomment that thought that's
just turned out yeah Mary format to
reuse Yemen and here I'm just saying
okay I need the plug-in and the name is
correct I'm sorry and the jar is where
I'm telling you it is and the the class
that's the setup class basically is
named coverage Modi in their job so I'm
going to be run at this time with with
coverage miss a
this yes thank you only one so as you
can see there's a little bit more output
and that's just as I instrumenting okay
we're also not putting as much detail
may be in in the in the final summary
here because again we've generated files
so the test output flag made it
generating files so here you can see I
have some XML files that's basically
stand out like j unit xml files so you
can use them with your continuous build
if you need to and i have that new file
let's just as rival dash coverage that
and that's basically my my elko file
here curve format but is kind of weird
that's what it looks like and the good
thing is that because we're using elko
we can use the tools that already exist
for you to generate maybe the repulsion
so so yeah i'm just going to use the
standard like coming in the alcove
package virgin HTML and just feed it my
file and that created an HTML report for
me you can show you here that's why I
removed under 50 Regina readers to make
sure that the new ones well there and
you could see it's real and I can then
from there I can wear open the
index.html and I have my coverage data
the coverage data is basically to the
coverage folder browsers that run here
so I know that for example return halo
was run four times executed fall times
because while both of my test the first
one curves ello directly the second one
indirectly by cutting hello you pero you
curse hello so yeah hello was actually
called four times you can obviously not
you can capture only one browser to get
these information only on the browser
you want
but basically here so you have all the
data folder browsers and we all really
happy with that too because well again I
don't I don't want to to the courage in
JavaScript and I think most of the
JavaScript promoter you don't don't do
that very well so yeah and again because
we are using l cove you can use all the
existing to file code today one last
thing I can show you quickly is what I
was saying we we are supporting their
burgers in the browser so I'm just going
to demonstrate that pretty quickly just
so we want you to be able to debug just
like you would because it's great to
stay in the ID and then what we really
want you to do actually is just like am
I mean what I like to do is that I like
to write tests and write my code then
and then when I change something I want
to run my test really really of an ike
I'm changing a line I'm going to run my
test and make sure that it's still green
and if it's not green it's really easy
for me to know what's wrong right
because it's like what I've dress wrote
one-nine so I know what's broken here
and I can make a and I can take care of
it but there are some times where you
might need to actually go into the
browser and actually start to debug put
break points and stuff like that so i'm
going to show you that you can put a
break point and that will actually work
the way it's eaten so I'm just going to
reset again because when we instrument
the code but because we're instrument in
because we are adding our own javascript
in your own in your JavaScript to get
the coverage data I'm just cleaning that
up right now also going to stop the
Safari there we go okay the beginning
let me find so we can see that the test
which me to run
capelli they run on Safari and Firefox
and yeah I can one of my thighs so let's
say let's put a breakpoint in hello and
let's make sure that it actually will
block when I run so same thing I'm just
running the clan the ruler lay oh it's
blocking oh it's in the breakpoint could
let me just finish that and finish the
run there you go any finished oh yeah
there's one thing to the way we we need
to know if the browsers out there
because we want to be really good with a
continuous bill there is actually a flag
I need to add we were kind of a straight
on when the browser is dead and some of
the devil girls so we have actually
frames and some of the debugger sometime
block both javascript frames so we kind
of we think one of the brothers is so
that's what happened you but yeah that's
that would be a flag that you can switch
on/off when you really want to debug
long sessions I need to add that it's
not in there yet that's it for my demo
and actually that's it for the
presentation to thank you for listening
do you have any
thanks very much for the presentation
I'm curious about your coverage data if
I picked up correctly your instrumenting
the JavaScript code to get that right is
some I obviously that's a portable
solution but it sort of brought with
danger is there any way to get inside
any of the JavaScript engines to collect
that data as the JavaScript running
without having to mess about with the
code ah so we we like actually the
JavaScript approach I approach because
as you said it's portable and it can
work anywhere we don't really have any
plans to try to get into the drive every
binging and I think that's going to stay
that way unless we really have extremely
compelling cases showing us that we
really need to be there but right now we
feel that that's working well and that's
again that can work anywhere and so we
were very happy with that we don't want
to have to also maintain different
plugins for different browsers if we can
avoid to do that it's already a moving
target I mean as you saw with maybe some
of the debugger girls and stuff to maybe
sometimes keep working with them so we
don't want to add more not good to that
again and and again yeah that's the most
popular solution and it's working really
well so far so we haven't seen any case
where it would be required to other a
plugin
and I have a question about the
integration with continuous integration
server yes like the great thing about
selenium ez coordinator browsers really
well starts map shuts them down it so on
how do you manage that so on a
continuous will actually there is some
more flags to to just a driver where
where you can specify we have a mode
used to get its canid the case you know
the and that mode is basically just a
driver is doing its itself everything so
we start the server and you can specify
on on a flag like where your browser's
executives are so if we stop the server
stop the browser's capture the browser's
run all your tests and shut down
everything so that's how you would use
it in a continuous environment actually
I can show you we are using it I will
search for well on tests so here if you
see the graph actually so that's hot Sun
that's why we use for the continuous
build but just to show you these big
Peaks that's actually all our tests Java
and JavaScript so everything is
integrated in Hudson that's why we are
creating this XML file i showed you are
so quickly earlier the j any type 1
because we want we want to have that
data on the continuous build when we
when we write our own code let me show
you just one quick example of the
results please to show you that it's
there so that's all I will test you that
run for the continued to build our
JavaScript test cases so you see we have
a cell plug-in test let's go in there
and then I can see crouch browser what
the time was and if it so I have
everything
that was really one of our focus on the
other hand right now maybe the way we
are starting browser is not as fancy as
a selenium webdriver priority and we're
thinking of actually maybe checking with
webdriver may be reusing some of the
code powerful starting browsers yes
you're all for it awesome I like that so
we need to be in touch for that just so
you could because he I'd like you you
you have to under comin at you have to
specify the executable path not
everything might be set up correctly so
that's why we want to go the webdriver
question first you see the possible to
put the browsers in the other machines
say we have favored machines to have
different browsers and it run a test is
same time so that or did have candies
cutie or the browsers are in this a pan
same time yes it's possible I mean it's
just an HTTP server so basically you can
connect from anywhere right as long as
you have the IP like it but you can have
I could have had yeah windows machine
connecting right now to my cell phone
running tests again we kept it we kept
it really simple and then that
architecture and clients LOL browser or
lowers to do that so you could have
browsers anywhere on any machine you
just need to connect on the server and
everything and again it's it's I mean as
you saw I mean we are two and we are
given that way we are really fast like
it's in milliseconds range and we were
really trying to keep it out that way I
think I answer this question who um what
happens to test that interact with the
growth of themselves such as navigating
from one domain to another do you have a
security problem though yes so okay
that's the funny part if you change the
UI on you will break because I will run
out is a basically age it's a lot of
JavaScript connecting to the server we
are trying to prevent people from doing
something
for example we prevent people from doing
document on rights too because they
could just destroy the document and lose
all our code so there is certain things
that you can do but that's also on
purpose that's because we want to really
focus on unit tests and not on
end-to-end tests I guess your web driver
would probably be a best solution if you
have to if you want an end-to-end tests
we really want to be like the unit test
just like get jenny is and then we want
to test the logic and stuff like that we
don't want to be in the business of
end-to-end test thanks so to expand on
what he said yes theoretically you could
point the blackberry browser app yes
I've never take it was supported yeah I
bet I don't have a blackberry but an
extra PES with it but I found or and
yeah yeah yeah yeah furi kuri you can
find anything the only thing is that I
have to I've never actually tested with
the mobile devices I should stop doing
that but yeah I don't see why I mean if
it can run JavaScript should be able to
run it very cool okay so I got a
complete the HTML magic comments in
there yes is that just an alternative to
dom manipulation if you need to yes it
is a damning the pay you can see right
JavaScript if you're more comfortable
with you know doing create element or
whatever you just we felt yeah 11 of the
the only thing that the html5 did right
was like AI can just write my HTML tags
you know and then I will be able to
access them from my test and we felt
that in JavaScript it just takes more
lines to say the same thing like you to
create the element upon the child you
might have multiple elements I mean that
becomes quickly kind of annoying so so
that's pretty syntactic sugar okay um
the stack traces you have now is there
some plan to make those clickable so you
can go right the line yes yes is in the
plan
and the coverage can that be important
into Eclipse and displayed with the file
we would love to do that we have to
check actually so that sorts of why we
went with the Elco format we were hoping
that we could reuse a lot of things that
were existing actually i'm not the one
working on the idea plugins it's another
person working with me but I think he's
going to look into it we hope that with
the Elco family will actually just be us
coning existing libraries in Eclipse for
us to be able to display most of it so
it shouldn't be too in terms of the
debugger yeah is you have any
conceivable way to integrate that more
into the IDE so you can set breakpoints
and have the browser launched on failure
so that's really something we want to go
to we would love to have everything
integrated in the ID again that's in the
works it's not there yet it's going to
take a little bit of time but that's
definitely our o-line go release to be
like yeah what Jane it and Java on
Eclipse we want the same fault driver
swing well it's tremendously exciting
stuff thank you very much why thank you
hello and dust jstestdriver support
different unit testing frameworks such
as qunit UI test and etc yes we so as I
said we have pregnant systems on on both
sides on on the driver's side and on the
driver side we actually do supak unit
and that's actually someone on the open
source community who wrote the plug-in
for it it's working well we were really
trying to encourage people actually to
write their own plugins if they want to
two superb existing promotes driver is
there an adapter for the genius test
driver reporter something like that yeah
so the the Q you need plugin I haven't
looked at it into details but basically
all you need to do with the cuny plugin
is adding it to your configuration file
that we load the fibrous I can notify
but that we patch some of our code and
from there to the user that dress looks
like any other gesture driver test so
you get exactly the same feedback on the
common line then you would do with any
other object side road baptist and
that's I mean so yeah we are really
encouraging actually people to if they
have favorite frameworks they want to
work on on and they want it to welcome
dress Sarah we encourage that and we
really want people to do that we
actually we're trying to be more kind of
a standout right now in some ways and
that's why we really want people if you
love ya cuny you should be able to use
it with us but it should feel as good as
what just as well feels like
or if we have no other questions we kind
of resume here in about 15 minutes but
you have 15 minutes you could have a cup
of tea coffee or is it the Vestals thank
you a lot Jeremy thanks about everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
