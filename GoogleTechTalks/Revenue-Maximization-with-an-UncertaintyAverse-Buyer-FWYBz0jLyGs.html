pistis program they're working with
Shruti Tala and he has done some really
interesting work in option theory ATT
mechanism design it is built over all
the pieces work yes thank you all for
coming
it's a plan B here and so this talk is
originally geared to a sort of general
theory audience I'm guessing most of you
are oh it's experts are we talking about
so feel free to let me know if I'm going
too slow or too fast or whatever anyway
yeah so this is joint work with ute my
advisor Carol Mary's a student at
University of Washington and Ellis
drunkest who is currently a postdoc at
you could be Austin so we looked at
maximization with an uncertainty averse
buyer and I'll tell you exactly what we
mean by uncertainty averse in a moment
so first of all the idea is that in
mechanism design we often encounter some
sort of randomness so for a simple
example suppose we're selling just these
two different items and we have a prior
with seller so we have prior over the
buyers value for these two items then
when we look at them like this it's well
known that the optimal mechanism
actually offers two options either a you
get the bundle of both items together
for a price of four or you can choose
option B where you get the first item
with probability one and you actually
flip a fair coin and get the second item
with probability 1/2 and you can take
slightly less for this and this is the
optimal mechanism as it has this kind of
strange format where there's this menu
of different options you can choose and
some of them actually have some
randomness or uncertainty associated
with them so this is theory but it does
show up let's show up in practice so
there might be I see okay so for example
Priceline
is this website that you can buy airline
tickets from so when I was looking at
tickets from Madison to New York I went
and did this search and you can see in
that down towards the bottom we have
these sort of standard results where you
can buy a certain flight you get a
certain areas or
Archer type and so on you see the price
and then up at the top they have this
Express video where you don't actually
know exactly when you're taking off or
when you're what era you're flying but
you can pay less for this so this sort
of thing shows up in practice and the
basic form right here is this sort of
example so suppose I offer you either
five hundred dollars with probability
one or offer to flip a fair coin and
give you a thousand dollars it comes up
heads and which one would you choose
Oh dizzy yeah most people would probably
choose it okay so we say a risk neutral
person would be indifferent between the
two but in practice we did this
experiment probably most people would
choose s if you have elizabitch yeah and
in fact you can actually do sit and many
people will continue to choose a even
when the amount is less so this is known
as a risk averse by a risk averse
behavior where you are opposed to the
uncertainty the risk that you might get
nothing where you can have had $450
there okay the standard model for this
is those expected utility theory so this
came from Hanoi Minh or Eastern at early
twentieth century or the middle century
when they basically invented game theory
and their model says that for each
possible outcome you have some utility
associated that outcome so in general
you have some decreasing marginal value
for money all right and then you would
explain the previous example by saying
that well if we assign a utility of 450
utils arbitrary away to $450 we might
assign something like 750 utils to
$1,000 then the expected value of that
second lottery where you only got $1,000
with probability 1/2 is actually worth
less to you than $450 the certainty ok
so this is the sort of standard model of
risk aversion
but there's the problem with it so for
example Maurice Allais a few that was
later did this experiment where he
offered people either a billion dollars
probably one or the second option where
you get a million dollars most most of
the probability mess but there's some
non-trivial problem
five million dollars and then this very
tiny little bit of probability on $0 so
you might get absolutely nothing and it
turns out that many people choose option
2a all right and this is fine so far so
good
you can assign utilities to each of zero
one and five million dollars subset this
would be the expected behavior but now
suppose we offer this second experiment
all right so we move we offer the same
outcomes except that we move 89% of the
probability mass in each case from 1
million to $0 now which choice should
people make right well I'm trying to
figure out the diligence well might you
would choose what yeah right so there I
think I'll just see actually you're
going to see so much what do you have
chosen it for I guess Oh Tuesday you
choose a.m. ends everybody but many
people would choose a and then D right
because because here there's this little
chance but there is some chance you get
nothing here the difference is only you
know eighty-nine percent versus ninety
percent it's almost the same things but
here if you win you get five million
significant fraction of people so not
inevitable fraction people would make
this switch and the point is that
there's no way to assign utilities to
these different outcomes such that you
can explain this with okay so sort of
that I guess the standard model within
behavioral economics is prospect theory
and the assumption here is that people
are fundamentally miss valuing random
effects all right so let's look at just
a simple example first so suppose we
have either zero I guess this plays
there's none forward okay so you either
get zero with some probability or you
get some R dollar value then we want to
find the weighted expec
of this randomized outcome to be this
weighted utility all right where this
would be the standard expectation right
just the probability of winning it times
whatever utility from our dollars is but
we're gonna actually weight this
expectation according to this convex
function so on the horizontal axis we
have the quantile and on the vertical
axis we have this weighted probability
okay
and where I see that the curve lies
below the identity function so that your
under weighting random events and so
this is going to give you risk averse
alright and I'll define how exactly this
works out for more complicated lotteries
but for this simple example the point is
just that you're basically under
weighting probabilities all right and so
for those of you who might be familiar
with prospect theory I should point out
that actually our model is going to be a
special case of kill me on the prospect
theory which was before a couple decades
later to sort of address issues what
they were job prospects a compressor
clearing of zinging they lend them what
why should be you know yeah okay good
question so in reality when people try
to measure these things Congress needs
experiments you see that why it looks
more like a sigmoid function so actually
rises above the identity function here
and then crosses somewhere in the middle
and then rises up again so you get
basically people overweight small
probabilities so in that previous
example where there's like this one
percent chance of getting nothing
anymore if so you'll really fixated on
that saying well there's some chance
that I'm gonna get nothing that's that
lose larger than I should in some sense
where is something that's a high
probability like you know 10% chance is
using five million dollars before
somehow underweight that wealthy
mathematical expectation should be yeah
I can also point out the Kuna prospect
theory does allow for this utility
function as well so it's a strict
generalization actually of expected
utility okay so this is prospect theory
now so turning back to mechanism design
so there's been a lot of work in
mechanism design from
perspective so meyerson's original paper
showed that when you have just a single
buyer at a single item the AA flow
mechanism is a fixed price right of
course it gets more complicated when you
look at multiple items and more
complicated settings so there's an
almost really beautiful theory that
addresses these more complicated
situations but they all assume risk
neutrality place all this work is
interesting colleague so what about risk
of Irish fires well there has been some
work on risk-averse buyers including in
the 80s some economists looked at the
optimal mechanisms for discovers buyers
but again all of this work is assuming
expected utility theory okay so what
about prospecting so the most relevant
work to what I'm going to talk about is
this paper by David easily in a pretty
coach from EC last year where they went
to a crowd sourcing problem when you
basically have a bunch of different
workers and you want to figure out
what's the best way to recruit some
workers to do your job for you and they
showed that there there's actually
quality the differences between the best
way to do this if you assume expected
utility theory model the best thing to
do is basically just offer a fixed
reward for people doing the work whereas
if you have a prospect theory model if
the optimal mechanism might be any comp
contest so you only pay the person who
gives you the the best work and then
people compete to win any number wins
okay so our goal is to understand the
implications of a prospect theoretic
type model with in revenue maximization
alright so this is just sort of a
summary of our model and how it fits in
with existing models I'll just point out
that our model is a special case of
prospect theory it also includes risk
neutrality as a she set this weighting
function to be the only function you
recovered okay prospect theory is not a
generalization of expansions to theory
does visitation it is because you still
have the you know water you can do with
the utility function concave utility
function and furthermore now the
probabilities also are changed from
linear to let's say
because you can modify poses market more
takes out right so we have this we
called a weighted expectation so I'm
indicating this with this you know Y
subscript on the exploitation and 20
Tony theory has this non linear with
value for money basically you know spots
like three decibels so you have the
buyer to be discovered a the seller is
not disclosed right the seller is risk
neutral idea being you can repeat this
many times in what's max what you
expected okay all right so what are our
results so there's we really look at a
simple simple setting where you have one
buyer and one item here we know that
fair risk neutral buyer the awful
mechanism is deterministic and
furthermore there's this really nice
characterization of any mechanism which
gives you the the allocation as a
function of the buyers value and then
there's this payment identity which
either you're familiar with or it
doesn't matter but the point is that you
can characterize the mechanism exactly
by this one allocation function right in
our case it's not clear I'll go through
this a little bit more in a moment but
it's not necessary clear that such a
thing should exist for a risk-averse
buyer will show that actually the
optimal mechanism does have a relatively
simple form although it can be
randomized and then it's also known on
that there's a gap between the wealth
where and the revenue that you can get
right so essentially the seller doesn't
know the private value of the fire if
you did you can charge a price exactly
equal to the buyers present value and
you can extract the full welfare but
there's this information rent that the
buyer earns because the celery
essentially has to pay something to
learn the evaluations okay in our
setting with an extremely risk-averse
buyer that actually that gap disappears
okay so I'll talk about all these
results a little bit more detail in a
moment but everything I just told you
about this optimal mechanism that we
come up with for this risk-averse buyer
it depends on knowing this waiting
functioning
which is an unreasonable assumption for
one thing probably most of you you know
Renato is here a moment ago trying to
figure out like he was going to choose
probably he doesn't know that to his
waiting function looks like and
furthermore economy Tricia's have
actually tried to measure this in
practice and found that within the
populations undergraduate so you can
take that for whatever it's worth but
people seem to be some people are risk
neutral some people have you know
different forms of this curve and it's
not clear that you can necessarily
assume one curve right so we'd like to
have some mechanism also a single
mechanism that gives a constant
approximation to the optimal revenue
from a mechanism that is predicated on
knowing the weighting function right so
we have some feasible you know some some
class of weighting functions that might
be present in our population and we want
one mechanism that will do well for all
of them right so we call this a risk
robust mechanism and sorry you wanted to
be incentive compatible for all possible
risk profiles yes you always be
incentive compatible and give an
approximation to the optimal remedy is
if I really say it's pure a bet over all
possible risk profiles yes yeah yeah so
the challenge if I give the most applies
right yeah you know the prior so your
big business the prior but not the
winning function mister comment about
the notation that like it looks like
auditors you have F inside off trade
which means opt is using the
distribution is similarly you also want
to use this to yeah it's like they're so
the revenue from this one mechanism
because in particular I thought when you
put something in the subscript that you
don't want to depend on it right you
remoter depend on the little Y here
right your Megan is it says it depend on
the little boy is depends on it yes the
boy is it mmm does no one does depend on
X in general but the revenue from it is
you know we watch the revenue you've
given this as a function of Y that's
clear what we want right all right so
we'd like a constant approximation turns
out that seems to be challenging
basically because of the
examples I just want to mentioned a
moment ago where for some extremely
risk-averse buyers the gap between
revenue and welfare disappears whereas
we know for a risk neutral buyer there's
this non-negligible yep okay but the
thing is that these risk-averse these
extremely risk-averse profiles are kind
of unrealistic right so would make this
definition so we say that a weighting
function is beta bounded if there's a
rectangle underneath the curve that has
bearing a beta the way to think of this
is to say that for some probability
bounded below one the weight is bounded
above zero all right and then we show
that if you have a weighting function
which is beta bounded that factor of
beta translates directly into a
guarantee on the Meyerson optimal price
the curve doesn't need to be convex
anything you could be put particularly
those thing is for very image for me to
0 for every sink little bit 10 meter
exactly so we you see that the curve is
convex so all of our analysis assumes
that the curve is convex I don't know
that that is a super necessary but you
wouldn't want to throw a little - yeah
so I talked to trammel James Wright who
was a sort of behavioral economist at
Masaryk and he was saying that you know
by the time you make this assumption
that it wise meet the curve assuming
it's convex is other small assumption
because in reality like I said these
it's curves is a reasonably reasonably I
also don't think it's I'm not sure that
this result depends on it I think we
should be able to generalize it right
okay one point is that this is not a
tight approximation so if you look at
this the largest rectangle for the
identity function you get an area of a
quarter but we know that the optimal
price is optimal
overall for every buyer not a tight
result
don't know price like the myosin price
yes the more interesting the mine
surprise for okay because the Meyerson
is a definition
Beverly I see fairies I see for
everybody it doesn't change based on why
I see but the only type of mechanisms
that ski the only Mexican I think of its
I see against every simple wise
deterministic mechanisms you could come
up with other mechanisms I think but oh
yeah okay I mean if you think of it in
terms of a menu right you can I just
think it's offering a menu offering one
menu to everybody yeah
people probably choose different entries
but you know way too much about spicy
thing I guess yeah so I would say don't
you reckon is that cycie for every y uy
so let's say I give a menu of lotteries
I was like talk about mechanism usually
Park is thinking in terms of like
submitting in beta and the mechanism
itself choosing an element of the menu
for you yeah sorry but I guess it seems
like you are thinking in terms of the
menu yeah you're right probably I can't
think of I'm not I would guess if there
is no I see mechanistic elections when
you think of it in this way of buyer
living in an allocation and if it's like
you have one bidder mechanism it stays a
1v2 mechanism is increasing but multiple
biomechanism is a little different
y-yeah so you might be oh yeah so you
don't you can't also stole them oil but
some of they shouldn't a wife that's
like utility they're getting can you
also tell them your y addition to your
bit
okay so you could do that that's another
good workout then there's the issue
though can people really report their
wide yeah yeah really yeah they do have
to the dissipation menu at least you can
imagine somebody just choosing their
favorite option from yes won't you other
things talking about earlier it might
question is it from what Bob is a single
buyer this this is all for single buyer
of a single voice everything I'm a
talking about to be a single buyer this
is also first single items so the next
thing I'll talk about is a dynamic
setting when we talk about two items but
it's always single buyer all right make
sure not miss it when you say a
provision revenue it's to the marginal
revenue so no so this this is Candace
this optimal revenue is the optimal
revenue that you could extract if you
knew why which is in general more than
the Meyerson already so you can always
expect my or some because my son is at
the wrist yes sure okay oh the point is
that when you have this risk-averse
buyer you can actually do something with
some water ease to earn even more
revenue so it's soft as a function of Y
and F like you do this okay it's in beta
orders not tight because you have
examples to it's not tight because we
know that for a risk neutral wire this
function looks exactly like that and
then the area here is one quarter and
this only guarantees a for approximation
for a central buyer so we know that it
first intro bio the optimal price is the
optimize so maybe you
you know more sophisticated with this
curve get a better approximation
guarantee the advantage of this is that
you only have to look at like these two
points just measure the weighting
function at one point basically okay
so then I'm guessing many if not all of
you are familiar with these dynamic
settings
another popular around here but they're
does he have say perhaps Google is
selling the new pixel and the buyer is
looking at buying this phone but they
know that Google's probably gonna come
out the pixel three a year or two from
now and if Google will offer some sort
of contract upfront weep a bit more you
can get the second phone or the third
phone I guess and teacher for Less right
and then the buyer would be willing to
pay more today exchange first I
discounted in the future all right so
it's knowing that you can get more
revenue by doing this sort of thing all
right but we show that you really need
to know the buyers waiting function in
order to be this sort of trade off
between future utility and present
payments so there's no robust
approximation no constant approximation
even when these weighting functions are
bounded by some constant there's a
single mm-hm there's the inherently
depend the romanization because this
mechanism how do you depend on the by
arisen about the futures so run away to
the determine is certainly some house so
our mechanism is gonna be deterministic
so we're all your talk about
deterministic mechanisms here but the
buyers still has some uncertainty about
her future value so there's some
inherent randomness that the seller
cannot control basically so the lower
amount of place for all mechanisms
really it's not specific this is the
lower bound is for two periods one buyer
one seller trait
yes and it applies to both deterministic
than randomized or not for the device to
randomize I suspect that there is also
learn after analyze madman's okay so you
have various pace of statistic
mechanisms to the optimal
right and the previous result was your
mechanism compared against the optimal
randomize mechanism yes after ym is
randomized mechanism - yeah for especial
buyers for the risky trip oh yeah so
there was no work on this fair risk the
perspire so long before now no what do
you mean risk neutral the benchmark is
oft of Wykeham is great yeah it is okay
all right so here's the summary of all
the results I just mentioned so for the
rest of the talk and first of all gonna
explain the model a little more detail
and then I can run through these results
skipping the high-level overview if
there's anything in particular that you
want to talk about or hear more or less
valid you know let me know otherwise
I'll just sort of go through this stuff
okay so here's our model so as I
mentioned so the the serum the result is
the is on the best response to give you
an awesome mechanism whereby a best
response made on his own right he's not
gonna send request is not is iciness a
series of menu and he picks the best
elements in menu yeah we think of this
as a venue understand the second menu
candy build the first choice yes right
thank you
yes yeah so in general for this is
saying we think of turistic mechanisms
so in other words is a menu of prices on
the first day and then depending on the
price you choose on the first day that
determines what the price under some 300
things - yeah okay one final question on
this so this result the first theorems
result is for y being convex functions
that any convex function is find rate
beta pound - yes convex function any
comment and then for the utility
functions what do you assume basically
it's just when you're an accurate linear
they bought the benchmark and
okay so we simulator utility function we
make assume that this is a convex why is
a convex function and then so now we
need to describe how this model
generalizes to these more complicated
lotteries all right and the basic
intuition is that we wanted to satisfy
and edit to the axiom really want this
for the dynamic setting when we want to
look at the utility across the two
stages okay so let's look at this
example so suppose that you get your
offered either one two or three hours
uniformly at random now the observation
is that in each case you're gonna get at
least $1.00 right so you should get your
utility should be always 1
now the second power comes with
probability 2/3 and the third dollar
with probability 1/3 so we want this to
be the expected value for this whole lot
random outcome should be 1 because
you're gonna get with certainty plus the
expected utility on the second dollar
with probability 2/3 plus the weighted
expectation of the third dollars holiday
onesy
okay and this might be a bit confusing
so the way to think of this is in terms
of the cumulative distribution function
right so here's the CDF of this lottery
and I said standard identity that the
expectation is equal to the area above
the curve here right and now what we've
done here is we've just transformed this
CDF by raising these cumulative
probabilities right and the formula that
we use is exactly this so think about
this if Y is identity function this one
cancels that one and we get back okay
does this clear how this transformation
works in this example all right now in
general we do exactly the same thing
where we transform the human of
distribution function here's the formal
definition throwing the only new part is
that when you look at negative values
okay
you subtract off the area below the
curve to the left of 0 so this is
exactly the stand
definition of expectation in our motto
we just transform the curve in this way
and you can see that there's negative
area increases the possibility decreases
so the way that expectation is less than
the mathematical expectation all right
all right so that's the model or any
questions about that's all right so
don't understand the mechanism is
defined by this menu of pairs so we'll X
and P where X gives you the allocation
and we're only going to look at
determinist ex-post
deterministic all right I should say X
posts a full allocation so either you
get the item read knowledge let me know
fractional allocation all right and then
we assume that the payment is just some
arbitrary payment and the buyers going
to select the pair or the distribution
over allocation of payment which
maximizes this weighted utility utility
all right but whereas in a risk control
setting the distribution you can assume
is just over you know with probability
of receiving the item is here because
we're looking at this whole
transformation of the entire scene yes
it really matters what the distribution
over X and P are so for particular it
could be the case that you know for one
particular pair from this menu even
conditioned on receiving the item there
might still be some randomness in the
payment and that's different from you
know just looking at a to outcome water
for your payment is one thing either
receive the idea at all
okay so we're gonna need to understand
what this looks like
all right so if there's a simple lottery
where either receives the item and you
pay P or else you get nothing and pay
nothing now there are only two cases
that we'll get first
sorry about that
so suppose your value is less than the
price and when you actually receive the
item when you are allocated your utility
is negative so this is the transformed
CDF but with the transform probability
here
you get this negative utility I mean and
so this attracts and note that as your
value increases the width of this
rectangle decreases and your valued your
utility changes is exactly this rate so
you get this linear function and then
when your value surpasses the price now
when you receive the allocate when you
actually get the item your value of your
utility is positive and now we're
looking at the area above the curve here
and so the weight here is y of X so
there's actually a bend in the utility
function when you go from negative to
positive
all right and we call this type of
Flowery of binary lottery so we're going
to show that the optimal mechanism
always consists of these sort of simple
binary lotteries right there any
questions about this example right it's
not too critical understand exactly the
main thing to remember is that for the
simple binary lottery we get a curve
that looks like this which has slope
weighted equal to the weighted
probability of allocation and in general
we get some concave on utility curve
okay now going back to the mechanism
remember that the mechanism is this menu
of these pairs and in general the buyers
gonna pick the pair which maximizes this
weighted expectation so you get some
sort of curve which looks like the max
of all these individual utility curves
and for risk-neutral why are we know
that this function this utility curve is
convex because you're just taking the
max of all these linear functions in our
case because these functions are now
concave utility function of integral
lotteries concave you might get some non
convex so they curved for the menu all
right but we can actually show that the
optimal mechanism has a convex utility
curve so we can do this by taking the
convex envelope so just the maximum
convex function which is upper bounded
by this original curve and then we find
a menu of these binary lotteries which
produces a utility curve
then we can show that you actually don't
lose revenue by switching from the
original menu to this support maybe I
mean let me have you talk about the
details but in the interest of time I'll
always have some nice lawyers actually
that give the intuition but okay so how
this probably uses the theorem the
document mechanism will induce a convex
utility curve uses the convex they give
for you I don't think the intuition
doesn't know about it sort of some
details where we use convexity all right
yeah so I think you can eliminate you
can't actually from this but someone
care for that yeah the basic idea is
that it's only a firm risk-averse buyer
some complicated menu is more as a lower
utility than a binary letter that
allocates with the same payment then it
has the same expected payment so if you
sort of eliminate the you know reduce
the uncertainty you to as little as
possible
you can only increase the utility and
then you can take this convex curve you
can actually show that the curve has a
higher payment and allocation positive
than that sort of simplified thank you
that's the very hand wavy baby
explanation but that intuition doesn't
depend on the convexity in any way okay
so how do we make more revenue so here's
the basic idea suppose you have a risk
control buyer you offer a price that
gives you a nice utility curve here now
if you add a second lottery with a lower
price you know some certain probability
of allocation and buyers whose values
lie between this lottery price and the
original price will now purchase the
watery so you gonna gain some revenue
from them however will be some buyers up
here who would have previous
purchased the item at the price and
we're now going to switch to the
randomized lottery and since we know
that the auto mechanism is deterministic
we know that the gains from these buyers
are going to be canceled by the losses
from those buyers prefer a risk-averse
buyer you can offer exactly the same
price and lottery but because people
undervalue theirs lottery fewer people
switch from the price to the determinant
from the price to the lottery you
actually lose fewer these lose less from
those people if they switch but you gain
the same amount from the people who were
previously buying nothing right and as
risk aversion goes to extreme in some
sense basically as you become our
material you have an arbitrary small
wait for you know probability that's
just below 1 then you can basically just
add these lotteries one for every value
and everybody is going to pay as much as
possible so we have a at the end of us
as much certainty as possible ok so the
point of all this is just that we can
characterize these mechanisms according
to this allocation rule which gives the
allocation probability for this binary
lottery we get a payment not any notice
by looking at this convex utility
function and it looks very similar to
the risk-neutral setting except that
it's not quite the same this payment
identity has these nonlinear weighting
functions in it however this is still
useful for further analysis because we
can use this weighting function or sorry
this payment function to compare the
optimal mechanism for a certain risk
averse buyer and then basically the idea
is that we can relate that to a risk
neutral buyer we're doing it to a
mechanism for risk neutral buyer which
we know is upper bounded by a price and
then we can upper bound the revenue from
this randomized lottery for a
risk-averse fire by the price I pay my
price
okay so that's all I head up for this
one shop setting so like dynamic setting
so the setting is exactly that we have
one buyer two items we know a
distribution over the buyers values wire
doesn't learn this second stage value
until after having Megan made a decision
for this first stage mechanism and sour
can offer mechanism that depends on the
buyers choice in the first stage all
right so we're also going to send that
the mechanism deterministic which means
that that's a price in each day and
we're gonna say that the buyer is
ex-post and with rational meaning that
she won't pay more on the stage then all
right so here's this example that's
right so the point is that you have this
distribution where if you just set a
price on each day no matter what price
you set the revenue is going to be one
thang so this is called an equal revenue
distribution however we can set a pair
of prices such that utility that the
buyer expects to receive on the second
stage is exactly equal to the price that
she pays on the first stage alright and
then every option in this menu has
exactly the same utility so we just
assume that the buyer is gonna pay for
value right and then you get revenue
that's at least equal to the buyers
value on the first stage which can be
much larger than one all right but this
should be somewhat off-putting because
we're assuming that the buyer is you
know and indifferent between all of
these different options and is just
going to be willing to pay
now you on the first day all right
and we show that if the buyers risk
averse well if we actually know the
buyers waiting function you can recover
exactly the same sort of result okay you
can basically recover the fold not quite
the same full value on the first stage
but at something that is like the
minimum of the buyers first stage value
and the weighted expectation on the
second stage value right but if you
don't know those weighting function we
can come up with an example where no
mechanism can give a constant
approximation even though the weighting
functions are a class of functions that
are 1/8000 so they fall within some
reasonable range or risk-averse or
uncertain averse buyers okay and know I
can talk about this in more detail I had
prepared to talk about it but since some
of you were somewhat experts on this I
can go over a little more this is
definitely the most technical part of
their paper I gave me this is for in
this class this lower bound is for
convex wife yes yes and that's why I
give some intuition right it's true
because I can come up with solutions at
a very the distributions can cause very
little value for some wise if I could
have any farther away yeah it's right
but so the point is that for a risk
neutral buyer you need to extract a lot
of revenue on the first stage so you
have to offer prices that cover a wide
range of first-stage values okay but in
order to do that you have to give a
decreasing second stage price right as
your value on the first stage increases
you have to have a we promised a smaller
smaller price on the second stage all
right but a risk very risk-averse buy or
even not that risk-averse fix um you
know being bounded
constant risk averse buyer basically in
order to get them to pay their full
values you have to offer steeply
discounted price on the second stage and
so these things are sort of in conflict
so for the risk-averse buyers you have
to offer this deeply discounted price
for a risk neutral buyer you have to
cover a wide range of first-stage value
so you have to have a wide range of
prices on the second day and you just
run out of discounts on the second stage
right so are you saying that that your
class of Y is just this control plus one
particular discovers no so we actually
needed actually looked at a continuum of
weighting functions um also just the
risk of ressources yeah we couldn't come
up with a way to make it work with just
like a finite number of physics created
notions like sure yeah
so if you want I can like this so you
have so you have some first page price
and you're gonna want buyers to purchase
this exactly so you offer some utility
for the second stage right and for a
price of zero you can offers you a
second stage encoding and then you want
people to keep paying their value so the
utility has to increase exactly
proportionally to the price right so
this means that somebody is exactly
equal to the price so they cancel each
other out and your effective prices here
the point is it as you this increases at
some point you hit no the utility that
you could possibly
you know utility that corresponds to
offering a price of zero expectations so
this has to flatline at some point and
you can't go on offering more and more
utility on the second stage okay and
then what we do is we show that this
corresponds to setting a price of zero
some call this you would zero and then
your expected revenue is equal to either
your value up until this point or this
value here on this suit was a linear as
well so the sandwich
yes our is risky this statement is the
same I'm not sure that makes sense the
question because one from his bias but
usually papers are like that people say
either the syllabus covers the purifiers
I wonder if they can actually get some
seat posts the same the protein is not
near the same that the problem is that
there there are no actual mixes it has
the same as you know very similar in
spirit for sellers universally
approximating all seller
it was a single mechanism that he can
use for every service profile yeah Rinku
posted price based mechanism but there
they assume buyers are all like
completely discovers nearby or service
he buyers or discovers the server like
the model let's see the natural the cell
is doing a bunch of things yeah
so the point is that this should be I
guess subscriptions by why this it's
very very large for a risk neutral buyer
so this point here is pretty far to the
right all right risk of first buyer in
order to get this slope here you have to
offer a very steeply discounted price
mm-hm
so you can look at that what there was
it takes you a constant but even that's
not an honest trade no so actually the
function we looked at look at is like so
it's like x squared up to some point T
and then it just rises linearly after
this is like yeah okay so I should
probably you know do finish there any
sense a randomized mechanism well maybe
if you do something but there it becomes
very difficult to elements hmm I mean
this expectations get too crazy yeah I
miss wise you've got both the buyers
uncertainty and they become hard to
reason about okay all right so basically
we can look at our results in two
different categories so for rental my
website for a single shot setting
basically we show that when the seller
controls the randomness so you control
the rents and the lawyers you can use
that to advantage in you can extract
Florida all right but then there's
dynamic setting where you have two
stages the uncertainty is inherent in
the setting it's in here in the
environment the sour cannot come up with
a deterministic mechanism that gives it
constant approximation regardless of you
know even when you assume that the
buyers waiting function for us one of
these
realistic classes of weighting functions
alright so there's a lot more work that
we could do here so we didn't actually
find the awful mechanism even computing
it just for like a really simple example
like uniform 0 1 y equals x squared I
know how to compute the output that
guy's up there so that would be an
interesting thing new multiple buyers it
seems difficult to find the optimal
multi-buyer mechanism but for example
you could analyze my posted prices but
something like this seems like an
interesting direction and basically
anything you can pick out for
risk-neutral buyers you know it's more
than this possibly theoretic model okay
so I'll stop there
