a Googler here and today I'm very
pleased to bring casey to google so this
is casey wilson so Casey started a
microfinance organization in China in
2007 in the past year and half she has
been working very hard in leading this
organization to raising funds to help
the pores in China and there are 300
million people who are living under the
poverty line in China and today Casey's
going to talk about some of the progress
the organization has made and also some
of the challenges in navigating the
heavily regulated environment of China
so let's give her a round of warm
applause so that she can tell us her
like stories first of all thank you guys
so much for showing up I know you guys
have wonderful lunch options and
restaurants and what not to go to and
thanks a lot for coming just to get a
sense of who you guys are how many of
you have been to China well that's
pretty good and then how many of you are
programmers or programmers what is the
rest of you do what are you guys
involved in finance and you guys finance
translation and then how many of you
know what microfinance is okay so we
have a pretty microfinance China savvy
crap okay so today I'm going to tell you
guys the story of what kind the
microfinance nonprofit that we've
started how we came to be why we're
involved in China and why we think you
should be involved as well our model
where we are today and where we plan to
go in the future hopefully with your
help so first of all what is woke I will
kai is a consumer philanthropy platform
for China that means that you can go on
to woke I org take ten dollars today
give it to someone in rural China
tomorrow
you start a small business track their
progress and repayments over time and
once they've repaid their loan
completely you can take that
contribution that you gave last year and
contribute it to a new borrower to
support their business so how did this
all start we started about two years ago
on st. Patrick's Day my co-founder
Courtney in this photo right here had
been doing microfinance in China for
about three years and I'd moved to China
to pursue a career in development after
studying together at a program in Ching
hua university right next to Google and
China we moved in a new apartment
together and decided to combine our
skills and interests in development and
microfinance to start woke I then there
were four major steps from there that
kind of helped us reach the point where
we are today it took us about four
months to really realize the needs of
the microfinance sector in China do due
diligence trips to see what microfinance
was like on the ground there and write
our business plan and then in the summer
of two thousand seven we returned the US
and put together some seed funding from
family and friends to get the
organization started by the fall of oh
seven I returned to China and we began
recruiting our field partners so our
Marlo works where we're online and we
select institutions so local NGOs in
China who select the borrowers and post
the profiles online and so in August we
began doing our first evaluation we've
evaluated for institutions in inner
mongolia province club a province
sichuan province and ningxia and
approved two partners one in inner
mongolia and we're going to be launching
with our second partner in the next few
days in sich one right where the the
earthquake was last May the second
component was recruiting volunteers up
until three months ago we only had one
full
paid staff and the rest was
volunteer-based we've had about 50
interns ranging from high school
students to college students at Penn and
Harvard and Columbia to professional
volunteers such as Larry son over here
who's our director of Technology the
next component was building chapters so
no matter how good of a product we build
online we need a community of
contributors to actually access our
website and so the major question we had
when we were developing woke I was how
do we actually build a community of
contributors online and we realized that
we really had to go offline to get that
community unlike Expedia or Amazon
people don't wake up in the morning
thinking how am I going to use this ten
dollars in my pocket to contribute to
someone and so we are at our answer that
question was building chapters these
chapters are made up of professional
volunteers many of them work in finance
or law or are getting PhDs are working
in web development and our chapters are
in San Francisco Seattle in New York
City and they work on everything from
giving speeches to holding events to
working with local media and doing
online marketing our fourth component
was building the website of course for
us we really realized with this that
three times is a charm it took us two
failures to reach the point where we are
today we first of all went with some
developers who were very large firms but
didn't have experience taking things
from scart start to scratch they made it
through our five page HTML site and took
about six months six times the amount of
time it would take me today to develop
it and we realized that they weren't
ready for that next step of actually
building our real site then it took us
about six months to find our next
development team we either found
developers who were very much experience
but we're quoting us between fifty and
two hundred thousand dollars for the
site or developers who were in our price
range but didn't have the excuse to
actually make the site happen we ended
up going with the development team in
New York City who delivered
site to us that was a disaster and
luckily actually through Chi Fuli the
head of google china we found our
current developers today and they swept
in and really were our saviors they've
been working at about ten percent
they're going rate and it took them
about twenty two months worth of
developer hours to build the site that
we have today so I mean the question I
get all the time when I speak about woke
I is why China why with the country
that's the one of the quickest
developing countries in the world its
GDP is going to surpass the size of the
united states in the next 30 years why
should we support china why shouldn't
China just solve its own problems and
you know instead we could help food aid
in Zimbabwe or support a micro
entrepreneur in India there's still some
huge issues facing China that I really
don't think will be solved by natural
course of economic development right now
you have about 300 million people in
China living on less than a dollar a day
so that's equivalent to the entire US
population on top of that you have this
growing rural rural urban divide so in
China about seven hundred and
thirty-seven million people live in
rural areas that's equivalent to 2.4
United States put together let's take a
look at rural life um this borrower in
the middle air this guy in the middle
with the last one sorry Hwang Jung ji he
is a 35 year old man living in Sichuan
province he spent about 10 years working
in urban areas working in the city as a
migrant worker in a factory and while he
was in the cities earning about a
hundred dollars a month he worked right
next to a chicken raising farm and so
when he was there he kind of learned how
people raise chickens and then he
decided to take that back to his family
in Sichuan province and start a small
chicken company so now he's taking out a
four hundred dollar loan to start a
chicken raising farm I think right now
he has about 900 chickens and he uses
the income from his micro enterprise
to support his daughter his wife and his
two parents that's the kitchen that his
family has and they live in a 33 room
mud hut without any electricity let's
compare that to urban China I'm for
those of you I'm sure you've been to
Shanghai and Beijing and here's the
Beijing skyline here's the apple store
that opened about five blocks down the
street from my house at this new Stanley
21 village mall it's a far cry from the
hills of rolls hitch one so kind of to
get an idea of the current divided in
rural China it's important to kind of
look back 30 years into the past to when
China began opening up to capitalism and
really to be able to use that to get a
sense of where China's going in the
future so back in 1979 everyone was
basically equal so that girl at the
apple store was basically in the same
situation as a woman in rural citron
everyone was earning less than a dollar
a day and basically urban in rural areas
were in the same position if we look at
today people in urban areas are inning
3.5 times the amount of people in rural
areas the average urban income is about
nineteen hundred dollars a year while
the average rural income is about dollar
fifty a day right now urban urban income
is growing at about nine point six
percent a year so almost ten percent
while rural income is around six percent
a year so you have the situation where
if you take this these income
inequalities and these differential
different levels of income growth by
2027 so about 20 years from now summon
rural China will be earning nineteen
hundred dollars a year so about five
dollars a day while someone urban china
is earning about twelve thousand dollars
a year so you have people in urban China
earning about six point three times the
amount is people in rural China and as
most of you know people in China are
savers so if we imagine not just annual
incomes but what that means kind of in
the long term if everyone if each of
these people are saving about forty
percent
of their income in 10 years that girl in
the apple store will have about forty
eight thousand dollars saved up well
that person in rural China has eight
thousand dollars and there's really no
way of bridging that gap this is just an
observation these aren't stats but one
thing that's been really interesting for
me living in China is to just to see the
vast size of the population what that
actually means in terms of growth so in
China you have about the same amount of
land as we have in the United States but
you have four times as many people
living on that land and that's not to
mention the fact that we have more arid
land in the United States and we have in
China so you have four times as many
people living on just the amount of same
amount of size of land and less
resources and there's no way in that
situation that unless you start kind of
really implementing innovative solutions
to development that those people that
are kind of being left out of the
economic growth are going to be helped
so when we were kind of looking at how
do we address these issues facing China
we thought the only way that you're
going to that well we're going to be
able to start affecting growth and
helping those people that are kind of
left out in the midst of economic
development is to develop rural
economies right now if you live in rural
China you probably have about three
options of things to do you're either
living on the land that you've inherited
and doing animal husbandry so raising
animals or agriculture or are you doing
date labor either in a local town or
moving to a city and being a migrant
worker there really aren't many other
job opportunities and people don't have
assets to start small businesses that
will then turn into larger businesses
and then turn into local economies so on
top of that a 600,000 people sorry 600
million people in China do not have
access to credit to start small
businesses so when we were starting woke
I we thought how about we work into in
the microfinance sector to begin
providing people with opportunities to
start small business
citizen begin building those rural
economies so first of all what is
microfinance microfinance provides
financial services to the poor
microcredit are loans to the poor to
start small businesses loans tend to be
about one year long have fifteen to
twenty percent interest rates in China
and that's due to instead of the
borrower's coming to banks the
microfinance institutions are going to
in their villages they will go to the
villages to screen borrowers every two
weeks they'll go to the villages for
repayments and also provide them with
training and support services and they
use the group guarantee system so since
the poor don't have assets to guarantee
their loans they've created the idea of
a group guarantee system where five
people will get together each of them
will guarantee the loans of each other
and if one person doesn't repay the
other four have to step in to repay that
borrowers loan if no one steps in to
repay that borrowers loan then no one
will have access to capital in the
future in China microfinance is achieve
success the institutions that are out
there have achieved over ninety-five
percent on timer payment rates but the
issue is that they have limited access
to funding due to current regulations
microfinance institutions have to rely
on donor funding for expansion and as
people see China less and less as a
cause donor funding is quickly leaving
the microfinance sector microfinance is
basically in its nascent stages in China
compared to other developed countries
such as if we compare China with
Bangladesh the entire population of
Bangladesh is about 160 million people
the Grameen Bank which is the third
largest microfinance provider in
Bangladesh has a loan portfolio of 530
million dollars in all of China the
entire microfinance sector combined only
has a loan portfolio of two hundred
million dollars so you know kind of in
the relative spectrum microfinance and
China is basically non-existent so when
we were creating woke I
why not create a new funding source for
these microfinance institutions to
expand to more borrowers and beginning
begin increasing their impact here are
some photos from a trip that we made
when we were developing the business
plan for work I and a few borrowers at
this institution in ningxia these are
the books that they use to record the
repayments so far cry from Citibank down
the street okay so what is the woke I
model they're basically three components
to our website the first component is
the contribute section where you can go
on you can browse borrowers you can
contribute say ten dollars to support
their loan after you contributed you get
updates on your borrowers progress and
you can reinvest your funds the back end
of that is our field partners in real
China's screen the borrower's post their
profiles online we translate those into
China into English from Chinese and once
we've fundraise for the bar will pass
those funds over to our micro finance
field partner in rural China we have
three main components that we do to be
able to get a field partner online the
first is due diligence before we work
with any partner will do a five-day trip
down to that institution to really
evaluate them and make sure that they're
ready to work with whoa Kyle in those
evaluations will do a five-day
evaluation first meeting with the Board
of Directors then going down to the
management staff MTG loan officers and
doing audit of their clients once we
return we'll put together a proposal for
our investment committee made up of
international microfinance authorities
the investment committee will then make
a decision on a do we partner with the
institution and be if we partner with
them what's our loan funding kind of
projections for the first year do they
have to make meet any benchmarks such as
adopting international best practice
accounting systems or putting together
an independent board of directors once a
partner is approved and we've come
dumped with our contract and funding
plan Zhang Zhang our director field
partnerships will go down and train them
on our systems both the online system
of our back-end banking systems and how
to use the website as well as how to
create convincing profiles of their
borrowers to post online the next
component of our website is the
community section so in order to drive
our cause and increase the traffic on
our website and really increase the user
experience we've created a community
where everyone from contributors to
microfinance organizations in China to
borrowers and groups can connect in an
online forum finally we have a news
section we realized it was really
important to in order to drive more
tractors traffic to our site get more
people involved in microfinance in China
and social innovation in China to build
a comprehensive information resource
right now if you try to search
microfinance in China you basically find
very very little information maybe six
or seven quality articles and we thought
that the first step towards pushing
development would be pushing knowledge
and information so how is what I
different right now we're kind of
existing in a space on our own one
aspect that makes us different is the
fact that we're transparent you can go
online from anywhere around the world
and contribute to a borrower knowing
that a hundred percent of your
contribution will go towards funding
their loan it would be the same if you
were sitting right here as if you were
sitting at their headquarters in inner
mongolia second of all were young I had
an interesting conversation last week
with one of our family friends who is
say around 55 years old and she was
saying that her generation would give
money to say the Red Cross and they
would just trust that the Red Cross
would use it well as opposed to our
generation where we're happy to support
social causes and we want to but we need
to know exactly where each dollars going
and we want to see the impact of that
change third of all wilk I can work with
any contributor we can have 60
contributors starving students each
giving ten dollars to support one
borrowers loan
or one person can give six hundred
dollars to support that same borrower
finally we're scalable when we kind of
project into the long term it basically
costs us the same amount to fund one bar
or at a field partners it costs us to
fund 10,000 it costs us about twelve
hundred dollars to do all of the
monitoring in the training for a year
for each partner and then after that our
platform allows us to scale at no
marginal cost to new borrowers so all in
all loci today has offices in Oakland
which is a donated office that I work
out of part-time and then our main
office in Beijing we have four full-time
staff and two part-time staff our
technology director Larry and our
creative director we have four
developers working part time to field
partners in inner mongolia and such wan
province and three chapters in San
Francisco Seattle and New York City with
75 professional volunteers so far we've
supported 144 144 contributors have
supported 24 borrowers to start small
businesses and we've done all this on a
budget of around 120,000 dollars a year
so kind of along the process of starting
woke I we realized you know a few months
ago that not only had we've created a
microfinance platform but we'd also
created a plot a pipeline for people
connecting back to China and that's not
necessarily limited to microfinance so
kind of what does that mean for us in
the future that means that if we
expanded to healthcare you could find a
barefoot doctor a barefoot monk in the
Tibetan Plateau to provide health care
and health services to other people in
Tibetan communities you could fund
vaccines for those students over there
or an education you could support a set
a child to go to school for a semester
of high school or buy them a ruler
but in order to get there we need your
support like I said before we're almost
ninety to ninety-five percent reliant on
volunteer support and there are three
ways that you can help first of all
spreading the word were one hundred
percent reliant on viral marketing to
get the word out about what kaya so by
telling your family and friends you're
doing a lot to help grow the
organization second of all you can
contribute by logging on to polka dot
org today you can go and support a
borrower in inner mongolia to start a
small business and finally you can
volunteer and join our team right now we
have chapter in San Francisco and we've
also started a chapter in the south bay
and we're always looking for people to
help out with areas such as web
development finance public relations and
online marketing thank you guys very
much does anyone have any questions
yeah so would you mean on the borrower
level or on the like kind of the partner
level
basically at this point if you want to
do microfinance in China you have to
have a lot of government support do
they're very very stringent financial
sector regulations and so they offer
licenses for microfinance institutions
but in order to get those licenses you
need government veto and you need
government backing and so that puts them
in the situation where they're always
working with the government as opposed
to kind of in conflict with them we
haven't had to deal with much kind of
correction or government like kickbacks
or anything like that and I think the
main reason for that is that China's
putting a really big emphasis right now
on developing rural economies they
realized that if they don't do that
they're going to have a lot of social
and rest going kind of into the future I
think the biggest area we have to deal
with corruption is we're dealing with so
in microfinance they're kind of four
tiers of institutions there's a top tier
that say like the Grameen Bank where you
know you have somewhere between 100,000
and a few million borrowers they have
very strong risk control very strong
accounting systems and kind of going
down the tears you get to the fourth
tier the institutions that have maybe
between one and five thousand borrowers
they don't have very robust accounting
system risk control systems and there's
really no way to or it's very there's
definitely way but it's very difficult
to monitor those institutions and given
kind of the nascent stages of the
microfinance sector in China we're
dealing with those institutions where
there is the possibility of corruption
because they don't have those kind of
risk controls in place and so for us in
a void and corruption the biggest deal
is you know getting them up on
international accounting systems doing
monitoring every three to four months
will actually do an on-site monitoring
trip we have special bank accounts that
have woke I funds and then we have
banking systems in the back of the
website where they record every bar
distribution borrow repayment and so we
can kind of match up those those account
yeah exactly sorry okay sorry
yeah so his question was the sources of
funding for our field partners the
majority of them were started back 10 to
14 years ago with funding from the UN
Development Program the UN Development
Program decided that they wanted to kind
of spark microfinance in China and so
they went to local governments of
counties that were the majority of
people were living under the poverty
line and kind of asked ask the
government's if they would sponsor
someone to start a microfinance Tatoosh
in' and so they gave them the technical
support and training to start up the
institution along with seed funding and
many of these institutions since then
have gotten a little bit of support say
from the Grameen foundation or various
grants but they're at the position where
the majority of them aren't getting any
new funding they're able to pay their
operating costs based off of that
interest rate but their loan portfolio
is basically static
yeah so her question was the idea of our
our models contribution based versus
like kiba's model which is loan based
for us that decision was purely based
off of the regulatory sector in China
it's impossible for us as a not since
we're not a financial institution we're
not able to lend to our field partners
and since they're NGOs are not able to
access commercial commercial loans and
so even if we were a bank we wouldn't be
able to lend to them as opposed to like
Kiva where the majority of the countries
that they work with the regulatory
sectors are much more open and so
they're able to lend their partners so
that was kind of the first component and
then when you look at kiva 95 or ninety
percent of people never take their money
out of the system most people consider
it kind of a donation and so we thought
that making it tax-deductible making it
a donation that will always be used for
loan capital in the future allowing you
to reinvest your funds would have that
same kind of impact
how do we measure the success well I
mean at this point we we launched our
website two months ago and so we are
just kind of in the nascent stages of
building but i mean i would say that we
would measure our success by the amount
of bars that we can support the number
of field partners we're working with the
number of contributors we get online
those would be like the major kind of
matrices yes um sorry his question was
ways of evaluating the impact of our
field partners on the borrower's i would
say that kind of in the long term we'd
really like to implement some like
social impact studies where you know the
field partners are you know in creating
the borrower profiles have to log in all
of this information about the borrowers
so if we could add on some additional
kind of data points that could measure
borrower impact over time that would be
a really good way that we're hoping to
eventually kind of measure their social
impact because that's important I mean
even in evaluating our partners one
issue I find is usually the institutions
that seem like they're safer bets to
work with are ones where they're in a
kind of an easier situation their
borrowers aren't quite as poor there
closer to cities and so you have the
whole like idea of like some
institutions that don't seem as strong
but they're really helping the poor
versus other institutions that seem
really robust but that's not the person
that you necessarily want to donate ten
dollars to support their loan and so I
think taking in to account kind of the
social impact of the organization is
really important
borrowers
so his question was the technology gap
what's so interesting in China's you can
be anywhere in China and get cell phone
reception like you can be hiking and
trekking on the Tibetan Plateau and get
cell phone reception which is crazy
because when I'm here in Oakland I don't
get reception at my home and kind of the
same with the internet every rural China
is very different than rural us and that
like you'll be in a very rural area and
there's always like what they call a
town which will have somewhere between
10 and 40 thousand people and those
towns will always be logged like hooked
up to the internet they have internet
bars and cafes for example our partner
in rural Sichuan each one of their
branches has internet access which is
very important for them because then
they can record all of the repayments
distributions and whatnot and be able to
track all of that stuff as opposed to
say like India where you know just
electricity is shoddy not to mention
Internet access and those kind of issues
a lot are a lot more complicated
Oh
would you so your question is how that
they chose the fifteen to twenty percent
interest rate it's basically they're
trying to reach operational
self-sufficiency would be which would
basically mean that they're able to
cover their costs and hopefully they
would charge to interest rate where
they're able to cover the cost of
depreciation and kind of compensate for
inflation and that interest rate that
they have is actually really low
compared to the international benchmarks
for like a sustainable level of interest
rates which is around thirty to forty
percent and I see you cringing but I
mean when you think about say like our
field partner in inner mongolia they
have a branch where some of the
borrowers live 100 kilometers away from
their branch and so you know before they
even get a client online they have to
first do kind of a promotional thing for
people to realize what microfinance is
and then if borrowers come and decide to
apply for loans they the loan officer
will first go and do a thorough
evaluation of the borrower interviewing
them but also interviewing their the
stakeholders and community their friends
and their family to kind of cross check
the information then you'll have a
director from the branch go in and visit
the borrower and then once the loan is
distributed every two weeks they'll have
to travel 100 kilometers to collect
those loans and provide training and
support and so when you think that maybe
that village has 20 borrowers each
taking out three hundred dollar loans
the cost of you know say 20 hundred
kilometer round trips just gets
incredibly high
yeah so our first requirements for field
partners is that they have to have at
least ninety-five percent on time
repayment rates they have to have
transparent management systems and both
the desire and kind of the capacity to
scale because one thing we've discovered
and I'm sure everyone in venture capital
or whatnot has discovered this as well
is it's really the leaders of the
institution that will drive whether they
kind of stay small and really stay in
the position where they are or work hard
enough to kind of get that capital to
expand to more borrowers so first of all
we look at their leaders and then if
they pass those basic requirements will
go down and do a visit usually the
institutions have between two and thirty
five hundred two thousand thirty five
hundred borrowers they have a staff of
about between maybe twenty and thirty
people the majority of them maybe
they'll have like a director a vice
director someone who does if they have
IT systems the management information
systems they'll have a cashier an
accountant and then they'll have
branches and have a director and then
loan officers so the majority of the
staffers loan officers who are just
