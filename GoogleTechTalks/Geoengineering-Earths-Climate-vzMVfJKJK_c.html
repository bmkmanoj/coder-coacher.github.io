Ken thanks
so today I'm going to speak about
geoengineering Earth's climate and I'll
explain what I mean by that in just a
second but you know an alternate title
and perhaps the topic of my talk is this
question of is it time to start working
on a climate emergency response system
that you know we hear a lot about the
threat that there might be some kind of
climate catastrophe or climate emergency
where that's poorly defined and
different people have their own ideas of
what would constitute an emergency but
you know I would just suggest that it's
time for us to start thinking about what
we would do if something goes seriously
wrong with our climate system one of the
things that leads me to be interested in
this kind of work is the record or the
record of our carbon dioxide emissions
and what you see on this figure is a
number of the major I P CC carbon
dioxide emission scenarios developed in
the 1990s overlain with two estimates of
actual carbon dioxide emissions and what
we see is that carbon dioxide emissions
today or at or above the emission rates
for seen in the most pessimistic of the
IPCC scenarios and that over the past
few years co2 emissions have been rising
much more rapidly than in any of these
scenarios and there are several reasons
why this is happening one is the high
price of oil is pushing people towards
coal which is much more carbon emission
per unit energy derived and then also
the rapid development of China and India
and other countries are making co2
emissions rise very rapidly the I mean
the the subject of this talk is not the
scale of effort needed to transform our
energy system but suffice to say that
it's truly a Herculean task which we
could do if we set about doing it as a
society but at least as indicated by
carbon dioxide emissions so far that
we've done essentially nothing effective
to reverse the increasing co2 content
also as we know that sea ice is
disappearing rapidly a number of other
indicators that climate is changing very
rapidly you know are presenting
themselves and and so while it would be
nice if we would reduce and eliminate
carbon dioxide emissions as soon as
possible that we don't seem to be doing
this and so we might think about well
what do we do if our efforts to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions don't avoid
dangerous interference with the climate
system so you know I've been in this
business long enough that I remember
when people used to show maps so what
kinds of temperature changes might occur
from a doubling of atmospheric carbon
dioxide content and people used to
pretend present these figures as oh this
is how bad things could be if we don't
wise up soon and really we've gotten to
the point where we're showing these kind
of maps and saying well this is how good
things could be if we work really hard
to transform our energy system because
they get much below a doubling of co2
would really I mean we can do it but we
really would need to more or less stop
making carbon dioxide emitting devices
as soon as possible so you know what are
the strategies to stabilize climate or
or at least to stabilize climate and we
can think of four major categories one
is to diminish induce energy demand and
that basically means either improving
efficiency or having sectoral shifts so
that we use you know start using books
instead of writing four-wheel drives
through the deserts or something or or
just conserve and do with less the next
major category is to produce energy
without carbon dioxide emission this
could be renewable energy sources or
perhaps nuclear sources and then there's
the idea of actively removing carbon
dioxide and other gases from the
atmosphere but these three methods all
affect the amount of heat radiation that
escapes from there a surface to space
and an alternate approach is to reduce
the amount of sunlight absorbed by the
earth and the basic idea is that the
earth is heated by the Sun and then it
cools off by radiating that energy to
space as long wave heat radiation and so
if the earth is having more difficulty
radiating out to space well one way to
compensate that is to reduce the amount
of sunlight that the earth absorbs and
so in the context of this talk other
people have different definitions I'm
going to use geoengineering to refer to
the intentional large-scale manipulation
of Earth's radiation balance and more
particularly I'm going to focus on the
intentional large-scale effort to reduce
the absorption of sunlight by the earth
and so there are a few different schemes
that have been proposed
here's a little picture of the Sun the
earth revolving around the Sun there's a
mark there Marcus
one over here it's a mark by the X and
that's a point at which the
gravitational forces of the Sun and the
earth are balanced when you also take
into account the apparent centrifugal
forces and so on so a something placed
at this l1 point is is is neither pulled
towards the Sun or the earth although
it's an unstable saddled there's the
unstable center you study say so you
need some controls to keep things there
but it wouldn't take large amounts of
energy so one idea is to basically block
the Sun by putting satellites or
reflectors or deflectors and million
miles out in space between the Earth and
the Sun what I think is a more practical
idea is that putting particles in the
stratosphere to deflect sunlight back to
space
and people have also suggested putting
whitening clouds over the ocean and then
well it might not fit with a large scale
idea that idea is you could also lighten
the Earth's surface by you say making
roofs wider or making roads wider and
all these things would help to cool the
earth but what's the scale of what we're
talking about that each doubling of co2
in the atmosphere so if you take the
amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere and you double that that that
prevents about instantaneously prevents
about two times ten to the fifteenth
watts of energy from escaping to space
now just two for comparison right now
we're using more or less the human
civilization is using something like 15
times 10 to the 12 watts so if we call
that 2 times out of 12 us is something
the amount of energy used by a
civilization is less than 1/1000 of what
the amount of energy trapped by a
doubling of co2 content in the
atmosphere the contrast the earth is
absorbing over 10 to the 17
swats at any given time and so if we
just divide these two numbers we'd say
that if we wanted to have the earth
absorbed roughly 2 times 10 to the 15th
watts less energy we would need to
deflect about 1.7 percent of the
sunlight coming into the earth and okay
and so now that the earth happens to be
a big place and so if if you if you said
that we're going to do this in the
stratosphere and so then you need to cut
to to block 1.7 percent of the whole
spherical area of the earth this ends up
being eight and a half million square
kilometres so you could think of this as
this was a patch a thousand by a
thousand kilometers on the side you need
to block eight and a half of those which
is pretty big now
because with the geometry the earth if
you do put something between the earth
and the Sun you just need to block the
disk area not the whole spherical area
of the earth and so now we're talking
about two million square kilometres
still rather large structure if you're
going to build a structure like that out
in space so you know if we if we so I
mean my basic point is I think this idea
of building this out in space is not
really practical and whereas I think
this one is eminently doable one of you
know just be a little disorganized in
this talk the geoengineering has been
proposed to play at least two kinds of
roles one is sort of as somehow a
replacement for co2 emissions reduction
an idea is that oh if we want to limit
ourselves to some amount of warming that
we can continue emitting more co2 and
then you try to Geoengineer the planet
to reverse that and and another view is
what I'm presenting this as is some kind
of emergency response system that if
something really catastrophic happens
that you'd take these desperate measures
and
this idea of building something out in
space this size would take a long time
to do whereas I'm going to argue that
you could do you can put particles in
the stratosphere very quickly and so
this I think the space based options
won't really work as an emergency
response system to give you an idea of
how fast you'd need to build these
things that so we said each doubling of
co2 in the atmosphere traps 2 times 10
to the 15th watts if we say this is
doubling is occurring on the century
time scale then that means that the
radiative forcing from the co2 is
increasing attend to 2 times 10 to the
13th watts per year which is okay about
twice or somewhat more than the total
energy consumption by mankind and so the
rate that would is six the rate which
this radio forcing is increasing is 600
kilowatts per second and so if you
wanted to match this with geoengineering
you need to block another 600 kilowatts
of incoming energy every second and you
know I won't go through all the dragging
you through all the calculation of the
numbers of it but you know if you wanted
to do this with a space-based option
you'd need to build 54 square kilometers
of satellite a day which is you know
more than a kilometer every half hour
and that's just such a Herculean
undertaking that you know I would say
it's just easier to transform our energy
system and and so I think the
space-based options are interesting to
think about but not really practical
from either emergency response system or
even if you just want to avoid it
doesn't seem an attractive alternative
to avoiding co2 emissions on the other
hand you'd think ok because the
stratospheric system is working on the
whole surface out of the earth you need
four times as much area because it's not
just the disk area and so well if we
needed 54 square kilometres for the disc
one we're going to need it over 200
square kilometers a day or for this
system and isn't that worse and
the answer is that it's not really worse
and and small let's just through this
miracle area that if you want to get
particles with an area of 8 million
square kilometers and you make them out
of one point one micron particles which
happen to be the best size particle for
for this process that that this that
point one micron particles that would
have an area of 8 million square
kilometers would be a cube only 100
square meters on a side so basically if
you could take a cube of 100 meters by
100 meters 100 meters grind it into 0.1
micron particles and loft it into the
stratosphere that would be the right
amount of material and I'm
oversimplifying because the radiative
properties of particles don't follow
simple geometry but just is that this is
the right order of magnitude the and
this is less than the amount of material
that Mount Pinatubo which was a volcano
in 1991 put up in the stratosphere and
you know we could basically do the same
kind of thing and put you know 100 meter
on a side cubes worth of material into
the stratosphere and that would be more
or less enough to compensate on a global
mean basis for doubling of atmospheric
co2 oh I meant to update this slide this
should be more like 30 years for 50% the
atmosphere there's a time issue here and
that when if you drive a car home today
that about a quarter of the co2 that
comes out of your tailpipe today will
still be in the atmosphere a thousand
years from now and so if you expect to
reverse the effects of co2 release by
geoengineering it you have to set up
some kind of institution that will last
a mighty long time and be able to to
compensate for future missions the yeah
so to compensate for a one ton of co2
which each ton of co2 release blocks
around 600 watts additional radiation
from escaping to space and so you'd need
sort of equivalent of disk area to block
six tenths of a square meter and then
say thirty years later this should be
updated about half of it would be in the
atmosphere maybe 50 years later half of
it would be in the atmosphere it still
has to block a roughly a third of a
square meter in a thousand years this is
you know a sixth of a square meter or so
and so the anyway so you it's there's a
long time to commitment to co2 and
geoengineering systems don't have
intrinsically that same long time
commitment so I'm not you know more of a
climate scientist than an engineer but
there there was a 1992 National Academy
study that looked at different ways that
you could place particles in the
stratosphere and you know I mean the
quickest thing seems to be taking a jet
airplane up and releasing particles at
the back of it or the other thing is to
use high sulfur fuels and and there's
various airplane based systems that
could be deployed pretty much right away
there are other ideas like a balloon
supported smokestack to the stratosphere
or a hose essentially that the
Department of Defense looked at and you
know the thing is that all of these
things look like they would cost in the
low billions of dollars where the cost
of energy system transformation is
thought to be in the high hundreds of
billions of dollars and so economists
who look at this in a purely economic
way and believe these systems will work
that the cost that you know that it
looks a lot cheaper just to try to do
engineer the planet than to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions
of course it's far riskier so one of the
basic things of geoengineering is if you
look at the radiative forcing or the
heat trapped by adding co2 to the
atmosphere from a doubling of co2 this
is season by latitude so this is the
South Pole the North Pole that it's you
see it's more or less three or four
three to five about four watts per
square meter over the whole earth and
it's relatively uniform both seasonally
and latitudinal a whereas if we look at
and then if we were to turn down the Sun
by an equivalent amount we would see
that while the sunlight is mostly at the
equator it's mostly at the high latitude
summers and you know so that a reduction
in sunlight looks nothing like the
pattern from co2 forcing and so why
would you if you trap this much heat and
then reduce this much sunlight with
these different patterns wouldn't you
expect to have different residual
regional climate change and this is
actually what when I started doing this
work I thought it would never work
because I'd say well how could the
climate effects of this change
counteract the climate effects of that
change and we did a number of
simulations there's more recent versions
of and and so this is a two-time co2
simulation using the NCAR community
atmosphere model and here's with 1.8
percent reduction in sunlight it needs a
little more because of some feedbacks
and you can see that over most of the
planet the you know that it does a
really excellent job and if you look at
this seasonally it's doing a pretty good
job seasonally also if you do a standard
thing that meteorologists do is you look
at 30-year time series as for to
establish the climatology and then you
can test statistical significance of
changes against the natural variability
of climate and and so here's for the
double co2 case basically the
temperature change is statistically
significant everywhere for just this 1.8
percent reduction in solar intensity the
there's still some residual
statistically significant climate change
over 12% of the Earth's area at the 5%
level so you'd expect 5% of the earth to
have to have to be statistically
significant just by chance now this is
an untuned system there's if you go back
to this other slide you can see they're
still a little bit of warming at the
poles and you know you can imagine a
system that would put in more aerosols
around the poles and so if I mean this
is the if the most crude thing does this
go to job you would think well something
a little more sophisticated would do a
better job and and then if we look at
precipitation the statistically
significant precipitation that you know
they're basically what you get in a
global warming situation is more net
evaporation around the equator and then
more water vapor transport to the high
latitudes and more precipitation at high
latitudes as a common feature of climate
model simulations and basically what we
found with the geoengineering is that
the in this sort of idealized
geoengineering that precipitation
changes are only statistically
significant over 4% of the Earth's air
you'd expect it to be over 5% just by
chance so basically it's saying it's
doing within the detectability of this
test a perfect job now this is a point
why statistical significance it turns
out there's actually is less
precipitation in this case overall but
and you could and you can that would be
statistically significant if you
averaged over say all the land area the
earth but if you there's enough climate
variability at any given point that it's
not statistically significant at any
given location and so it does it seems
to do a pretty good job both at
reversing changes in temperature and the
hydrological cycle and this is pretty
you know with a very crude approach you
know it's basically just blocking the
Sun on top of atmosphere so you know
it's the first objection
you know we published these kind of
results and people said oh but won't
this hurt
the biosphere because you're reducing
sunlight and plants need sunlight for
photosynthesis and you know there one
observation first of all is that after
Mount Pinatubo by looking at carbon
isotopes you can tell whether carbon is
going into the ocean or the land surface
and and also by looking at oxygen
nitrogen ratios and basically the rate
of co2 increase decreased after Mount
Pinatubo and after some investigation
was concluded that forests actually grew
better even though there was a couple of
percent reduction in sunlight and that's
because while there was maybe something
like a two percent reduction in overall
sunlight there was there was something
like I forget the exact numbers but
maybe something upwards of up to 20
percent of the sunlight was converted
into diffuse radiation the diffuse
radiation is able to penetrate deeper
into forest canopies and it looks like
that photosynthesis and forests actually
went up even though overall sunlight was
reduced because the lower leaves got
more we're better lit and able to grow
more vigorously and so in these
observations after Mount Pinatubo is the
biosphere grew more vigorously the in
our simulations also the biosphere grew
more vigorously in a Geo engineered
world in the sense that the the plants
are constantly trying to get enough co2
for photosynthesis and they're
controlling their stones to model
aperture it's a basically pores on their
leaves in order to get that co2 in and
they open up their their spores or the
stone mates to get the co2 and they lose
water and so by having more co2 in the
atmosphere the plants can keep their
snow mates closed and so they lose less
water and so they use water more
efficiently and this leads to eventually
the biosphere supporting more
productivity and
in at least in our simulations the this
effect hello there and the effect of
sunlight on photosynthesis is basically
linear so then it's sort of a 2%
reduction sunlight is more or less a two
percent reduction in photosynthesis and
so in this simulation at least this co2
water use efficiency effect was much
stronger than the reduction in
photosynthesis due to the reduced
sunlight and the result was that the
biosphere at least in the simulation was
much more vigorous though you know what
that means for the real world
now I have to say that some of my
colleagues have gone around touting this
these kind of results is saying oh this
is encouraging and it says that you know
somehow the world geoengineering world
will be better than even the natural
world and I think this is a misguided
view because especially for natural
ecosystems you know that even even
something that makes that natural
ecosystem grow more vigorously is a is a
perturbation to that natural ecosystems
not necessarily good for the ecosystem
you know we see coach putting more
coastal eutrophication putting more
fertilizers in coastal waters doesn't is
not good for coastal ecosystems it's
disruptive and the same way this could
be disruptive to ecosystems so you know
one of the questions is if we were
confronted by a climate emergency you
know I leave it up to you to define what
that might be
you know how long would it take for a
geoengineering scheme I didn't make the
whole sentence there how long would it
take for a geoengineering scheme to
become effective and we did some
simulations last year published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences where we basically turned on
geoengineering schemes and so we had
this background red curve which was a
global warming simulation one of the
IPCC scenarios and then you know at
different years kind of turning on
geoengineering to try to reverse this
and as you can see that you know that
effect the temperature effects are seen
you know in the subsequent year or even
or almost immediately and the same is
true of Mount Pinatubo the next year
was cooler and that a continues cooling
very dramatically for a decade or two
and then you have slower cooling after
that and so you know and in contrast if
you would say well what is the time
scale for response to a change after
reduction in co2 emission that you know
that even if you even if we eliminated
emissions entirely tomorrow that that
would be enough to stabilize
temperatures but not reduce temperatures
and that the the full climate affected
the co2 emission or most of the kind of
effect of the co2 emissions not felt for
several decades and so as I said even if
we went to zero emissions tomorrow that
would be just enough to stabilize
temperature and not even reduce
temperature and so if we were confronted
with some kind of catastrophic situation
that that really emissions reduction is
not even an option for reducing
temperatures in the short term but these
do engineering schemes are this is sort
of the flip side of that is that if you
had a geoengineering scheme and and you
were keeping your earth cool and then
the system should fail at some point is
you'd get the opposite thing that you'd
get a huge amount of warming right away
and so you know and this could fail you
there for technical reasons or political
reasons or there could be a war or
something and so if you were masking
huge amounts of warming by doing these
geoengineering options and they failed
you could get rates of warming that were
I'd say 20 times faster than what other
than otherwise would have occurred the
the other point here on this figure said
that we really don't know how much the
earth will warm due to a doubling of co2
there's an uncertainty in climate
sensitivity and if you continue
geoengineering the planet you might
never actually find out what climate
sensitivity is and so the dashed lines
are a case where the earth is is very
sensitive to to increasing co2 content
the solid lines are where it's less
sensitive and so in the Geo engineered
case you're both in those purple lines
at the bottom basic
you know you're you're down here and and
you're masking climate change and if you
stop the system if climate sensitive is
high sort of rebound up towards that
dashed line if it's low or you'd rebound
towards that line and so anyway
geoengineering might prevent us from
learning how much climate change we're
masking so you know geoengineering the
whole earth is a little scary and you
know so some people said well could we
do things at a regional scale and so we
started looking at the idea of since the
Arctic seems to be the ecosystem that's
disappearing the fastest with sea ice
being lost and the southern end of
Greenland possibly collapsing and so on
and the tundra melting and releasing
additional carbon to the atmosphere you
know the question is well could we at
least do something to prevent that and
avoid while avoiding some kind of global
scale action and this actually comes
into the issue of what is a climate
emergency that for example Tom Wiggly
from the National Center of Atmospheric
Research is basically you know after
some testing more or less ready now to
start geoengineering the Arctic because
he feels like we're already in what he
would consider to be a climate emergency
in the sense that we're looks like we're
losing a major ecosystem or biome type
in the world and also risking the loss
of Greenland and that to him there's
enough risk to want to start thinking
about seriously deploying these kind of
schemes so we did some simulations where
we just removed the you know but what is
this point three seven percent of
incoming solar installation and we just
took a nick out of the sunlight coming
in at the highest latitude areas and
they say okay what would this do to
climb it you know so what if we just put
and the the 61 degrees extends over
Alaska 71 degrees extends basically over
the Arctic Ocean and so this one would
say what's the block twenty-five percent
of the sunlight over the Arctic Ocean
and then this one would say let's block
ten percent of the Sun
going down to a latitude that would
include Alaska and parts of Norway and
Sweden Scandinavian Russia northern
Russia and so on and and and so this was
right so once taking 10% out north of 61
degrees one's taking 25% now at North of
71 degrees so this is then this is the
same figure you saw before of the double
co2 warming and then this is the effect
of taking a quarter of the radiation out
north of 71 degrees and so this is
basically just over the Arctic Ocean and
you know wait and what you see is
actually it's a bit of an overkill that
it's actually cooling now over the
Arctic so you'd probably want to do more
like 21% or something like this and you
can see that the cooling effect extends
down into the the confidence of the
northern hemisphere so you get some
cooling further south and okay let's
just do that and so then if we do the
10% north of 61 degrees and so 61
degrees is is more or less you know
basically the southern end of Alaska so
you're getting this ones do going over
where people are living and so it would
be more controversial I guess both of
them would be incredibly controversial
but again here you see that for removing
10% of the radiation or the 61 degrees
you get significant cooling over you
know all of the northern hemisphere
continents and if we look at sea ice
extent why should show a more recent map
because this year I think they're the CR
last year when sea ice was at an
all-time minimum but you know basically
the Arctic sea ice is getting lost
faster than anybody anticipated also
there's some indications that the
southern end of Greenland
may be beginning to collapse this
somewhat controversial and so we you
know looked at you know the sea ice in
these simulations and say could we get
the sea ice to recover and you know
here's the the control case the sort of
natural state here's the two times co2
we're basically in this simulation just
have a little
of a pretty dense sea-ice and then a lot
of sort of discontinuous sea ice and
basically both of these two
geoengineering cases sort of have
created a little bit too much sea ice
and we did a bunch of other simulations
and more or less it's within our
technological capability to make however
i've seen much sea ice we want the so
it's here's the for the Arctic the
temperature changes that we predicted
using I mean weather models predicted
and so here's the warming over the
Arctic for this model which is again the
National Center for Atmospheric Research
model you know for the Arctic for a
doubling of co2 and so we sort of
overdid it a little bit with this 25
percent north of 71 degrees and under
Dennis a little with the 10% north of 61
degrees but basically you could see that
by turning the knobs you could get the
Arctic to be zero temperature change an
interesting thing is that you you don't
do very much to reduce Arctic
precipitation and that's because
precipitant
you engineered the whole world the well
precipitation reduced a little bit or
somewhat that basically at a point by
point basis there was no statistical
change in precipitation we do the Arctic
only there's still lots more
precipitation in the Arctic and that's
because the high latitude precipitation
is driven by evaporation in lower
latitudes and then that water vapor
transport to the high latitudes and by
geoengineering the Arctic you're not
doing anything to reduce the evaporation
in equatorial regions and so the result
is that you get much more snow because
now you've cooled things off but you're
getting more or less the same amount of
precipitation and so you've got a much
snowing or Arctic and you know and so
some people would say okay well this is
an imperfect climate you know
modification you know other people like
mike macaque
said well maybe this is what you want to
do because if you're worried about
Greenland collapsing what you want to do
is put as much snow on top of Greenland
as possible and so geoengineering the
Arctic would do it you know another
thing that's been raised is this issue
of well won't this destroy the ozone
layer if you put a bunch of particles in
in the stratosphere and certainly this
needs more attention but you know the
first thing we can see is what happened
after Mount Pinatubo and so this is 1991
Mount Pinatubo going off though just so
you see the scale here this is a measure
of the amount of ozone in the atmosphere
and so this is 280 people in 280
thousand units 290 300 and so the
estimates are that there was something
like a 3% reduction in total ozone after
Mount Pinatubo you know but it's hard to
say what's what's due to shifts and you
know it was this the particles from
Mount Pinatubo only stayed there for a
year or two and there's problems of
inter calibrating units and so I mean
different satellites and so on but
basically well there might be a couple
of percent reduction in stratospheric
ozone that it wasn't a major effect
furthermore the destruction of the ozone
depends on having chlorine in the
stratosphere from CFCs and because of
the Montreal protocols and the reduction
CFC use that the chlorine in the
stratosphere is decreasing and by
mid-century it's thought that there'll
be so little chlorine in the
stratosphere that even if we threw a
bunch of particles in it would have
virtually no detectable effect on ozone
and so again well this is a research
issue there's no evidence that there
would be any major destruction of the
ozone layer or anything like that you
know these are all preliminary results
so you know what are some of the
concerns and that I think they're well
one is the ozone layer which obviously
if it destroyed the ozone layer that
would be a bad thing the but you know
there's another kind of thing that many
people including myself are worried
about and that is just that the
perception that there's a technical fix
could reduce pressure to reduce co2
emissions and that you know if if say
these preliminary preliminary
simulations indicate well while there
are some problems that these schemes
would basically work that it's a
rational you know if if the existence of
these schemes reduces downside risk a
rational response is to engage in
riskier behavior right so if you if
flood insurance is available it can
become rational to build a house in a
floodplain whereas if you didn't have
flood insurance that might be irrational
behavior and so insofar as there is some
kind of potential for insurance against
some kind of climate catastrophe that
this could you know the logical response
is to work less hard to reduce co2
emissions and so this is a danger and
the other thing is just this unintended
environmental surprise isn't that you
know nobody predicted the ozone hole
from CFC emissions nobody predicted that
LED and gasoline would damage children's
brains and nobody predicted that the MT
be put in our gasoline would pollute our
groundwater and so you know and if you
look at the history of you know in
Australia where they would introduce you
know cane toads to eat something else
that was eating something else there are
history of interventions and natural
systems is one of you know where the
system responds in some unanticipated
way and so you know you could be sure
that whatever we have in our models if
you actually did this something would
happen that's not represented in the
models and so anyway it would council in
favor of a cautious approach I guess
that's one other thing I want to bring
up and that's the whole issue of ocean
acidification
my post-doc long cow here and myself
have been doing some work on the effects
of carbon dioxide on the marine
environment and if you see these what
dots over here represent the location of
coral reefs and this represents 280 ppm
is there the concentration of co2 in the
atmosphere before the Industrial
Revolution and you can see almost most
of the corals are in this blue zone
where where aragonite saturation is
greater than 4 this is a measure of the
sort of the chemical potential of the
ocean that's helping to drive coral
skeletal development and then there are
a few corals and these sort of green
colors like you hear off the coast of
Australia or you know anyway in a few
places you get some corals and the
greens but basically by the time you're
in the yellow is there's no corals that
are able to live in you know sustainably
in those kind of environments and so if
we see how this is marching into the
future that you know that things look
pretty dismal that but even by the time
say you're at 560 ppm which is a
doubling of co2 you've basically lost
all the water in the ocean with the kind
of chemistry where corals have been
found living sustainably and so I think
there's at least an expectation that if
not an expectation
anyway I would say for me it's an
expectation that at a sort of doubling
of co2 that coral reefs will no longer
be able to sustain themselves in the
ocean I said to say that they'll die off
right away but it's a question of
ecological competition that you know if
a ragged saturation is somewhere down
here say these orange colors that a
coral might be able to survive but if
there was a hurricane or some kind of
disturbance and then it comes time to
repopulate that area it's likely that
that
you know seagrasses or allergies or
something else will occupy that space I
guess the other thing I want to say is
this purple color the shells of some
marine organisms will actually start
dissolving in these areas and there are
marine organisms that live in the ocean
that make their shells out of this
mineral calcium carbonate and you know
by the end of this century in around mid
century with here it's only 400 people
400 something ppm before some shells
start dissolving the ocean and so you
know that basically unless we reduce I
think unless we reduce co2 emissions
very soon major components of our marine
ecosystems will be gone and I don't need
to go into these issues but so the point
is is that while these geoengineering
can might be able to undo some of the
negative effects of climate change their
chemical effects of co2 that they will
do nothing about and those and
themselves I think are sufficient reason
to reduce co2 emissions so I guess what
I want to say here is that that you know
this whole area is in its infancy
there's basically been almost zero money
and it's starting to change a little bit
but say up until last year not a single
dollar of federal research money had
ever been applied to geoengineering
research not that the Bush
administration is ideologically opposed
to these kind of things but I think it's
just so politically a hot potato that
they didn't want to touch it that the
preliminary results indicate that a high
co2 world with geoengineering maybe more
similar to the pre-industrial world and
would be a high co2 world without you
engineering so it's not saying that a
Geoengineer world is somehow better than
the natural world but the you know it's
it's it's not it seems hard to argue
that a high co2 world with lots of
climate change is better than a high co2
world without lots of climate change I
guess the other conclusion here is that
the Geoengineer is something that could
be deployed rapidly in response to a
climate emergency whereas the emission
reduction approaches I would take much
longer and that but you know they sort
of caveat and all this is that the
Earth's systems notoriously complex and
one can assume that tinkering with it on
a global scale will produce
unanticipated outcomes which is pretty
scary because you know if we do any
irreversible damage there's not much you
can do about it
so but you know I don't think it's a
simple thing and you know especially
saying with this Arctic case is supposed
to tug at your heartstrings that you
know that is it you know which is the
really more environmentally and green
environmentally conscious thing to do is
it better just to let Arctic ecosystems
disappear and they biota that lives in
those ecosystems or is it better to put
some particles in the stratosphere over
the Arctic and you know I don't think
it's obvious which is the more
environmentally sensitive thing to do is
it environmentally sensitive just to let
Arctic ecosystems disappear and you know
it obviously it's best to get rid of co2
emissions but on my as my earliest slide
showed we don't seem to be doing that
yet and there's I think actually slided
stole from Marty Hoff and changed it a
little bit but you know that it seems to
me that we you know that we need you
know they're basically we need to if we
if we assume that we want the world to
develop and we an industrialized world
can say oh well we don't need to develop
more but it's certainly if you're in
Africa or many other places development
seems like an obviously good thing but
you know we can either develop in ways I
say by putting out lots of carb
coal-fired power plants and then trying
to Geoengineer our damages around this
or we can develop approaches for growth
and developing well diminishing
environmental risk and methanol you know
I know you guys are investing in high
altitude wind power there are different
designs but you know I really think that
I mean the ultimate thing we need to
develop our new energy systems that can
fuel growth and development and our
industrialized world without damaging
the
environment but you know it seems that
we're getting there way too slowly and
that we really need to start thinking
about our our insurance policies of what
will we do if things really go around so
I think I'll just close it there any
questions could you use the mic over
there would be the best thing it strikes
me as a little I'm not sure what word
I'm blocked on let me phrase it
differently you talked about how we
should be doing controlled and
thoughtful development of our energy
resources because the alternative which
is unplanned growth and has all this
risk is probably bad nefarious and I
agree with that and if that slide were
your only slide that would probably be
great but you just went through this
whole presentation at the end of it you
said basically we have no idea what the
consequences of this kind of meddling
and the earth ecosystem would produce
and furthermore what you didn't say was
that these climate models are not even
necessarily accurate representations of
your system so yeah that's true but I
don't see that you've proven or even
suggested that geoengineering is even
our same thing to to do without some
sort of science behind it you know what
you could build a simulation of anything
and say look at these graphs it produces
yeah
I mean I what could I say I could say
that these climate models are the same
climate models are used to predict what
might happen from continues to into a
mission and you know it's known that
these models are deficient and I mean
that's why we don't know how much
warming they'll be and and you also you
know and I think I said several times
that we would anticipate that it
wouldn't work the way the models say
that there would be surprises but now
some of these simulations have been done
in a number of different models and also
there are some basic physics reasons why
it seems it works and one of the main
things is that it turns out that sea ice
is a really important component in the
climate system in that if you have sea
ice in the winter in high latitudes that
insulates the atmosphere from the ocean
and allows the atmosphere to get very
cold and if you melt the sea ice then in
the summertime all kinds of heat can run
into the ocean and in the wintertime
that he can run out of the ocean and and
it seems that and those flat heat fluxes
associated with having sea ice or not
having sea ice can be on the order of
100 watts per square meter whereas the
radiative forcing from co2 doubling say
4 watts per meter squared and and so if
you get the sea ice back to where it is
then you get these sort of hundred watt
per square meter fluxes back to where
they were before and the climate gets
closer to its base state now you know
that I don't think you know the reason I
mean I think people who've been talking
about this would say ok well in the
polar winter the air mixes vertically in
this wintertime and so if you threw some
particles in in the spring they would
presumably get rained out in the in the
in the next winter now I'm not
advocating doing this but people who are
advocating doing it we would say okay
you would start you know with this kind
of phase thing and see what happens if
nothing bad happens and try it for two
years three years if it works good you
extend it so I think even the people who
think it's ready to deploy these kind of
things would see some kind of phased and
gradual phase and so you'd be you'd you
know there'd be some feedback so you see
if something bad is happening myself I
think if you tried anything like this
where there's something short of mass
famine in the developed world that you
would have so many protesters in the
street and people would lose elections
you know that I think a politician who
said all that Spray particles in the
stratosphere you know I don't think
that's going to win them elections so
you know I think it would not my guess
is this won't get deployed
unless there's real like starvation in
the developed world okay but but I think
by then the danger is that a politician
will go and do something crazy like
maybe he'll put this there's you know
there'll be such political demand to do
something that they'll start spraying
sulfate particles all over the place and
then maybe something really disastrous
would happen and so I think it's worth
doing the research upfront to have some
idea of what might happen but I don't
think it would get deployed in a
practical sense outside of something
pretty clearly catastrophic going on but
it's just my own personal view yes I was
just wondering given the examples we
were showing of having the sort of
targeted aerosol I'd like over just the
arctic cap etc how would you keep the
particles isolated once they're up in
the stratosphere he's wondering this was
idealized they wouldn't really say that
in fact Phil Wragge has recently done a
simulation with particles and car and
and they would you know basically
in the general stratospheric circulation
is right you know
upwelling at the equators and
downwelling at the poles and so to a
first approximation if you put something
in its some lab latitude it would tend
to go north and go down but it doesn't I
mean there's sort of quasi diffusion and
it wouldn't really be as neat as this is
the answer yes okay so maybe we'll hold
it there I thank you for your attendance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
