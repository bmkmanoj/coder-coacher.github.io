was doing a Google search of all things
and I came across an interesting fact in
2004 gross Pulitzer and wilt siq won the
nobel prize in physics for the work on
the strong force that binds quarks
together now after discovered that Roger
Eddie had nothing to do with that group
and he has never won the nobel prize in
physics although he's won just about
every prize in computer science that
counts including the most important one
the Turing award as well as the cow
apprised the honda prize and the French
Legion of Honor Award now so why did I
mention that stuff about the quarks it's
because I personally have this theory
that Raj is the strong force that binds
together the community computer science
community and more than anybody else I
think he's the one who's tried to make
computer science get out into the lives
of people in the developing world and
help them and help us help bring
computing and communication technology
to them he's also he's run the world's
premier robotics lab for two decades and
the decade after that he ran one of the
world's premier computer science
departments at CMU I'm from Berkeley so
I have to say one of rather than the
he's the founder of the PCT VT project
which I'm sure he'll tell you about in
the million books project for the
millions book project he was the first
and I believe only person in the history
of the world to get the presidents of
India and China to write a letter and
put their signature on the same letter
to get them to agree to a project so he
is truly an irresistible force and we're
glad to have him on our side and we're
happy to welcome him to Google
thank you Peter so I'm not sure I need
the microphone but it's kind of noisy
I'll try to use it so the talk today is
not about emerging world or million
books or a number of other things we
could have talked about but I came here
with a mission the mission I have is
google is not doing enough about
organizing the information about the
world and there are lots of things
you're leaving behind I want to tell you
about them and then hope that some of
you the younger generation will will
actually pick them up and transform the
way we access and use information so
this particular talk was in was inspired
by my colleague carbonell Jaime
carbonell who is the head of the
language technology institute is one of
the leading figures in language
processing for those of you who don't
know ancient history the first web
crawler and Google and the search engine
was built by one of the sternum Jaime
students fuzzy malden called lycos the
rest is history as they say and that was
in 1994 and so one of the things that
Jaime said was when he was trying to
explain to someone what is the purpose
of the language in technology institute
what does it what will he do or what
does it do he said it is to provide the
right information to the right people in
the right time frame in the right
language in the right level of
granularity and he had a few other
rights and which over the period of time
we were jokingly used to call the Bill
of Rights of the information society
okay so but when I kept thinking about
it and I would kind of bug him and
saying why aren't you doing all the
research that needs to be done in this
thing it is that's too big you know we
don't have enough money to do all the
things not even google has all the money
to do all of it but so but the important
issue is
when you look at the world's information
with this prism and say how do we what
does it mean the first place what
research has to be done to get there and
will we ever get there and and and if
you do how will we know whether we've
succeeded or not so that's this is the
challenge and so and I don't think I
have the answer I don't even think i'll
be presenting all the facets of it the
purpose of my coming here and it kind of
giving the stock is to stimulate each of
you and perhaps even have a dialogue i
don't think we can in this kind of forum
but we might have a dialogue afterwards
if you come to Carnegie Mellon we will
have a which is right next door here
Carnegie Mellon vest in the NASA park we
can have a brainstorming session so so
that's the purpose of this talk so the
in here more there are more than five
here the right information to the right
people at the right time in the right
language in the right level of detail in
the right medium and the last one is an
issue that's very important if you
happen to be an illiterate person in a
village you know you don't know how to
read or write especially you don't know
anything about English and so you better
have to be able to provide the
information I'm looking for in my local
language but more importantly using
audio and video not text ok and so the
right medium also becomes an important
part of the research agenda that one
needs to look at ok so they as soon as
you use those words they implies certain
kinds of research search engines
classification of information into the
right chunks and right formats and right
time frame and security analysis machine
translation summarization speech input
output all of these things are video
input output to
and but they are not they're part of
this solution but not this Empire
solution the right information just
doesn't mean searching something and
displaying a list of all the
possibilities the it may be the right
information with our clutter right and
and the question of how do you kind of
get only the right information not you
know everything else under the Sun
perhaps maybe one way of looking at it
and another way of saying it is if
you're a kid going to school the right
information to you is knowing about the
things that were discussed in the class
today or if you're about to get married
you knowing the information about what
where to get all the relevant you know
wedding planners and all kinds of other
things solutions for that particular
situation so the right information has
many context many connotations different
in different kind of two different
people at different times so the right
is very difficult to define I'm finding
and I don't know what the right answer
is but I'm just giving you examples of
this the right people you know is again
something that you can define if you're
about to get to be hit by tsunami you
don't want it you know it doesn't matter
if you broadcast it to the whole country
of in the inner Thailand is the people
on the shore that are in a sunbathing or
in the end in or fishing or something
that are going to be impacted but they
have the ones that need to get the
information and by the way they don't
have days or hours or something and
furthermore it is a push technology not
Apple technology so you have to be able
to kind of figure out how do you get the
information to them in ways that are not
usually kind of where I go and type in
is that a tsunami coming and then if
inertia tells you something about so
there are lots of very you know
complicated complex issues that this set
of Rights that Jaime carbonell proposed
seemed to raise and we don't yet have as
a community language processing
techniques community don't have a broad
research agenda that covers the whole
spectrum of these issues that's the
thesis of my talk basically so now what
I would like to do is can take you
through quickly what we are doing at CMU
which is less than as I was telling my
colleagues which is less than five
percent of what we need to be doing and
and that's rightfully so because we
don't have the resources to do
everything that needs to be done so
since search engines the right
information from the future search
engines how to go beyond the just
relevance to query in popularity I'll
talk about a little bit more second
issue is eliminating massive redundancy
and in the for example if you say type
into Google web based email it should
not result in links to various yahoo
sites promoting their email not even non
yahoo site site in discussing just a via
email richard just a link to yahoo email
gmail msn mail a comparison between them
perhaps that's much more what we call
you no relevance rather than a massive
redundancy into the thing the second
issue is harder to do and we need to
somehow organize the world's information
is way what information is trusted at
what information is just pure marketing
and what information is snake oil
unfortunately the web publishing
paradigm permits all of them to have
equal weight so we need to figure out
how to begin to go towards trusted
information sources at one point I
proposed to my friend Bob Kahn who is
one of the inventors at the IP protocol
and internet that maybe we should have a
triple a web an authentic archival and
always available information
so how do you make sure it's authentic
that means you have to register your
information with some trusted associated
society maybe you know Google could set
up such a thing you can submit your
information you get a checksum or
something and then every time you access
this information if you have changed
anything you say you can it'll say no
it's not authentic anymore and but some
other information you're not getting the
original information that is certified
so if so anybody has changed it
including yourself then it's no longer
the original information that was
certified or trusted this is where the
peer-reviewed journals are there
different than web a web sources of
information and peer review journals are
not on cannot be changed you know that
is they're printed and published and
they're reviewed and somebody certifies
that this is a high quality material and
then it's there forever in that form
they may be wrong or right doesn't
marriage there right so we don't have
trusted sources of information at this
point so I'll talk about these three
subjects maximum marginal relevance and
novelty detection and named entity
extraction as three narrow topics within
this right information which is what
we're doing so most query systems can
simply retrieved everything that's
relevant to the key words that you type
right sometimes that's not enough the
things like novelty timeliness
appropriateness validity
comprehensibility density medium all
kinds of things might be also
appropriate rather than just you know
purely you no relevance to the thing
novelty is non redundancy if you want to
call it that you know if you if there
are 20 different hits or 102 heads that
are more or less saying the same thing
from different sources at different
newspapers are different
locations you have to be able to say
that's all one thing but let me give you
five things that are really different
from each other right and that would be
a desirable outcome for the search
engine so so sorry there's more detail
earlier I don't want to go and go into
the detail but I think you understand so
if you have large number of things in
the central cluster there and there are
lots of outliers you want to pick one
out of each of those and present that
because then it'll be maximally
non-redundant right and that's what
you're looking for so novelty detection
and is another idea name that's usually
irrelevant in newspaper stories usually
one of the things that happens in
newspapers is out of the blue a word
Katrina appears it was never there in
the vocabulary before and suddenly it
takes on a meaning of its own it goes on
and on and on you know for for for a few
days or a few weeks is the the top story
and then it slowly goes away right it
hasn't gone away yet but it will one of
the days so so the detecting of a new
event you know is it turns out to be a
an important aspect of getting the right
information available you know in ways
that's not otherwise the then there's a
whole set of issues about how you do
that cosine similarity tf-idf from
things like that our example so how you
might do this and so there are issues on
how you do the first story detection fsd
sometimes it's called and and then we
categorize these topics these words into
topics and then see if these terms are
maximally differentiating in in the
topics and the second way of doing this
is to use named Stanton situated named
entities like Sharon as a peacemaker so
link detection is once you have the
first story you've detected now you need
to track it over a period of time why is
this important it turns out at any given
point in time when you look at the story
like number of people that died in
Katrina you know I'm for unday one it
might say seven people and their 17 it
might say 3,000 people and then it kind
of maybe cause down or up when I just
like the world trade center and the
total number of people that actually
died changes every day so if you're
trying to kind of find out a fact of how
many people died in Katrina or World
Trade Center disaster you can't simply
pick one of those things that present
all of them you need to find a way of
summarizing or finding the final number
and sometimes it's called non-monotonic
reasoning right where what was true one
day becomes not true the following day
and you know that become not for the
next day at some point it stabilizes and
you know a fact and at some point it
disappears you no longer have that fact
right so if this becomes an interesting
set of issues another problem that
occurs in language processing of this
kind is named entity extraction and this
is important for the usual query type
systems you know who was mentioned for
example when a Peter was talking about
okawa prize or Honda prize when I got it
I didn't know what this prize was you
know i got a letter saying you've been
selected I said what is this price
this before but it turns out to be very
important price in Japan but here in USA
we never hear about it as much but so so
the finding these these things like who
is mentioned what locations what company
is what products turns out to be an
important aspect of finding the right
information okay so here is a story and
what you're trying to do is named entity
of identification and there are a lot of
names and there are a lot of roles
they're playing and the issue is can we
have a system which identifies different
named entities and the relationships to
each of them between what it is that
they're doing and how they're doing it
and so if you can't there are many
techniques for doing it in the finite
state transducers and statistical
learning techniques are two of many so
here are the people that were mentioned
in that story Clinton Kanter hang suzuki
Langford and so on and and places how
did you know this your people and how
did you notice your places and it turns
out is not a big deal you once you have
this thing categorized in your knowledge
base and with appropriate labels you
know you can do this but you don't
always have all the relevant information
you know you may you know come across a
name that you've never seen before or a
name of a place that you've never seen
before and it's not uncommon for many of
us when presented with a foreign name to
know whether it's a man or a woman and
many times we make the mistake of
calling hey he or she when it's the
opposite is actually true so so the
roles that they play turns out to be
important also you wanted to say who
participated in this meeting who is the
host country
or who was the host what was discussed
who was absent at this meeting these
kinds of questions come up all the time
and he's not exactly stated in the story
it is not explicitly there you have to
infer it from the meaning of the
language most of us don't have any
problem inferring that that that those
relationships but systems do right so
there are a number of emerging methods
and here is a who does what to whom
relation or the entity extraction
problem and and so you know what this is
very useful if you're going from
unstructured data to steamy sex or data
like in a database sense if you wanted
to organize the information into a table
then you need certain tools of going
from unstructured information to
structure image our semi structured
information so those give you a kind of
two or three topics that we are working
on at CMU namely into the extraction
novelty detection for story detection
and maximal relevance marginal relevance
and so the next topic is the right
people again the right people is a very
complicated phrase to define you know if
a seven-year-old is working on a school
project and he or she searches for heart
care or heart attack or whatever and
then the kind of stories you might want
to retrieve for this right this person
would be very different than if you're a
doctor and asking for the same question
as in the same question so each person
based on their context and situation and
so on needs to be provided with a very
different set of information you know
every once you see the example it's
obvious
but the issue of how the the system are
individuals inverts people how would
they know what the right information is
and most of us have benefit have the
benefit of knowing this person is a
doctor and that person is a kid and
therefore you might be able to provide
the right information but it's not
always obvious right and then there's a
whole set of other affiliations that
also in a kind of force you to select or
subselect information in a particular
way if you're a family group or an
organizational group or stockholder
group or whatever then the information
that you'll be looking for and you might
be provided would be very different from
each other so the right right people
right information to the right people
and so the basic tool that seems to be
needed here is to somehow given a text
classifying it categorizing it and
saying what is this about and how does
it you know group together is it for a
kid potentially is it for an expert and
in between so there may be many
different ways you would organize this
information and that those are ways of
organizing the information is not in the
content you can search for it it's
inferred information and that's where
the complexity comes in so
categorization yahoo for a long time in
the beginning used to do manual
assignment of categories right and in a
reuters for example used for a long time
and coded rules and a lot of the rest of
us use various machine learning
techniques and notice and they're
getting more and more sophisticated as
we go on and seemed to me and then the
issue of whether you can do hierarchical
event classification becomes an
interesting issue
so the right time frame now I used to
think right time frame is as soon as you
know the information send it to me that
turns out to be the wrong strategy I
only want the information when I wanted
just in time information if you send it
you know well in advance you know it'll
sit there and I you'll even lose it
right that's the trouble with our
education today you know you go to
college and you're taught calculus
because 30 years later you might need it
you know by that time you've forgotten
it right so you here to go back and
relearn it so if I to relearn it why
don't they just teach me calculus in one
week instead of one year and then say
even if and when you need it go to
Wikipedia or something and you'll run
the restaurant or you know here is a
learning by doing method of learning
calculus and you can learn it when you
need it right so so that's the kind of
adjusting thanking right information
being for why did well in advance of
when you might need it but this is not
just you know that type of thing all of
us get information about a seminar are
about something I am supposed to do 23
weeks in advance you know if you're like
me which you probably are you're
probably being bombarded with hundreds
of emails every day and you just cannot
keep up with it you know they're my
senior colleague and the only Nobel
Prize winner in our field herb Simon
later observant i used to say we have
the wealth of information but scarcity
of human attention we you know we don't
have enough lifetimes and as human
beings don't follow moore's law right
our capacity has been constant for the
last thousands of years and it's not
going to change soon enough anytime soon
and purely by evolutionary means right
so so the right time frame is defining
it even becomes a very difficult issue
so getting the information to user
exactly when it is needed and you know
immediately when it is requested
pre-positioned
this whole issue of anticipatory
information so for example you know when
you ask one of the in areas of research
we have you know some faculty members
that studied at CMU is what is called
anticipatory computing you know we cache
results all the time right computers
were designed going back to the 60s the
stretch for example would pre-compute
lots of things and then pick one of the
right ones and that type of caching of
the results is common in computer
science so the issue is you know if I
know there are only 40 things I can do
and 38 of them are trivial and can be
done instantaneously two of them require
search or something we may take you know
a minute of time and I don't want you to
wait a minute you can pre-compute it
right and then but you don't present it
you precomputed me and keep it and when
I asked for it you then give it to me
think so that's the kind of the issue
here so things like push technologies
alerts and reminders and breaking news
are also often considered harmful you
know just because you know the the
steelers won the Super Bowl I don't need
to know it in the instant the certain
event has happened in the Super Bowl I
may be in the middle of a meeting I
don't want it alert at that point and if
and when I'm ready to get it I should be
able to see it so there is a whole set
of things that alerts and not always the
right things to do and becomes an
important part of the right information
the right language there there are lots
of that we in us at CMU and many other
places including Google wow there's a
lot of language translation tools and
techniques and unfortunately all of them
tend to be you know not that good and
it's a hard problem it's been a hard
problem will continue to be our problem
but there's a lot that it's known about
how to do
with it and so as one of the reasons you
might want to do the translation is for
multilingual search there it doesn't
matter if the certain of the the
translation is not perfect because
you're not asking the people to read the
translation it's mainly being used as a
way of indexing into various materials
such as trans lingual research language
identification full language
identification turns out to be very
interesting problem you know we one of
the things we're working on is this
million book digital library project
right that is well before Google Google
print going back 25 years ago but one of
the way that we are using in China and
India are partners with us in this
project and they are doing the scanning
and they enter all the metadata and the
scanning is done by high school
graduates at not minimum wage at at some
way that I don't know about because the
government of in China and India are
paying for it and and one and i was
looking at one book it was obviously
French you know vital but the guy didn't
know that and typed it in as German I
said how could you be so stupid I could
you how could you make such a mistake so
you know this young man was obviously
super bright we should be hired by
google came to me and brought a couple
of books and one of them was in gujarati
and another one was in marathi it so
happens even though i'm from india i
don't know either of those languages i
couldn't tell the difference between the
two so you're a PhD you should know this
right either that was I said sorry
you're right so it turns out just
because you know you're educated or
illiterate doesn't mean you know all the
languages you know all the scripts but
it's a very simple problem all that you
see is one or two words of the title you
know and then you can tell most of the
time what language it is so it is a
sparse language machine learning problem
you know most people that learn
we do language detection go look at a
whole page of text and then do a
frequency in account and then say oh
this is this language that's an easy
problem the hard problem is supposing I
only give you three words of the title
can you tell what language it is turns
out you can you know it requires a
little bit more work but so so there's a
issue of a regular translation like the
one that you can get from google and
there's also what we called reading
assistant or on-demand translation let
us say you know learn a little bit of
Italian but not a lot and and you're
starting to read but you come up against
in an email some word or phrase that you
don't understand you should be able to
just select it and get the immediately a
translation but that's much better than
simple translation because now it's in
context so most of us have this problem
especially if you're non-english
non-native english speaking speaker and
you come across a word or a phrase or
even if you're an English speaking
native speaker if you're reading
Shakespeare and there are lots of
phrases there that are not used by us in
today and you need to be able to kind of
have a translation assistant or reading
a system which will give you that is
that you know it's an interesting sub
problem to solve and can be solved in
there therefore all the different
languages transliteration is also turns
out to be a big important problem in the
right language because every language
many languages have different scripts so
it's very interesting especially coming
from India it turns out in India the
sounds of all these languages that the
sounds are the same no matter what
language but the letters are different
but in Europe the lettuce is the same
but the sounds they sound different so
when Unicode was invented you know by
the people in hit the rocks park they
thought all the word in all you have
do is make sure that it is the same
letter no matter in what language it is
you have the same same 8-bit code or
whatever other than 16 beds but they're
turned out to be exactly the wrong thing
for Indian languages you want to be able
to say it no matter what language it
sounds it is cop or key or whatever the
word sellable happens to be and that's
not you know easily identifiable in the
Unicode system as it's currently done
right okay so there's lots of issues on
right language there are many different
techniques that have been tried
statistical translation knowledgebase
translation example based translation
I'm not going to give you a tutorial on
all of these and you can quickly find
out about them of them where things are
going now is the so-called multi-engine
machine translation it turns out none of
no one of these techniques is perfect
their work some of the time they don't
work other times so rather than
depending on the best technique using
them one you say can you actually build
a hybrid system that gets translations
from all of them and then figure out how
to use right so that's the multi-engine
in machine translation and here is an
example of different kinds of
translation ebm tea and semantics in 10
syntactic interlingua r and so on so
here is an e bmt example example based
machine translation and multi-engine
translation won't kind of go through all
of this it is is you know you get three
different translations and it turns out
you need to figure out a way of
selecting the right right ones that
itself is it turns out to be a hard
problem how do you know this is the
right set of things right and and that
is designed that is determined by
looking at the naturalness of the
sentences there there are there ways and
if you ever worked on natural language
generation as opposed to analysis this
is
the issues that you spend time on okay
what we can do in New like new languages
what we cannot do yet okay is an
important set of things I and I assume
you will work on what we call orphan
languages obscure languages that Google
may not be interested in or most people
most you know commercial organizations
would not be interested the reason we
work on these is we get funded by DARPA
DARPA wants to know how to translate
push to into English are so hilly or
some other language and that's not
something that you will normally
consider as a research topic ok the next
interesting aspect of Bill of Rights is
the right level of detail and there are
a number of aspects of level of detail
you know and i will present some of them
here one of them is this issue of if you
have a document if i have a report that
came up on a google search i want to
read it i don't really have the time to
go through 300 pages if there was an
automatic summarization technology that
will produce a summary for me and that
would be very useful and there are such
technique tools and techniques they're
not good but they're okay but and people
stop at that point is really not
adequate what you need is a hierarchical
summarization we know you need a
one-line statement the headlines saying
what is this book about and you need a
paragraph an abstract or something and
then executed summary and a regular
summary and so you can have four or five
levels of detail of the same document
and so so one way we kind of
characterize it is we say 10 word
summary 100 words summary a thousand
words summary of 10,000 person right and
so so information structuring or not
here it's not one ten words it's 20 I
guess headline abstract summary and
document and the scope of the summary
can also be different in different
places you can kind of see what the
issues are and this this two-by-two
matrix is a very illustrative of the
kind of problems that you run into one
of them is when you just don't go to a
generic query like you do unto under
google like right and there you know if
you're asking the question do I want to
read any further what you want is a
short abstract in the in the right
column query free and if I want a
summary where I don't have the time to
read a hundred page walk or 300 page
book give me a summary of 10 pages of 20
pages then those are the executive
summaries but neither of them are
appropriate if you're actually looking
for a in a highly focused response to a
question where you say you know you know
you want to search filter the search
engine results by clustering them or
grouping them to determine whether you
want to read any further at all and the
the query relevant summarization for
busy people is I don't want to read this
article I want an answer and you know it
turns out I used to think this was only
important for busy people it's also
relevant to an illiterate person in the
village so if you go to if this person
goes to your computer or some pay
somebody to do a search for him and says
I have eight
what do i do what do they don't want is
10,000 or 100,000 links to AIDS related
articles they are not competent to read
and summarize and analyze and integrate
the information that is there they're
illiterate or semi literate so what you
want is something that will actually
understand that knowledge and say oh you
have AIDS you need this cocktail and
then you said where do I get it and you
get another answer so it turns out the
kinds of information that's needed when
your query with highly focused require
requirement is essentially you want the
computer to solve the problem and so
some of the types of work that ask
jeeves and others tried to do earlier is
related to this and I think Google
answers might be related to it for
whatever reason Google Answers has never
taken off at least I haven't seen a lot
of buzz about him but probably people
use it still so there may be if we've
removed the the cost angle it'll be in a
more successful but solving problems is
different than just providing
information one of this is passive
knowledge and the other one is active
knowledge right so in the right medium
finding information and providing
information in non-textual media turns
out to be very important also and there
are a number of issues our research
issues in the in these areas that many
of us are working on I'm sure they may
be work here too but so in conclusion
the purpose of this presentation was to
kind of highlight the kind of research
problems and concerns some of us in
academia are kind of grappling with no
doubt there are people at Google
research and Google engineering that are
also working on these problems and and
the issue
how do we make you know substantial
progress and the only way that will
happen i think is for us to begin to
have kind of professional conferences in
each of these topics may be organized by
google one day or two day or three-day
symposium that will actually bring all
the people working in this thing in a
public disclosure without heart design
and in the air or something where you
can actually present the ideas and and
and kind of go forward and that's one of
the things I think we need especially in
areas where things are still very fuzzy
of what the right way of approaching the
problems are thank you okay any
questions comments
their maximum life
do it
ability that people
we look at it is grouping together
relevant subtopics into clusters doesn't
imply you have to throw away the detail
you might all be there but you know it's
like Google News just ride it here's one
headline and one may be the main main
story and then it says 74 other stories
right and so if somebody wants to see
how the same story was reported in in
multiple different locations you can get
it right but the the interesting thing
is in that scenario we never have the
patience at time to go read all the
facility for stories what I would like
to see is those three stories that
provided completely different
perspectives of the same story you take
any of these you know stories with
there's controversies in Israel or
Palestine newspapers the same story will
have very different way of presentation
and that's not just in there it can be
between here in Mexico or it can be any
any place where there is difference is
open between Google and Microsoft the
same story would be reported slightly
differently in different and what I want
to see is those specific differences in
what way are they different because I
don't have the time to read you know
hundreds of pages to figure out for me
what the differences are if I had a
human assistant i would say you go
figure it out and tell me what the
differences are and what we are looking
for is the equivalent
