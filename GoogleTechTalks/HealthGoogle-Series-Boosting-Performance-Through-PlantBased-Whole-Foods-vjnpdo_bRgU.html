my talks about whether it's athletic
performance or other changes performance
so kind of discipline of what
performance is i'll be talking about how
to prove that through what we give you a
little background first i started off
with 1980 i started running track in
high school and I just really enjoyed it
I just loved running so I thought well
if I have to do this full time as a
career as a job that would be ideal so
that's why I started working for just
trying to be a full-time professional
about it just because I'm doing I just
really liked it I'm not by nature
competitive person this might like to do
so unfortunately soon after I got
injured around too much too much too
soon and I got stressed out so I started
swimming cycling to try and maintain my
fitness while while I was injured and I
realized I really like swimming cycling
as well so I thought of people swimming
cycling ready let's travel baby ft track
on full time and that is my career and
I've as my god I love this be ideal is
to be perfect and like to if I need you
i'm not really competitive person so i
wasn't doing this to try and do anything
to myself to anyone i just like hearing
it so I'm not really motivational
overcoming odds and my great with your
barriers and try to push myself to
extreme ice like this point but soon
after I sighs you Iron Man crap on Iron
Man python is made up of the 2.4 mile
swim underneath 12 mile bike ride in the
marathon so 26 points c'mon so obviously
a really long event that if you want to
do well ivf train a lot but like i said
i enjoyed the training so that was that
was easy part for me just like it but
what surprised me was when i started
looking into this seriously and i found
that some of the top athletes in the
world we're doing the identical training
to be a few athletes their training
programs different very little and of
course ask myself well it's one of these
guys are top in the world and others are
just average what is it that separates
that obviously some training so there's
another factor there that is allowing
some to become world class while others
remain averages and crane so i started
to investigate that and i found it had
more to do with what happened between
the training as opposed to the training
itself so the republicans the phase that
your body generates we use itself after
exercise is what I realized was the most
important case and of course when we
rest we eat well our body
overcompensates and become stronger
that's why training works is I'm
overcompensation by a body that can only
happened during the recovery phase and
when I cell regenerating unit cells so
that's right again focus was on
renewal process and I realized there
around eighty percent of recovery could
be attributed good nutrition so
obviously overwhelming them so that's
what I started focusing on this
nutrition and that's why I got
interested in nutrition that very early
age Madame care about nutrition just for
the same patrician I cared about it
because I deal with staff the out of my
favorite having the career I wanted his
nasty and I've never really been
interested nutrition so ha but I'm
interesting the outcomes of good
nutrition the mental clarity the ability
to get away with less sleep the ability
to be more rocket which people so things
like that that are very tightly tied to
good nutrition what it can do for you so
I became quite interested in this and I
started trying different ways need to
see if I lose my performance with these
different diets and I tried the whole
gamut by high carb low carb high protein
low protein and nothing really impressed
and some were better than others but
nothing was really amazing and I found
that I wasn't really getting results
online so I kept on trying different
ones and I try completely flat based
diet so being we need he died and it
didn't work at first I was always hungry
I was tired and I wasn't recovering well
and my high school track coach asked me
what I was doing wrong and all the most
trying this new guy this new way of
eating and he was a very good coach but
because he was so good he was someone
close minded he had a lot of success yet
the template that worked he put all his
Hassocks through it they got results so
he wasn't willing to change and he had
zero interest in Disney wave eating and
that's discouraged me at a time when I
look back on that I think that was
actually a good thing because it's
taught me to realize that this top-level
coach doesn't place any value good
nutrition then probably a lot of other
top-level coaches w so I thought okay
well if I can find a recovery program
that works well for myself maybe this
sort of thing then we passed like
athletes through your coaches and she
like I say was resistant to this but I
kept on pursuing it and looking into
ways to boost performance through
through nutrition I trying to pull a
bunch of different ways beating like I
say those different hi Carlo fro between
all sorts of it and then the plant-based
way I'm started investigating further I
thought I think there's something to
this I'm just doing a bra and I was
saying I was basically eating a junk
food vegan diet and that's ratings going
to do I keep in mind to one of what I'm
going store this was happy in extra 90
so information didn't flow the way that
it does today so information about
zombies nutrition was very hard to come
by information about sports specific
plant-based nutrition was near
impossible so I do a lot of research and
really find out what what would help me
and I i revealed five major things
initially that unlocking my diet through
this even jump to dust and it was
complete protein going to be 12 iron
calcium and omega-3 fatty acids so
pretty major stuff that I simply didn't
have my nutrition program so as I
investigated I just research more I
found what each of these nutrients came
from which plants and then I found this
glass started blending them together
come on ova ova after my working and it
really did work it did allow me to
speedy recovery didn't taste very good
but its functionality got me when I
wanted it got me to the point where I
could be considerably more training than
people i think and that was a huge event
because then of course obviously my
performance improved at a quicker rate
and I got closer to achieving my goal of
a patent on three other one so I was
pleased with that in nineteen ninety I I
started all this 98 I started my
professional career as an athlete as an
Ironman crappy so i dunno seven years
full time and it was great and really
enjoyed that suddenly appearing at 131
well but it's you know in forested by
carbon cycle and i can race that here
and obviously not a good thing to have
happened but for the first time i have
time i freed up all this time I always
been training racing and enough time for
anything so this was kind of exciting to
me and I've been getting us the same
question over and over because people
knew that I race at a high level in a
way to find a spot so I was always going
to ask or even tell see my iron protein
all these things so I decided to address
those and write about them in a short
book that i published his call try the
self-published book under days long it
came out 2004 then i expanded it out as
much new ideas expanded on the ideas
that existed and out in 500 recipes now
became all the tribe died it was
published by penguin canada and then
published the following year here I'm a
back painful drive apparently were
diatoms come ottenere so so it's just if
you see a book called I got it is the
same moments from different public
you're different powder are different
tidal flow in anyway so what I want to
do today's can I go over some of the
main ideas in in those books that you
can use to plot your life whether you're
athletic or not they're very broad so
they will help you for better
they're not thinking or you just want to
maximize or delay you think clearly are
you sleep amount like this equality
popsugar case sergeant a pathologist I
should also mention the two thousand
flora partnered with someone else and we
collaborated and made a replica the
pledge agreement with myself videos and
that is now available in whole foods are
pretty much all health food stores it's
called bag and complete multipop
optimizer Los Alamos for you after
actually waffle pops if you want to
cuddle up on that very welcome to
something that you do in five so that's
been out for six years and counted at
five years here anyways first thing I
want to talk about pertaining to the
book is something called gaining energy
conservation as opposed to consumption
what I mean by that is eating foods use
less energy digestive synlait but give
you more nutrients to return now I'm
univ estate for years and I think a lot
of people make this mistake is very
confident to assume that sense of
calories measure of food energy you
would think of the war how easy weight
or energy to have it seems to make sense
but if that worked really true people
eat lots of fast food lots of high
calorie foods without morning tea than
everyone else and they go so the problem
is is that you have to spend energy to
digest and assimilate these highly
processed foods and when you spend
something you no longer have just like
anything's like money if you spend it
it's gone you know however you can make
a good investment and get a return on
that investment so that's the way to be
able to make food is something that I
would get a return on if I made the
right choice so for example I want from
eating tons of bread peanut butter not
that's the worst thing the world's game
but it is very highly processed whose
white bread with brigid bread and
process peanut butter so we spend a lot
of energy so I just assembly enough food
so you have less of it pretty simple
that way plus is very few nutrients in
it and when I stay neutral tone speaking
of micronutrients you know we don't lack
calories calories are very very easy to
get is some micro nutrients that a lot
of us lot and micronutrients are
vitamins minerals phytochemicals
antioxidants all those things of the
face to get help them by eating this way
I was getting the calories but I wasn't
getting the micronutrients so I switched
over and started swapping out white
bread and even regular bread and pasta
and and all types of flour all types of
refined certain foods swap those up
started eating mostly carbohydrate from
fruit fruit is a great source of
carbohydrate digest much more easily
than these refined bars plus there's
more micronutrients so less energy out
more micronutrients in I call that high
netgain too so that's the first part
that I go to be filled on my focus had a
base your diet on Hainan Game two now
another high-end game food in addition
to just fruit is something called studio
games so things like amaranth quinoa
buckwheat wild rice these are
technically seeds they're not great so
they are gluten that gets more easily
because they are seeds they have more
protein for around twenty-five percent
protein as opposed to a grain it would
be much lower so just making that little
changed my diet found I have
significantly more energy yeah my
calories drop twenty thirty percent but
more energy because like so with the
spending so much energy plus I started
getting more micronutrients in now when
you get the micronutrients in that's
going to help turn out your hunter
signal our hunger single of course it's
a final signal goes back to our earliest
ancestors that tells us we need food
food for a few older building blocks so
as soon as we get hungry that's a sign
biological science being sent from our
brain cells eat now problem is most
large Americans a lot of food we eat LOX
micronutrients so our hunger signal
remains active sleep white bread white
bread pretty much know my kids maybe it
physically fill up your stomach but
you're still going to be hungry you're
still going to want to eat keep eating
because I chemical hunt under signal
remains active now that's the number one
reason for BAC in North America it's
very simple being over too soon but
their reason we open consume is because
there's so few micro nutrients in the
food we have these days that we keep on
you and until we get the micronutrients
to satisfy our hunger single turn it off
and of course up that's a lot of food
that's a lot of calories not like people
gain weight and of course when you gain
weight your risk factor for a whole
bunch of diseases goes up so type 3
diabetes arthritis osteoporosis
cardiovascular disease all these things
so it leaves those nutrient-dense whole
foods and I'll go to some specifics have
it here we're going to get full much
more easily we just don't want to be it
so very clearly on the map with an
unfortunate control I think you're
hungry you should eat food is not the
end the food is good food is good thing
to be when we get ourselves into
troubles because we eat North Americans
a lot of highly refined foods that do
not turn on for hunger signal I just
create a wealth of calories that we
simply do not need and it's actually
very common ft / undernourished I
mean that would have been paradox in
15-20 years ago but now it's pretty much
the norm people who are obese are
commonly showing symptoms of
malnutrition you figure how can you need
so much to become obese yet be
malnourished very strange but that's a
testament to the direction our our food
systems on which producing yeah a lot of
calories a lot of stars very few might
refuse so like I say basically died on
the time at game foods little energy out
and basically steer clear that now
something else i think is really
important is the relationship between
stress and hormones now they're very
light being plugged a lot of people
don't realize i didn't realize this
until I experienced the downside of it
and this is really a lot of what my
phone cases me making states taking
years to figure them out and then
remembering the book so hopefully you
don't have to make the same mistakes but
stress does matter where it comes from
it's perceived by your body the same way
as the same physiological response which
is causing cortisol to go up cortisol
the stress hormone so stress can come
from too much work not enough downtime
you know traditional stress concern to
the family concerns about relationships
concerns about professional problems
walking down the street we included air
us environmental stress or eating food
that takes a lot of energy so i guess
but using very few nutrients to return
these nutritional stress you know work
without getting something back is it
biologically stressful as far as a body
sensor so all those things even
psychological stress sleep worrying
about things you have no control over
that's something one more problems that
no personality types of worry whatever
and nineteen cents things like that
control so that's just excuse for a CD
so when that happens any one of those
things triggers a stress response to
cortisol will go up when cortisol goes
off several bad things happen one
physiologically you will not be able to
get too deep famously called delta
that's a really deep with you being a
phase North Americans most of us never
get into and the reason to that of
course corozal being high so then we
don't to sleep equally we don't get this
deep delta phase asleep so what happens
is quickly that we're still time and
then what we do eventually go that we
crave pop your cherry coffee sugar works
they give us energy right away puts
through stimulation and obviously it's
treating the symptom of fatigue it's not
being the cause pause as we didn't sleep
on in sleep bulbs corozal Todd for this
all times of stress so it all comes back
that so if you can copy and pretty use
that as a crutch to to overcome this it
just perpetuates a circle and then we
become dependent on these stimulants and
I realized that to be successful enough
they ought to break that cycle and it's
hard to do it around skill and coffee
shop no no jobs is very clear for
society that is dependent on on
experience but as we lower cortisol and
I'll give you specifics in a minute how
to do this but where's all sorts
condemning sleep deeply you wake up
refreshed your rest of you ready
okay papi I figure between the paws
across town centre now downside to this
of course is that it's not instant it
will take a couple weeks to take any
drink coffee obviously to medium this is
not me so you have to be prepared to put
in a little bit of effort and invest a
little bit in that but of course once it
happens then problem solved we don't
feel another huge advantage to read
ducing corozal is that when you sleep
more deeply when you get to that deep
Delphia sleep your quality obviously is
getting better so therefore naturally
your quantity will come down so maybe
you used to need eight or nine hours
sleep now you can get away the south and
that's obviously very beneficial I mean
anyone share the benefit from that
you're obviously doing all right next to
our not on sleep today so it's probably
daily save every day so it's great it's
obviously a very practical solution to
freeing up more weight upon by improving
sleep quality quantity small and i'm
sure you go see i'm creating that
conversations with people and you're
wondering are these people totally think
of a fully awake and the answer is
probably no they're not because when
they're sleeping at all you are fully
asleep so that lies become blurred
between being so you can being away we
don't see pulley deeply when we're way
we're not totally waiting some people so
obviously to find i'm on a big deep
sleep and then complete being awake and
focus concentration and obviously
productivity stuff like that goes goes
up so
preciate that azmuth sleep another
problem of high cortisol level is the
inability to tone muscle and lose body
fat efficiently now again item in the
Sahara I was training in 1997 35 40
hours a week I was trying to build up
for my first what would hopefully be my
first professional career as a fastly
for the following year and I was
training 35 40 hours a week it was great
up until the fourth week and then I
started first of all I start getting
able to tie and I thought well since
javis reason I'm exercising a lot but
the more tired i got the worst my
ability sleeping and i realized now for
his best because I las gorras all 20
high we should prevent me from sleeping
deeply so I had to compensate by adding
extra sleep and it got my season back on
track but I'm sticking nine hours a
night and obviously don't want to do
that I'd to make up for the you know the
shortcomings of my quality sleep by
offsetting with more quantity but like I
say got Cena got attracted under
standard so I was into dressing properly
but now he of course it had been to
better nutrition whenever you sport
assault what started to happen on the
following year was even more strange I
began gaining weight and it wasn't
muscle it was found a sort of gaining a
pound of fat in between these and I
thought how is it possible to gain fat
when I'm exercising 35 40 hours a week
no idea one so I started asking around I
started asking the so-called
professionals reading a lot of books and
everyone said the same thing if you're
gaining weight simple you're taking more
calories never thought well you know
that's that's pretty strange because yes
I was taking a lot of calories but even
I was burning up there's no way what I'm
taking
doctors can be but I was out of my kids
I no idea what's going on so I try to
suggestion I cut back to my food as he I
started getting way more quickly about
how different tunings I thought how was
as possible on partly eating and gaining
fat and exercising 35 40 hours a week I
don't get it and I didn't get it until
about a year and a half later until I
spoke with an endocrinologist explain to
the relationship between stress and
hormones now what I've done is either
retrain so that's physical stress of
course exercise is good but in excess
it's not and I stepped over the line so
I had put so much physical strain in my
body from it having to find recovered
from all those exercise that had caused
reporters all to be chronically elevated
and burned up adrenals so wasn't
sleeping well but also in corozal goes
high it's near impossible to tell muscle
and lose fat extreme cases okay anything
so that's exactly where topic me as I
advised that extreme having a lot of
people are in a situation not from
necessarily overtraining strategist at
work family all those things I mentioned
before so cost the corozal to go up so
that means it's very difficult to tetona
so loose top and break through those
athletic plateau so if you've been
working out consistently and you can't
seem to get the results that you should
look at your life list if we look at all
those other stresses and all those other
things going on as opposed suggest
calories and colored up
the reason I started being way more
quickly when I kept talking on and who
does eating was because i was now
depriving my body of nutrition I wasn't
going to buy my body the fuel needed to
fielding or cups or the building blocks
that needed to recover from so that was
just the greatest dress I just placed
more stress in my body which costco
resolves go up even higher which cause
being that work quickly so on the
surface that seemed counterintuitive
obviously if you're exercising lottery
money watching gained weight well the
tendency of course is exercise morning
less that was an opposite of what I
should have done what I should have done
is eight more news against all high 19
foods and alkaline forming foods a lot
of that minute and that when it started
to bring cortisol back down so I think
let me say a lot of people are in that
situation I'm sure you've seen people
that you see them at the gym you go to
gym regularly to be the same people that
we got to leave maybe month after month
you're after years insane people on your
gym and they can't lose that last five
to ten pounds or change the body shape
whether and I'm sheriff your to go those
people and ask them what was going on
must
they'd probably be confused they
probably wouldn't know what problems but
this is sort of looking at specifically
is a person not just obscene calories
and telling us we've started asking
about their professionalize the personal
life and you saw all things applause
worrying certain you're like there's
your answer we're a concerning stress or
a zone so essentially those people are
and I was hormonal aging and that's the
way the end of phonology explains mean I
think that's an excellent way to look at
it because of course you can't see it
you like another injury broken or
something but it's still an injury when
your hormones are so far to laugh you
cannot tell muscley hot August I'm so
something to consider you know if you're
not situation you exercises diligently
any actually to break through or you go
backwards then take a look all the other
things in life now easier said than done
some pieces now I understand that
obviously there's a lot of stress in
their life that we can phone know those
things family will it work really some
of those things are out of our control I
will say one thing's data reception also
has a large component to do with the
stress if you perceive something
stressful it's stressful so as an
example I like to run so for me to go
for a run I actually get a greater
physiological benefit that someone cast
for Sandra herself to go for run so if
you don't like running run pretty much
that simple people say yoga is great for
stress relief yes that's true if you
like you if you don't
so I think when you slap your activity
if you find something you really do
enjoy you know that that was actually
going to have a greater benefit to your
end your end goal different now I was I
was kind of flailing around with this
trying to fix this for a while and it
wasn't until I pieced those things
together the relieving sense to me so
what I'm going to say is well when I was
researching the book I found that of the
average young Americans total stress
forty percent to be attributed to poor
nutrition forty percent is he now at
first I thought is terrible you know
we're doing as ourself we're placing all
types of stress on us finding important
food fixes but then I realized I was
actually in because we all control what
could you speak when we make this choice
is obviously like I say we don't all the
clothes other aspects and cause the
stress we control what we hope we put so
therefore we have a lot of control over
lowering cortisol and treating the cause
of these symptoms which of course to a
girl stuff so the high 19 zoos those be
the base that's going to be useful large
amount of cortisol there for a large
amount of overall scratch therefore if
free of a lot of problems I spoke a bit
about acid alkaline and I think that
that's where they had talked a little
more about that's something that is
better understood now it was you just
few years ago but at a bizarre Americans
were actually getting osteoporosis in a
younger age
before in history it originally that was
thought the reason for that is that we
weren't having a housekeeper dime turns
out not to be the case the reason we're
getting osteoporosis and as such a young
age because we take too much calcium out
of our bones can we do that by eating a
supporting food so anything that is
highly caustic white flour white bread
synthetic vitamin synthetic drugs may
vary so to all of stuff standard
American diet 100% us so what happens
when you need that is your body has to
compensate that has to Ostend this acid
forming food means your body so what it
does is it pulls calcium which is highly
offline out of the bones into the blood
keep it neutral neutral ph 7.3 25 so
blood is going to stay that way as a
survival mechanism but in doing so the
drawers housing from books and anything
as over the course of one to three
decades of eating every meal every staff
being outperforming you're going to get
weaker bones and then eventually
osteoporosis so that's why it's not
uncommon to see people concurrently
standing guard I've taught osteoporosis
in their twenties so best thing to do
obviously alkaline forming foods
alkaline forming foods are basically any
whole plant-based foods 13 14 alkaline
forming the lessons conduct them may be
better there may be the most up line
forming foods are their cues so anything
chlorophyll spinach kale anything like
that for Elif spirulina which are both
with Vega as well which is offline those
really help keep you on line so they
salad every day best thing to do for
your bones smooth
great three rungs but another huge
advantage to keeping offline is
functionality if if you need acid
forming food that promotes inflammation
and if you have arthritis obviously
that's that's a given that's going to be
the big difference by just switching
over but even if you know just an
average person you think if you have to
work harder for every muscle contraction
because they're in claim you won't even
open flame that takes energy to just
walking across the room you have to
spend energy obviously to do that and if
you spend it you're five less of it so
by the end of the day you're going to be
more tired which obviously again you
know is just creating more efficient
body by reducing information that is
going to free up your ability now to now
think that becomes more importantly do
you think of all the muscle contractions
during a 5k 10k marathon come on there's
a lot so it gets work hard for everyone
you're going to be able see spend energy
efficiently so by eating these alkaline
forming foods functionality improves
because information of them now
obviously I'm an endurance happening so
it's all about strength weight ratio be
strong but I want to stay light and
that's great way to data obviously
getting this way keep some pretty clean
pretty like but what about if you want
to build muscle what is your body going
with your power lifter 81 put on some
muscle can this type of eating huh and
yes you can right after a workout your
claim your muscles are torn down for
from the exercise any body has to
rebuild so you need protein building
long but the problem is a lot of
proteins animal-based protein whey
protein anything from an animal is going
to be for a support so he weak alkaline
forming proteins plant-based proteins
like proteins goralina protein I'll felt
anything like that right suppose eating
those things have chlorophyll in them
they're more alkaline forming they're
going to reduce inflammation right after
work out now when you use information
after your workout like I say your
functionality goes up when your
functionality goes out your ability to
lift heavier weight improve so you'll be
able to lift heavier weight next time
you're in gym which is what makes
figured wrong lifting heavier weight is
what build bigger stronger muscles so
eating this way in itself is not fitting
