Knuth to visit Google today I was John
Don I were just talking we met in the
mid 1970s which you know he's a very
young man I'm a very old man but it
seems like it's been a been a while but
Don has done a number of things he's got
a remarkable number of awards it's hard
to say enough about him I think many
people consider him the you know the
most prominent living computer scientist
and I he he wanted to come today and
have a kind of free-for-all Q&amp;amp;A session
so I hope you all came armed with
questions I think he may be available to
sign a book or two after this I
understand a few of you may have brought
such things but let's do that afterwards
but with that let me welcome Don Knuth
okay thanks Bill yeah I'm not sure if I
can match Lady gaga but anyway look
while I was teaching at Stanford always
last day of class was reserved for all
questions answered and I told everybody
they could cut class but they wanted to
but if they had some something that they
wanted to you know the one of the asked
me because they paid their tuition and
everything that was the time to do it
and they could ask questions on any
subject whatsoever except religion
politics or or the final exam now two
years ago about two years ago at Google
I gave a talk that connect that had
something to it religion and and the
politics is kind of depressing but if
you want to ask questions about anything
I'll still give it my best shot but I
probably get better answers to things
that I know something about and I
understand that that some people have
been submitting questions and they're
going to choose the best ones to vote or
anything but anyway let's let's I'm
hoping that the questions are not
frequently asked questions okay
currently in the lead okay so Mike I
mentioned the guy who asked the question
well does this show up on your table
whatever okay so he lets go
what is the theorem or constructing the
puter science you feel is most
counterintuitive in which one do you
find most beautiful okay well so this
kind of ranking of things in a
one-dimensional criterion
I encounter so first of all we project
onto onto the counterintuitive thing and
beauty aspect okay I mean it's somehow
you get or you ask a apparent which of
their children they like the best or
something okay counterintuitive is
anything intuitive to me that so that I
guess that go into more and more
dimensions our intuition seems to seems
to be worse and worse
I understand George Dantzig once said
that our intuition and dimensions isn't
worth a damn I don't use that kind of
language myself but anyway so I think
the the things that were that were that
were doing in high dimensional spaces
and some of these methods now that are
dealing with many degrees of freedom and
and and somehow we can still happen down
into something we can we can control
those are pretty probably the most
beautiful theorem in computer science my
goodness
it's always the one it's the one that I
that I learned most recently I guess but
yeah there there are a lot of contenders
and then the boundary between computer
science and mathematics which is hard to
draw so let's see right right now I'm a
big I'm gonna go for construct that I
that I find very beautiful because
during the last year I've been playing
around with with that with a data
structure called as EDD which in the
greatest name but it's it it it it's the
best way that I know to represent
families of sets and families of sets
cover many many applications of all
kinds and it's and I played with it yeah
I started out with thinking I would just
spend one page of volume for talking
about CDs and and a year later I had I
had almost a hundred pages of
introduction to it and I was still
learning more stuff about CDs I think
it's a it's a very beautiful
construction that that needs to be
studied much more and exploit and assume
people will find more reason for now
let's see should I alternate between
this and and and people in the audience
okay so let's take something from the
floor rumor has it there's an amazing
pipe organ located somewhere near where
you live do you ever have anyone else
any other we're gonna splay that pipe
organ and what's your favorite song
played on it okay so yeah I have I if
you look in art of computer programming
volume three index under did anybody
hear that everybody hear the question
it's about pipe organs I look in the
index to vol 3 under royalties call my
use of it'll take it to a page that
shows that shows a picture that looks
like organ pipe and so after after I we
have sold a few copies of the volumes
one two and three I was able to fulfill
a dream and and get a really nice
instrument in my in in one wing of my
house and I guess L&amp;amp;K also has has a
great organ in his house Southern
California and I my father was an
organist and I and I took some lessons
when I was 12 years old how to play an
organ and then and then I was called
what when I was a donor in Pasadena I
was a grad student I was all of a sudden
the organist at the church I was going
to had a detached retina and they called
me on Saturday said Don did you really
taken a year of organ lessons when you
were when you were a teenager can you
feel him and and I learned at that time
that all a wonderful literature that's
been written for for pipe organs and and
I and I found some people down in
Pasadena that had gotten organ in her
house and so that became a dream of mine
and I was able to realize that in the
middle of middle 70s and I I
investigated I was thinking maybe I'd
get somebody in Denmark to build one for
me because they had such beautiful
instruments but that turn out to be
impractical because I could they
couldn't give me a fixed price on it and
so finally I found a really good builder
near UCLA and and
they built for organs a year and the one
that's in my house
so we occasionally have people from that
American Guild of Organists I've come
for recitals and play on and then like
if you if you're an organ is to just see
me afterwards and you can come and try
Stanford students used to practice on it
but that there aren't so many organ
students now it's there used to be
thanks I'll come see you afterward yeah
now the next one here what kind of
problems do you feel Google or the
industry at large should be working on
but isn't okay so Google okay well I'll
just another great question
I'll just give you one in Google Maps
put back a facility that I can get the
GPS coordinates I can click on something
in Google map and then I have a way to
find out the GPS coordinates I that used
to work last year until November and
it's gone now and if you google GPS
coordinates and Google Maps and you'll
find a lot of other irate users who
missed this feature so okay another one
from well I'll take another one off the
screen
most of the low-hanging fruits in
computer science have already been
reaped and dissected in detail um do you
still see any of them that surprisingly
no one gets trying to reap okay so you
know that that's a it's true that a lot
of things have been dissected in detail
but it in all fields including computer
science it seems that people are always
going down the same roads and and it's
amazing to me the hit rate of how many
how many times
another low hanging fruit appears in my
consciousness and and both in computer
science and even in mathematics which
has been around for hundreds of more
years of problems that are are very
different for example last year I let's
see how do I see I was i I was finishing
the eighth dime of my collected papers
out of eight and I got it I got to give
a plug for this book because because
actually I have to admit that that I
loved it much more than I can explain
but the but it was decided many years
ago more than 20 years ago that that
that the papers that have been written
she should be published in archival form
with all the bugs removed and adding
adding extra information about the
developments since the papers were
written and so on and and he divided
into eight eight topics the first topic
with literate programming and the second
topic with general computer science in
general for for non specialists and the
third book was about typography and so
on well the eighth the eighth of these
eight was papers on fun and games and
and and I saved that up for dessert
it was the one you know I I knew that if
I kept that for last it would keep me
going up through all the all the other
paper and then so I so here I have this
finally though I'm closing the door on
the papers that I'm writing from now on
idea I don't write anymore papers like I
add to the art of computer programming
but I don't but and and I added
seventeen there are 17 chapters in that
book of papers that were never before
published and and doing those chapters I
wrote last year which might
on topics that you might say are
low-hanging fruit things that you know
research that was still there in in one
case it was about night stores
I call it long and skinny night stores
and I and I studied the this the problem
of how many ways are there to take a
this has three rows and n columns and
and and find a night's to nice tour on
this board and it turned out that they
it was a really interesting problem a
really challenging problem it taught me
a lot of mathematics as I'm doing it I
can't get big I can tell you the exact
number for any end I can tell you
they're asymptotic numbers and I can
classify them in two different ways that
surprised me it seemed like low-hanging
fruit because you don't need much I mean
people have been thinking about night
stewards for 200 years still there was
another open problem on night stores
when they call Celtic night stores which
which are our night stewards that are
specially beautiful because they don't
have three lines that that that come
almost touching each other and they're a
mess and so you can you can make
beautiful Celtic knots from the patterns
anyway they another example of something
that that was that was out there hadn't
been finished two weeks ago Ron Graham
tells me about the following problem
take any take any integer write it in
binary
so you got a any basically any sequence
of zeros and ones you can always you can
always cut it any string is there
someone you can always cut it into
substrings so so that the sum of the
consider each substring as a binary
number the sum of those binary numbers
is a power of two
it's not easy but there it is and very
in a sense low-hanging I would say you
know try it out but don't start thinking
about just before trying to go to sleep
because I was just I was just reading
the information god what is it called
the learning in the loo or something
like this it tells you how to get get a
good night's sleep man
so so anyway surprisingly there's
there's still a lot of low-hanging fruit
and and just keep asking questions so
it's not it's not really that likely
that that has been totally explored yet
yeah
earlier you were talking about GPS
coordinates or sorry yeah that long
doing Google Maps yeah there's a labs
feature we can get that on your mouse
cursor now there's a what you can turn
on a labs feature a labs feature yeah
okay well tell me because it used to be
that through my Maps I could get
something called position finder but but
they they discontinued the the ability
to use other people's Java code and
during my lab well yeah I'm not too
familiar with what you're using but if
you just want GPS queries I you know I
can do it easily with Google Earth but I
but with Google Maps I want to I want to
be able to do it do it easy and and I
searched and nobody had nobody had
published at that solution so we can get
it with the mouse cursor you can get it
with what it's just the mouse cursor a
mouse cursor yeah there's a plugin for
it a plug-in a labs a lamp plugin okay
all right well thank you
with the increase in processing power
and adoption of machine independent
high-level languages it's a common
perception that being close to the metal
doesn't matter anymore what impact does
this have on computer science as a field
of study I don't like this I don't agree
that it doesn't matter anymore it
doesn't matter as much it to as many
people as it used but it but it it's but
but that's just relative in absolute
numbers it probably just matters I mean
we can still use more power we can still
usually there's all kind of problems
where you want to push the envelope and
do better and and so so if you just you
know lots of problems like there's no
point in i am i spending much time on on
something if it's gonna if it's gonna in
order to make it to get the answer in a
microsecond instead of instead of ten
seconds it yeah so no point in it yeah
so I write really inefficient programs
to solve certain problems but boy when I
when I was studying these three by n
night stewards I had to find the inverse
of a 700 700 matrix and polynomials and
so I had to I had to think about it and
and I had to know a bit of what's going
on and and if you if people imagine a
whole generation growing up with this
philosophy that that that you don't need
to be close to it you don't even know
anything about the metal metal
underneath then the programs they write
are gonna be really bad
and and and so then of course there will
be lots of low-hanging fruit for people
who want to make improvements okay next
question literate programming has never
really taken off although some scripting
languages have improved code readability
somewhat what if anything do you think
has hindered its adoption yeah that's a
that's a question that of course I I can
try to answer but literate programming
is so close to my heart that I'm totally
biased about it and so I so you have to
discount what I say the again in
absolute numbers we've got tens of
thousands of people who who use literate
program but but still that's less than
one percent probably and but but I've
got at least one program that I wrote
that was so complicated that I believed
that I would never ever have been able
to get the program finished at all if I
didn't have literate programming to
organize my thoughts enter and make it
done this is the this is the the meta
simulator for for my MX computer I've
got this I got this RISC machine that
you can configure in basically
infinitely many ways you can say you can
say each instruction what functional
unit belongs to or how much of a
pipeline you wanted to have all kind of
caches that that you can control on
multiple issue of instructions and
different branch prediction methods and
you can you can imagine you can simulate
what it would be like if you had a
processor with
many more things than we know how to
build at the moment but but anyway I I
wrote this this dis simulator and it was
the hardest challenge that I ever had as
far as programming I think and and we
end with literate programming I was able
to finish it in a year but without
literate programming I think I would
have totally flopped so it it's not only
for me literate programming isn't only
nice it's it's sort of essential it's
also nice because I write average of
maybe one program a day some of them are
longer than not some are pretty short
but but with this literate programming
method it really works for me and makes
me happy now
so on the other hand you know fewer than
a hundred percent of the world loves it
now it's and it's because the way that
you know I read a lot of code and and
there's a there's a general and a lot of
the best code that I that I see out
there adheres to a certain set of
conventions that are pretty good they're
nowhere near as good as literate
programming but still they're good
enough that that they that they're
adequate and so and they're understood
by by a huge community and so people can
you know people know this this style and
it's it's a it's a lingua franca for me
to say drop that and go to literate
programming it would like saying well
you know let's go to Esperanto instead
of English or some other language that
might be better than Esperanto you know
prove that's a much more logical
language yet English is good enough and
I'm not going to change from English so
you know why should I tell somebody else
to change the style of programming that
they all
using and it's good enough
so John Bentley might have hit the nail
on the head because literally the people
who like litter programming the best are
people who also like I seem to be the
people who also like to like to write
you know bloggers and and teachers
because when you're writing illiterate
programming you're you're like beat in
front of a class you're you're writing
for a human audience rather than for the
computer to understand it you're trying
to explain something to another another
programmer and so there's a certain
percentage of the world likes to write
and there's a certain concern of the
world as good at programming and and you
have to be in the intersection of those
two in order to really live leader
program so so that might be why it
hasn't taken off still if I you know I
think that if if Google managers would
sort of you know say let's let's have a
test here and we're going to do some
some system with with literate program
you'll find that you know that it might
in fact make Google even better no I but
but anyway I'm not going to change and
and I think a lot of of people
understand I I can point to some large
programs that probably more more people
understand that these these difficult
programs that than any other any other
programs are their side so that's my
take on one more thing know at my book
on fun and games
the last chapter of the okay they I
don't know how many people know this but
my first publication was in Mad Magazine
and and you know when I when I was a
freshman in college like this this
article came out and and so now that's
chapter one of my of my papers on fun
and game and the last chapter is equally
it is equally crazy and it's a and and
it's a spoof talk that I gave last
summer where I where I basically
promised that the well I basically well
people were asking about the future of
tech and I said well I decided that
everything I did on that project was it
was a mistake and and and and so I'm
starting this I've secretly started this
company and I'm and I've got this new
product that's coming out that's that's
not only going to do three-dimensional
typesetting but it's also including the
the manufacturing on demand and it also
includes things like search engines and
social networking and and you know it
tells differential equations and and
it's been you know and and it's all
written in scheme and and and and of
course we gave up on literate
programming because because everybody
knows you know documentation is a pain
okay so that was the hardest paragraph
for me to write but but I thought I
would I use some kind some kind of
bookends to have one you know I started
out Mad Magazine and I had to have
something to match it as my final
publication Jeff so are you using
call/cc in that program
am i using call people call CC and your
scheme programs oh all right here's
here's my question it's a master's math
search question so this morning I use
social search to find the name of such
this little technique called propensity
score matching
and and so sometimes I know that there's
a mathematical concept that exists but I
don't know what the name of it is and I
want to go find out about it
integer sequences is a good example of a
search technique that allows me to go
find you know yeah the online
encyclopedia in integer sequences you
can calculate your way into the
literature if you can care if you can
compute the first six terms of of some
sequence you'll find if there's anybody
else has ever been interested in that
right yeah so so that's a that's a good
solution so but that doesn't solve all
problems so how do you when you know
that there's been a mathematical concept
that you've stumbled across but you
don't know the name of it yeah how do
you find out what that name is so you
don't have to go reinvent everything
okay well the answer is of course I I'm
73 years old now and I developed a bunch
of friends and so I know yeah right so I
know who to ask you know but but but if
it's it was it was a completely new
field and then I haven't got any good
method myself but but I know but I often
you know there's certain questions that
I ask IRA Gessle others I asked Richard
Stanley or Bruno you know Jeff Feldman's
cetera and I you know I fortunately I
can go down the hall at Stanford and get
the answers to most these questions and
we get together for lunch every week so
so that's my my solution but it's not
yeah you know you don't scale very well
I don't like you don't scale I don't
well replicate you too you know well in
fact that would be that would be
terrible
I mean if they were if it note let's
face it if there were ten people like me
in the world we wouldn't have time to
read each other's books
okay how many P unequal NP proofs have
you seen what is your opinion on this P
equals or p1 equal when do you think is
going to be settled oh boy
okay so I know I got one last eye last
week I have and the guy sent me a Java
code that that that seems to prove that
P equals NP and and I'm pretty sure that
he's finding maximum maximum cliques and
and I'm pretty sure that that the way
he's generating the data is from a set
of problems that I in polynomial time
you'll be able to find maximum cliques
you know with n cube steps on the
average so so it looks like you know it
would look like P equals NP and that
because maximum clique is one of those
np-complete problems on the other hand
you know you've got to be able to sell
all problems in in a in the maximum
polynomial number steps in order to have
people and P still he his his algorithm
might be really interesting on practical
problems and so I I filed it a way to
read the code when I when I get to the
point when I know maybe a year from now
when I'm gonna be writing up techniques
for maximum cliques now I but I've done
I've done a lifetime share of checking
proofs that that P equals NP of P on
equal NP and some some years ago I
passed that threshold
and so I'll never do it again but till
there was it was a pretty serious thing
that a lot of people looked at about six
months six months ago when it and it
turned out that it that it didn't it
didn't pan out but still the ideas
couldn't be dismissed out of hand now
I've also read proofs about squaring the
circle to in my in my youth okay now I
have this to my surprise i i i found
that i had already given this opinion
fifteen years ago but i'm afraid what's
going to happen in in his question is
that is that the solute that somebody
maybe fifty years from now is going to
prove that P equals NP and the proof is
going to be something like this that it
equals NP because there are only
finitely many reasons why is what why it
couldn't
in other words but a proof that that
gives us no algorithm it just proves by
that there exists you know some some
exponents so that but an algorithm that
will never know it's just as it's out
there and and so so then that was the
wrong question to ask
it would mean now we already have cases
like this for there's some deep theorems
in graph theory that say that certain
kinds of graphs in order to test for
these graphs you can do it in polynomial
time but nobody knows the algorithm
because we just know that there's only a
finite number of cases to try for but we
don't know what those cases are we just
know that that's not infinite and you
know the paper by louis that
that describes some of the paradoxes
coming out of this so it's looking to me
more and more like it's going to be that
number of possible algorithm is is huge
huge and to show that none of those it
is polynomial time might just be wrong i
I don't know if this touches more on
philosophy but do you believe that
programming is more of an emergent
behavior of math or it's it's own thing
that just happens to be well described
by mouth okay the connection between
programming and math and an emergent
format I I find my own feeling is this
that that mathematics and computer
science are the two unnatural Sciences
the things that are man-made we get to
set up the rules it doesn't matter the
way the universe works we create our own
universes and decide you know we can
design our computational and models and
we can we can make axioms for
mathematical problems
well physicists and and chemists and
biologists and so on are have a
different thing they want to know what's
actually in the real world now
so art so but our computer science and
mathematics really two sides of the same
coin are they somehow different coins
and I I feel strongly that that they're
different but I tried to convince bill
Thurston of this and and he and he
disagree with me my opinion though is I
can feel rather strongly when I when I'm
wearing my mathematicians cloak versus
when I'm wearing my a computer scientist
cap you know there's a lie I mean one
mode or the other sometimes and and and
sometimes what so to me the biggest
difference is mathematicians are mostly
working on unified theories where you
have one or two axioms that that are
sort of applying all
all the way through computer science I'm
more dealing with very heterogeneous
things where there's case one case two
case three and and well the and we have
different things that that happen in in
different states and and we we have an
assignment statement where we can say
that X X is replaced by 2x so all value
of x is gone mathematicians that's a
weird concept to mathematician so so I
think of these are different mentalities
different different approaches where I
can sometimes you know say well I'm a
computer scientist I got stuck here
not sure I'd translate my problem into a
mathematical one and then then I gonna
you know then I think mathematically for
a while and that yeah that moves me to
another thing and then mathematically
I'm stuck and then I go back and put on
my programming hat again and try to do
something constructive or figure out a
data structure that helps me understand
the mathematical lab so I think they're
different but I can't convinced bill
Thursday the the it's the other thing
that computer scientists oh so I can
conclude this by saying we got our its
pluses and minuses so so there are
problems in the world that that
mathematicians don't do very well at
because they're sort of inherently
heterogeneous nothing uniform is going
to explain them all and so Matthews not
gonna to be comfortable with that at all
and computer scientists can cut through
like like butter knife you know but on
the other hand there are problems that
that do have a uniform thing and the
computer scientists might not see it
because we've got a weak we can we can
find a case one case two case three
way to attack it which is actually very
inelegant and missing the the underlying
unity so to me that's the difference
thanks yeah how is your involvement with
music affected your computer science and
vice versa I think there's a common
thing about patterns and so we so it's a
love of patterns idea that seems to have
a high correlation with with the kind of
thinking that goes on in in both
mathematics and computer science at
Stanford we had one time our the lady
who was sort of our department
executive had she had come from the from
the law school and she said there was
incredible difference coming from the
law school to the computer science
department in in in music the students
were interested in music musicians it
was completely different than she had
experienced in there is go anyway I
think there probably something to that
although so in the 70s we used to ask
our incoming grad students the first
question what's your instrument and and
we had cases were like class I don't
know if you remember bill Sam bent oral
exam he preceded by a cello recital and
and you know we would we would have
student parties and we would we would do
chamber music and and so it was it was
much more in the 70s then then then in
the 80 because one one year I got to the
incoming grad students and I'd say
what's your instrument and it turned out
one guy played a harmonica and and
another one said that he did an Abba
imitation and and nobody else did music
at all that that year and you know what
what are you what's your main hobby
isn't it turn out that
more than half of them were really into
bicycle riding so so there was there was
a change somehow in the in the
population I don't understand why and I
don't know what it is now
anyway I do believe that that these
things go together
and but it's it's maybe not not a direct
Minette to compose some music with with
some like algorithmic ideas that I have
and so I maybe if I could influence
music that way how does music actually
influence a program that I write I don't
know if I can point to anything director
Oh next question here was you are
famously known for you're interested in
contribution to digital typography over
30 years after release of tech what are
your thoughts on the current state of
typography as it exists on the web and
other digital media and and basically
I'm upbeat about the about the way you
know I got the mic I got a Nexus S and
has beautiful fonts on it I love to you
know I love the typography I'm seeing
and I think that people are starting to
understand fonts and I guess one of the
only protections that I i I'm famously
bad at predicting in fact that's
probably the one of the the fact that I
can't predict how hard something is the
only reason that I started working on
typography in the first place but but
but I did predict that font designers
would would become heroes and I'd turn
out to be fairly like one of the
previous questions so now kids are
growing up it's using computers like on
the cell phones everywhere like the
small small kids and like but the
computers became like really really
complicated so what do you think will be
the long-term impact will we actually
have more people understanding how it
all works
or you'll when I have actually like a
magic you know that the only only few
actually you understand this is this is
a paradox and I wish like I think and I
wish I knew I just gave you a couple of
so so I know that my grandkids are
pretty are pretty fascinated by by some
applications that you might say are
fairly like programming and they they
put together
objects that that the object can move
and I can't remember them the names of
the systems I think that they do so
they're doing more than just then just
passively playing games although games
are you know I must say I spent hundreds
of hours rolling dice when I and and and
moving
horses along a track when I was when I
was my school I mean and now the
equivalent is is doing doing things on
a-- and on the other hand
nikrif Ethan told me three years ago
he's if son is going to the best High
School in Oxford and and Nick went there
to talk to the kids in in his son school
and he found that not a one of them had
ever written a computer program or even
thought about it so this was so anyway
it's a very strange
situation that were that were in and you
think that that more in the old days
people were learning logo and Carl the
robot and stuff and now there's many
more systems like that which are which
are quite fascinating we know that we're
not called Chuck from Stanford and then
MIT has this one that was featured in
the ACM last year and and they're there
there's there are more but I don't know
I don't know if it'll change thick thick
throughout my career the number of
people of every hundred people it's it's
been pretty steady over my career that
that two out of every hundred seems to
be born to be a computer scientist you
know they're they're geeks like me they
we have a peculiar way of organizing
stuff in our head and that happens when
you're young something at some point and
I do computer science as a as something
that that I do because I just happen to
be good at it not because I I had a urge
to compute programming today is not
fundamentally changed from programming
decades ago how has the industry failed
in this regard and how could it change
in the future okay yeah I wish I could
answer about industry but I my own
expertise is in writing books and how
many people have actually cashed the 256
checks now I think some of you know that
that I I reward people for finding
errors in my books
and as I started that it used to be one
dollar back in 1960s and then it you
know in the second second edition it
went up to $2 at some point it switched
over to $2 and 56 cents which seemed
more appropriate number I had to and
over the years I people used to cash
those checks a lot and it was it fouled
up our checking account so so so I got
my own so I got my own account because
because others others who we're not
cashing well now it turns out that the
electronic funds transfers is incredibly
insecure
the banks have have almost no security
the bank's believe in any any electronic
message that they get and and it's and
and crooks have learned how to how to do
this so that if somebody looks at at one
at a check that you write you write a
personal check it hasn't has numbers at
the bottom if that know if that if a
crook
it was those numbers he can turn himself
up an ATM target that and withdraw money
from your account and anyway I had to I
had to close three accounts because
these numbers were examples were the
checks is Bank of America Atlanta
Georgia and at the bottom and has the
routing number of my checking account
Palo Alto and you know and people people
would look like a payroll check and so
you know 400 bucks cash it at the
supermarket and but others were actually
as I say making ATM cards and doing
withdrawals and and ordering a kind of
fancy computers and stuff I think
probably somewhere in Eastern Europe
happening so anyway this that's all good
banking system is all screwed up so so
but four years ago I suspect
I started my own bank and you can find
it on the web it's called the Bank of
San serif and instead it's the write
checks but they but you don't cash in
because it doesn't say paid to the it
says deposit to the account of and it's
virtual bank so so you can look on there
and you can find the names of everybody
who's got an account at the Bank of
Santa serif' and how much they've done
and and I wrote twenty one of those
checks last month then I'll write
probably ten this month so far from what
I know things that came in I last week I
got a letter from China and I found an
error in Volume one from 1968 hadn't
been noticed since 1968 finally somebody
read that page carefully it's true so
but it's very valuable to me you know
trying to make the books more and more
correct
what is the do I think is the most
effective way to get children and foods
about computer science I guess we got
good tools for them to play with I but I
I was best at understanding children
when I had children who were that age I
mean I when I was a when my kids were in
first grade like I could design
curriculum for first graders and and
then the next year I could great design
quick two percent greater right now that
that's wiped out of my head but but I I
I think part of it is is they have taken
do you have to have the have a way to be
creative and and and share their their
creations with their friends so that's
probably going to be the most effective
way have have some kind of thing where
where the kids can can make a
construction that they're proud of
did Steve Jobs tell you he'd read all of
your books and how did you respond by ok
now there's a but there's a funny story
about that you can look up and and the
true story I believe is on the Russian
version of the Wikipedia because because
a guy in Russia wanted to check out the
source and and the fact is that that I
did I have met Steve at several times
and and the most likely thing is that
that he said that I said oh that's
wonderful you're the first person I ever
met who has or something like has read
them all I deferred the rest of the
story and you've got a question ok so
are you familiar with the field of
natural language programming or sorry
natural language listing excuse me
natural language across the land which
processing will I use Google Translate
are not allowed and I and so you know I
don't I know a little bit about the way
it works but so from what little you
know how do you see it having any effect
on the field of literate programming or
programming in general no well it's it
it talks to me like a different it's
certainly a huge impact on artificial
intelligence and a lot of the algorithms
that are that are used in order to in
order to deal with
things that are okay to me the I've
always looked for a way of getting
automatic translation so I wouldn't have
to use a dictionary but I only had to
learn a dialect of English when I'm when
I'm dealing with with with things from
other languages and and this this seems
to have this seems to be happening now
but I haven't got anything anything
profound to say about it like a friend
of mine gave me a wonderful book they
started out with with Alice in
Wonderland and translated it by Machine
into French and then translated that
into English and back into French and
until he had a stable after two cycles
you get the same thing back again and
and then they printed the whole thing in
the stable form and and and so well is
it's it's so the rabbit is saying Oh
precious instead of oh dear good could I
yeah I'm gonna interject here I'm gonna
take the liberty of asking the last
question oh okay so you know years and
years ago when I was studying computer
science there was a lot more expectation
for mathematical training and I've
noticed over the ensuing 30 or 40 years
that there's less and less dependence on
mathematics and my impression is is that
students are less trained in that I
remember it was very good with Stanford
for a number of years about whether to
have an undergraduate degree in computer
science and so forth
and I think there was a presumption that
people should have mathematics training
and so forth before they they went into
computer science do you think how is
computer science changed as the role of
mathematics has become less in the field
and be interested your view yeah okay
another great question like all of these
questions have been have been reading
read through it so there's a lot of
computer science a good computer science
that can be done without i with allowed
without a lot of mathematics now but
they but there's just as many examples
of really of really cutting-edge
mathematics going into computer science
as well i mean i just go through the
through our building and you know
computer graphics all the rendering
methods that are that are heavily based
on mathematics and all and you know that
the new camera techniques are people are
using are using high mathematics in
artificial intelligence all of the
Bayesian network the calculations with
with with robotics are requiring are
requiring great mathematics so you know
Oliver so I don't think however that I
need a terrific amount of mathematics to
come up with Facebook but still I I
understand the way Facebook is able to
do its magic is by is but you actually
put putting everybody's Facebook page in
one giant computer somewhere in any way
that and there's certain mathematic
knowledge in order to understand caching
and and so but but not not traditional
mathematics mathematical paradigms are
still there you have to know concepts of
of rigorous proof for at least half of
computer science now I would say but
there's also lots of other things that
that are we talk about design of gooeys
or something like that where
where you don't need so much too many
theorems now that's true but I've heard
a few people say that reading your your
books the arts of you know the art of
computer programming and challenging if
you don't have the right mathematics
background yeah which i think is true
but ya know it's not easy to read my
books but it it could be a lot harder I
try to make them as simple as possible
but I but but I haven't succeeded in in
making breathe so with that I want to
thank Don again for coming by and
answering questions and and thank you
