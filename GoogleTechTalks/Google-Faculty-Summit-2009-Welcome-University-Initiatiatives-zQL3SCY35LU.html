hear me first runner Holly and um Ian
thank you so much for all this it's a
lot of work so a round of applause for
all of you guys for setting this up
thank you so I'm glad to be here I'm
going to go through really a couple of
different things in this I want to just
introduce what we're up to with this
faculty summit to I'll tell you a bit
about our perspective on research and
innovation some of you may know it but
not all of you and not all of you have
been to this kind of summit before and
then finally I will talk about our
University Relations programs so this is
a fairly small gathering as these things
go as you can see by looking around on
the room we try to keep it small so that
it's intimate enough that there's
actually a lot of time for discussion
with Google employees some of whom have
been your students and with each other
and to be frank that's probably the
overwhelmingly most important part of
the conference the theme this year is
we've noticed that with the aggregation
of all of these computer science and
networking kinds of things that we do we
are becoming an ever more important part
of global connection both for
information purposes and for empowerment
and communication so we're looking at
how all these things kind of aggregate
you might put that in the back of your
mind as a theme because it's quite quite
an impressive undertaking that we as a
community Google and the rest of
academia and other companies as well are
in the process of pursuing and achieving
I think as I said there'll be a lot of
time to interact with Googlers so we
hope we will explain some things to you
um this is not high gloss so please you
know ask us when we're not clear and
will tell you that like we don't know
we're talking about and that's why we
weren't clear or we'll fix it or you
know we'll try again and we'll try to
get there I'm indirect learn and have
fun it's fun to be that's a great campus
that google has here and there's plenty
of food not that you should necessarily
eat it but because we all know about
these rats which don't eat
which live forever or something but it's
one of the great conundrums in the world
here all right so with that um this is
the agenda you have it on a sheet of
paper next to I won't go through it in
much detail we are above the line here
and things are continuing on after that
but you'll see there some talks after
mine here they'll be lunch with alums
from your University Larry Page will be
here at one o'clock to talk about
something we never know what in advance
but it's always interesting up you will
talk about books and machine translation
and then what we do is we break up into
small groups again in the notion of
talking with our engineering and
research leads here and talk about what
we're doing in the areas that are listed
and then there'll be a nice cocktail
reception this evening on the patio
across the street and dinner at one of
our restaurants and then Friday the
shuttle again will come here there'll be
a technical talk on Android will have
some very fast talks on our flu trends
open data kid in our crisis response uh
initiatives well then talk about google
wave which is a new way of communicating
and it's sort of coalesce is a variety
of paradigms into a new one that we
think will be very effective and then
Alan Eustace will come and talk about
whatever he thinks is coming next and if
you have any things you want Alan who's
the senior vice president of our
research and engineering to talk about
let me know and I'll put a hour send
them a note and ask him to address them
at tianas mita to do that all right so
with that innovation and research at
Google let me go to part two of this
presentation so as you know our mission
is this probably rather well-known
phrase of organizing the world's
information and making it universal
access universally accessible and useful
it's it is really a mission statement
that drives the overwhelming majority of
what we do and it's really a terrific
mission statement to have if you're a
computer scientist or electrical
engineer because it drives an enormous
number of grand challenge problems an
organization of information of
dissemination of information
of how it is you pay for this kind of
activity and the like um it's a very
broad and good charter and it's one of
the things that those of us who work in
the technology domain really like I'm
one thing it's relevant for you folks is
as you consider possibly working with us
in one way or another either through
students or research or whatever we do
look for things that fit under this
umbrella fortunately it's a pretty big
umbrella well of course the other side
of the business is in fact facilitating
commerce that itself is a valuable thing
to do unto itself but it also of course
pays for the business so that's
important also so we don't view your
advertising a bad thing we have to do in
order to pay for the business we view it
as an information dissemination and
organization izing mechanism itself that
facilitates the operation of the real
world but indeed it does so there are a
variety of things we do there and
there's an enormous number of challenges
in the advertising space for example in
algorithms and auctions and game theory
and economics and the confluence of all
these activities so we have a lot of
work in that part of the business as
well we don't believe innovation begins
just with research innovation is a much
broader topic and as we try to keep our
business innovative in our now 11th year
of operation we have a very strong
commitment across really everyone in the
business I was meeting with our chief
financial officer in New York for about
an hour and a half on Monday of this
week I guess or Tuesday perhaps and and
we're all committed even the CFO we're
all committed to doing things that are
innovative and that's really I think the
most important thing at the business we
have this rich domain their grand
challenge problems there is a cultural
agreement here that getting concepts
into real use is often every bit as
challenging is coming up with an
algorithm or concept in the first place
and one of the implications of that has
been the structure of the engineering
organization at this company so at our
company roughly speaking a third of the
folks in engineering have PhDs
about a third or masters and our third
bachelors and we've done that because we
recognize that to do things that are
really innovative at the scale within
the domain of our mission is really hard
to do and I think for the overwhelming
majority of those people the ratio of
innovation and production etc has been
quite good and this has been a very
exciting and compelling career for them
but that's a big difference from
ourselves and a lot of other companies
where the PhDs are in research and then
they work with another group that are
not PhDs elsewhere we get a lot of
technical leverage which helps in
innovation we have this common
distributed system that we use that has
an enormous amount of building blocks
for everything from web serving to data
storage to machine learning and a
variety of relatively common components
like remote procedure call to more
specialized components for say you know
dealing with spam or something like that
but we use all of those building blocks
in a somewhat modular way to really give
us a lot of leverage on big problems so
that's one thing um second is we have a
focus on services so that's that's been
very important because it really reduces
the barrier to entry for our engineering
team to getting new things out the door
because it's been more than just
convenient for end-users it's been a
real reducer of complexity for us in
terms of not distributing lots of
packaged software now we do some of it
right there's no question but we do
relatively little and that is a big
leverage point for us and then finally I
think probably more than most firms and
certainly earlier we started realizing
we had to take a holistic approach to
design now HCI has always been a field
where you want to involve the consumer
and user and measure the user but at
Google we do it probably more than
anyone else we're just so cognizant of
the fact that the user is actually a
part of what we of the capabilities that
we provide you all probably know about
how spelling correction is done at
Google it couldn't be done without users
misspelling are noticing the misspelled
and then noticing the occasionally
correct Corrections and then feeding
that back into the system that's
symbiosis that feedback makes the user
part of the system some people call it
wisdom of the crowds but it's really a
lot broader than that and it's a it's a
whole new way of thinking about the
design of a system the system doesn't
operate in isolation trying to help the
user the system operates with the users
with mutual benefit and I'll get to that
point a little bit later because I think
that's sort of one of the grand
challenges we're pursuing fairly
directly our talent as I mentioned is
distributed across the organization and
I think I mentioned the first couple of
bullets on this that we just feel we
have to have a very broadly talented
organization and it really breaks down a
lot of the barriers to innovation so
we've had it we're a normal organization
it's always tricky to figure out when to
innovate and change things but I think
it's easier here because of that now in
research that's clearly part of
innovation as well we are here to
innovate to catalyze innovation and to
learn in ways that help Google achieve
its mission we operate within the
overall umbrella of the mission
statement but there's broad
applicability of most of cs to what we
do we do have a diversified portfolio
some things are near term there is an
emphasis at Google on you know what
probably's left over from you know the
the web year which was deemed as being
three months back in the the bubble of
2000 so we do look at things on a
quarterly basis but we have many
projects that go way longer than that
now we try to divide things into
projects which have measurable outcomes
at you no measurable periods of time but
it doesn't mean that we don't try to do
things that our couple years or more out
in nature we are trying as hard as we
can to have a ever stronger relationship
to a Kadeem and we have a strong and
growing emphasis on publication it's a
challenging thing to do here because we
do integrate a lot of the research with
the broader engineering team so it's
always an interesting question is should
you write a paper or should you try to
ship a new feature in the product so
that's a challenge that's one of the
disc
vantages to integrating horizontally in
that respect but there are a lot of
benefits to it and we do we are
publishing more and you can look at that
on our website if you'd like so a few
themes here so i put these themes
together for my keynote at at dub dub
dub this year that was in madrid about a
few months back and and as I looked at
the web and what has been achieved on
the web which is really tremendous a lot
of it has occurred bottom-up but that
it's been moving in a reasonably
coherent direction and when you look at
all these bottom-up innovations they've
been pretty remarkable and what they've
generated I think that's happening in
these themes as well so what I tried to
look at is some things that are
happening bottom-up today that will look
back on a few years from now and say
that was pretty remarkable what happened
in that period of time again this is not
just work here although it's work we're
very interested in so one theme and
their three of them that I'll mention
one theme I refer to is totally
transparent processing so can we break
down barriers to communication and our
information processing and retrieval
with computer systems in ways that have
not previously been done so we can we
break down all the barriers that occur
because we use a lot of different kinds
of end-user devices and seemingly a
growing number of them with the great
diversity in what people will do with
pervasive devices can we work across the
set of all human languages and try to
mitigate the impact that of not speaking
the same language with each other um can
we work across the set of all modalities
text image audio video graphics other
sensor base data may be structured data
may be included in that list can we work
across them and can we work across the
set of all corpora as if there are no
boundaries between them so can we search
all of them for example so in a certain
sense you know you can probably look at
from your vantage point in your field of
things that you or your colleagues are
doing on almost any one of these sub
points so you know you look at you know
image search for example and how can we
find objects within images
label all right that's part of one of
these things right that's going from
text to image all right can we go image
to text while people do that in facial
recognition so if we look at all the
individual things we're doing they
really do fit to a large degree into
these themes in many cases but if you
think about what it is at the broad
level we should be very proud of what
we're doing as a field so I think this
is one of the grand challenges that
we're looking at so just for example one
of the pictures and you'll see more of
these kinds of things in the world wide
web pub is many of these arrows really
are filled in today so for example we've
spent a lot of time at Google on voice
search on mobile devices so voice to
text all right or voiced image right I
want to find a picture of someone you'd
say the name of the person and get back
the image and a lot of them so you can
imagine so not all these things are
filled and I think one of the arrows I
didn't fill in is I don't think we're
going from we're not doing video to
image very much no but you can imagine
it you can imagine that's a useful thing
find me images that capture this and in
fact there's one of the research efforts
that I think I talked about today what
we've been funding does that by creating
panoramix from a sequence of frames that
enables us to get a better idea of what
the video is from a single image so
that's one thought um the second thing
is what's going on on the computational
platform so you could call that ideal
distributed computing but clearly what's
changed a lot is the creation of huge
huge utility clusters out there
somewhere whether within a company or
across many companies like Google / as
Google provided for many users and like
and then the seamless integration with
billions of endpoints or maybe tens of
billions or hundreds of billions of
endpoints a lot of the ideas here were
known in the 70s and 80s I mean a lot of
the structures we use at Google of you
know threading and remote procedure call
and directory services this is a chart i
used i used to do distributed systems a
long time ago and and you know a lot of
these ideas of atomicity of one form or
another time service and time
synchronization these ideas were kind of
known a long time ago
but we didn't really understand the
degree of scale that this would would
would would come into and we didn't
understand how these things would be so
loosely coupled right we thought we'd
you know with interface definition
language is defined the interfaces
compile everything and then spread out
the computations and they would run
beautifully and in fact the reality is
no one ever knows what's in the entire
system at any given time and you don't
know what's going to be done on the
system later but we're really pursue so
there were a lot of issues of that
four-minute um one of the things we also
didn't understand is the complexity of
the architecture that would result in
this so if there's a huge amount of
complexity with all of the services as
they've come to fruition that's another
big one so we didn't really understand
truly open these evolving large-scale
distributed systems that we've now come
to to use and to need more of so there's
tremendous excitement in the distributed
systems community as we approach a much
i think for sophisticated view on
distributed computing and there are many
interesting challenges here and I I
can't go through them all today but I'd
love to there's another talk on the web
where I spend a lot of time on this i
can give you a reference to that later
if you want um the last one that i think
is a really a grand challenge issue and
franz oak and i was friends in the
background we wrote a blog entry on this
notion about nine months ago i think on
google's 10th anniversary is this sort
of notion of hybrid intelligence so the
question of how far can we really go
when there's immense feedback coming
into systems on almost every interaction
between the system and the outside world
though it might be with humans right
that's a lot of what happens but it
might be with all manner of devices that
are controlled by machines and it might
be actual real data like outcomes of
health experiments or or clinical trials
it may be not just the wisdom of the
crowd but the wisdom of the world if you
will and it's real operation how far can
we go in all of this and there's so many
examples of this today there's so much
happening but as we look back say five
or 10 years from now
onto this I think we'll see all of these
things aggregating into this
tremendously valuable area of I don't
know I don't think it has to be called
hybrid intelligence but that's what I
mean is not trying to get a computer to
do something by itself but to do things
with lots of other people involved all
the time in its continuing education for
mutual benefit at google it leads to a
tremendous notion of empiricism so G
when I was at IBM I thought it was an
empirical organization with a lot of
measurement it's nothing in comparison
to Google in terms of measurement we
measure everything we're always looking
for feedback internally externally on
you know to find feedback loops in the
web on course feedback loops it's very
interesting and we're trying to always
learn from all of this data and what we
do so there are lots of challenges in
these things you know what will all the
applications be with all the new user
interface implications on this
transparent computing idea how do we
address limits to data is there enough
data to learn everything we want do we
have to create new environments where
humans can interact with systems to
teach the systems more a lot of people
look at video games for example in that
how do we integrate user feedback and
acceptable privacy aware and sensitive
fashions you know the the opportunity in
healthcare is huge as we get more and
more health IT the epidemiological
benefits are absolutely great but can we
do it in a way that doesn't spook people
the very important set of questions how
do we get new kinds of signal
annotations how do we explain scale and
minimize variance and machine learning
particularly when there's a lot of noisy
data how do we fuse approaches for
learning about systems you know fuse
things we know about syntax with things
we know about behavior in the real world
how do we do all that together how do we
deal with the usability of different
kinds of devices and subpopulations how
do we deal with all of those issues in
this so they're fascinating challenges
there are many more
and then in in the world of distributed
systems there there are a huge amount of
things to go do and you know how do we
come up with energy efficiency or
proportional proportional energy
efficient computing so computing systems
use power and proportion of the amount
of work they do is the server operating
system right for that we layer it on top
of in our case linux kernel's is that
the right structure for these mega scale
systems in the back end how do we find
good abstractions for exploiting
parallelism beyond the sort of
embarrassing inter transaction
parallelism that we typically have in
these systems continuing to focus on
reduced latency which is tricky in a
very very big network environment how do
we do that in a way that's easy because
it used to be so if it took a second
across the web who cares we don't want
that we want things to take you know
milliseconds we don't really have a good
general model of replication there are
many approaches but to do replication
well you hire a really smart person and
they go through and think through all
the alternatives and decide which is
best in the situation we haven't really
codified what we're doing how do we
apply machine learning and this feedback
system to actually manage the systems
they're complicated enough and this was
a we provided some money to Randy and
others at Berkeley to go look at issues
of this form and they've been doing that
in their rad lab among other things how
do we do automatic dynamic placement of
data and computation and in fact dealing
with constraints of governments on where
they want their data to be and those are
very interesting issues how do we deal
with security like access control lists
that's a really interesting problem
other good privacy models and many more
things so lots of challenges these are
all areas that we're interested in and
to some degree working on ourselves so
now let me turn to the last portion of
this talk and that is to discuss
university relations with you so we're
involved with universities for a number
of reasons um
probably more than anything else we know
that so much of what we do has been born
in the university environment so we're
we're well aware of that fact that you
know even you know the original ideas at
Google came out of our founders at
Stanford so we are extremely supportive
of the role of the University in our
ecosystem and we have been since pretty
early on in the business and we're
trying to grow our commitment and our
involvement in many ways with that which
I'll describe to you that's that's the
first part of it in addition that comes
to fruition is we clearly want to
recruit talented people we want to make
sure that we both catalyze and help and
understand relevant research and we want
to make sure that we stay relevant that
we are doing things we know what's
happening it's easy to become irrelevant
to get some isolated we don't want that
um so in terms of just some of these
topics you should know we have about 700
plus internships around the world I'm
more in the US than elsewhere but good
representation and other continents are
the hundreds of full-time new hires and
engineering in no.9 we provide over 60
scholarships the Anita Borg they're also
scholarships given through uncf and hcf
um we have some special programs i'll
talk a little more about our Summer of
Code but you could also talk to Chris
DiBona who's here who's heavily involved
in that um we're even reaching out
through universities to high school
teachers to try to help educate more
high school students so that the
pipeline of computer scientists is there
for our mutual benefit yours as well we
have a research awards programs we fund
about 125 projects and PhD students the
next due dates for awards or August
fifteenth and then we have a program we
do with wpp that do work in sort of
economics and operations research and
marketing kinds of things
and those awards are the proposal due to
us October 15th we have visiting faculty
program there about 20 visiting faculty
at one or another side of google at any
given time thanks to the work of leslie
a johnson we have a PhD fellowship
program this year that we started in the
u.s. we hope to roll it out globally and
we of course will continue it next year
and we have 13 named fellowships you can
be the google machine learning if i hold
the fellowship and google machine
learning or a variety of other things
we've named them individually we thought
that would be nice for the students to
be the 2009 fellowship holder of the
google fellowship and machine learning
and we do some focus larger programs as
well which i'll briefly mention so i'm
going to go through some things kind of
quickly and technology awareness um we
produce some course where you can find
some of that on some websites i'll show
you we've been helping and providing
some resources not obviously the bulk of
resources needed by researchers but we
provided a cluster with the help also of
IBM to the NSF clue program for use in
using MapReduce style cluster computing
to about roughly speaking 15 University
so far are set up to do this we provide
some applications for education and
we're providing some data this is the
number one request i get is can we
provide more data for machine learning
purposes we provide some it's a big
privacy problem to go do a lot of it
it's hard to do but we do some and
you'll hear probably more about it from
franz as to what we're doing with
machine translation to assist in that um
the Summer of Code activity is great so
what we do is we help get about a
thousand students focused on open-source
products open source projects that are
ongoing on ongoing is a faculty advisor
and students and we get really enormous
amount of work catalyzing growth and
open source we think for the benefit of
the open source efforts and also clearly
for the benefits of the students
flip it's not burgers I guess is the
model the mention this cs4 high school
these are some of the institutions that
we worked with these things happen in
different ways reflecting the desires of
faculty to actually teach so you don't
have a set curriculum that we always
want to use with with high school
students we're not really sure we know
exactly what's right in all situations
so that some diversity in this but these
are some of the the programs that we're
doing and we've seen this for a long
time CMU did this outreach show for
women a long time ago in the high
schools and it really works they showed
it really work in getting more of a
pipeline for women into the field we
think it works more broadly with good
education and good mentors in the high
schools just a much higher chance that
people will find our field interesting
in terms of the research programs um
what we request from people is a
proposal on a project description that's
concise and lucid preferably it's always
good to have a it's not always lucid I
confess we'd like to have a Google
sponsor that you found so that's
obviously not exactly an effective
procedure that I've specified as to how
you find such a person but these
meetings are good ways of doing it for
example and you probably know people
here so it's good to find someone that
will be the liaison so that we can talk
to you and understand what you're doing
the award range usually supports one or
two students we give out grants rather
than contracts to avoid all of the IP
licensing issues that happen when
lawyers get together and you can find
out more on our website on this I'm
visiting faculty things there are many
fewer of those that just probably
worthwhile to talk to us but ultimately
we end up with a we get a proposal
together that we can review at the
research hiring committee actually and
we go look through that and make sure it
looks like it's mutually beneficial and
that something will accrue from it um I
would love to spend a lot of time
discussing sort of 150 grants that we've
given out but that would use up all of
bread chen's time and that would be
problematic so I'm just going to just
kind of look at the top line of these
things and we can probably put these
charts up on the web so um which what
the children do with the web it's
actually interesting I'm embarrassed to
tell you this but might like
four-year-olds when they first used the
web my boy in particular typed how do I
get rich was what he typed to Google now
I don't think we're a very materialistic
family and we never emphasized any of
that but he thought Google could answer
that question so it's very interesting
nek so if it's clearly clearly
interesting what kids do and what they
use the web for um we're working with
shrien I are some of may know I'm a
great camera guy at Columbia on helping
him develop a assemble digital camera
that can then be used kind of as a basis
of teaching engineering and computers
and optics and things to people around
the world so he's really excited about
that and were glad to support that we
dick lion works with us in cameras for
example in the street view they're
somewhat more sophisticated cameras I
believe but maybe in a few years that we
that simple we are we did a project a
while back on the image label or work
with luis von ahn and you've seen the
results of that in Lewis's company that
he's built him the whole captcha thing
has this has helped grow the captcha
thing effectively and we use it it's
getting harder and harder to do the
captures I notice even for me but done
that's still there's still more work to
be done there must be something better
than CAPTCHAs but no one knows what it
is anyone can tell me I would love to
hear that we do work overseas on
extraction and classification at
shanghai jiao tong university i was
there last year we're looking at at
speech translation speech-to-speech
translation so we're doing that with
University of Cambridge that's clearly
one of the Mogao
any things you'd like to see is you
cannot just go from speech to speech but
speech to speech in another language and
that's work we're working on video
summary and synopsis is an example of a
panoramic video mosaic that we create
out of multiple frames in a video to
help summit looking at stemming and
transliteration for the diversity and
breadth of the Indian languages there's
a huge population in India that doesn't
use English and they will become web
aware at some point and we would like to
serve that population how can we
understand the layout of objects as we
scan them this is important say in our
books effort you might be able to hear
more about that later when we talk about
that collaborative filtering looking at
how we can work on getting other users
to help a another user based upon the
knowledge of each other in the social
graph and such things trying to learn in
a more direct collaborative way meeting
schedulers you can imagine that finding
3d landmarks on the fly and trying to
sort of rapidly create these 3d
landmarks from image data that we have
document classification again overseas
natural sounds you'd like to be able to
search for sounds not just words or
documents can you can you actually
understand sounds and will that help us
and doing better acoustic models for
things beyond just speech tone marked
pronunciation for a variety of languages
where we need other kinds of text to
speech kind of prosody issues in them we
also visiting faculty just of just a few
you'll hear from Hal Abelson who is
either a visiting faculty member or the
oldest intern at Google is that correct
hell I hope I did steal your thunder but
basically I must tell you this that for
HR procedural issues visiting faculty
member is a subclass of type in turn
which is interesting thing so how
thought that was either annoying or
humorous or perhaps both both so he
became the she'll hear about the android
app inventor so how's been working with
a few Googlers and put together an
educational platform that will I think
you'll find interesting based upon
visual programming in the in the mobile
space we worked with Professor Connolly
and actually managed to get google sky
out of that effort which was a terrific
terrific collaboration we've been
working on machine translation with
Professor Osborne and and also it's it's
lots of lots of these things have gone
on with visiting fact so we spend a lot
of time to try to find good projects but
then many of the things have turned out
well so I think we maybe twenty five
percent of the projects are actually
memorable for specific accomplishments
that have benefited the career of the
faculty member and Google maybe even
more that's a pretty good ratio I think
for these things they've all been
beneficial but most of them are really
many of them are memorable um we're
providing google apps on a variety of
places to help the technology enterprise
lots of schools are using the apps that
we have so that's been effective we
mentioned the Kluwe program of providing
computational clusters so we're working
on that as well I guess they're 14
projects there's another date for
submission to the NSF for proposals I
guess to support this that's mid-august
that's coming up but you'll have to
check with the NSF website we've been
working on course content and course
material for some of the things that are
ongoing on the web and we have course
material on that stuff you might find
useful on the website that's listed UM
at Berkeley as I mentioned we looked
after Randy Katz was on sabbatical here
for a year we looked at helping to fund
the rad lab of Bill corn who is an SVP
of engineering catalyze this to look at
how the universities could get more
involved in
the management and operation and control
and understanding of these large cluster
systems and they pursued an active and
aggressive program in that we've been
glad to provide some of the support for
it geospatial publishing is another
space the backplane of Google Earth is
just a very useful place to use as a
pallet on which to put lots of
information and we see the benefits of
that with all the planes of data that
are now on Google Earth and it's been
very helpful in a variety of communities
I was really excited when I went to
scripts to see the excitement in Google
ocean and all of the information that's
getting pooled their no pun intended to
you know help communities it used to
have the information stored separately
now bring it together in one in one
place so what I think it would be good
to do now is just turn to an
announcement that I'd like to make and
then I've got a couple of concluding
slides and maybe they'll be time for
just a few questions so what I want to
do now is introduce Maggie Johnson this
is actually the first public
introduction in this setting for Maggie
Maggie is our new director of education
and university relations so Maggie is
combining our interest in education
internally and externally and university
relations into a new director level
position at Google and she'll come up
and say a couple of words for you in
just a minute working with Maggie will
be Jeff Wallace who all of you probably
know and leslie johnson who i mentioned
earlier so this is all part of our plan
to try to give this more sort of
aggressive and a coherent focus within
the business so Maggie want to come and
say a few words
Thank You Alfred I just wanted to also
say this- okay yeah i also wanted to
just welcome everyone the faculty summit
is definitely one of the high points of
the summer for us at google so it's
really great that all of you could take
some time off and come spend a couple
days with us it's really a it's really
nice to see everyone so there have been
some changes in university relations
that that alfred mentioned just really
briefly my background is I've been at
Google for about four years now and my
main role has been to manage to the
groups that do all the internal
education for our software and hardware
engineers and our data center staff and
now we've expanded that to include
university relations and we're also
starting to think much more deliberately
about education now this is computer
science education at the undergraduate
level and we're also thinking about what
we can do what Google can uniquely
contribute to help in k-12 as well so
we're really trying to figure out what
are the best ways for Google to really
help across that whole spectrum of
education so the only other thing I
wanted to say is it Jeff and Leslie and
then the team have done a great job over
the last four years building
relationships with with faculty at
universities around the world and
running all the programs that Alfred
just describes so they and will be
continuing to maintain and build those
relationships and we're also going to be
looking at a lot of other opportunities
to work more with you so that can range
from you know doing more of these sort
of short-term smaller grants and also
looking at how we might be able to do
some more longer term and deeper grants
with you know along specific initiatives
so there's a number of things that we're
looking at and we'll just kind of go
from there and again welcome and look
forward to talking with you more over
the next couple days thanks
some of you may know so Maggie had a
long before Google mega had a long
career in the university world first of
course with a PhD in the field and then
at Stanford for what 15 years or
something like that in a variety of
different education on other roles so
she knows Google really well and she
knows the university world and computer
science really well so it's a very nice
thing so thanks to all of you in
university relations for so much on
these all these programs and I echo
everything Maggie said Jeff thank you so
much for getting us to this stage here
all right so um I have two more charts
one is there has to be a URL next and
there is because this is of course a web
company so there is a new research
website that went up two days ago in
time for this called researched google
com but if you make a mistake and put
www in front of it it's okay so on that
site you will find blog entries that we
make lists of papers that Googlers have
published our observations links to
videos that we've done on some of the
technologies that we built and we hope
it will be a vibrant and useful spot to
find things about us so you'll see a lot
more on it than you have in the past
it's not the huge you know we don't do
really big flashy websites things are
relatively understated in the Google web
design world so don't expect you know
flashing lights and things of that form
but I think you'll see a much nicer
layout and a lot more information on it
and then within that there is a
University Relations page that discusses
in more depth than I had time to in 45
minutes to go through some of the
programs and activities that we've been
doing and we'll try to keep that up to
date as well so without further ado I
would like to also echo Maggie's thanks
that you are willing and happy to come
and spend a couple of days with us and
we're really delighted that you've done
that so thank
and I could take a couple of questions
cuz I just probably could could use the
mic this is my crib yeah Brenda so
Alfred no twitter feed for Google
research there is yep now that was the
the cynical question ok the real
question is could you give us any
insights into into sort of areas that
Google is hiring also geographically as
you look forward over maybe the next
year uh so the answers I'm not actually
a member of the operating committee of
Google so a research hiring I beg your
pardon ok I thought you were asking a
general question I was going to try to
answer it anyway but I was going to do
it with that caveat um so I think
research um will probably be hiring
probably centered in the bay area and in
New York we have the largest research
presence in certain in certain areas so
the I think you'll see hiring in systems
in machine learning in information
retrieval broadly speaking I have a
feeling we'll probably be doing more in
computer security as well what you
should know is that when when Randy
asked about research it may be
researchers that work in our engineering
organization right and doing some
mixture of you know what we might
consider research from a university
perspective and engineering service
development so I think it's a pretty
broad set of activities Randy in general
I don't think that there's like gee we
didn't hire enough in that here that's
where all the growth is going to be
there are some new initiatives that
we're doing as you somehow seen I could
imagine they will need more staff as we
get more into desktop stuff and what
have you yep you go ahead yes is your
mic there's a
sorry but it's it prevents blood clots
getting on so it's all right that's fine
um I just hope that used to calc on San
Diego I was looking at the key themes
over and again the three Keith
information and the message that comes
out is how information affect society
and you're capturing that in your themes
the part that I thought I noted by being
absent is how data is affecting
engineering structures and society
infrastructures and Google does have
course quite a bit in power meters and
our electricity and data centers but
there is a broader view beyond just
looking at interface to the enduring two
devices and actually it's the other side
of it that is looking at data from the
engineering ingenuity structures right
and I was just learning you for that is
a separate division or well it's it's
it's interesting point so first we are
to a degree a consumer company to a
large extent so the focus of Google is
very much on individuals in the
societies that they comprise so I think
it's not surprising it's quite natural
for anyone standing in front of you from
google to look at the societal
implications of technology sort of first
now then we do also look at things as it
relates to our own apparatus that is to
say the data center for example look at
how all that information affects the
data center you will hear you're welcome
to talk to ed Lu later he'll be there
looking at the power meter initiative
and you could talk to look bill while is
here or not today talking about energy
in the in the server complexes etc but
we do we do care about that the extent
to which we really get involved though
in you know do we monitor bridges to see
if there's stress on bridges so we could
try to prevent the kind of collapse that
was seen in in Minnesota I don't know
whether that's the highest priority here
or not so I'm glad to have a lot of
quality oh that's a great that's a great
topic and that's a very interesting one
and our dorg people might very well be
interested in that someone from
or we'll be here the google charitable
arm might be here to look at that so
that's a that's a good good point to
bring up thank you one more question if
there is one or shall we call it a day
without okay well again thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
