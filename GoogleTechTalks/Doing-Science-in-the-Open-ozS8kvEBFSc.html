Hubble Space Telescope and I've got a
couple questions for you if people can
just kind of you know say out loud what
they think so we put these these
questions here on the side is this
galaxy simply smooth and rounded with no
sign of a disk or does it have features
or a disk what do you think it's a star
or some kind of weird you know image
artifact so does anybody want to venture
an opinion yeah you reckon it's got some
features so it's got some kind of
structure ok so do you think the galaxy
has a mostly clumpy appearance or not
really not really ok do you think this
could be a disk feud edge on some here
ok I'm getting lots of knows there is
there a sign of a bar feature through
the center of the galaxy ok that's
interesting confirmation for me actually
I kind of I was a bit unsure of it yeah
yeah I reckon so too it's not very
strong but it's just there do you think
there's any sign of us you know a spiral
arm pattern or no spiral ok lots of
knows this is kind of it's actually a
fairly complicated one how prominent is
the central bulge compared with the rest
of the galaxy so there's a bunch of
options there you know there's no bulge
just noticeable obvious or really
dominant yeah is there anything else
that's odd about this
it's kind of hard for you to answer
actually not having seen a bunch of them
but I'll just tell you I think the
answer's no it's not particularly
unusual like I mean how can you tell
okay so a couple of facts then we go
through a similar process again not
necessarily as complicated can I get the
lights back up again so I said this was
an image from the Hubble Space Telescope
it's actually probably an image that's
never been seen before by a human being
so yeah they've collected a lot of data
and they need to process it in some way
and it turns out that for a lot of
processing tasks human beings are still
actually better than the best computer
algorithms and so some people at Oxford
University in 2007 had the idea of
crowdsourcing classification of galaxies
and basically the idea is that you go
through a little training process where
you know they kind of test you out and
once you've had a bit of experience they
set you loose then to analyze data
originally they were doing it from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey which is a
different telescope and they classified
something like a million images from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey actually they
classified all of the images many times
over they asked people it's not just one
person is shown one galaxy but I think
ended up actually getting 30 people to
classify each galaxy and they did
various things they would randomly flip
the galaxies in case there was some kind
of problem in the human visual system in
terms of you know if there are things
like spirals determining whether it it's
rotating clockwise or counterclockwise
maybe there's some bias in the human
visual system actually they were able
once they backed out the results to
determine that there was a bias in the
human visual system we're slightly more
likely to see things going one way or
the other coming interesting
physiological discovery but the basic
point is that the best computer
algorithms for doing these kinds of
classifications turned out to be not
quite as good as
careful analysis by professionals and
with the data that they've gathered
they've been able to determine that in
fact this kind of crowd sourcing
potentially by amateurs is comparable
once you post process the results too
careful classification by professionals
in fact they're using some of the data
to train computer algorithms to do a
better job than was heretofore the case
so you know what we just went through
that process doesn't necessarily look
all had interest in here why why would
you go through such a process so the
initial motivation at least was a
question about whether or not galaxies
have a particular preference in terms of
handedness so if you look at spiral
galaxies out there in the universe
there's a question do they tend to look
a little bit more you know are they
pointing in some direction is there some
slight preference and there was an
astrophysicist in 2006 who had claimed
on the basis of analysis of a small
number of galaxies that in fact there
was just a slight preference but but
statistically significant for the
galaxies are spiral galaxies axes to
point in a particular direction in the
universe and if this was true is pretty
cool it was not something was predicted
by the standard big bong Big Bang model
of cosmology so it would cause
potentially a pretty serious revision to
our thinking about how the universe got
started so you noted this project is
crowdsourcing project to try and analyze
a very large number of galaxies and see
whether or not they could get a more
conclusive answer to this question and
it turns out by the way that the answer
is no in fact it was just a statistical
artifact but along the way they've made
many more much more interesting
discoveries I think than they originally
anticipated let me show you just a
couple well I should say by the way the
just want to talk a little bit about the
scale so they started with a million
galaxies that they were classifying
they've been able to recruit 300,000
people to participate and so far they've
done about 150 million galaxies
classifications actually I think they
might have gone past 200 million now so
they're doing pretty well and at peak
times you know it goes up and down a lot
but at peak times though they'll be
certainly getting many tens of thousands
of classifications per hour and and that
adds up it's certainly better than
having some poor grad student sit there
doing classification it was actually a
poor grad student named Kevin Schwinn
ski at Oxford who had SAT here for one
week and did 50,000 classifications and
he he went off for a beer with a postdoc
at Oxford after that and said there has
to be a better way that's where this
project came from so some examples of
some other things that have been
discovered here is the Galaxy Zoo forum
just get it right
chisholm right okay it's unfortunately
not very easily visible oh my goodness
it doesn't really matter it is actually
yeah there's a little green dot in the
middle and so one of the year that one
of the Galaxy Zoo for remembers pretty
early in the project actually came onto
the forum and said this is something
unusual looking for a galaxy he just he
wasn't expecting to see a small green a
galaxy like this and asked what is it
and a few days later somebody else
posted a similar-looking galaxy and said
what's this and then some people were
looking at the spectra of the galaxies
and noticed that are pretty unusual in
certain ways in particular they were
able to determine that the galaxies were
surrounded by very hot ionized oxygen
gas which is unusual for galaxies at
least nobody had heard of a similar type
of galaxies being found it turned out
that they'd actually discovered an
entirely new class of galaxies there now
known as the green pea galaxies they
were actually able to track down and
took I guess about six or seven months
of pretty hard work initially it was
just all this looks cool you know here's
another one here's another one then they
started to do some spectral analysis
then I started to write database queries
that would actually pick out from the
database possible candidates and they
compiled a list they looked at them more
carefully they're able to identify about
260 candidate green pea galaxies some
professional astrophysicists got
involved and ultimately there's actually
now a series of papers about this new
class of galaxies that's pretty cool
kind of a thing to have happen to start
with what is this and to end up with
that here's another example of a similar
discovery
this is a Dutch school teacher named any
gonna hole up there unless she's a one
of the Galaxy Zoo participants and she
was looking at galaxies one day see here
there's a faint glimmer of blue on this
image so she had the presence of mind to
post to the forum and say what is yeah
that's good what is this blue gas cloud
below and once again people kind of
battered ideas backwards and forwards
but nobody knew professional
astrophysicists started to take a look
none of them knew either and again we
have this interesting situation actually
a bunch of papers have been written some
of them we have mrs. Van articles name
on it it's okay so here's one of the
first and they named the object after
her hanys of all group she's Dutch
bulwark is apparently the Dutch word for
object and at least one of the theories
about what it might be is that it might
be a quasar a light echo so the idea is
that about 100,000 years or so ago that
nearby galaxies contained an incredibly
blah bright quasar really you're
lighting up the entire region and in
particular what we now see as the warp
that blue gas cloud was actually a
nearby dwarf galaxies whose gas was
being heated up by the quasar and what
we're seeing is the remnants of that
heating it basically it's just glowing
with remnants of that energy and for
reasons that nobody really understands
very well the quasar has since turned
off so that's why we don't see it in the
galaxy it's not entirely satisfactory
explanation I must say and some people
have put forward other explanations you
know the question is why did it
conveniently turn off the quasar nearby
so some people are not convinced by this
and there's a bit of a discussion going
on in the astrophysics community but
it's another example where an amateur
has kicked off
an interesting discovery okay so Galaxy
Zoo is just one example of a phenomenon
I want to talk about today it's an
example of a guest network science the
use of online tools to do science in new
and interesting ways and in particular
to solve problems that just you in some
sense weren't accessible before to
scientists and so I'm kind of talk be
out a second example of this can I ask a
question did any of you present at TEDx
Waterloo okay good so you've seen some
of what I'll talk about but not all of
it I just want to get some background
different people tend to respond in
different ways how many people have a
PhD or published a paper okay all right
it changes slightly some emphasis later
on how many people have contributed to
an open source software project okay and
I how many people are regularly using
open source tools as part of their
day-to-day jobs okay not surprising all
right so my focus is going to be on
basic science and talking about the
impact of the network on on basic
science I'm going to move to a new
example it's an example it's a project
that was started by a mathematician
named Timothy Gower's so Gower's is a
mathematician at Cambridge University
he's one of the world's leading
mathematicians he received the Fields
Medal which is often called the Nobel
Prize of mathematics and in early 2009
January 27 he put a post up on his blog
Gallas is a blogger in addition to being
a leading mathematician and the post was
entitled is a civ lee collaborative
mathematics possible and basically the
idea
galvez was proposing was to take a very
difficult mathematical problem and
unsolved mathematical problem one which
he said he would love to solve and try
to attack it completely in the open
using his blog as a medium to attack the
problem so the idea was to invite
anybody in the world who wanted to
contribute to come in and to post their
ideas about the problem as comments on
his blog very similar in some sense it
obviously similar in spirit to the way
in which open source software is
developed although the actual details of
the medium quite quite different
ultimately it would spread out not just
on gaolers blog but also would spread to
a wiki which I'll show you in a moment
so I want to tell you just very briefly
just to give you the flavor of what the
mathematical problem was that ours was
considering it doesn't really matter you
don't actually need to know the details
but just to give you the flavor the
flavor is this you wanted to attack a
problem that the circle density hales do
it theorem so what I want you to do is
to imagine a noughts and crosses board
just standard noughts and crosses board
and you're going to fill it up with a
certain number of pieces and you can see
that once you fill in enough pieces on
the board in fact once you fill in seven
pieces on the board you force a line
somewhere right there's no way you can
fill in seven pieces without getting a
line somewhere but if you fill in only
six you can convince yourself with a
little bit of work that actually it's
possible to fill them in in such a way
that there's no line forced anywhere so
what the entity house do at theorem does
or it concerns itself with is
considering what happens when you take
noughts and crosses not some process
board in a very large number of
dimensions so it's no longer three
dimensions a very large number of
dimensions and it's not just 3 x 3 x 3 x
3 x 3 but it's actually n by N by N by N
by N and it tells me something kind of
incredible if you go to a very large
number of dimensions the a fraction of
the ball would that you need to fill in
in order to force a line somewhere so it
doesn't matter how carefully you fill it
in there is a line forced somewhere but
actually that fraction gets smaller and
smaller and smaller so you don't
actually need to fill in most of the
board as you do in two dimensions
instead in the limit of a large number
of dimensions actually a vanishingly
small fraction of the board is all you
need to well in fact you're forced to
have line even if you fill in a
vanishingly small fraction they so this
is kind of kind of surprising and
shocking in my opinion now you might say
okay so what on earth yeah who cares it
sounds like sort of maybe an
entertaining problem but not necessarily
one that's very important you know it's
difficult to explain why this this kind
of a result is important i will say that
there are reasons to suspect that it's
connected to other results which have
been proved over the last ten years
which concern the distribution of prime
numbers yeah that sounds kind of
shocking right that there'd be some
connection between this geometric
problem in high dimensions and the
distribution of the prime numbers but
indeed there was actually kind of an
argument to be made and that's why some
leading mathematicians part of the
reason why some of these leading
mathematicians involved so that's a bit
of a digression on what the problem was
let's get back to the actual kind of the
social software or the open-source
science aspect of it and you can see
I'll just show you what the discussion
looked like so here's galas he's you
know talking about some of his ideas he
seated the discussion with a list of 38
ideas about how to attack it and if you
come down here what you'll see is you'll
see people this is actually the start of
people's attack on the problem but the
very first person to comment while it's
actually Gower's himself he kind of I
guess for about seven hours after he
posted this initial said nobody did
nobody said anything and then a
mathematician named Joseph solomo see
from the University of British Columbia
comes
in at nine oh eight pm on 32 the first
2009 and he writes this comment and it's
just it's an idea it's a little idea and
then a few minutes after that Jason
dyess this is fifteen minutes later
another person Jason Dyer comes in he's
got his own little idea Diaries by the
way he's a or was at the time a high
school teacher in Arizona and then
another mathematician comes in Terence
Tao this is just three minutes after
that and he's got his own suggestion so
Jerrod's towers actually he's like
yahwah's one of the world's leading
mathematicians he's another field
medalist and we're kind of often running
you can see I keep you you can't wait
see the scroll pub we just keep going
and going and going in every few minutes
there's another another idea that comes
in you can see people actually in real
time going to bed or waking up or
whatnot is they'll be absent for a few
hours from the common thread it's kind
of fun to go through actually a very
interesting thing to do if for people
who have some interest in doing research
even if they're not interested in this
particular problem is to read through
the comment threads you're seeing
leading mathematicians solve a problem
in real time right this is not something
that we would narrowly get the
opportunity to do it's kind of like here
standing over N Stein's shoulder and
watching him right in his notebook or
being able to interview him it's kind of
an interesting thing to be able to do
and you start to get a feel for how
people think for how they attack
problems one of the things that is most
interesting is to see the extent to
which people are willing to just be you
know every idea they chase down and
people make mistakes they do silly
things they forget things and someone
this kind of romanticized image that
people often have of of breakthroughs is
not really in evidence it's very very
hard work on the part of the people
involved and they chase down a lot of
either incorrect ideas or ideas which
half-baked to need a lot of modification
you really get to see that in detail
okay so this went on through quite a few
posts for quite some period of time
there was also as I mentioned before a
polymath wiki and this had the function
essentially of being a repository
basically as people go through this
these kind of comment threads they're
coming up with ideas and gradually
refining the ideas but it's hard to read
through all the common threads and a lot
of it's fairly half-baked so what people
were using more wiki for was to store
kind of useful reference materials and
also the progress which had been made to
say this is what we now know for sure so
after 37 days Gower's put up a poster
the problem was probably solved he
ultimately turned out to be correct they
still needed to check over a bunch of
things but indeed at this point they
actually had a year the essential core
of the argument so this was 37 days
during that time they'd had 800
substantive mathematical comments from
27 contributors containing about a
hundred and seventy thousand words which
if you've ever tried to read that much
mathematics is it's a lot of mathematics
that by the way is just on the on the
blog's that were involved it doesn't
include the wiki contributions which
were also very substantial but which are
a little bit harder to count so yeah
this was really quite remarkably
successful especially for a first shot
using off-the-shelf tools this is a
wordpress blog really the only two there
are two special things about it one is
that it has a threading plug-in which
means that the comments are at least a
little bit threaded and the other is
that it has a plug-in which allows you
to do mathematics on it to get nicely
formatted mathematics and that's that's
basically it there's actually a funny
story about the mathematics plugin which
is it was written by a
employee at WordPress Michael Adams just
kind of for fun and he has this blog
post we he says I wrote this you know
wordpress plugin that will they issue
mathematics I'm sure there's probably
only three people in the world who care
I don't think he anticipated that this
is the kind of thing it would be used to
do so just to give you some idea of webs
project has gone here's the main page of
the polymath wiki and there have been a
bunch more polymath projects which have
gone on and polymath like project to do
all kinds of different things now how
many people heard the news was pretty
widely reported that there was a
supposed solution to the P versus NP
problem last year okay so most of you
and actually a very interesting thing
happened many of the same people who
were involved in this first polymath
project got involved in what was
essentially a polymath project to take
the part of the paper this if you look
here we are we right so one of the pages
here the researchers name there was
viene de la loca and so that the
polymath McGee was used not actually on
ours blog but rather on Richard Lipton's
blog they essentially an impromptu
polymath project kind of convened there
there are more than 100 mathematicians
involved and they took this 110 page
supposed proof and really just
absolutely took it apart to find where
there were errors where they were
interesting insights with interesting
ideas and people from all over with all
kinds of different expertise there were
logicians computer scientists there were
theoretical physicists involved there
were some people from outside any of
those disciplines and really trying to
see what it was in this paper if
anything and it was much much faster
after
a week they concluded that unfortunately
the central idea in the paper was
probably wrong I think that's the
consensus now they were able to recover
a few small bits and pieces however
interesting ideas in the paper okay all
right so that's kind of where the
polymath project is had a couple of
notable points1 is that you're as I said
before it's very primitive kind of tools
and in substance that's actually an
advantage it's a little bit like the
early days of many open-source software
projects certainly if you look at the
early days of Linux for example you know
it's people reading mailing lists and
then sending dips via email to Linus
Torvalds this is not a sophisticated
kind of an approach and this has
something of the same flavor it's very
much bare bones the other thing which is
I think interesting is about the
scalability of the approach 27
mathematicians is a large number from
mathematics collaboration but it's
really quite a small number of course in
the scheme of things certainly compared
with Galaxy Zoo with 300,000 people and
it's an interesting and I think open
question to what extent we can scale up
so some of these other projects have
involved more people but we're still not
talking about thousands of people we're
talking about maybe on the order of 100
people it's an interesting question how
much better we can do than there all
right so that's a couple of fairly
optimistic examples I want to talk about
some reasons for pessimism about doing
network science so in particular let me
show you example so the science journal
Nature probably the world's leading
journal in 2006 conducted a very
ambitious experiment it was what they
called the open peer-reviewed trial and
they really threw their weight behind it
and
and made a big attempt at this the
concept was that when authors submitted
their papers to nature that's the option
of having a kind of an open peer review
process conducted so the paper would be
posted publicly and then comments would
be invited and there would be an
opportunity to rebut and so on and what
nature noticed during the period of the
period of this trial it took several
months quite a few people were willing
to take them up on it authors were
willing to take them up on it there was
huge traffic to the site people were
very interested in seeing as but nobody
or very few people willing to offer
comments and so nature is a very high
visibility example of this but there are
other similar organizations have tried
the same kind of thing so many
organizations have tried to build what
is essentially kind of an amazon.com
style review system for for papers
similar kind of an idea you'll have
papers in it's very common in my field
of physics for example many people have
built sites which take physics papers
often preprints which have just been
released by the others and give people
the opportunity to write comments and I
don't keep track of how many such sites
have been started but at least half a
dozen possibly more and they all go
through the same process many people
will register for such a sign but nobody
almost nobody is willing to actually
offer comments so people want to benefit
from the comments of others but they're
not willing to actually offer comments
of their own this is a fairly common
problem unfortunately here is another
website the so-called quickie it stands
for quantum wiki it was started by a
grad student at cal tech named john
stockton in 2005 august of 2005 it's a
great idea potentially he worked in the
same field I worked in for many years
quantum information when I'm computation
and his hope was that this would become
sort of a almost a super textbook
for the field so people researchers in
the field would come along and they'd
put review material they describe the
latest open problems they'd share their
ideas about how to solve the problems
and so on and so forth and he worked
very hard with some other people in his
lab to seat the quickie with material
and he really did he did a great job
actually I have to say then he made it
an announcement at a conference in
august 2005 and i happened to be at that
conference was that Kaltag and there was
quite a lot of enthusiasm I have to say
some people were skeptical this was
going to be of any value but a lot of
people were kind of you know cool yeah
this would be prey to be really good to
have sort of a Wikipedia for quantum
computing but at a higher more technical
level and maybe this could be a locus
for collaboration and so on well
unfortunately although lots of people
thought it was a good idea in principle
again nobody really wished to contribute
if you go there today well here's the
recent changes and you can see AR that
life insurance quotes essay writing tips
so on so forth DVD duplication it's just
spammers right so there's a lot of good
seed material on on the quickie but
unfortunately nobody wished to
contribute except unfortunately the
spammers it which it's been overrun by
so there's a general problem here
underlying both this kind of open peer
review will open commenting kinds of
ideas the quickie as well as many other
ideas which have been tried I'll just
mention one other class of ideas it's
the so-called Facebook for scientists
idea so many dozens of sites have been
started which essentially the idea is
scientists can create profiles for
themselves and hopefully connect with
other people with complementary
interests in order to share ideas share
data share code and so on and like many
such sites have been started
scientists they're typically ghost towns
if you go and take a look at them so
there's a problem here and the the
problem is basically if you're a
scientist I'm talking here about basic
science you have cast the question why
should I be contributing to these sides
it's great the idea of being able to
read the open your comment reviews or
these open comment sides but why should
you take the time to write a comment on
such a site what's in it for you so I
want you to sort of imagine that you're
a young scientist at a university and
just think about what the the pressures
on you are typically for a job mid to
mid-level kind of university to a one of
the outstanding research universities
will have hundreds of applicants and so
it's very competitive and so people will
often spend as pre tenure scientists or
as before they become assistant
professors they may have been 60 70 80
hours a week working on the one thing
that they know will lead to a job and
that is building their reputation by
getting as many grants and publishing as
many papers as they possibly can and so
there's an interesting dilemma here for
those people they may think that a site
like the quickie is a good idea in
principle but that doesn't mean that
they're willing to take the time to come
in and contribute to the quickie when
they know i mean really that the
trade-off is this you can make a long
slew of brilliant contributions to the
quickie or you could write one really
crappy scientific paper and from a
career point of view it is much better
to write that one crappy scientific
paper right that's a real dilemma so
even if you believe very strongly that
it would be great to have a site like
the quickie for example function really
well you know
that from the point of view of your
career that's just a terrible investment
of your time so it's a very difficult
problem to overcome now I talked about
these successful examples the polymath
project and the galaxies of your project
and there are of course many other
examples what happened yeah what's going
on here why are they successful it
doesn't have contradict what what I'm
saying about the failure of sites like
the quickie no it doesn't the reason it
doesn't is because you're ultimately
those other projects are actually quite
conservative think about a project like
the polymath project sure it's done in a
very unconventional way but the ultimate
goal which was eventually reached was to
write a conventional scientific paper
that's the output from from that project
so it's serving the standard career ends
similarly with the Galaxy Zoo project
well if you look at the actual
scientists involved yeah they've written
I think so far they're up to about 30 or
so papers using the data generated by
the pilot by the Galaxy Zoo project so
again you have an unconventional means
in service of a conventional end okay
but a project like the quickie or the
open peer review project or any of these
others that I talked about has the
problem that it is not serving
conventional ends in any way and so
people are simply not willing to explore
these kinds of ideas or it's very
difficult to get them off the ground so
let me talk about what's probably the
most famous example where in fact people
were able to overcome this conservatism
and that example is actually the case of
the Human Genome Project so there was a
pretty big problem in the early nineteen
nineties in biology it was becoming
apparent people that we certainly were
going to be able to sequence whole
genomes and you know optimists at that
point we're saying we'll be able to
sequence the human genome by around two
thousand and ultimately they were
correct although there was still some
uncertainty but as a scientist while it
was obvious that that data you should be
shared
as broadly as possible the data being
generated by the Human Genome Project
should be shared as as broadly as
possible there was a problem which was
why would you take the data generated in
your lab and make it freely available to
everybody else in particular why would
you make it freely available to other
people in other labs who are actually
your competitors so this was a big topic
of contention in the early 1990s and
people went round and round and round
and round about it yeah argument after
argument and ultimately there was a
meeting convened in Bermuda in 1996 a
very important meeting and many of the
world's leading molecular biologists
attended the meeting and basically what
everybody said was look if we can
convince everybody to do it or compel
everybody to do it visit to share their
data this would be great it's obviously
the right thing to do but we have no
incentive to do so at the moment then we
have no reason to share our data we make
our bread and butter by publishing
papers not by sharing data in online
databases databases like GenBank so
everybody could see the problem and they
they came up with an agreement now known
as the buter agreement which stated
essentially first of all that when data
was taken genetic data was taken in the
lab it should be shared within 24 hours
so uploaded to GenBank or a similar
database within 24 hours and in fact it
would be put into the public domain was
the other key point and the people there
had so much clout there were several
Nobel Prize winners or future Nobel
Prize winners that they were able to
convince the big funding agencies to
actually make this agreement into policy
at the funding agencies so what that
meant was that if you wanted to work on
the Human Genome Project and you wanted
to get funding from the National
Institutes of Health in the US or the
Wellcome Trust in the UK the other big
thunder you had to agree to abide by
these principles right so they were able
to shift from this world in which there
was no reason to share data to all
sudden the
there's a radically different world
where they had every reason to want to
share data but it did take a collective
agreement and it was enforced
essentially by the ground agencies
ultimately these ideas made their way to
the highest political levels in march of
2000 Bill Clinton and Tony Blair issued
a joint statement essentially they had
actually named Bermuda but they
described the same principles in their
joint statement and urged that every
country in the world adopt those
principles so this is a great story at
some level and if you go to the the NIH
you can you go there and you can
download the genomes actually for all
kinds of different organisms and it's
really as a result of these sorts of
agreements but unfortunately it's far
from universal even if you just look at
genetic data which is very limited kind
of type of scientific information
there's no universal agreement on
sharing of genetic data over the last
few years there has been an incredible
amount of wrangling for example over
influenza data but so you'd think that
sequencing and sharing flu data would be
pretty high priority given things like
the avian flu in 2006 the swine flu a
couple years ago but no there is no
universal agreement to share that data
yet it's still very ad hoc and there's a
lot of wrangling amongst the some of the
leading parties one bioinformatician of
my acquaintance made I think the very
nice comment he he said he was talking
about the challenges he faces in
convincing his collaborators to share
the genetic data and he said somewhat
sheepishly to me that he'd been quote
sitting on a genome for an entire
species for a year inserts an entire
species of animal who's a genetic data
had been locked up just because there
was no real incentive for them to share
it and every reason in the world for
not to ok so that's kind of the
fundamental problem i should say by the
way of course it's not just genetic data
it's all kinds of scientific data and
more generally people scientific ideas
there are not at the moment the reasons
for people to share those ideas and
there's every reason in the world not to
now this kind of problem has been faced
before in the history of science if you
go back to the start of the 17th century
so early modern science tell you a
little story about Galileo and kind of
the information sharing that went on in
his time so end of 1609 Galileo has just
built the world's first astronomical
telescopes and he's made his great
discovery of the moons of Jupiter and
he's as a result got some sponsorship
from the de Medici family he's sort of
doing well for the first time in his
life but he's under pressure they want
him to follow it up with mala
discoveries to kind of keep them famous
and in July of 1610 Galileo who's been
ignoring satin to this point points his
telescope that's happened and pretty
much straight away he sees what we now
know are the rings of Saturn it's
actually doesn't quite look like rings
to him it looks like Saturn as a disk
and then there's a couple little bumps
on either side it wasn't until years
later that people realized it was really
really rings but he knew he'd found
something important so immediately he
dashes off some letters he dashes off
letters to four of his rivals including
Kepler he doesn't tell them what he's
discovered instead he sends them an
anagram right it's an anagram of a
description of his discovery so he
writes down his discovery then he
scrambles the letters he sends it to
Kepler and his other rivals and what
this means right is that if somebody
else later makes the same
every say a year later galilea could say
oh I already knew that here's the key to
his the way you unscramble the anagram
but in the meantime he can continue
working so so at the same time as he
sends these letters need dessert the day
after the discovery well actually the
morning of the discovery he also sends a
letter to his patrons the Medici but he
tells them all about the discovery
there's no anagrams there and also you
know procedures them to not reveal it to
anybody else ok so this was sort of
scientific publication in the early
1600s and I wish I could say you know
it's a cute story actually I can tell
you this almost exactly the same story
about you about Newton about weakens
about da Vinci a whole bunch of people
early modern scientists state law used
anagrams they were used ciphers and the
reason was because there was actually
very little culture well almost no
culture of openly sharing scientific
discoveries at the time and so people
like Robert Boyle and Henry oldenburg
Oldenburg's the editor of the first
scientific journal worked incredibly
hard to establish the principle that in
fact Oh scientific discoveries should be
freely shared so oldenburg who set up
the first scientific journal in the 1665
over the last 10 years or so if his life
after that would write to the leading
scientists of the day and he would do
every kind of arm-twisting to get them
to disclose their discoveries he he
actually he notes at one point that one
of the most effective things to do is to
go the each one so he'd find two people
two rivals and he would ask one of them
for some piece of information and then
he would send that piece of information
to their rival and say oh I said what do
you know and he kind of had gradually
drag information out of each of them in
this way which ultimately he would
publish in this journal but it was
really it was like pulling teeth and
what happened over the ensuing 150 years
basically up to about sort of 1800 is
that there was a change in the culture
of science so that instead of keeping
discoveries secret it became expected
that you disclose your discoveries in
scientific journals as quickly as
possible this was kind of the first open
science revolution and the way it was
enforced was by tying a scientist
reputation and therefore their jobs to
journal publication this was a very
clever thing to do and it was basically
done by the by the funders ultimately by
by governments certainly today so that's
a nice story but as I've tried to
explain today we have a similar problem
today except it now it's we're not
talking about disclosing information in
the form of journal articles we've got
that covered scientists are very
motivated to do that because because of
this first open science revolution the
problem we have today is that they're
not motivated to share ideas informally
they're not motivated in the same kind
of way to share data something they're
certainly not motivated to share
typically is code there's very little
benefit to to scientists in terms of
building their career building their
reputation to developing good tools and
sharing them unfortunately and and
that's the kind of thing which I believe
we need to change today I believe we
need a second open science revolution to
kind of complete and complement the
first now in the few minutes I have
available I'm not going to tell you how
I think this could necessarily take
place I will just make a few remarks
it's obviously it's a difficult problem
for the reasons that I've already
outlined how do you change a complete
culture there are some encouraging signs
though for individual scientists it's
possible to make some small motions in
the right direction certainly you know
it's possible to work at least a little
bit in the open to donate a little bit
of your time
to doing things like working on sites
such as the quickie or what nobody needs
to spend all of their time doing it they
can just spend at least a little bit of
their time the real thing that needs to
be accomplished though is for scientists
to take these alternate ways of working
more seriously in particular it's a
question of recognition and of giving
credit so if people you go to at the
moment if as I said before if you you
put a long series of brilliant
contributions on the quickie or a
similar site it's not worth anything to
you career-wise but if people start to
to brag about that kind of thing or that
kind of contribution on their CV and
then your discussion takes place
internal to the scientific community I'd
be out you know what value does that
really have and people develop metrics
and they develop ways of measuring those
kinds of contribution then slowly a
change in the culture will start to take
place that's obviously going to be a
long process and I don't think it's
enough for the scientific community
alone to go through that on a process
the other thing that I think needs to
happen and it will ultimately be even
more effective is for the public at
large and for politicians for
governments for grant agencies to get
engaged in the case of this as I said
first type in science revolution that
was what ultimately actually drove
change governments and patrons realized
that it was in the public's best
interest for information to be openly
disclosed and we need to have the same
kind of awareness today I told you that
story about the Human Genome Project and
sharing of genetic data and you know at
least part of what was going on there
was that there was a lot of work being
done in the background by the grant
agencies who realized that sharing data
was in everybody's best interest and so
I think a lot of progress will come
basically to the extent that we can
raise awareness amongst the general
population of the need for more open
disclosure of scientific information and
you compel open release of data and
similar objects things like code in this
same kind of way we can certainly change
the culture of science so thank you all
very much for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
