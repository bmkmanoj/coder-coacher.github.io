the speakers back to have a seat at the
table here and to have a discussion that
picked up questions and issues that we
didn't have time to let you ask earlier
let me say something to all of the
Googlers in the room this is a public
meaning we have people here from outside
of Google so let's be a little
thoughtful about the questions and
issues that you raised in this session
if they're matters that need to be dealt
with internally please hang on to those
for now and we'll deal with them later
so at the moment though and we want to
take advantage of the fact that we have
real experts with burned fingers who've
been dealing with ipv6 in one way or
another for quite some time so I'm going
to simply open the floor for questions
I'd like to suggest that we might start
by finding out whether any of the
speakers want to react or respond to the
things that their colleagues have said
before we begin general questions and
answers from the floor so let me first
invite the speakers to raise any issues
you think need clarification or perhaps
debate I don't see anyone levitating out
of their chairs that means you all
agreed with each other somehow
so I had working yes I I had one point
at least I thought I had hoped someone
would make Apple has done a reading
thing with their new airport the airport
extreme or something I forget what they
call it and it's got v6 in it and it's
very easy to turn on the automatic
tunneling I don't know where what the
where it's tunneling to but if you turn
it on then it does Ras back on the you
know on the wireless side and you get v6
access is yes by turning one thing on it
just works and it's automatic I have to
say I'm using a Macintosh they turned on
the enable ipv6 and it seemed to work
without any
a special effort on my part the thing
you were probably talking about is the
airport base station and then the other
devices Airport extremes that extend the
wireless to further distances in order
you know by repeating the signal yes sir
we're taking question one is the kid
working oh I'm sorry we have one other
Ellen I'd like to make a point in via
Apple Airport base station so they have
made a conscious decision to treat it as
a stateful firewall meaning that they
will think that anything originating
from inside of a network is fine and
anything that will originate from
outside of the network is treated as
dangerous
same way as NAT boxes and that's
interesting in the sense that it will
prevent us from putting devices into the
home network but we will control and
it's a bit of a problem if we are
thinking about today we have set up
boxes that have their own cable modern
Soviet act directly to the cable plant
so we control them like this but in the
future if you want to go to an all IP
network and have those devices simply
being an IP device if we cannot access
to this device it's a bit of an issue so
that's why at the end of my talk I was
talking about this new social contract
and what does it mean to have a shared
management of the access point before
service evita I've offered by the
service provider or by third party the
simple model saying everything from the
outside is bad is a little bit too
simplistic in the future I'd like to
reinforce that with two examples one of
them is that I would like for example
would be able to manage all of my
opinion abled devices at home including
the entertainment system through the
public Internet I would like to be able
to subscribe to services that will help
me manage those devices and so I need to
be able to reach them from the outside
public Internet and I wouldn't be
permitted to do that under some
circumstances the other observation is
that I found viruses propagating inside
the firewall almost as easily as they
come from outside as people wander in
with USBs whose history isn't
necessarily known you know where
have they been plugged in before they
got inside the corporation okay we got
lots of people lined up to ask questions
so go hi Bruce Hana with Google
corporate network engineering so the
future of the internet I've seen
multiple talks today showing multiple
layers of NAT sometimes double or triple
layers of now - v4 - v4 v6 - v4 and
everywhere in between
given the amount of potential breakage
of end-to-end that we've got happening
what is the future of the sort of
mythical garage software entrepreneur
the person who can write an application
get it deployed virally and essentially
start a new industry or a new business
or something given that it appears to be
it's going to get much more difficult to
actually deploy something without NAT
boxes and therefore centralized control
getting in the way where are we going to
be in five years so one of the reason
why we'll be looking at this not v4 v6
before is that it forced us to have a v6
connectivity into the house so you can
look at this not as necessary evil but
temporarily meaning that you have an
alternate path what it means for Google
is for example if somebody has v4 and as
 miyako I should show it maybe if
you display a map it will take 10
minutes to display a map of San
Francisco Airport if you go to v6 and it
will display immediately so that
actually create an incentive for content
delivery players in this industry to
move to v6 and that wifing is a better
system than a V 4 V 4 V 4 not that will
lock us into a pure v4 environment
without any escape toward the v6 world
so I think in all this discussion of
Nats I think the one thing maybe that
didn't get said was that the idea here
is that people noticed that if you do v6
to v4 net you you can get the same
access to the v4 internet that you can't
before have today essentially through
NAT but you can still run but the idea
is that you also run v6 in
parallel to that so a v6 destination you
can go directly not through the net
there's more Cummings here please go
ahead Jim I'm sure the DA brunette in
allows the people to is only very
typical application on top of the TCP or
maybe the very simple UDP from inside to
outside no dynamic DNS can be added and
how about a UPnP punching hall doesn't
work which means MSN chat or maybe the
Skype need to have them some server you
know to exchange their stream you know
not only for the signaling I don't know
much about the Google Talk
so you know you need to think about that
and such kind of centralized server in
that circumstances so you know no p2p
anymore in the tablet right yeah
then correct you are correct this
inevitable is the problem but the you
know then we Justin air can be enforced
to move IP version 6 you know then you
know we'd like to drive the people to
encourage to use IP version 6 to get
freedom as original internet you know we
I completely agree with the Landy you
know we keep Internet as a one single
intimate not to divide it but Tina I
don't know you know how to keep
surviving you know existing ipv4 world
without any good thinner enough numbers
of 93 fatherís that's just a very
simple message so lots of application
will be died if that to stick to the
ipv4 Randi did you haven't come in
friend was once over for dinner and we
asked him whether he wanted broccoli or
cauliflower and he said would you rather
be run over by a car or truck it's
parallel to what Shin is saying it's
that's you know you want massive v4 and
adding or you want six to four
and it sucks caterpillar snot and
there's no way around it it's the
problem if we want to scale what I don't
like hearing is centralized servers
centralization we know is grim but the
big thing is how well can people make
some of these Nats so that they can hold
some significant state so that that's
gonna be the real trade-off holding the
edge is if they can hold enough state
that you can scale it and I think we had
our head in the sand about Nats for a
long time so we haven't really pushed it
and now that we see people proposing
Nats closer to this core maybe some of
the somebody's gonna throw real hardware
at it we'll see okay that's one more
comment from Ellen and then we'll go to
David what's going to be interesting is
to compare the price of this nut box
in is peanut box with the price of the
ipv4 addresses that we would save good
point David so talking a bit about the
the edge and back to the Apple Airport
extreme case I've recently discovered
was told by someone at Apple that their
apples back to the Mac functionality has
actually drived off ipv6 that when you
turn it on you're actually turning on
ipv6 connectivity internally within your
network and you're able if you have the
appropriate hardware an airport extreme
and you've turned it on and on Mac and
drunk all the Apple kool-aid you're
actually able to get to your home
devices behind your out Apple Airport
extreme through v6 and I've actually
done that here with my laptop and I'm
going through all of it the relevance to
sort of on the edge as these boxes that
Airport extreme boxes 150 bucks or
something and it handles my home network
which is probably a little more unusual
than than most without any significant
stress
so you're actually able to push the
scaling issues out towards the edge if
you have people who are willing to buy
into one vendors particular
implementation and that's gets into the
centralization issue that Randy was
raising but it's just one of another one
of the examples of where ipv6 is sort of
insinuating itself without a lot of
people even being aware of it
problem there David is that you've got a
v4 address at the edge I yes I'm on and
no on Comcast network I'm using what
you've got worked which the thing is is
the tension that's happening is if that
translation is happening at the edge
then all the edge has v4 addresses and
you've limited the size of the edge okay
yes yes my name is Joe Kingston I work
at Google I have a question about the
fundamental of ipv6 is that we see a lot
of people doing the deployment but I'm
just wondering whether any of the panels
are actually proud of ipv6 means you
really think this is the right thing to
do because for me I feel that we have a
bunch of very smart people in a room
working on a product that none of us are
proud of I think there's something wrong
well at least speaking for myself I'm
very proud of v6 and the work we've done
to get it this far and I just want to
make sure it gets to the end so we've
completed the transition but yeah I
think it's been I started working on at
the beginning because I knew it was
going to be really important to the
Internet and my focus has continues to
be making the Internet can you be
successful and I think v6 is essential
to do that any other comments sure it
could have been a lot worse
well just speaking for myself like I
said earlier this morning I really do
believe that v6 is that the only thing
that we can do right now to make sure
that address space is available and that
we preserve as much as possible the
end-to-end structure the network so can
I get one another coming in here so you
reminded me of something so back when
you know Vint and everyone was starting
you know the v4 the current internet was
not a sure thing back you know 15 20
years ago and there were lots of I'm
sorry it's 30 years ago because the
decision
no I'm serious the decision to put a
32-bit address space on there was the
result of a years battle among a bunch
of engineers who couldn't make up their
minds about 32 128 or variable-length
and after a year of fighting I said I'm
now at ARPA I'm running the program I'm
paying for this stuff I'm using you know
American tax dollars and I wanted some
progress because we didn't know if this
is gonna work I said okay it's 32 bits
it's enough for an experiment it's 4.3
billion terminations even the Defense
Department doesn't need 4.3 billion of
everything and couldn't afford to buy
4.3 billion edge devices to do a test
anyway so at the time I thought we were
doing an experiment to prove the
technology and that if it worked
we'd have an opportunity to do a
production version of it well it's it
you know it just escaped it got out and
people started to use it and then it
became a commercial thing so we're
really this is the production attempt at
making the network scalable only 30
years later yes at least yeah I just
want to mention you know not being proud
I don't know why that came up but
anytime you're designing something you
always want to do the best you can at
the time and hindsight is wonderful
because then you realized you overlooked
something you sort of thought of in the
beginning so v6 is the same thing if
we're designing it now it might be
different than it is today but back when
it was being decided upon there were
compromises and battles they were the
tuba battles and everything else so I
don't think it's people aren't proud of
it but hindsight is a good way to point
fingers at things and say oh well if
we'd only known then what we know now
yeah I mean they believe me if you
didn't live through the IP ng battles
next generation balance you have to
appreciate the enormous scope of debate
and argument that and different designs
that led ultimately to compromise it's
called ipv6 yes sir
so you've said a lot about like
corporate networks and whatnot but I'm
sitting here thinking if and when you
know ipv6 moves to the edge how does it
affect like my mom you know she has a
you know in that router that allows her
to connect like a laptop and a printer
and you know and a few other devices and
you know even even assuming that there
would have to be a new device to allow
for ipv6 I mean how do you deal with
security implications he's talking about
you know being able to access all those
devices from outside some people may not
want that actually one of the answers
for that question is in a wizard to
notice you know the today's an SCP
device in a some time an automatically
upgraded due to the security in Apaches
right the same mechanisms can be applied
to upgrade and a firmware to be you are
stuck in a compatible then in that case
you know if the people Justin purchased
a new PC from the fries you know Easter
on it so people just use it without to
notice if upstream is completely to a
stack right so then my mom or maybe
their any grandmother utilizing email
you know doesn't we don't know which
protocol is she is using that's just
fine
I think one of the big difference
between v4 and v6 if you look at the
edge if I consider what I'm getting
attached to my own network right now a
small description five pcs playstation
PSP mobile phone video camera some saw
or if you try to reach those and by the
way our not server as well if you try to
reach his device from the internet what
does your mom needs to do she has to go
on the CP device she has to know about
DNS / mapping she has to know about the
IP address she has to know about the TCP
port do them apprise mapping and make
sure everything is right before she can
access the device if you go to the six
of that exactly what I do with my device
I only put my device reachable from the
internet using ipv6 no I guess what I'm
an explorer ibly broken she shouldn't
have to know any of that let's drive a
car I don't need to should not need to
be a mechanic the tension here is
between security and the end-to-end
principle the fact is that if we want
truly intend network then that's going
to expose all your mom's devices that's
right and the question is how much do
you want to break the end-to-end
principle to provide what kind of
security and I don't have an answer for
that well I guess another question is
I'm sorry I do have an answer and or at
least a speculation one of the things
that's very clear is that if you were
going to have devices that are generally
exposed to the rest of the world and oh
by the way they are exposed even in the
nap box I mean anybody who's drinking
kool-aid that says an ad box provides
security you should go you know get
yourself cleaned out at a clinic
somewhere but the point is that you need
to start building in mechanisms that
will allow the configuration of these
devices to only interact with devices
that are essentially authorized and
that's the the challenge here I think is
getting the user interfaces so that
implicitly the right kinds of
authorizations and controls are in
are put in place without the users
having to understand any of the details
of addressing or DNS or anything else
but it does feel to me as if you have to
build those mechanisms in and make them
easily configured yes I think regarding
the home environment which is what has
been mentioned in this context we need
to remember that the platforms that we
have with ipv6 enabled now such as Vista
come as a default in home versions with
a strong firewall and this applies to
most Linux distributions as well and by
default it's on so this is almost this
discussion is almost a non discussion
because you either have your security
through NAT by breaking the connectivity
or you have it by buying something that
has ipv6 and and by the very nature of
having ipv6 built in also has an ipv6
firewall I would like to add to this
that this is all nice and well but NAT
is really really entrenched everywhere
I've been talking to some other internal
folks and business people and saying
about oh there's an opportunity to not
have an ad box and to connect to devices
and they say no no no no way no way not
just to be there to provide security so
even that I know this point dad
but better way it is and we may wish
otherwise but unfortunately in the mind
of a very large number of people not as
where to provide security so whatever we
have to invent we'd have to from our
work around this perception problem not
technical problem ok let's keep going
Lorenzo so in the trade-off between
security and end-to-end hey if I lock my
computer up and I unplug it it's very
secure but this is not so so as a brick
that's not the question I wanted to ask
the question I keep asking that meetings
every time is when people say to me hey
you are Google you should do ipv6 so
that people will follow you and you you
need to provide content because
otherwise there will be no edge because
chicken-and-egg problem so my question
is this you know it is for the panel for
the floor for anyone who has an answer
how do I suppose suppose I could I have
this magic wand and I make Google's
Network ipv6 ready and it's you know
production grade and thus your grade the
same as a v4 Network the ipv6 Internet
is broken right there are long tunnels
there is bad connectivity there's no you
there's broken I can't get to some
places now with the transit we have now
DNS DNS forwarders in that gateways are
broken you send them a quad-a on a
question and they can they give you an a
answer back with the first four bytes of
the v6 address in a v4 in a v4 address
all this breakage right how do we fix
that how how can how can Google look at
you know look at the situation of the
Internet and say yes we're going to put
up a quad a record for Google comm we
can't do that right so how do we how do
we as a content provider even if we want
to provide v6 how do we provide it well
it seems that well maybe we should see
what our guest saying about that first
come to Tokyo please and then you were
CD you know hundred mega bps v6 ready
connection to your apartment right but
the guy in in in Europe who has a broken
that box he won't be able to get to
Google I would I don't want to lose that
that guy you know actually the you know
then the matter of what you know maybe
you Google has also the competitors
RIKEN am distributing a bit video
streaming service like stage 6 of
whatever then in especially in Far East
Asia as you may know about that and a
lot of pressure is coming from lots of
places just because IP be fatherís is a
shortage from China governmental giant
enterprises whatever if somebody else
other than Google we're stirred IP
version 6 Trump spotted video streaming
service just like YouTube entire
Japanese and as a you know Far East
Asian traffic properly goes to that site
not yours
yes but I don't think threatening
Lorenzo is Renzo the way you do it is
document the problems publicly and we
work together to try and get them fixed
if you noticed that's what I've been
trying to do expose these issues talk
about them honestly and see what we can
do is the best solutions to them there
ain't no magic so I had to put up some
publicly accessible service somewhere
tell everyone it's broken and tell
everyone tell me please tell me how it's
broken and so it start telling the story
of Google trying to deploy v6 and here
are the problems we are hitting we don't
want to take this next step because
here's the breakage how can we take that
next step
safely yep so so you bring up a service
which you announce is not WWE Google com
it's something else that's intended to
help us expose the v6 issues I think we
have an interrupt here from Susan dan
wait a minute won't get you a microphone
thanks I'll talk a little bit more when
it's my turn a little bit later and not
to interrupt our panel but what he said
this is one of the things we're trying
certainly with deploying v6 transporting
quad A's for the route is exactly get
that kind of storytelling out there find
the gaps and fix them yeah I think we
get we get points for that
okay Allan one more and then we need to
move on before we run so a damn sentence
in my slide which is try to decouple
things and another way to say it is a
whole wall run so trying to isolate the
service and something new that you want
to start that will be ipv6 and expose
the problems will actually go a really
long way
instead of saying oh everything has to
be v6 on the get-go first we cannot do
anything decoupling figures is really
the key here
okay let's shall we go on that's a
reason why that's at the end of my
presentation you know I'm just proposing
to set up some X day to negotiate to
synchronize from an ASP site and a
network provider site to you know the
back every sink
yes but how do I tell whoever boss nine
ten layers above me we are going to turn
it on on this day and on this day we'll
have a ten percent or three percent or
whatever percent drop in the number of
people that reach our website how do I
tell him that right that is that is a
problem
Lorenzo that's my problem yeah and he's
gonna ask you and how do we fix that
right and that's what Lorenzo's asking
it's not how do we face up to it it's
also how do we fix it we are engineers
right I mean this is Joel yeagley
currently I guess I work for Nokia but
you mean you're not sure
well yeah 13 years of the in academia
and it's all this is all new to me you
know 70 been a year but I mean the thing
I see with with when we observed that
ipv6 is broken or that we have problems
with deployment if we observe the
problems that we observe in ipv6 in ipv4
we treat them as network outages right
and we fix them because we're engineers
and that's what we do and when we build
services that leverage ipv6 we
instrument them and we observe problems
and we responded those and we treat them
as what they are which is brokenness
right you know if you have a host that
has an ipv6 default route it's going to
assume that it can talk to the rest of
the world via that default route so
natural assumption that
happens with the v4 host but if it can't
reach the rest of the world the ipv6
then we go v6 is broken and if it can't
reach the rest of the world via ipv4 we
have a network outage right and so those
are things that we address to talk to
lorenzo's point just a little bit one
place to address on how you deal with
instrumenting your customers and their
ability to reach your applications is do
it in places on where you have control
over the application space so if you
have an application where you have an
opportunity to use both v4 and v6 and
you can do so transparently then you can
try both at the same time right instead
of waiting for one to fail before using
the other this is Alan's point about
separation there are it which you know
you use the different words in that bit
a couple a decoupling that's a very good
even once you can measure that on with a
few million data points like for example
say Google Maps applications running on
mobile devices for example then you have
you know a bunch more sensitive
measurement of the quality of the
network that you're using and what
problems that users are experiencing
without actually shooting the users in
the foot so I mean I think that's some
you know a really valuable tool when you
control the application environment and
you know certainly Google has some
applications that do that thanks Tony
I'm sorry sorry yeah I was gonna say I
mean the ideal way to do that is to run
things in parallel essentially under a
different name and if the chap from NTT
is correct then Japanese users are gonna
start using their impressions because
they're gonna get better service and
things will work that don't work on the
v4 network and you know the whole point
of this is that it has to provide some
value to people other than the address
is running out people have to see some
value in this otherwise they're not
gonna want to change nobody's gonna want
to go out and spend another
books on another home nap box or
whatever and by default hopefully the
next time they buy a home in that box it
comes with v6 support already in it but
nobody's going to want to go out and do
that unless there's some perceived
advantage and so you know for a while
just like v4 is gonna exist with v6
maybe Google Network services are gonna
have to exist in parallel in v6 and v4
versions under different names that
people will get to depending on which
one works better for them yeah because
the as Landy's said that within a few
years two or three years probably to get
brief or group address is going to be
more expensive than today which means we
do need an isp need to late snap tea
subscription fee that's very simple and
enough reason our customer will switch
from grow bar way for only subscription
to gr stack right if price is different
if you think about that and a still eq
can keep the same price as today if you
switch to the you know the subscription
proud to the basics to the private level
but then we all at the same time we
would ask them to raise nap the
subscription fee from next month's
what's happening then probably David you
know online on site and and you know
subscription or something like that they
will change their protein in a
subscription model right away so then
this is also the another scenario we
will see within two or three years just
because as randy said that we are
looking we are thinking about that you
know to get ipv4 address it's going to
more expensive than today simply because
just one other observation it's my sense
that over time let us say in the next
five years that there may be an
increasing likelihood of needing server
like functionality at home and that
mitigates against kind of dynamic
assignments that you get with NAT and
the private addressing that you get with
them so that might also influence
people's
decisions Tony you know so this just
want one more short comment I'm just
reminded of the similarity between this
and the light bulb issue where
essentially power companies pay you to
adopt the fluorescence rather than the
incandescent light bulbs because they
save so much money
so essentially maybe ISPs and well will
make now will make this sort of the home
boxes available at a really discounted
rate so that they can start using ipv6
instead to reduce their own costs at
some point down the road that might be
true you know when prices get to $10 per
address per day it becomes economically
viable to Randy's point earlier about
business models as I talked to his
service providers around the world
they're all standing around going I
don't have a business case I'm gonna do
all of this I'm gonna get all done and
the content still v4 Google's not vv6 I
can't get there from here that's the
example that gets used constantly so
whether you like it or not you're in the
crosshairs to Lorenzo's point about what
can you do some simple measurement
things that I thought about or put a
zero you know a single pixel image at
the bottom of the page that is on a
separate name that is a v6 only
resolution and you can get some
statistics about the things that can get
to you with v6 and not one of the things
you have to think about is you are an
edge all of the talks today have been
about the things for the core network
and for your core network they're
important but you are an edge your
client is the other edge the transition
tools were meant to decouple you from
whatever happens in the network all
right so if the network can't get all of
the broadband last mile loops done
you still got v4 in the middle and look
you're gonna have to use transition
tools to across that so those exist
specifically for that case to get you so
you can build your application and you
know so you may end up running six to
four antara dough and you mumble mumble
whatever new when we have to create to
make it work in addition to having
native set v6 you can't just walk in and
say I'm going to do native v6 only right
if you do you're gonna have a very long
page for Randy's document the cases are
you
that plus these other things and you
start walking through the list I think
when you get all done we'll find that
their problems aren't as big as they
seem to be it's stepping back and
thinking about you you are operating at
both edges and the middle is not
necessarily cooperating how can you make
this work so just if I understand your
point you're saying measure the quality
of the ipv6 Network by having a host
name that is reachable somehow and use
single pixel images or whatever it is to
quantify the quality of that
connectivity and at the same time try to
use transition mechanisms like taro and
stuff like that to get people to to have
that actually work on your production
website I think that's gonna work right
I don't I don't think you jump straight
to production but I think you build up a
website that is a little more
broad-based than just measurement so in
time what do people do this question
what do they do they type dub dub dub vi
or Google I'll come into their browser I
think you might want to offer that as a
service to see where it goes you know
with the Apple Airport who's gonna do
that that's that's the point right who's
gonna type there will be a number of us
in this room that will type it and give
you some statistics which will make your
documentation work it doesn't give you
massive scale which you don't really
want to begin with anyway
but then again we fly around the world a
lot so yeah we don't get a lot of oxygen
there's also no significant point where
I would disagree with you Tony which is
it's not lorenzo's to justify my
business decision he's not in my
crosshairs I'm sorry I decided to go
with v6 or not that was my decision and
I did not put on Lorenzo that he has to
justify that decision by choosing to
spend his efforts understand it and and
I'm not saying no I'm not saying that
all service providers are that way but
the ones that are not doing v6 which are
not the ones at the front of the room
here right the ones that are not are
using Google as the example of why
they're not right the ones that have
chosen to do it have chosen for other
reasons right so if that was the only
okay we have three more Pete
keeneland just a few more minutes so
let's keep going so I got on the
Internet originally because it was this
dream I heard about this great thing
where any computer could talk to any
other computer across the globe and I
was excited so in 92 I got my first
internet connection which was $50 a
month 9600 baud horrible within six
months I'd started my own ISP just so I
could pay for a t1 line directly to my
house and it was awesome I could get my
DNS name for free I just sent in a form
and it gave me a DNS name I could add
asked for a block of addresses for free
I sent it a form justified how many
addresses I have and I got a cider block
and then all suddenly charged me 50
dollars a year for a domain and the
whole internet kind of spun out of
control got very corporate and the dream
disappeared where I couldn't talk from
any computer to any computer because
suddenly every computer in AT&amp;amp;T was
hidden behind a couple of addresses with
Knapp and the internet changed from what
I originally dreamed of it to be when
ipv6 came out I got excited again
because people would always ask me well
nobody's gonna go to ipv6 it doesn't
have a killer app it doesn't have the
web or something that draws people to it
and I've been trying to maybe it's just
in my own mind that I justify this I'm a
bit of a dreamer my dream of ipv6 was
the killer app will be innovation
because it'll be the internet the way it
was supposed to be every machine will be
accessible from every other IP there
won't be a need for NAND so everything
can talk directly to each other and I'm
horribly depressed here today because I
keep hearing or we're gonna start adding
all this stuff in ipv6 and gateways and
translation and it sounds like it's ipv4
all over again going down the same bad
path of poor connectivity you know I
can't log in to my grandmother's
computer and help her fix it because
she's got a Linksys router that's
blocking it and I don't want to have to
describe to her how to set up a
translation to allow me to come in it's
not ipv6 per se it's the lack of a
compatible transition right it's the
incompatibility on the wire and from
then on it tumbles I
would gladly follow any reasonable path
out of that traffic
unfortunately some time it's left us
none that's depressing well then I would
use other words but not in public
actually we've learned over the last
let's say at least 20 years that not
everyone wants every computer to be able
to communicate with every other one what
you would like though is that it's
technically feasible for that to happen
except when you don't want to and there
are methods for preventing the
communication from happening we have to
accept that that's part of the
architecture that was missing from the
original design and we need to
reinstitute that so it's not a surprise
if you can't make everything talk to
everything else but what you would like
is that that's a policy decision you
make as opposed to an accident of
engineering and implementation well yeah
to be fair I've been on security
engineer for god knows how long now and
I'm probably partly responsible for
going to all these major companies and
putting in net policies and firewall
filters but at the same time with ipv6
you could have filtering and
restrictions just by putting an access
list without having to go with NAT no
I'm agreeing I didn't intend to suggest
you that NAT was the way you should
achieve those constraints and
restrictions in fact I don't like the
idea of using Nats for that purpose I
prefer the idea of being able to
configure constraints and filters that
meet your policy requirements we got
several more people in the Keele can't
we keep going yeah just one more
addition because it comes up is um there
are a number of businesses right now
whose subscriber growth is contingent on
an available pool of ipv4 addresses and
their subscribers are also your
customers so when they can't grow their
subscriber base because they can't get
more ipv4 addresses then they have some
angry shareholders to answer to but they
also have fairly dire implications for
you know how they actually continue to
manage their business and so they have
some serious interest in ipv6 whether
they are successful in deploying it on
any kind of reasonable timescales
another question
early but if you find yourselves in the
position where you need to address those
customers and you can't you're also in
an interesting situation Thanks yep
that's part of what motivates my
interest yes sir so for Alan and Shannon
I guess anyone else who feels that can
contribute on this let's say I'm running
a network and it's X and if I can flip
the switch and turn to ipv6 overnight
with ipv6 being less efficient to
process how much more hardware do I need
do I need 1.8 X do I need 5 X what what
what does an efficiency cost me with
regards to an increase in the amount of
hardware I'm not even talking about all
the people behind it I mean v6 is
inevitable give me an idea of what kind
of commitment I can might need to make
it the worst case to actually get v6
running yeah actually the we have
prototype typed it's a farmer for inks
is wrt54g you know used let's talk about
larger networks larger devices this is
the case where you have to have large
routing tables they're done
XP box trying to go case you know in
that case that's up to his estimation
you know now and also the Juniper
estimation tours how much they charge us
for the equipment right please you know
it simply deuce that cost but the
frankly speaking in a maybe they yeah
maybe the table would some time just
because of the router table just because
the enhancer box maybe retina still we
cannot in a you know determine how much
still we need to upgrade but at the core
network of the NTT communications also
backbone and also others did that type
of things just in a nothing different we
just turned on the IP purchasing feature
on iOS or maybe the Junos you know that
works you know then doesn't matter in
which protocol can
on top of it so still I'm not sure just
two observations then it'd be good to
hear from Francisco and juniper my
understanding is that the most notable
costs may be at the very edge of the
router the edge cards because that's
where you do the forwarding tables and
if you have to have tables that are
double the size that they are today
because they're doing v6 and v4 it could
have a notable the fees for this notice
a network it's not nowheres near the
size the v4 network it's not going to
double your big costs are gonna be in
your infrastructure back-end it's gonna
be fixing your software to hold both
some kinds of addresses etc etc you can
go to all your routers today if you've
bought them in the last two years and
turn on v6 right and run dual stack your
cost is gonna be the problem
locking Randy the problem is when you
start to if you're doing any kind of QoS
if you're doing any kind of little stack
and the FIB shrinks immediately so
you're forcing us to go sideways because
the boxes aren't getting any bigger so
forcing us to go sideways means we're
not gonna do a dual stack because we
can't so solve that problem for us I
would say the the first the first thing
there is no generic question regarding
the cost and that the reason the first
type we go when we are working on IP
visit project is to do a network
assessment because we know we need to
know exactly what kind of hardware what
is the city road what kind of feature
people turned on on the box from there
if I look at any platform we do design
today we do v6 and v4 in hardware so now
the real question is what kind of future
do you need not only at the data plan
when we are forwarding packets because
we know how to forward packet in ipv6
but what kind of control plan feature
and from there if you look at the
routing table for example do you need to
under all the full v4 routing table plus
the small v6 routing table and from
there we need to look at what kind of
memory size you need at the same time
what kind of CPU processes you need for
OSB v3 or is is at the same time as OSPF
so it's really the combination of all
feature you have today for before plus
what you want to add for v6 we need to
understand and from there we can make
recommendation and other than that the
reason for some of the customer when we
go through the network assessment we can
say yes you can do it right now on this
platform or you may have to upgrade some
software you have to agree they are the
hardware or maybe we don't have the
right solution and you can't provide any
guideline without a network assessment
did you want to respond okay so one of
the things that we've heard often and
this is that the nanog meetings as well
as that Aaron meetings is that there's
concern about the routing tables and
I'll only talk to that piece I think
Patrick spoke to some of the other
pieces I can't speak for Cisco but it
doesn't appear to me from the
projections that everyone gives and I
think about 2 million routes of a
mixture of v6 and v4 is what people are
projecting for like the next five years
I think all of the routers that are out
there now can do that I don't think that
that's an issue for a routing table so
you're raising your hand you're saying I
can't little ones I know what they're
running there yes and and it's worse
it's that if an enterprise at the edge
an enterprise cannot multi-home and be
in the default free zone with an
enterprise size router we have lost
no but I'm just attacking specifically
Elise saying all the routers can hold
two million routes bas I was talking
about I think she was talking about core
right and that's what I thought well
what grants Brandis point is that if you
wind up having to handle the full
routing tables closer to the edge or at
the enterprise level and that could be
an issue so we should take that into it
otherwise the enterprise at the edge
becomes a slave to the upstream your
back to TLA all the things we fought and
got rid of okay let's keep going and
take note I'd like to address something
that was brought up earlier and a
question this guy asked he was saying
that he likes you know the end-to-end
principle and was disappointed that ipv6
seems to be going the way of ipv4 but
the way I understood it is that all this
talk of Matt and NAT PT and all that is
really about you know kind of beating
ipv4 with a stick and crippling ipv4
further but that there is no intention
of you know using that on the ipv6
addresses that the intention is to to
maintain the end-to-end stuff for ipv6
is that correct that we're not planning
on doing any kind of crippling of the
ipv6 network that would have been my
understanding I think the PT who is
there to also help you get content the
connectivity with the parts of the net
that aren't v6 yet the is there a
different view yes unfortunately okay go
for that will be true if both ends are
ipv6 and the question about asking you a
civil time was should an ipv6 node that
is talking through a translator to go to
ipv4 no but the other end is ipv4 should
it be made aware of that or not and
there are really two schools of thought
here one says no I mean it's v6 is v6
and factor to his translator is just
broken legacy and we are not going to
carry this over for next 20 years the
other school of thought is well we have
this model now with ice turn-turn and
all those fake complex things to make
fix walk through a nut box in my country
is exactly the same thing in 96 because
we don't know if the other end is going
to be v4 v6 and we need to help the end
nodes to make some decisions and it's my
mind very much an open question now as
we Traverse two models we're going to go
to but the ultimate principle is to
restore the end-to-end idea I mean is
that correct that that's our ultimate
goal I'm not sure well some of us would
like it to be yeah at this point is
really about I want to be able to keep
adding customer to my network that's
really what it boils down to ok next
comment just thought I'd come back on
this interesting discussion about the
size of the v6 routing table and the
edge devices because I don't understand
why everybody gets excited about it
being v6 versus v4 if you're gonna multi
home or whatever you want to do as an
enterprise you can go ahead and do it
right now on v6 get your a Eska some
address space and announce it it's just
the same on ipv6 in fact shouldn't the
ipv6 table be smaller because I mean
everybody wants they gets an IAS get a
enormous amount of v6 spaces whereas now
we have a lot of routes because we have
fragmentation in the v4 space I mean in
theory we should be close to one
announcement per ASM and there's only
25,000 there sends in the table 24
because they don't want somebody to
hijack their routes half of the bloody
routing table is there because of idiocy
not because of a lack of aggregated
address traffic engineering it's another
darling that's very true right now let's
keep this civil folks alright so you
have another another question you want
to raise no it's an Erin thing really I
was gonna say the you are right you
could fragment it if you wanted to but I
mean that's about our policy on where do
we filter well on the boundaries I mean
before we filter on 24 which allows for
a huge amount of prefixes to be
announced but on v6 I don't see why we
we can't you know stick a sensible
numbers and like slash 32s and only hand
thirty twos to everyone who wants one no
no that it's gonna be the same problem
as we had before
how am I gonna deal with a VP of
Marketing who says that
Charlene called from over there and
can't get her packets out because we
filtered that's the problem so it's
about precedent I mean right now you I
was the last filtering Nazi in v4 I'm
telling you what happened
okay now nobody goes like Vint come to
talk to you Randy
as soon as soon as the conversation
mentions things like Nazi you know that
you need to stop that discussion so
thank you for getting to the endpoint
there Randy let's take two more and then
we really need to shut down go ahead
there was talk about releasing class II
address base to regular use do you see
that happening and if yes then what kind
of impact do you see no we look at this
and it's actually the same cost to take
all our equipment and certify it to work
in 240 slash free class II I'm to
certify it you move to v6 so why should
we bother only to save a few / aids and
that use on the private space you can't
the problem is you can't use it in
public space period because where it
might have solved the last problem in
private space in public space if I try
to use it that means you must have
converted actually last year once a
month
one cross say was disappeared actually
the more than that within just a 207
China took 8 cross days I guess then
crusty space has only 1216 crises so
only we can gain two years recent at
best at best so
doesn't work no no thinking that I was
open the same things okay I see that
Eric is the last speaker and I'm going
to turn this over to you Eric because
it's time to shut this thing down yeah I
hate to be the one to actually do it I
don't actually have a last question I
just want to deal with some mechanics
we're gonna break for lunch we're back
to start at 140
all of our guests please take advantage
of their time and escort them to lunch
and so on so forth there are 14 seats
reserved for the guests downstairs in
case it's a problem and let's see if any
of you are leaving I don't intend to be
back after lunch please let me know and
if that's the case we should talk about
the release video where these forms as
well but please take advantage of the
time take them to lunch
be kind hosts not too brutal and we'll
be back at 140 thank you
thanks very much Eric</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
