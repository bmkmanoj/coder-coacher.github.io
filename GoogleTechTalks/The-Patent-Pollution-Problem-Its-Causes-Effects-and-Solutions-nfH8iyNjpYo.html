today with us Daniel Ravager he is the
executive chairman of the public patent
foundation and a professor of the
Benjamin and Cardozo School of Law he's
here today to talk about the patent
system in the United States and you've
seen a lot of news lately regarding
patents and I am sure we are going to
see a lot of discussion about patents in
the coming years and perhaps in the
future people will look at the times of
today and think well those were strange
laws they had in those times so please
join me in welcoming Daniel bill Ravager
Thank You Boris I'm so excited to be
here again
for those of you who don't know I was
actually here in 2008 and I gave a tech
talk about my organization's mission and
activities so instead of redoing that
same talk we're gonna move on to a
different topic today one that I think
is one of the most critical features of
the patent system is patent quality and
ensuring that only meritorious patents
get issued so with that discussion I
first want to go back and just remind
everyone or show you for the first time
some historical underpinnings for our
patent system so we have a frame of
reference then I'm going to talk about
some statistics there's a lot of good
statistics which can help us get a basis
for an opinion about today's patent
quality then we're gonna start to think
about what is the cause of that state of
patent quality what are the factors that
contribute towards it what are the
effects and finally what are perhaps
some ways to address it if you have any
bleeding questions while I'm talking
feel free to raise your hand I'm happy
to stop but otherwise just take a note
and I'll make sure to leave plenty of
time at the end for questions and
discussion and I'll make sure that we're
all out of here within an hour I teach
students who are they'd like to leave
right on the dot
so there's no bleeding and bleeding late
and other professors are waiting to come
in so
we'll make sure we're out here so we
have to remember the patent system was
very important to our founders it was a
critical component of our new nation in
the enumerated powers given to Congress
it was actually listed above the power
to declare war so this is something
that's more important or at least was
higher on the list than a lot of other
things
the key phrase to focus in on here is
that the purpose of patents is to
promote progress so anything that does
not promote progress is contrary to our
founders intent for the patent system
now many of you may have heard that our
patent system is about incentivizing
innovation but that does not necessarily
promote progress because progress is
innovation plus access so to give you an
example which I use all the time let's
make patents last five million years
that would increase the incentive to
innovate over our current patents which
only lasts 20 years because you're
getting a much greater reward but it
would decrease progress because there'd
be no access to that technology for a
much longer period of time so we have to
have a balance between incentives and
access in our patent system Thomas
Jefferson was one of the most important
people probably the most important
founder when it comes to interpreting
our patent system and it's important to
recognize that even Thomas Jefferson who
was a supporter of the patent system who
did believe is important to have patents
nonetheless characterized them as an
embarrassment there is something that we
as a society shouldn't be proud of and
we shouldn't just willy-nilly grant them
but there are certain limited
circumstances where it's justifiable to
suffer this embarrassment of granting an
exclusive right to someone and Thomas
Jefferson is cited by the Supreme Court
repeatedly for his opinions I won't read
the entire quote to you but the bottom
line is the last sentence there which is
he insisted upon a high level of
patentability trivial improvements would
not benefit the patent system if we
allowed people to get patents on trivial
improvements that would be detrimental
that would be harmful to our patent
system and again the Supreme Court just
as recently as a few years ago in
another case involving what is the
standard for inventiveness required to
mérida
to what we call obviousness again said
we need to make sure patents don't
stifle innovation we need to make sure
that they promote progress and so we
can't award patents for insubstantial
incremental obvious tweaks so what is
the current state of patent quality I'm
gonna ask you a few questions we can
just have some fun with this how many
patents the Patent Office only grants
patents once a week every Tuesday but
every Tuesday they issue patents how
many patents do you think are issued by
the United States Patent Office
every Tuesday maybe when it yes sir what
was your guess a 1000 1000 every week
because that's 1000 every anybody think
it's 10,000
whoa ten thousand they may want to go
higher lower five hundred okay the
answer is about four thousand five
hundred patents that means there are
four thousand five hundred things every
Tuesday that your federal government
tells you you are no longer allowed to
do okay I'm a conservative okay I might
be different than most of you I don't
trust our government I think it needs to
be checked and so when there's a
bureaucrat in Washington DC telling me
there's four thousand five hundred
things I can't do every Tuesday I don't
like that okay just as an initial matter
there might be some of those that are
worth the embarrassment to use Thomas
Jefferson's phrase but four thousand
five hundred things every Tuesday that
I'm no longer allowed to do it at least
causes me to want to investigate a
little further okay well maybe they do a
really good job at the Patent Office
maybe they work really hard
that is not me laughing for the audience
who can't see maybe they do a really
good job in scrutinizing all 4,500
applications to make sure they deserve
because how much time do you think
should be spent not just reviewing the
initial application but doing a search
for prior art writing up any issues you
have with it reading any responses you
get debating these issues with the
applicant how much total time do you
think should be spent on an application
to make sure it's been thoroughly
reviewed for accuracy how much time
would you want to spend how many 100
hours okay so that's about two weeks two
and a half weeks well our Patent Office
spends 19 hours that's how much time
they spend from soup to nuts to review a
patent application okay
that's very small amount of time what
can you do in 19 hours I can't do much
in 19 hours including making sure that
this exclusive I'm gonna grant is
justified yes sir it fluctuates it's a
because there's a lot of turnover the
question is the number of examiner's
higher employed by the Patent Office but
it's in the thousands yes sir
so the question is what's the
credentials of an examiner it's usually
someone with a technical degree in
whatever art unit they're hiring for but
not necessarily anyone with a legal
background so let's look at another
factor in the patent system let's talk
about the fees at the Patent Office
charge just one more question we're
gonna get to those stats okay so let's
talk about fees for a second because I
think this plays a large role in our
patent quality issue so to apply for a
patent you have to pay the patent office
a certain amount of fees and it's about
$1200 that's how much it cost to apply
for patent now if you go through this 19
hours back-and-forth with the examiner
on the examiner agrees to allow your
patent application to issue before you
can get your patent actually issued you
have to pay a specific fee just called
an issuance fee now notice the Patent
Office doesn't do anything to earn this
fee it's merely I'm willing to grant you
this patent but now you have to pay me
this bonus payment in order for me to
issue it I'm not gonna do anything any
additional analysis well that issue fee
is $1,700 now once I've issued you your
patent it can last for up to 20 years
from initial application but every four
years you have to pay me the patent
office a maintenance fee again I don't
do anything it's just if you don't pay
me this fee your patent term ends so at
four years eight years and twelve years
you have to pay me a total of almost
$9,000 so let's look at this I'm the
Patent Office right
if I want to reject an application how
much total fees do I derive 1250 that's
it because I'm not gonna get an issue
fee I'm not gonna get any maintenance
fees because I've rejected your
application okay now let's say instead I
decide to allow your patent now how much
money am I going to make an order of
magnitude more for not doing any more
work I'm gonna make 10 times as much
money if
I grant a patent as if I deny it now so
many people say well the Patent Office
isn't a profit-making business you know
it's not like they have shareholders and
you know so to imply that they have a
financial incentive to grant patents is
improper
well I'd concede that they're not
profit-taking
but the patent office does like more
fees because the more fees they have the
more people they can hire the more power
they have Congress actually likes to
siphon a significant portion of excess
fee payments off to pay for other public
programs so I believe there is financial
incentive due to the fee structure to
grant patents as opposed to deny them
which has nothing to do with the merits
of the application yes sir in the back
you're not to speak up just because I
can't hear you I'm sorry still can't
hear you so the question is well isn't
the increase be a disincentive to
actually receive a patent well and in
some cases people even though they've
been told they can receive one they
don't pay these fees and so actually the
number of patents that don't survive
past four eight and twelve years is
about twenty percent at each phase which
shows that even to the patent holder
it's not worth paying that amount of
money to maintain the patent into the
future but the vast majority of patent
applicants do understand that these will
be the expectations for them to pay in
advance and so they've already made that
decision by filing the application that
they're committed and willing to pay the
issue fee and the maintenance fees
because they want that patent bad enough
so let's talk at the examiner level how
much effort does an examiner have to put
into grant versus deny a patent well
they want to grant a patent to someone
you've applied for a patent I want to
grant it to you how hard is that for me
to do I'm making you happy I'm giving
you what you want you're not gonna fight
that you're not going to object to it
you're not going to appeal my decision
because I'm giving you the patent you
want that's very easy and examiner's get
their productivity measured on a quota
basically a quota system
how many patent applications do they
close quote unquote
how many do they resolve
okay now that sounds on its face to be
neutral between grant or deny an
application but let's actually think
about them if they grant a patent you
know someone applies our patent they go
you know what approved they get credit
for closing that patent now if they want
to reject an application they have to
explain their rejection they have to
deal with the patent applicants
attorneys writing letters back to them
telling them why they're stupid and
wrong then they have to write back and
then the applicant can appeal that
decision and then the examiner has to
write an appeal brief and time is tick
tick tick tick tick and so it's much
harder for them to get the same amount
of credit for closing an application if
they want to reject it as opposed to
simply allowing it and a lot of
examiner's just throw up their hands and
say you know what this is the system I'm
in I'm getting counted on a quota system
I'm just gonna approve it what do I care
right that's how they get their credit
for how much work they've done for
promotions for vacations etc yes sir
it's very public knowledge if they're on
a quota system actually all unionized
and there's highly detailed debates
between the union and management and the
quota system has been severely
criticized both in the literature and
politics and hasn't really been changed
okay so let's talk about those patents
that get issued how many of them
actually end up being litigated in court
so there's about two hundred and twenty
five two hundred and fifty thousand
patents granted every year how many
ended up in court
anybody want to hazard a guess half of
them a quarter it's about one to two
percent so a very very small number
patents actually get litigated and
there's been some academic literature
says well those are the ones that are
considered to be the most valuable by
the patent applicants or the patent
holders because they think that's where
it's worth to them the burden expense
actually go to court okay how many of
those that go to court actually end up
going to a verdict a lot of lawsuits get
filed they don't actually go to a
verdict because they get settled or
dismissed or something else happens in
the interim but only about 10 percent of
the patents that go to court actually
get to a verdict okay
so here's a good question once patents
are being litigated frequently but not
always so I just want to make sure we're
very precise about the language I don't
mislead you with these statistics
frequently but not always the validity
of the patent is challenged sometimes
the defendant will only challenge the
allegation of infringement
they'll concede the patent is valid but
they'll say it's very narrow and so we
don't do what it does and so we don't
infringe the vast majority of time the
defendant will make a validity challenge
how often when a validity challenge is
made to a litigated patent is it proven
that the thing described in the patent
had precisely exactly been done before
was already in the prior art what
percentage of the time do you think that
happens 15 percent says oh 50 percent
sorry so any okay well it's not that
often it's 30 percent which is still a
big deal to me 30 percent of the
valuable patents 30 percent of the 1%
most valuable patents that get litigated
are proven to have been granted on
something that was already done it was
already in the prior art now we also
have an additional requirement for
patentability which isn't just
anticipation but even if it hadn't been
identically done was there nonetheless
in significant improvement over what had
been done that's manifest in the patent
is it just obvious the improvement that
you patented here and that 40% of the
time patents are found invalid as being
merely obvious improvements on what had
already been done yes sir
well that's interesting because you have
to yeah so the question was isn't it
shouldn't we expect that patents which
are litigated or more likely to be
invalid it depends on too many moving
issues right how much of a licensing fee
are you demanding right if you're
requiring a very significant licensing
fee say you're requiring 100 million
dollar licensing fee it only costs me
five million dollars in litigation costs
to challenge your patent what's the
rational actors probability of success
necessary to make that a wise challenge
one out of twenty right so long as I
have a one out of 20 chance of winning
zero in verdict as opposed to one
hundred million dollars I have to pay
you I'm willing to take that five
percent risk and then I always know that
licensing option is probably still going
to be available even if I lose and
numbers may go up some that I've lose it
won't change that much so there's a lot
of analysis needs to be done about the
expectations of the parties and depends
on different parties some parties do
very much litigate but never take the
trial patents that they know have severe
questions because they don't want to get
to a verdict so they're willing to
settle for amounts that are much lower
than a cost of litigation so instead of
one hundred million dollars versus a
five million dollar litigation I'm
willing to settle for five hundred
thousand dollars well even if you know
you have a 50% chance for their patent
invalid would you spend five million
dollars to litigate when the patentee is
offering your license for five thousand
no because it's it's worth it just pay
five on that so it depends on the
numbers my concern is even when we take
all those factors aside if we were to
say pull out all the dollar bills in
your wallet and 40% of them are
counterfeit okay forty percent of them
if you were to go to the bank the bank
would say actually this isn't a valid
currency that's a severe concern to me
okay so then there's some other
statistics there is a process at the
Patent Office called re-examination so
the initial applying for a patent is
called examination and then there's a
process called re-examination where I
can ask the patent to take a second look
at a patented already granted now in
order for the Patent Office to do that
and
the public can request this
reexamination the patent office must
believe that there is a substantial
question regarding the validity of that
patent so before the Patent Office will
even grant a reexamination process they
have to believe there's a substantial
question regarding the validity of the
patent you're challenging how often does
the Patent Office itself concede there's
a substantial question regarding the
validity of patents that it has been
asked to re-examine 92% of the time 92%
of the time when you ask the Patent
Office to re-examine a patent that they
previously approved they previously put
their seal on that they previously
signed is okay they will concede Yelp
has substantial questions of
patentability we agree all right you had
a question sir so the 40% 30% those are
only the ones that actually go to trial
that we have a verdict decision on so
it's not even the wanted to go to court
it's even less than that I'm glad you
asked that thanks for bringing up I
wanted to mention that there is some
overlap between these so this is an
accumulative 70% of patents are found in
Valley because sometimes don't get
challenged for lack of novelty some only
get challenge for obviousness and some
get challenged for both so the general
statistics are a third of the time
patents are felt invalid a third of the
time they're held not infringed and a
third of time the patent holder wins so
that's generally how it breaks down
overall so of those 92 percent of the
times at the Patent Office itself agrees
that there's substantial questions
regarding validity of the patent what
ends up happening at the end of the
re-examination proceeding how often do
they simply well there was a question
but we've resolved it and we've
confirmed that the patent is valid as
issued how often do they say nope the
patent should be cancelled its entirety
and third with how often do they say
well the patent is invalid has issued
but there's still some smaller version
of
the patent that would be valid and so
will reissue just a narrower version of
the pattern well there's two types of
reexamination there's a type which only
occurs between the Patent Office in the
patent applicant even as I as a third
party request reexamination its ex parte
means once I've called the cops it's
between the cops and the patent holder
I'm not allowed to participate during
that type of process eleven percent of
the time the patents are cancelled it
means 11 percent of these 92 percent the
Patent Office agrees were completely a
mistake to ever have granted and should
have never existed in the first place
and 66 percent of the time of those 92
percent they say oh yeah it should be
changed it should not have been granted
in its original form then Congress
created in 1999 an inter partes
re-examination which allows the third
party requester to actually continue to
participate in the process throughout
and actually respond to or rebut any
arguments made by the patent holder now
an inter partes re-examination we see
that actually 44 percent of the patents
are completely cancelled completely
withdrawn from existence never should
have been issued in the first place and
another 43 percent are amending for
those of you just watching on video it's
bringing your children to work day here
at Google so that's not people objecting
to what I'm saying necessarily that's
coincidental it wasn't a typo so the
other percentage the 23 percent or
whatever 27 percent 23 percent is the
number that were confirmed and they're
retired okay so just a couple more
statistics you might find interesting
so let's compare how we are here in the
United States to other jurisdictions as
well maybe we're better made the world's
all relative right maybe we do a better
job than the rest of the world let's
let's look into that
okay patents granted by this is the
question asked earlier how many patents
does the Patent Office reject as opposed
to allow there's some you know liar
Liars figure and figures lie you guys
ever heard that my mom was it account
that was one of your favorites so
there's always some debate over any
statistics but I've taken the most
conservative number I can find there's
some statistics actually say it's 90 90
plus percent of all applications mature
into an issued patent okay but there's
another study that seems to be pretty
uncontestable this is 78% of the time if
you apply for a patent you're gonna get
it now what's that rate in Europe 55%
what's that rate in Japan
61% t2z there's a noticeably tougher
standard applied by these foreign
jurisdictions now let's just compare so
that but that may not say well they're
applying for different kinds of patents
it may be they're applying for harder
patents in Japan and that's why there's
less they get issued and that you're
comparing apples to oranges okay so
there was a study done in the mid 2000s
that took all the patent applications
had been filed in all three
jurisdictions at the same time so an
inventor of X applied for a patent in
the United States the European Patent
Office and the Japanese final same
invention okay of all those that ended
up being issued by the Patent Office
here in United States the similar
application is granted by the European
Patent Office only 72% of the time in
the same application in the Japanese
Patent Office only 44% of the time okay
and in both the EPO and the Japanese
Patent Office only 37% of the time so
relatively speaking we are a much easier
Patent Office to get a patent from than
any other Patent Office in the world we
are the easiest Patent Office to get
patents from so in summary this is my
equation patent office is a rubber-stamp
okay and what's the theory behind this
okay whenever I think about the problem
makes me
I mean people watched Oprah's Favorite
Things or at least know Oprah Winfrey
you least know Oprah Winfrey okay so she
has this episode or she used to every
like right around the first week of
December called her favorite things and
this is where she would bring onto the
show and she'd you know she'll for all
these products like the blackberry and
all these other things half of them
might be good half of them were junk
okay but she was getting paid tons and
tons of money
to give these products away to her
audience because she got that
advertising revenue she gave them
credibility her stamp of approval her
approval of that product gave it
legitimacy okay and so she'd go around
and people were so happy to be on this
show because they knew they're gonna get
all this free stuff have you not seen
these before they did a whole Saturday
night life right and so this is what I
think about the patent office
because pharmaceutical companies you get
a patent biotechnology industry you get
a patent any patent troll you get a
patent this is our patent office
everybody gets a pattern you get a
patent you get a patent you get a patent
you get a patent you can depend
everybody gets a patent and the world's
better off right so what causes poor
patent quality well we have to look at
incentives who all has an incentive to
make patent quality worse first of all
patent applicants right if you look at
if you're applying for patents you want
to get as many patents as possible you
don't care if some of them are bad and
some of them are strong you want as many
as many as possible because they're
almost like lottery tickets right some
of them are gonna scratch off and be
duds
whatever you don't pay the maintenance
fees you let them expire but others
might be winners and you just want as
many patents as possible I teach my
students okay listen carefully what I
say I tell my students if you do not get
at least some invalid patents for your
clients you have committed malpractice
they say if you do not get at least some
invalid patents for your clients you
have committed malpractice now why would
I tell my students that because if you
don't get at least some invalid patents
you're not being aggressive enough
you're not being greedy enough you're
not pursuing as much as you can it's
like if you go to buy a house and you
make an offer and it's accepted on the
first offer you offered too much you
never want your first offer accepted you
always want your first offer rejected
right so in the same theory a patent
attorney always wants to get as many
patents as possible and a patent
attorney doesn't care they're about
some people say oh but Dan it doesn't do
my client any good to give bogus patents
not true at all because venture
capitalist care about how many patents
you have you want to do cross licensing
with other large firms it counts a
patent a patent right so if I've got 50
patents as opposed to 500 patents even
if those additional 450 are all bogus I
feel better and I get more respect and I
can negotiate more with 500 than I can
with 50 so patent app attorneys and
applicants have an incentive to get more
patents of any quality Patent Office we
already talked about their fees how they
get ten times as much money by granting
a patent as by rejecting it we also
talked about examiner's and their
incentives how it's easier to award a
pen than it is to fight one now I know
many examiner's who care a lot about
defending patent quality and they work
very hard to reject applications and
they're proud of them so this is no way
a personal attack on the examiners I
even know several of people and
management the Patent Office it's not a
personal attack on them it's the system
that's been created that they have to
exist with them it's a system that's
been created that they try to survive in
and get promoted and that creates these
incentives has nothing to do with
scientific merit whatsoever we even look
at our politicians they only care about
serving the special interest the
third-largest special interests behind
the Chamber of Commerce and Big Oil is a
pharmaceutical industry and one of their
most important issues the being will get
strong patents on their drugs to keep
generics off the market and so they've
created this system so that they can get
patents and it's brought into the system
a lot of patents that you guys actually
care about there is a interesting case
involving a software patent or a patent
related to software and it went all the
way up to the Supreme Court and Eli
Lilly how many people heard of Eli Lilly
it's a pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly
submitted a brief to the Supreme Court
in a case involving software patents
which is strange on the first part and
you will be flabbergasted to hear what
you a Lilly argued Eli Lilly argued that
software should not be patentable now
why would a pharmaceutical company a get
involved with a software patent case
and then be argue software should not be
patent eligible subject matter why would
they do that because they know they've
expanded the patent system so large that
it's had all these unintended negative
consequences in your industry and they
want to take the heat off by just
getting rid of them and saying don't
drag down the whole patent system
because you're granting bad patents on
the internet because that dragging down
the whole bad system will hurt our
pharmaceutical patents so it was I had
actually submitted a brief that said
almost the same thing and I got bad
chills down my spine when I realized
that you I Lilly and I were arguing the
same thing never in my life
now the Court of Appeals we have a
specialized Court of Appeals just for
patent cases it created in the early
1980s because patent holders felt they
weren't getting a fair day in court so
they literally went to Congress and
lobbied for a specialized Court of
Appeals and there's been lots of
academic literature about how a
specialized court will always make
decisions to enlarge its jurisdiction
right that court when asked should we
make patents bigger and more important
and should we have more jurisdiction
more cases yes yes yes because there are
specialized court and their desires to
be more important and so we have this
specialized Court of Appeals all of
these actors don't care about the
negative effects whatsoever of bad
patent quality now competitors some of
you might think well Dan you know if I'm
a brand name drug company there's a
generic out there that generics going to
challenge the quality of my patents and
so the public can just free ride on that
generics effort you would be sadly
mistaken a generic drug companies
incentive or desire is to actually
somehow get a most favored nation status
under the patent if the generic proves
the patents invalid that's a decision
that can benefit all other generics
right so it's not going to benefit much
because there's gonna be other people
who freeride on that effort and enter
the market as well the generic is better
off either negotiating a favorable
license from the patentee and then they
work together to use the patent to keep
all other competitors off the market or
at least get some kind of
non-infringement decision that maintains
the validity of the patent to be used
against other later generics because the
first generic wants to be in a duopoly
they don't want to be in a fully
competitive
because they make more profit from a
duopoly than they would from a market
where marginal costs is where the price
is tenth they're going to get that so
let me ask you a question and bring it
to your industry let's say there was a
patent that all of us in this room knew
was invalid and we knew we could prove
it and that patent was being asserted
against smartphones it was being
asserted against Android it was being
asserted against iPhones okay what would
be your incentive of your Google
would you rather prove that that patent
is invalid and that way it can't be
asserted against you or Apple or would
you rather try to negotiate some kind of
relationship with the patentee that
maintains the patents validity to be
asserted against Apple but yet you get a
better deal so a lot of right so there's
it's an interesting question
right the purist might say if it's a
bogus patent let's prove it's bogus and
the fact that Apple gets the benefit
from our cost and time and risk and
doing that whatever and other people say
wait a minute if I can get a license
from the panel it says I only pay a
nickel for every Android phone and they
swear they'll never license it to Apple
for less than a dime then I'll take that
because now I know Apple is going to
have to increase the price of all of its
iPhones by $0.10 I only have to increase
the price of my Android phones by a
nickel right so commercial competitors
actually do not often have an incentive
to challenge the validity of patents
they have an incentive actually try to
manipulate the existence of that patent
to create a more preferential treatment
visa v all other competitors in the
marketplace and then there's the savvy
actor some of you may use the term or
have heard the term patent troll I don't
like that term I think it's pejorative
but there are people who will do this
analogy says if it costs five million
dollars for Google to defend itself
I'll send Google a letter or maybe even
file a lawsuit against Google which only
cost me $350 or $300 and 42 cents to
send a stamped letter these days and
I'll offer Google license for $50,000
Google might very well pay me $50,000
rather than spend all the money to
litigate and prove my patents invalid
and I could totally know my patent has a
99% chance of being proven invalid but I
won't ever get there because no one's
gonna have the financial incentive to go
through that process so is there anyone
who has an insane
to help rid the world of undeserved
patents well I would say the public and
people stand up on the public behalf
this includes consumers organizations
and attorneys like myself and my clients
tray and then there's you guys I think
most of you are not in lawyers small
you're actually people who do stuff to
make the world a better place not you
know fight with each other and are just
basically social waste transaction costs
right so here we've got no disrespect to
me or my students its friction you're
not gonna get rid of us okay just accept
it right and include it in your
calculations right so the people
actually do stuff don't want bad patents
around and the people who care about
access to markets don't want bad pads
right but other than that who do you
think wins in this fight it's a tough
fight and the resources are not on the
side of those who want to stand for
Thomas Jefferson's principle of ensuring
that the embarrassment of exclusive
rights is reserved only for those
inventions that deserve it but some
people mark Laemmle is a law professor
over here at Stanford he's very well
respected he's a friend he's a great guy
but he actually argues this is good this
is a good thing that we have an ignorant
patent office and ignorance is his word
not mine it's a good thing because the
cost of increasing the number of hours
each exam and hiring more examiner's and
paying them more and giving them more
time to do it would be so overwhelming
because there's such a small percentage
of patents to actually get litigated
it's a good thing right this is what I
call the Bob Marley which is don't worry
it'll be okay right no big deal what
happened to Bob Marley okay so let's
look at the negative effects of poor
patent quality so we've already talked
about this markets get completely
perverted why is someone allowed to
charge a super competitive price by
excluding competitors based on a patent
they should have never been granted in
the first place it's just completely
contrary to any economic theory any
political theory it is just ridiculous
and yet I can't even get people who are
in patent representatives to agree with
me like I love asking this question
whenever I'm on a debate or
panel is there a single patent issued by
the Patent Office that should not have
been granted they can't answer that
because they can't say no because then I
can go pull out about 5,000 cases where
patents granted my patent also proved
invalid and they can't say yes because
they concede my point right there are
patents every Tuesday issue at a patent
office that should never been granted in
the first place and this has a negative
effect on markets consumer access it
diverts resources there's a book by
Besson and mirror called patent failure
all about the empirical data which shows
that applying a patent system almost all
industries causes a net drag on research
and development because it siphons away
resources from funding you guys and
hiring more people like you to go to
people like me and my students I'm fine
with that
but it may not be good for society
alright there is one interesting
economic study that's tried to put a
price like just on the negative effect
it has on other innovators so the fact
that Apple has a bunch of bogus patents
and you guys have a bunch of bogus
patents and you're threatening each
other that drag on research 21 billion
dollars you put on top of that all the
wasted litigation costs and then so
thirty billion dollars a year because of
all this waste that's not trivial I'm
not Bob Marley about that that's a lot
of money
I think there's Buffett Rule tax that
was being proposed would come in and
about the same difference to the bottom
line so if we just fixed patent quality
we'd save a lot at the same amount of
money as the Buffett Rule would which to
me seems pretty important and then
there's a concern that I have that not
many economists yet recognizes that this
impact on civil liberties because
technology is such an important part of
everything we do the ability for some
company to restrain access to technology
can impact our ability to anything
including speech assemble all of our
other civil liberties and we don't have
any fair use right in patent law like
there is in copyright law so what can we
do about poor patent quality and just do
a time check okay well on the specific
patent level there's lots of things we
can do one is file these admit these
administrative challenges I told you
about the ex parte de re-examination the
inter partes re-examination
so here's an example of one we filed
back in 2004 against the patent held by
Microsoft over there fat file system and
we at the time we're a very small
nonprofit I was the only employee of the
nonprofit and on that resource was able
to get a patent held by one of the
largest companies in the world
significantly narrowed and this is the
patent that they were touting to the
world that they wanted licensing on
Microsoft started their licensing
program back in early 2000s this was one
of their this is the patent we're gonna
license and I said oh really look at all
these questions and the patent office
ended up narrowing it that was one of
those vast majority because that was
through the ex parte process we disagree
with that even that allowance of the
narrowed patent but we had no right to
appeal it or pursue it further here's
another one of my favorite examples so
this is a company called Forge n't
networks before it was called fortunes
called compression labs and it's since
been renamed as sure they had a patent
that they said covered JPEGs yes the
photo image format jpg okay and so they
started asserting it against everyone so
we filed a reexamination request because
we found prior art that we thought
rendered invalid and should never been
granted in the first place so I want you
to look at the date that the Patent
Office granted our reexamination because
we're one of the 92% that they grant and
said yes you've raised a substantial
question February 2nd ok now let's look
at the stock price if you look at
February 2nd
as Pete
see that drop that was a 30% drop in the
stock price over the course of two days
you can go look at the horse tour achill
price data between February 1st and
February 4th at the time the company was
originally an eighty million dollar
company lost thirty to thirty five
million dollars a market cap simply
because we announced to the world that
the Patent Office had granted our
request to re-examine their patent and
if you look it's never recovered so for
those of you who use the word patent
troll you'd be correct to apply it to
this company and by us filing a
reexamination request which cost about
twenty five hundred dollars a file and
maybe a hundred hours of my time and a
little bit of help from some others we
got it filed so in exchange for even say
we spent ten thousand dollars of the
public's money to file that
reexamination request we helped
eradicate thirty five million dollars of
market cap from a company that was based
on a bogus patent and in fact I got some
fan mail
now my favorite part I hope there's no
kids watching okay good
my favorite part is that he wouldn't
write out the word a underscore
underscore but he had no problem writing
out the word B earlier in that sentence
so this is just you can't even believe
the kind of stuff I get I've been yelled
at at conferences I've been told I
should be disbarred that one of my
students tried to get a job at a law
firm DC they reject his application when
he was interviewing because they said oh
you work for a bunch of Communists I say
if you want to label me something that's
fine I like being called names but
Communists when I'm actually trying to
prevent the government from taking away
my freedom you're gonna have to defend
that label and eventually in November
the company abandoned all assertion of
the pattern so that's what ten thousand
dollars can do for the public so then
there's also pre-emptive litigation and
I'm gonna come back to this in a minute
where you can actually file it and
someone's asserting a patent and you're
afraid that it may get asserted against
you you're allowed to go to court first
preemptively and sue them simply for
ruling that their patent is bogus and
should never been granted okay now I'm
gonna come back to an example but then
there's just simply exposing it expose
the hypocrisy have expose the invalidity
so what's an example of that so back in
the day w3c I'm sure most of you've
heard of that it's an it's an internet
standards body somebody laughed when I
said I'm sure you guys are heard of it
yeah
so there is this patent holder named
inter mind who assert was asserting this
patent over communications over the
Internet so communicating over the
Internet was patented by inter mind and
they you know it is what it is so they
started asserting his patent against the
p3p how many people heard of p3p
it's a protocol so it just assumed any
standard so you got patent holder
asserting patent against standard so in
response p3p I mean w3c went out and
they got a law firm called penny and
Edmonds but you can see the author's
field there it says penny and Edmonds
that was a very prestigious law firm it
doesn't exist anymore but it believed me
back at this time it was one of the best
patent law firms in the world
and they asked penny omits what's your
opinion about this patent and you can
find this on the web still and basically
this is a copy of the opinion written by
those patent attorneys now look they
didn't file anything to Patent Office
they didn't file a lawsuit they merely
wrote a letter saying hey we've looked
at this patent and we don't think you
need to be worried about it we don't
think you infringe it we think it's it's
it's the only way it could be valid is
if it's so narrow you don't practice it
well what benefit does that do a it
helps expose the weaknesses the
patentees case B we have in the patent
law a certain amount of money that you
can be awarded once you've proven that
your patent has been infringed which is
a reasonable royalty or your loss
profits now when you're simply a company
that asserts patents you don't have any
profits loss you're not like a
brand-name pharmaceutical company who's
lost sales of drugs when a generic
enters the market so you can really get
as a reasonable royalty
well the footnote to that is if you can
prove that the infringement was willful
you can get three times as much money
and your attorneys fees so you can go
from basically a quarter for a
reasonable royalty to a dollar right so
the ability to get willfulness is really
a multiplier effect and that's what
patent holders really want to be able to
do well your get out of jail free card
for willfulness is that you consulted a
lawyer and the lawyer told you don't
have anything to worry about not even
that you don't have to have consulted a
lawyer yourself if you read another
lawyer's opinion that you had no
relationship with about that patent and
why your implementation of some
technology doesn't infringe it you can
rely on that opinion to defend yourself
from any claim of willfulness so you
basically I don't like using but you've
cut this patent off at the knees you've
reduced its ability to scare you and
you've reduced the monetary value that
the patent holder sees and being able to
sue you and all this takes is the time
to write the letter the letter is just
something that attorneys we the patent
attorneys do all the time let's in
another example so a more recent example
is this patent holder called
a rival star which you may or may not
have heard is asserting a patent on
telling people when a vehicle will
arrive okay so they've gone around suing
all the public transportation agencies
you can think of the New York City
Subway Portland Chicago Boston etc okay
well I actually came to represent one of
these transportation agencies I'm not
going to tell you who well one of them
and the first thing I say is well you
don't have
right to sue us because the Eleventh
Amendment prohibits States from being
sued for patent infringement you may not
know all this history but the Eleventh
Amendment was basically the federal
courts can't hail into their
jurisdiction state entities it was kind
of like this separation of powers
compromise that our framers made so
after I got called by the third or
fourth transportation agency about this
and because they don't have patent
attorneys they're not saying none of you
knew about the Eleventh Amendment patent
infringement right so I think you know
what I'm just going to write a blog post
and so it took me like a day I wrote
this blog post and now everyone knows
including this patent holder that they
can't sue state transportation agencies
right and so that's really undercut the
threat that they can wield against
people simply by putting up a blog post
so that's what I mean by publicized
legal advice a very low-cost but very
harmful to the bogus patent holder
activity on a macro level administrative
change we talked about changing the
quota system changing the free structure
all these things you know to me being
one who doesn't trust government doesn't
like government it feels like putting my
head against the wall so I I don't
choose to spend my time much on trying
to do that we do submit comments to the
Patent Office frequently I know that my
name has been submitted to be part of it
they have a an advisory committee at the
Patent Office for the public a public
patent Advisory Committee public patent
Advisory Committee public patent
foundation sounds kind of similar I know
my name has been proposed several times
they won't even consider me because they
don't even want to hear dissent they
don't want to hear criticism we were to
ask the the director of the Patent
Office
he'd say there's no patent quality
problem what are you talking about we
don't we issue only valid patents and so
we're back to that ridiculous question
well how many patents a week to you are
bogus he can't answer because he knows
if he says zero he'll be laughed at and
he can't admit that his patent office
his signature goes on the bogus patents
every week legislative change you know
here's one person's opinion about
Congress
so what about litigation I said I'd come
back to litigation now this isn't an
example from a case involving a
technology that you directly care about
but there are have been patents granted
on your genes which give you a
predisposition for certain diseases how
many people think that's a good idea
okay for the people who can see there
was no hands raised so we in conjunction
with the American Civil Liberties Union
filed a lawsuit one of these pre-emptive
lawsuits I told you about when you're
aware of a bogus patent you can go to
court and file pre-emptive lawsuit
challenging the validity of those
patents the district court judge agreed
with us that they were invalid we went
to the Court of Appeals which I told you
was a specialized Court of Appeals it's
very Pro patent so they reversed on half
of the decision they upheld half the
decision in our favor reversed on the
other half we then petition to the
Supreme Court and the Supreme Court
vacated that decision last month and
remanded it to them for reconsideration
in light of another patent case the
Supreme Court had earlier decided in the
month relating to medical diagnostics
patents where they ruled nine to zero
that a patent the Court of Appeals had
said was okay was not okay so this to me
is a clear indication again that the
court of appeals has sided too far in
favor of patent holders and so when we
go back yes I'm going to be very
confident that we're either gonna get
the verdict we want we're gonna go back
to the Supreme Court no reverse Court of
Appeals again but this is an example a
public interest litigation in the patent
system you can undertake finally public
transparent now here's an idea about
something hopefully maybe one of you
finds interesting maybe not maybe it's
stupid feel free to tell me about it
this is something that I thought I'm
going to the world's best company for
searching and relating documents to one
another and this is something that I've
done since day one of being a pan
attorney about how to find other
references and it's called patent
mapping anyone ever heard of patent
mapping okay so here let's assume we
have a patent one two three and on the
cover of the patent review even go to
Google patents you can look and you can
see what prior art references were cited
either by the applicant or the examiner
during the prosecution or the
application process so what was the
prior art O'Kane so here I've
represented that as cited reference a
cited reference B and then I drawn a
circle around that to mean that's what
the Patent Office examiner
had before her when she was deciding
that application okay so that's that's
the nucleus of your map well then you go
and look yourself or you use some very
smart people at a big company with lots
of servers something that I am NOT and
you go find what documents do a and B
refer to okay so a and B refer to this
uncited document a 1 and this uncited
document b1 ok now another thing you can
do and this is something that patents
Google patents does is you can not only
see the patents or references that your
specific patent site so you can also see
later arising documents that cite your
patent so said I mean by ok so these are
things that came after the issuance of
your patent but then nonetheless have
now cited it as prior art ok so we can
do that with unsighted a1 and unsighted
b1 right and so now I've got this
unsighted a11 reference and this uncited
b11 reference and they both look like
maybe they have something to do with
patent 1 2 3 because there's there's a
relationship there cousins or you know
second cousins twice removed whatever
you want to call it regardless they
weren't before the examiner ok and I can
tell you this is how I find most of the
prior art that is undermined all the
patents I've ever challenged is doing
this mapping not by boolean searching
boolean search and sometimes helps but
it's usually duplicate of a patent
mapping so then we also go citing one
what else deciding one refer to citing
one refers to
unsighted one a well lo and behold look
that also refers to unsighted a1 1 so
when I'm looking at this patent map I'm
thinking without even reading it uncited
a11 seems like a pretty strong reference
lots of people are referring to it's got
a lot of causal connections it seems
like it might have something to do and
then you can see how big this we these
maps can get very big very quickly and
then you can also do interesting things
like well how crowded was the prior art
you know this patent 1 2 3 wants to be
able to say that they were very
innovative and no one had solved the
problem they had solved well if you look
at all the prior art that existed before
it that tells you well there was
actually lots of people focused on this
same
the same problem and so you can start to
see where this patent stands in
comparison to all the others so this is
something I think could help the public
a lot there are some companies that do
this now they charge a very large feet I
would love if someone would make this
available to the public for free you
just go to a patent you say map this
patent and you click on it and bam you
get this graphical interface and it
shows you all this data and then you can
start doing comparison data
well how many patents were unsighted for
this one compared to the average within
this classification and you can you see
all the derivatives of how helpful this
information could be to people and then
you may not never even need to use this
the fact that it exists will cause a lot
of bogus patent holders to think twice
because they know they're not going to
be able to take advantage of this lack
of information that the public has this
lack of transparency so with that I'd be
delighted to answer any questions or
respond any comments you guys might have
thanks again for having me here really
appreciated yes sir
okay preference for the microphone yes
sir
just a request to clarify one fine point
you talked about protecting yourself
against treble damages for willful
infringement is the citation of the
legal opinion does that override any
evidence that for example you know
discoverable emails and so forth that
you knew at the time that you maybe
thought you were infringing but is that
still overridden by the leave right no
I'm so the question is does the
existence of the opinion letter from an
attorney per se defeat willfulness or is
it merely a factor that gets considered
amongst discovery of other elephants and
they are allowed to pursue discovery
related to that issue so there's an
email it says oh hey there's this
opinion letter out there by this
attorney saying we don't infringe but I
completely disagree with it because of
the that attorney didn't know what they
were talking about that would be an
email you'd have to disclose and that
would then rebut your defense that you
relied on the letter but as long as you
can prove you read the letter
you found the com
and you relied on it you can use that
letter as a defense to the charge of
willfulness yes sir so this might seem
like a glib question but I promise it
isn't why don't we just scrap the whole
thing I mean like what's the benefit
that what's the evidence that the
benefit of the patent system as a whole
outweighs these you know fairly tangible
costs and restrictions to our freedom
right so I'm a you know a lot of people
have said that you know why don't we
just do no harm right and the best in
your book does a good job of doing
industry by initiating there are some
industries where the existence of the
patent system does promote progress and
so we would want that
and there's other tweaks we can make to
the system like if we had an exemption
for research if we had like the rest of
the world does if we had better
standards for patentability if we
ensured the only valid patents were
issued I think there is some value to a
properly working patent system so I
wouldn't myself vote in favor of
overturning it I just think we need to
fix it so that it works better and then
we need to make better policy choices
about what field should exist in or not
can you give like your strongest example
of an industry that really benefits from
where everybody benefits from patents
existing in that industry just whatever
it is your strongest you know example
where it's most clearly not broken you
know the best in your book says that
pharmacy and does the analysis of the
pharmaceutical industry and also the
chemical engines like Dow Chemical and
other chemicals not just chemicals we
swallow would really be retarded by the
removal of patents now what I've said is
that our patents our pharmaceutical
industry is also benefited by FDA
exclusivity so when you invent a new
drug you don't just get patents you also
get an exclusive right to market that
drug from the FDA so we could always
tweak that market exclusivity to make
sure that we compensate for any decrease
in patent issues but at this point I'm
so concerned with just making sure that
bogus patents get eradicated I haven't
stepped forward to saying well let's
make sure that the patent system is on
the right policy tweaks although we do
debate those as well thank you
so whenever I asked the government or
representatives thereof about getting
rid of software patents the answer was
well the pharmaceutical industry would
be against that you know there there are
big fans of the patent system so now
we've got to the point where even the
pharmaceutical industry is arguing that
we should get rid of software patents is
there any chance of actually doing that
and if we were to do so how would that
be done well I wouldn't say the entire
farmer school industry is against offer
about the Eli Lilly was right and so
they didn't get the pharmaceutical
manufacturers Association which is the
lobbying group but um there are members
of that group and see this there's an
interesting case right now it says is
questioning whether or not putting a
patent putting a known method onto the
Internet is patentable because the
Patent Office is routinely granted
patents for doing something that we knew
to do before but just doing it on the
Internet and so there's a case pending
before the Supreme Court may address
that issue unfortunately it's not
something we can just snap our fingers
and get fixed and the lobbying powers in
Congress do prevent a lot of times
merits from being seen instead we only
get legislation the benefits special
interest so you know it's it's a process
it's a slow-moving process and I think
the litigation system is working in that
direction you know so the best thing we
can do is on a micro-level continue to
challenge those bogus software patents
that get brought up most often or
asserted most often while that also at a
meta level continuing to have these
policy discussions about more
comprehensive change one of the problems
with just saying let's get rid of
software patents is then how do you
define a software patent because to you
what might be a software patent to me
might be a system right and so I won't
even concede it's a software and so we
end up in this debate about labels and
so we end up just having to review the
specific claim language itself that's
one of the main arguments for saying
let's not have categorical exclusions
because then you just have people
arguing over what does it mean to be
within or outside of that category two
very quick questions one quite specific
in another
perhaps more open-ended this 20 year
validity of patents is that something
based on history and and is it still as
valid particularly in software industry
is it not possible to earn back the cost
of doing the research and applying for
the patent in a short period of time and
would that be useful and the second one
is there's been a lot of talk recently
about defense of patents so companies
that seek patents some similarly as
defend simply as defense against you
know people that are getting against
them for suppose that infringement and
is there any you have any useful
comments on that talk right so the first
question was about patent term it has
gotten longer and longer over our
history
it used to be 17 years from issuance and
then they changed it to 20 years from
initial application and that's not
actually always the case because you can
get an extension to your patent
if the Patent Office delayed your
application too much or if the patent
relates to some product that some other
government entity delayed approving like
the FDA so pharmaceutical patents often
last much longer than 20 years
revocation because they get this patent
term extension there's even people who
go to Congress and try to get a specific
bill just to extend their patent so like
that really heavy flashlight I think
it's called a Magna light or something
like that those people try to go to
Patent Office several times to get a
specific law passed just to extend the
term of their path so the term isn't as
specific as I said but it has generally
tended over time to lengthen but people
know that that would be a more
transparent change so the patent system
would be more easily opposed so instead
of doing that they do other things like
in large impeccable subject matter to
include things that people thought were
not within the original intent by
including the remedies available to
patent holders by increasing the burden
on a challenger to prove a patent
involved so you do these other things
plus patentees are savvy enough to be
able to file multiple applications on
related products so it just as the first
patent expiring lo and behold they've
got a second patent that has now been
issued and that they can extend the
coverage of their product for and this
is why a lot of times you'll hear
pharmaceutical products will go from the
regular pharmaceutical to like the
extended-release version now you ever
heard of that but do you know why
they're going to the extended-release
because they have a patent
the invention of making the drug in an
extended-release form and the patent on
the original chemical has since expired
and so they went to all these doctors
offices as the first patent was about to
expire and said you better not prescribe
the old pill to people because that'll
kill people you better prescribe only
the extended-release and we're gonna run
all these commercials convincing
consumers they have to buy the
extended-release and that the old pill
is bad because now it's generic and now
we have a patent on the extended-release
form so this kind of like evergreening
of patents is a very sophisticated but
frequently used strategy defense of
patenting again there's the pragmatic
versus the theoretic perspective the
pragmatic perspective say hey it's
beneficial it doesn't cost us much
that's why I said in my examples those
parties who are incentivized to get bad
patents include commercial entities
commercial competitors patent applicants
because the more patents you have isn't
harmful in any way right there's no net
negative to getting a bad patent you
spend a few thousand dollars on it and
that's trivial compared to how
beneficial can be but theoretical there
can be one of these you know what we say
to our kid well the other kid is being
bad then should we be bad no we tell our
kid look you do the right thing because
that's the right thing to do
you know and the defense and patenting
doesn't work too much against some of
the most frequently litigated patents
which are held by non-practicing
entities so there's no threat of
retaliation against them because they
don't have a product right a defense a
patent doesn't help you against like a
who you would call a patent troll it
doesn't work because the patent you
can't sue the patent troll right the
defensive padding only helps against
other large commercial actors and
usually just end up cross licensing so
it's a strategy it can be helpful but
it's unfortunate that it's a strategy
people have to waste money on instead of
using that money to hire more engineers
to make better products and services for
the American people
so thanks again for having me here so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
