back in category 2006 and there's much
more to send so he's going to do a quick
recap and we're looking at oddly the
social participation here and are all
working put into it she will cease
obviously it's a survey Thank You Connie
tennis so we figured we'd then I'll reap
for the benefit of people who weren't
here last year I'll represent the slides
and maybe take 20 minutes on that then
we could have an interactive discussion
in as much as people want to and then
when that Peters out then we can break
up into groups so just to get an idea
how many people were caught this talk
last year in May may think this my
pretty sure is my okay so we just trying
to get through these things so I checked
the the list membership today there's
actually now 400 members 397 303 fully
subscribed 96 digest so things have
moved on even more since so this is the
state of things as of April May 2006 so
we had 103 responses to this survey 83%
response counting 130 active members
which is our tally of who came to
meetings and this had changed to some
extent since the last time we ran it in
in march two thousand three and so i
tried to present some slides to tabulate
what I think are people's points of view
and interest but anybody who wants to
get access to the sequel data I'll
probably make that available and on
anonymized so you can do that so people
want to know why are we doing this why
are we collecting data what's the point
why should I care why should I fill this
in and so it was basic law just achill
stuff so okay so people complain about
you didn't cover my favorite topic or my
favorite package or is anybody else in
this group interested in
you know a certain application on a
certain platform so we wanted to
quantify who is and who isn't what are
the really sort of nishi things that
only a few hardcore are really
interested in and what are the broad
interests that haven't been covered yet
and then how do we might great that into
inviting speakers that we know would be
of interest to people speakers that
people knows because people that people
like have seen before where do we need
volunteers what are the issues
internally that the group needs to
organize those sort of things so we had
some basic questions about people's
level and python and how much they use
it so we've we've got a sort of a very
broad cross spectrum of users from
complete newbies which is fine to psf
members and everything in between and
sort of it splits up into people who use
Python more than fifty percent on the
job and less than fifty percent and that
kind of splits evenly so there's some
hobbyists some full-time developers some
hold multi-skilled developers different
profiles like that and to how many
meetings people attend a year the median
of this is is is a so we have twenty
four percent of people who are list
lurkers who who don't come and that that
numbers probably increased quite a lot
twenty-nine percent of people who could
only come to less than a quarter of the
meetings and thirty-two percent of
people come to less less than half of
the meetings so the meeting of this is
pretty low so you know we we ask for
constructive discussion on you know is
it that the meetings are hard to get to
or you're not interested or you really
need them to be advertised earlier so
you can carpool or or just that the
topic doesn't interest you we got a
bunch of opinions on that as to how long
people have been a member of the group
the sort of shake out of this was that a
seventy two percent of the people have
been members for less than two years so
the membership really is changing
radically and in fact you can see it
from the graph so as the venues have
changed in time has moved on so we're
now here if you can extrapolate from 160
to 397 then that's where it is today
so I don't so therefore we fill all the
Google campus by the year 2000 2015 so
this is a I don't dwell on this one this
is you know one of the contentious
issues which is where do people like to
have the meetings everybody knows that
if you feed if you've been on the
mailing list for for more than a month
you're aware this is very passionate of
the subject I was going to try to
suggest we were in the discussion
tonight towards more basic stuff like
simply a topic speakers organization
that sort of stuff this is like a sort
of higher function we can aspire to so
that's in the slides you can refer to
that so then we had a we had some other
surveys of platforms that people work on
which ID things like that it's not
massively relevant so the most one of
the most important things was what are
people's objectives and for the group as
in either the email list or the meetings
or both what do they want to do and also
what format of meeting did they prefer
for those who come to the meetings so
this is some arbitrary ranking numerical
ranking I had to give it surveymonkey
allows you to pick a score which is an
integer so so on a capricious scale of 0
to 4 or 1 to 4 so the most important
thing to people is learning something
new then staying current getting current
community buzz meeting Python people
hearing from Guido directly and then
sort of a score of 2 is moderate
moderately important so other stuff
networking job shopping social stuff
meetups and other unspecified things
recruiting publicizing demoing your
package book of course and there's
there's an in-depth break out of these
things later on so you can see this so
when you ask people what are the topics
of interest so this is maybe the most
useful output in terms of what do people
what do people want to see and what were
they personally prepared to to host so
language internals advanced Python core
features web frameworks Python language
future standard packages they're like of
extreme interest to almost everybody
so I think they're well hit and the
things in blue and light blue are things
that haven't really been covered okay so
some some of that is a little bit out of
date but and so for example the some
people expressed interest in profiling
refactoring &amp;amp; Co deficiency which hasn't
really ever been covered of itself
except in passing but I said people like
drew so there's a few other things build
automation and build automation release
and testings is of interest to a lot of
people especially if I understand
rightly Google folks so I don't think
what you disagree tennis I believe so I
say build automation is it's it's of
interest to quite a large bunch of
people I don't think it's ever been
covered so we know that people are out
there and and then a whole you know a
whole bunch of a standard standard topic
areas and everything from business logic
databases compiling a IDEs and cheese
shop distribution how to package
something for distribution and more
content management frameworks like clone
which was supposed to be tonight's topic
text processing things like xml cgi and
so on GUI methodology so then sort of
moderate topics of moderate interest we
maybe bring this slide up later if we're
discussing but there's a there's a whole
sort of cross universal cross-section of
things that people are interested in and
the most important thing about this is
most of it hasn't really been covered in
a talk here and everybody's enthusiastic
about something so most people are
capable of speaking about this stuff
everybody has maybe slightly different
nation turists so for example when you
you talk about evangelizing or
commercializing Python startups and
segments Business Studies venture
capital you know what's getting funded
these days so that's maybe something
thats of extreme interest to some people
and not maybe not to others so all of
these potentially could be
yeah I built it built out into a talk if
people were willing to make it happen
and then this stuff that's this is stuff
it the final list of stuff that's of
niche interest or it's a strong interest
to a small bunch of people but generally
not so for example there are people who
do ironpython there's a few of them they
said they say a lot of good things about
it but again it's never it's never been
published personally I'm interested in
electronic design automation and chip
design CAD scientific applications but
you know how many many other people
aren't so the take-home stuff about this
was there were some topics that are of
general interest some topics that are
for newbies some for advanced and there
are surprisingly there are pretty
popular topics that haven't ever been
featured I think functional programming
still wasn't you know on the same row
gooeys is always popular and has never
really been as in not just my favorite
GUI but how to build a GUI application
or a survey of designing with different
gooeys that sort of stuff and porting as
a topic in and of itself databases
things like that and then there's the
niche topics this is the sort of cig
material special interest groups may be
so stuff stuff that borders some people
but as is interesting to other people
animation scientific usage that sort of
stuff job hunting fight in an education
is something that popped up in the last
18 months that a lot of money is
starting to go into this and with the
the Macintosh distribution of Python
it's sort of reaching critical
penetration in the education sector so
other suggestions that people made these
are individual suggestions so they may
or may not be popular but certainly
would be worth throwing out to see how
much interest to generate and sort of
non non lecture formats code sprints
other other formats of activity so then
I asked this question about usefulness
of Python resources I thought it might
it might or might not
you know show some interesting trends
like some people always use the list
where some people always use the IRC but
this actually sort of generated an
interesting side effect question is a
lot of people said what are these things
and where are they and I never realized
there is a Python shooter list or that
sort of stuff so in and of itself a you
know a review talk of these are the main
you know these are the main Python
activities and for sure Oskan and PyCon
are really popular most people can't get
to them so and because they don't they
don't publish the the transcript so
we're sort of wholly dependent on people
who go there to tell us what's hot and
what's not this is a sort of a comment
that's been kicked around a lot what is
what are the preferred meeting formats
or what do people like or what are they
not like or what would they like to
experiment with so the sort of
monolithic one speaker technical talk or
detailed presentation from the podium
that's that's one format it's sort of
marginally the most popular but the
second priority was people expressing a
preference for all of the above people
with people talking about people
suggesting several speakers on various
topics and so the consensus was it
didn't really matter people didn't
really care if it's one speaker or
several speakers or whatever they just
want to make sure that the speaker's
sort of practice before and that the
presentation will be interesting that
they'll get something out of it so there
was a suggestion you can sort of give
new speakers a five minute or lightning
talk sort of audition then and that's a
good way to help see if they have
material and if they can capture the
audience interactive workshop and learn
athan it's a it's an interesting
proposal takes a lot of organizing or
coding Sprint's so it's it's heavy duty
you know requires a core of volunteers
to do it so if it's going to happen it
would need a group of volunteers to
drive it so then snippets and lightning
talks are useful it was done in the past
anybody who writes some cool applet and
wants to show us
something particular together they found
or at a book review or a conference mini
conference talk something like that and
then the other formats QA formats
discussion round table quiz whatever
special interest group breakout
discussions and other things people are
interested in social activities as well
and some people have expressed interest
yeah sure thing yeah as so whether book
reviews are popular or not yeah it's um
hmm good question i mean we didn't list
it as a separate activity you know we
thought like you know five-minute talk
covers it and yeah they're parentally
popular and as long as you know the book
is of general interest and you know the
person can present it well and so Tony I
don't think he's not here but so too you
know Tony capellini is coordinating that
so at the moment the book reviews go up
in the website but there's no email
notification so you know I think I think
you know I think it would be a good
thing once if somebody has reviewed
something broadly interest so this is
this is where the rubber hits the road
it's like if we put a gun to your head
what topic could you volunteer to speak
on or what topic what topic would you be
least unwilling to speak on well what
can you do for us so so a lot of people
answered which was pretty neat so you
know whatever that is eighty-seven
percent which is pretty cool or they
recommended other other people who they
like and have seen before and so we got
some names and you know that's that's
one mechanism and so we got some other
things for example a picture said yes
but as of last year they had a major
rush on so they said come back talk to
them 2007
various other things asking gido to give
a talk is kind of like taking the easy
option adds so we should be able to be
self self perpetuating that Django so
Jacob couple animals came here last year
and that was pretty cool so this is an
interesting section and so now we have
some some comments that make it that
make interesting reading yeah some of
you know some of this stuff is it should
not be necessary for for adults to have
to make these cons to each other better
various comments that might might or
might not be still relevant that
discussed what was going on last year
but so the consensus is if the meeting
is is is organized and starts on time
and and is over topic that that
interests people then they like that and
if it's not then they don't comments
about organization there is a highly
interesting comment later on and
something about moderate one here I
understand the need for the high volume
on the email list but hopefully some of
it can be taken offline in executive
committee in the near future which is
sort of betraying an assumption that
isn't valid so so if you have a group as
we do which is essentially has no formal
structure then and as a sort of ultra
democracy then really anybody can
propose anything so we several of us had
made the comment sometimes that we would
like to move towards a formal structure
and have a charger elect officers and
not not not out of some power-crazed but
simply as an effective way of scaling
and not beating everybody to death with
the minus CA of had organized a meeting
or that sort of stuff so people's
comments about the format they made the
big deal is there is there's a multitude
of comments and there's no consensus but
people would like some so most or many
people would like to experiment at the
format's some people like the current
one they think it's just fine some
people would like to change
the time and the discussion about the
location again is kind of fun it's kind
of mood but it'll always be out there
meeting planning meetings need to be
planned further in advance note note the
use of the passive tense meeting I'm
sorry done little did you have a comment
no ok sorry notified I thought somebody
did the group should be more proactive
to seek speakers even out of town
experts so we have one inanimate
abstract noun and one passive tense so
useful comments I wish I could attend
more meetings volume on the mailing list
itself that's kind of it's a historical
comment but the fact that you have to
discuss stuff on the mailing list is in
my opinion a manifestation of the fact
that we don't have officers we don't
have a charger so you have to run
everything by everybody all of the time
and disagreements happen and then
sometimes heated discussions happen so
that's going to continue to happen until
we change the structure it's just a
necessary evil and there was a quite a
few good comments about how to organize
the many lists filtering top posting
don't include everything don't include
the entire last week's digest some
comments about various people policies
about officers discussions or cross
posting for example this week and there
were some comments about the website and
the perennial stuff pops up about you
know clarify the topic well in advance
publicize it the location the time that
sort of stuff various comments about the
aesthetics positive and negatives some
people love cloned they want to use it
some people don't some people want V
calendaring and many people don't care
as long as the website simply
communicates the information and timely
way some people suggested creating a
community space on one of the whoops on
one of the one of the social networking
sites and and again some people want to
do that and some people some people
would like to show who their network to
and have a link to their website and
some people don't for privacy reasons
and stuff so this is probably not
relevant since we're not organized
enough to be able to do this stuff so we
should probably pass over that gently
and stuff I learned from running the
survey and from bottom to top explain to
people why they should care why they
should answer it what's what's what's in
it for them to help us orient this if
you don't get a high response rate so
you have to bribe people to get a
representative survey and you've got to
get enough detail out of them to
understand what what what they really
want so what I found is the closed form
at questions where you ask people to
choose are hit and miss if you really do
your homework and you find out what
people say top 30 topics are then you
can get a good answer but if you know if
you give them an open format and say
what are the top three actions that you
would like to see the group take or that
you will personally volunteer to take in
the next year you can get some much more
focused answers so as I say question
design it's not trivial some people
complain about SurveyMonkey itself
whoever whoever wants to volunteer to
run the survey next time it runs
whenever that is can you can bypass the
limitations but you can only ask people
so many questions with so much level of
detail sort of sweet spot is maybe
twenty or something so if anybody
actually wants to write a survey engine
which would be a cool and neat thing to
do and is actually quite non-trivial so
if it's capable of handling sequel and
generating HTML output so it was a
suggestion I can see I can see the
volunteers are lining up to and the
girders and then there is a sort of
matted discussion and this is the sort
of thing that if this happens on the
list then it sort of it irritates some
people or if it happens at meetings then
people say there wasn't a consensus and
they don't know what's happening so so
I'm simply going to state based on
people's comments that there's no
there's no formal mechanism for making
decisions of legally speaking there is
no bae piggies as Dennis was pointing
out with respect to
the pie con 2008 proposal that Russell
is looking into so the pie con 2008 the
pie come 2008 proposal that's right okay
Alvin sorry okay my mistake yeah so but
legally speaking we don't exist to what
extent that matters we got some useful
feedback from rich Morin who is a guy
who only comments on the list and he's
very active in a bunch of scripting cigs
and he pointed me to Rick Moens essay on
linux mafia com about how to organize
your linux user group but he had some
good comments and he's saying you know
you need as much or as little structure
as people want and at your targeted to
their needs so you know if pizzas and
raffles are what attracts them then two
pizzas and raffles and if you want to
full shebang 20-page charter with
corporate officers then then do that but
so that that was a comment but you can
see everything and everything in that
list has a question mark after it so I'm
still I'm still not not aware that
there's a consensus other than a large
number of people voice criticisms but
then you go back to them and say okay
how would you make the group better and
then you get them miscellaneous and
answers but when one of the most common
complaints made by people who are on the
list but don't come to the meeting so
it's do we have to just universally
discuss everything can we delegate maybe
we shouldn't can we appoint leaders with
defined their responsibilities is the
whole thing non scalable so is it is it
order of N squared to the number of
people in the group the number of
discussions that can break out and so
this is Rick Moens essay and some some
comments about off topic list volume and
if that was a necessary evil if it if it
really means people are plotting against
each other or simply that some
discussions are not worth or educational
enough to be put on the list and then
there was a matter discussion about do
we need and do we need to split into a
bay piggies announced a bit for the
people who aren't multiple say
or only come to the Bay Area rarely and
only one to know when's the meeting on
what's the topic Bay Peggy's jobs for
people who aren't interested don't need
to subscribe an internal organized list
or something like that and people who
actually want to talk about Python them
so then some some further principles
based on what people said since we never
since since the group doesn't legally
exist and since we never said what our
Charter is and what our aims are and
what they aren't then there is
necessarily difference of opinion about
what they should be and is this a
technical group is that social
networking is it both do we which
community are we serving do we have a
charter to have say newbies evening
every so every now and then you know but
also we don't want to if we want to have
expert talks as well do we encourage you
know how do we encourage new speakers at
some something that used to be done was
it was good for participation personally
I think it was it was pretty cool and as
I mentioned things like book reviews or
code snippets are a great way to get
somebody to present something new and
tell everybody who they are and then the
the controversial opinion meetings are
never canceled for lack of technical
content which is something we flirted
with in the last few months so I'm sure
everybody has a different opinion about
that one and then I quoted some flippant
and completely useless thoughts
everybody agreed something somebody
should do something about it in the end
nothing happened which which is a
principle and has a title d collusion of
anonymity which is very impressive and
the alternative the Ashanti proverb two
men in a burning house must not stop to
argue you can decide for yourself if
that's completely irrelevant so what did
we learn well we still know the topics
of interest but since then so some of
them being hit some of them haven't some
of them were opportunistic for example
it was great that the the Django guys
came to town so that was pretty neat
should we focus on things that we know
are of interest to people and haven't
been addressed before
or perennial favorites where we know
that we have we have hardcore of
speakers who can talk about something
that we know will be interesting who is
responsible for inviting speakers is
that each of us or should we delegate
this should we have some defined program
managers and so dennis is handing over
to Jim right so it's a sort of ongoing
question whether we should mix up the
format whether we should keep it as is
whether we should try two or more
speakers on the same topic or on
different topics depending on the
popularity and the perennial stuff about
logistics which is you know nailed down
the meeting early to find the speaker to
find the topic to find the agenda
communicated to everybody so that for
example people who want to carpool from
Auckland don't get annoyed because the
thing has changed at the last minute
stuff like that so obviously I'm
violating that so and then another
question which isn't really satisfactory
dealt with so identify where volunteers
needed who we need to do what so
volunteering for a talk at inviting
other people that sort of stuff and so
also other things like the doing app
icon 2008 bid is going to sort of hit
the same the same question how many
people do you need to to make a certain
activity happen so to recap the the
point of the exercise was understand who
is the member base where is it going
what do people want what are their
interests you know what level of
organizations they want and what they
needed to do where do we go from here
which is just it's it's as much an open
question really as as when I threw it
out and to now maybe let's have the
interactive discussion part so we have
about 30 people here tonight
one the speaker repeat whatever is asked
and to the questions yeah cool so
anybody got a question tennis okay but
this is not so much a question but an
alternate interpretation of one of the
sides where you talk about what people
are interested in first let me note that
the questions were asked basically
before I've started organizing sessions
so the list of complaints against me
would be different you know they aren't
up there yet and so maybe that will come
out and discussion I go back one more or
the format yes it huh yes um or the
format I think doesn't that yes I i I'd
interpret this as saying that there's
very strong interest in technical
presentations let's take out mix of all
of the above temporarily the top for the
top for the remain them are all
presentation or educational in nature
and the ones that are at the bottom are
all social many on many kinds of
interactions so that you see that if we
can take out mix of all of the above
that the professional presentation rise
to the top and the many on many fall to
the bottom now let's put mix of all of
the above back in I think that that you
you would need to apportion that by
what's risen to the top and what's
fallen to the bottom they aren't all
equal and I think that my interpretation
is that this preference for technical
presentations does anybody else want to
comment to that
yeah sure can you go to the mic please
Chuck occasion yeah sure sure so what is
the numerical scale of this table it's
an arbitrary ranking from a survey
monkey so basically for would be is of
extreme interest to everybody and one
means none at all so so three means very
interested in 1.83 means not reading you
know you know but you know just to point
out I mean these are not exclusive I
mean you can you know you can have a you
know beer and Python bash meet up at the
thirsty bear in san francisco on a
saturday and that's you know it's not
like everybody's fighting for the one
hour time slot a month or 90 minutes 30
so I'm totally new to this so I'm two
questions I guess did you ask how people
found it is because it seems very random
you know how people find this then which
of course is as it should be but it's
interesting to see how many people find
the website or you know is a word of
mouth and stuff like that and the other
thing is have you guys seen growth I saw
there was growth on the mailing list on
subscribers has that growth been
reflected in the actual at Annisa just
hers innovation don't think here as well
as on the Mentalist in the meeting
attendance yeah yeah kind of I mean so
that you know you can't get the
historical server logs previous 2006 but
it's kind of increasing exponentially
would sorta okay cups do you want to
tell us how you personally found a group
I did through Nami trouble Stoddard
Project Hope law also started a project
called plum okay sure dramatic over oh
so I heard it from which Morris I guess
he used to live in the Bay Area and I'm
sure he's been here a couple times hmm
he said you should really go to Bay
piggies not that you were at Google so
all right yeah sure I mean there's there
certain packages that are Python centric
that you know or or Ruby centric or you
know there are people who are sort of
agnostic and it's like the package
attracts people to the language so you
know I was even talking to
a friend of mine recently and saying
have you considered using clone and he
basically said I don't I don't care what
language it's based on as long as I
don't have to write any code and I mean
he can code but he just didn't want to
so you know so yeah it's not a bad
question would be well worth yeah sure
Russ
I'd like to speak in favor extremely of
the snippets another organization i have
been to is called the SP glug and they
have existed a thing called nifty of the
month about which unfortunately I think
has faded away to my disappointment but
I sort of see snippets and nifty of the
month as similar things and they're
short and you can possibly even write
them down and maybe even use them huh
that like American Python Idol yeah we
need we need a sarcastic English judge
and substance taking dancer rebuttal no
yes seriously that's it's it's like the
question people ask about that is do you
just set a line in the sand and say
we're having snippets evening in April
you know come hell or high water and
everybody get cracking or what i mean so
if so if we said tonight we're having
snippets evening in april so anyway
every month one one thing so this sort
of the yeah i mean it could be popular
you know the traditional i'm sorry yeah
so a snippet evening where you have 25
minutes no concern right one each night
yeah and I mean at least historically
you know they sort of bundle them all
together no I mean there's yeah this
pros and cons it's if you know if we
want to let's we we can suggest
organizing it and you know get one
person next month and see how it goes
get a reaction jagiya can you go back to
the list of topics that people are
interested in uh-huh
please yeah sure so for first of all if
you haven't already done this it'd be
good to maybe repost this or summary of
this although it's a really long list of
topics yeah you know which is maybe good
for getting people to if they haven't it
one of these they might want to give to
talk about getting interested but it
also it seems to me you might want to
have a smaller list of topics sort of
yeah I mean in fact the original one is
twice as long and i had to amalgamate
them yeah Vegas yeah you know again I
don't want to give you the job or anyone
the job of having to redo a survey but
it's sort of like you know are
interested in Python web technologies
versus Python you know data you know
technologies or whatever sure if anybody
can help me I was trying to sort it to
distill this hose I was asking the
question so if you did do cigs so there
is you know there's web framework folks
there's you know core technologies you
know there's language fundamentals thurs
let's say XML there's animation there's
numerical scientific engineering usage
you know and then there's you know other
things like say packaging distribution
so yeah it would be it would be neat to
distill this into subcategories but you
know please help me send me a comment or
I'll put this out on the list within the
next few days please do send me your
feedback on that yeah I have a so i'll
probably post to the list as well
because i have a sort of a few ideas for
either topics i might want to give or
talk about or just get people to give me
some feedback and maybe get other people
to talk about them some of it which is
like this like snippets type related
things as well as other other things but
i was wondering if we have anyone hasn't
has by the way my name is chad i I'm a
longtime sort of attendee of these
meetings but I've been gone for over a
year so I'm sort of back recently but
dumb and I'm very interested to see all
that's changed in the past year so I'm
now throughout my question
but what was it no wait it's not we
decided to become the Ruby interest
group and what so actually Ruby by the
way having been away for a year you know
I come back and there's a lot of
interest in Ruby now Ruby is yeah along
with python is sort of really growing by
leaps and bounds it's getting a lot of
attention that would be frankly a very
good topic if someone who is sort of
knows rubens looking to python or vice
versa I'm actually I'm looking for some
of those things i'm doing i'm thinking
porting him to ruby sure pay to get used
to rupee and just be because it maps so
well it sort of like if you have a good
idea in python why not do the same thing
in Ruby yeah Ruby on Rails keeps coming
up and people be sayin hey somebody
should give a talk about Ruby and rails
I don't know why it doesn't happen you
I've noticed i think the very last item
on that list if you go down you go to
pages on is pearl yeah but just again
right so this is this is where i was
going to serve like calculate not it's
not just the mean you know the standard
deviation so what that really means is
there's you know there's a bunch of
people who use it or have to use it
after be multilingual like any and other
people i know and you know a lot of web
people you know you're forced to do this
you know or you want to use libraries
that don't exist aren't mature or stable
so you know some people do use it
necessarily and some people don't you
know so one crossover topic i was
suggesting is pearl to python migration
and there's actually a pretty okay book
on that which i think is in its second
edition yeah you know so actually so now
I remember sort of us talking about as a
do we have sort of a good idea of what
people have honestly proposed maybe for
the upcoming few months to sometime this
year to actually talk about and be it
would be nice or be interesting maybe to
have you know everyone's willing to talk
about the kinds of things they'd like to
see it you know a talk on but without
necessarily committing people sort of be
nice to say well like you know to you
know if you're interested in
contributing what could you conceivably
talk about without committing to
actually doing a talk yet but like what
think about starting my likely if you
were force and someone said you have to
give a talk on Wednesday it's your moral
duty what would you talk about yeah I
know and sort of getting a list of what
those you know what in other words what
what
what what skill sets and knowledge and
so forth what you know experiences and
that do you know comprise the people in
this group who could present and yeah I
think I would help to sort of maybe
narrow some of these things down and
start to get it more concrete and
getting actual talks scheduled and done
and so forth yeah no totally and I mean
you know one of the ways I was trying to
narrow it down is give people here's the
top 10 list of topics we know where if
general interest that haven't been
covered so you know you can you can read
them off here so I see that you know in
the pie charts you know we have sort of
like fifty percent of people i think
renew to python and just going to kind
of want to network and find out more
about it and then you have met fifty
percent people who maybe use Python at
work or just a bit using a long time
yeah might be able to use sort of these
advanced topics and so forth I know that
beginners would love to hear advanced
topic discussions even if its seemingly
over their heads but at same time you
know getting people to do beginner level
talks is sometimes difficult you know a
lot of people appear if you think you're
you know you have all these really neat
stuff you're doing don't want to come in
and sort of go over the basics but I
think they're there is some interest in
people it's kind of going back to this
Ruby versa Python so why do I use Python
what I love Python a lot of people are
coming in sort of saying i think i love
python and you know but I haven't you
know I looked at all the library
features I don't know what they do you
know those types of talks I suppose
they're hard to get scheduled but anyway
the point is I think it's you know I'm
certainly what now that I'm back we've
started willing to help as well as I can
but you know getting concrete on talks
or in our actual talks proposed for the
year and then starting to schedule at
least getting people thinking about what
they're going to talk about is no it's
worthwhile it would be nice to I know
you would say but you know it'd be nice
to be able to say that for the month of
februari orator March we have two talks
lined up if one person can't make it we
have the other person sure if one goes
over you know you know or you know these
types of things you want to always be
ahead of the game
and I think if things have grown as much
as they have I think it's we're getting
to that point where we could should be
able to have people who can talk yeah
look at me I can talk it like tonight
sure so anyway I'm done no I bring
Dennis wants to god I'd like to point
out an opportunity which we didn't see
when this survey was taken which I think
really affects what we said is our goal
and that opportunity is that we now
appear to be videotaping and
distributing these talks on a regular
basis it took a while to kind of get in
the groove so that the talks would
actually get videotaped as Stephen well
knows because this his first talk wasn't
wasn't videotaped and you know just sort
of slipped through but we're pretty much
now in a groove and what that means is
that we can have worldwide
english-speaking scope right in other
words if someone can understand English
bacon they can download the video and
watch it of the technical presentation
so that gives us an opportunity to
evangelize and teach on a scope that was
simply unavailable to us before and I
think that we really ought to be
factoring that in to what we attempt
yeah at Social Register yeah look look
look at the URL when you run this and
that's who's that's who's doing that
they've a thing I think they prohibit
using the google name right everybody
I'm Wesley I've been a member of vaping
since 1999
we were meeting in San Francisco does
anybody remember those days up in that
city yeah up in the city you should have
to drive all the way up there now people
in terms of stuff the drywall were down
here it's kind of interesting but to
follow on Dennis's comments that because
we're video tape now the location thing
doesn't really mean as much anymore even
if you can't make it you can't at least
watch the videos but yeah we're so we're
missing 1999-2000 but you're we were up
in the city for a while it's quite
interesting so as far as talks are
concerned the easy months to schedule
our februari March and August did you
guys know that because of pike on pike
on happens at the end of februari so
usually the februari talk is always it's
a warm-up for people that have to give
talks at PyCon so we usually have three
four five I think last year wasn't this
one in iron for where we were in the
dark people mostly on board giving the
previews of their toxin and the power
went out at ironport so we were doing it
in the dark that was probably the most
interesting one of the most interesting
means you've ever had a great Python
kiss Jace are important yes right and
and March is easy because someone's
going to give a wrap-up talk on what
happened at PyCon for all those people
that missed it and although the o'reilly
oskin isn't as popular as Pike on in our
community but there there is a Python
track at OSCON and so in August we
usually have a wrap up of what happened
at the Python track in Oz con so those
three months are pretty easy so we
should be done for februari march for
this year as long as we have volunteers
who who are giving talks at PyCon to
come top next month give a preview of
their talk just a warm-up for it and
some volunteers to come back with the
write-up of what happened at
icon and I think in April I don't know
if you guys were open to this but I
think Alex myself and oz have
volunteered to give a panel on
experiences writing a technical book on
Python and all the trials and
tribulations that that that brings forth
we were throwing them around ourselves
and discussing when is oz going to be
able to make a meeting and so he said
April would be the first month that he
can make so I'm going to try and hold
him to that but that's something that's
kind of interesting that's not technical
but you know everybody specializes in a
field other than Python and if you have
the interest or the urge to write it'd
be interesting to hear what other people
say about it so didn't do we do we in
fact ever anything March March should be
the summary of my con so somebody should
volunteer for that okay I mean I can
fall it well it's really easy to say
someone should volunteer for it if you
know but having an actual volunteers is
a little bit more difficult because
people don't you know are pretty shy I
mean I could give a summary but I can
only give a summary of the talk psycho
to you know so you know I'd be glad to
do that so deep yeah who is going to
python did you guys get all my message
today so we have about Rick great early
bird registration is ending its nice
okay so there's four people so drove us
at least four people that can at least
say you know a quick 10 minutes you know
talk about a quick timis about the talk
that they weren't too is anyone here
giving a talk at pi cons to see if we
can fill out our februari calendar hmm
okay right okay that's fine too
especially if there's no speakers on I'm
not camping atop this year I'm maybe
giving a tutorial which I could turn
into a for this if you guys are all
interested but on gtalk i see i'll be
discussing win32 how to do comm client
programming how to connect to excel and
word and outlook and all that kind of
stuff it's not you know a lot of people
don't like to talk about non open source
software at these meetings but you know
if if you have to play with windows in
your work environment it's kind of good
information to know so I can always give
a talk if there is always a need for
talk I have like 20 talks that I've
filed a way that I can always pull out
in an emergency so I'm always a willing
volunteer as long as my wife lets me
come yeah okay it's not gonna be that
bad I actually have talks I mean if we
have to get really really bad ivan i
created a talk on how to play craps okay
i have a full power point in graphics
and everything as well as a
demonstration spread so i have all kinds
of interesting times no but we do have a
user that lives there you see Michael on
the main enlist he actually lives and
works in Vegas I used to have a house
there so we're pretty familiar with that
area you're just trying to make a text
to dr. orange I'm just saying that
there's so many topics just look at your
slides I mean you should have 12 months
easily just young one page alone yeah so
it's just getting people to volunteer
you know and not be shy or have stage
fright you know think of it as
toastmasters kind of a thing it's of
course I'm saying this because I've been
teaching for 20-some odd years so I know
I'm fairly comfortable in front of a
microphone but now it's a good way to
break out of that shell because nobody
knows who you really are you can pretend
to be
somebody else and just talk about
something that you're working on you
know whether it be were professional
hobby you know everybody has an interest
and everybody has a specialty in some
area even if it's strange all right or
what do you think it's strange other
people may not in vice versa yeah I mean
I had two thoughts about how to make you
know how to make it reality and so you
know so the first is start them off by
saying 5 10 or 15 minute talk you know
snippet flash flash tool book review
whatever and you know get a bunch of
people get like six people in the
evening and then people would say I
really want to see this person present
again and the other thing is something
I'd suggested which sounds trivial would
just advertise whether the level is you
know expert advanced beginner
intermediate or universal so for example
I had an experience where I invited
somebody to one of our talks and I
thought it sounded like a newbie talk
but it turned out and to begin to to be
really really advanced my friend wasn't
even he's not a Python programmer and he
said can it really be dis complicated so
it actually negatively evangelized him
to go off and find a new language which
was kind of depressing for me but so
hence that's why I'm suggesting
advertised the level that's expected of
people and if you know if you letter you
know the argument in favor of saying
let's have a new bees and snippet
evening is saying you know new new users
are encouraged you're welcome people
aren't going to laugh at you if you
don't know what the command to read a
line from standard input is bring all
your friends bring people you want to
evangelize you know so that's one aren't
you ken yeah johnny is the mic
that if a lot of people are interested i
can probably throw together a
five-minute lightning talk on a little
kind of a module to get started on
writing at wxpython app in about 15
minutes the talk would be five minutes
and run your application if I take about
15 minutes okay so I kit comes out in
true that and me yeah I'm today to do it
sorry but you have time today to do it
or show you do it another time do we
have time to look for more are you
prepared yeah sure I can I can throw
together weekend okay can do what do you
think it's 820 so we're kind of okay
because that would be proud of you in
and the other part of it is that there's
there's nothing on this know for sure so
maybe I didn't but we let the discussion
run until we stop and yes yeah yes so
yeah if the discussion and soon then
maybe okay
I'd like to introduce myself my name is
Jim um I don't want to bore you all I
keep it brief but I think I should
introduce myself um wonder what I should
say so Jonathan jim jim has kindly
volunteered to be the organizer well I
volunteered to help and I want to say I
think it's important you know I'm not a
coder on I like engineers and talking to
engineers a lot and I'm really want to
be supportive of open source generally I
just want to add my little help as my
I'm a little ant joining on the other
hand i push it in with respect to this
group the kinds of things I can do is to
call people up email kind of try to get
it together remind them they're supposed
to be there for the meeting when I read
supposed to be I've got a rather
extensive experience and docs so I I
could help you with this day of Kerry I
can help organize I did a lot of
training so I can help with that if
that's what I can't come to every
meeting I don't know anybody who's that
python Dakota except for two women I
don't know who uses Python what
enterprises except for clung on but I do
want to help so the expectation i'm
hoping the set is that you'll use me as
your helping you'll get him let me know
what's going on and coordinate and but
work that way i think i've talked to
them sure and i mean i agree they you
know actually a review of which
companies are pythonic where is it being
used now what are the killer packages is
a great start point to talk to me hello
everyone my name is lee was how I think
of as he was talking about me who study
here a lot of times but never said
anything and I probably now I'm the only
in this room anyways I used to be a
research scientist for a chemical
intelligent the instrument company and
I've done a lot of programming in matlab
lat bu and C++ the reason i was using
python is because there are some air
with them they research field that was
seen is common metrics so there are many
pattern recognition type of algorithms
that i want to develop and share it with
other person other people but i don't
want to use any commercial or something
to take me too time-consuming so I read
probably only two or three kind of
algorithms that I used a late for like
principal component analysis partially
square analysis seen Cal metrics to
separate component in solution but
that's um but signal processing library
stuff yeah yes and then after I wrote it
I realized that somebody else already
wrote it and I couldn't I take it in
Python um yes in Python and Nam now i'm
working for dash navigation and it's a
gps company a lot of things were written
in perl in the last of the list so i was
thinking i could wrap it up using python
or you know someone could give me some
tips on that so that's about me my
feelings for this group I wish it could
be more educational because I've been
here a lot but my most impressed
presentation was given by Alex at the
foothill college because that's the most
technical one he was talking about the
iterator and I think I learned a lot
from that person
they could do a lot more like that here
I think the reason that so we are not
doing too many of that is because people
taking the technical presentation too
seriously it doesn't need to be it could
be people like Nestle or rush Russell
they're doing Python every day and i'm
pretty sure that they have something new
to share every day just like little
stuff I'm doing this module and there's
something that I I haven't noticed that
haven't used but it's really cool it
could be just several minutes of sharing
of their daily job for experts let them
like them it would be really helpful for
us newbies and because i did ways to
some of the time just because i don't
know there's something out there and i
didn't bother to do this research sure
yeah i mean when you say educational you
mean to find out who's working on a part
and wanted what's a cool package yeah
what's new out there what do you learn
today even little bitty you know small
things like ghost using google's
bathroom and there's you know the things
you could lend on a toilet seat so talk
about testing on the toilet i call it
yeah little tips yes that is really
educational and i really like that
because i was just reading at and I i
think it's a it's good thing to know and
you know just spend a few minutes here
and there by listening to experts we can
now more about you know unit testing or
or whatever things that I never heard
and I could adjust the pointers pointing
me to this that side I'll pointing me to
this resource for that I will just you
know now it's out there and now I need
to spend effort to know more about it
sure um so yeah I mean what you know
some things that have been tried or talk
too bad for that I mean it'll be great
to have little
um brainstorm like that for like maybe
10 minutes I as a routine either experts
or new bag whoever has been doing hide
down that meant and have little things
to share yeah that's okay sure yeah so I
mean you know Dennis had introduced
mapping at the end of the meetings if
you've been to the previous meetings
where anybody who mapping mapping means
at the end of the meeting people who
have an interest or a shared interest or
looking for people or want to solve a
certain problem will tell people and say
so if you know how to do this and this
package come and talk to me you know
which was it was good at link making
those links you know the other
suggestion was if if we were all on some
sort of a social network then you can
index your name against your interests
and your activity your day job great
that sort of stuff um and also I'm just
a new to the navigation system type of
programming so if anyone here is a
expert on GPS like Python graph I
haven't done my research yet because I
was overwhelmed learning the stuff new
stuff but if anyone who is really
familiar with using Python to develop
graph and maps I would love that if you
could introduce yourself to me and all
right so let it come
it's awesome I was ok so maybe if you
someday DreamWorks sure I think maybe
someday you can have the presentation on
GPS see if you are going to do one and
probably happy year or couple month I
can do one so that we hear something we
can contribute yeah I mean you know GPS
as long as those those topics its
interest you know of interest to a small
bunch of people so if you advertised it
well in advance and cross posted it to
other lists so it's kind of it's you
know it's independent of the language so
yeah and actually our dash navigation
gps is the special one because we have
internet connection Wi-Fi transfer from
the GPS to danger to your desktop and
from desktop sin ti address in
interpretation yeah I mean so if you can
drag one of your marketing folks along
to give us sir yeah you can search yahoo
the advantage of y dash is better right
find the cheapest gas station around you
and did so Wesley points out that if you
want to cross post you have to use the
special secret protocol yeah okay that's
me finally introducing myself thank you
one that
LSD was talking about trying to get me
to introduce myself okay cool right
that's re this dude can you tell us your
name please I'm sorry can you talk to
him your name please yes my name is
alexander lee me so I thought I'd longer
proper introduction instead of just
mentioning that I found it Paul
godfather so um mine history with Python
kind of goes back to when soap came out
I started doing so around 1998-99 and I
couldn't figure it out so i started
doing user interfaces and status which
is what google has hired me to do so i
don't actually do any python a google
which is interesting I don't really know
any Python I can read Python but I I
don't really do it because there are so
many good programmers out there that do
it way better than I do but but i love
the fact that i can actually read what
they do and that's a huge you know bonus
to me as a UI designer because i can go
down and i can say you know I think
let's build a bee tree that gives me
this information and you know I can see
what kind of information they're giving
me back and I can construct you I on
that and if I'm missing anything I know
that this is possible by doing this in
Python so um for the more history um for
some reason we ended up implementing
content management application on Toppa
so i knows oh is this kind of weird
parallel universe for most Python people
which I don't blame you zoeb to is
really really really a weird parallel
universe there's a new version of zope
out now has been out for a year or two
and officially which is of three which
is more like a collection of python
modules which makes much more sense
currently clone is moving everything
from soap to part way over to sub 3 so
we're in the interesting position where
we were making a lot
money on plum it's very much a business
compatible thing one of the classic
things I say you know if you want to do
Python for a living DuPont you know and
then actually it's sorry that that's a
you know that's a non-trivial questions
a lot of you know a lot of people are
asking right you know python is neat and
all that but yeah you know how do i how
do i check the date and find something
that I can do for a living exactly so so
one of the things I keynoted pycon last
year with Alan which is the other guy
who started a long and it's pretty
strange to be you know keynoting pipe
icon and I don't know if I thought so so
that was an interesting experience we
mostly talked about non Python stuff I
like I don't know phone is kind of we
call ourselves a j2ee liberation army
because a lot of our people that do poem
now used to be in these huge companies
June j2ee and did I mention I would know
some example so i do harder it's an
example so so one of the things we've
done is that you know we've shaken up
that space a little bit and people that
are you know themselves or with a friend
or something like that they started
company and two years later there are 30
people doing plone full-time you know so
it's an interesting approach and i was
poking to guido a lot about this or not
a lot but we discussed it to how you
know phone becomes a gateway drug to
python just like so used to be a gateway
drug but at this point soap is to
framework e for people to work what they
they want instant gratification they
want something running in five minutes
yeah it gives it the no code five minute
killer application it's often yeah so as
Ruby on Rails this is so which is a
different approach that's more like
building it from the bottom up or
building from the top down we give you
something in their works and then you go
oh this almost sounds my problem you
know and then you stop digging and then
you're like oh Python you know okay so
so that's an interesting other approach
for bringing I believe you have some
people here that have come to python
through bone which which
it makes me very happy because what I
always says to say to people you know
even if we end up not using clone right
stick with Python it's great you know
yeah I'm here to use buona notte but
keep watch on you know oh you're right i
mean that's a question we must start
asking this like you know did you come
did you come for a killer application or
you know you're well aware of what
python is but like you know terminal
disenchantment with tickle or pearl or
was there a killer library right you
know so we had an interesting situation
sorry if I'm rambling we have had a
parade where a lot of people came to
clone because they wanted to build web
applications because this was before
Django 20 bergÃ¨re stuff like that so we
we kind of took all those people at that
point they came through pone for some
reason just because it did something out
of the box and now that Django and turbo
gears are here I'm super happy both
about those and ruby on rails because
earlier on we had so many people that
were trying to not do content management
and they came to blown and I like I want
to build an issue tracker you know and
of course you can build an issue tracker
in plone but you shouldn't you know if
that's the only thing you were building
you can use that so exactly so but but
it is it is a very like specific problem
solving thing is a very broad problem
but but it's still there's a lot of
stuff I love sending people to turbo
gears or to django now because they are
not trying to solve our problem and it
makes the world better if we're both in
the rights slot so oh so for example I
know this is the missing you know case
study evangelism zone I know people who
downloaded soap and played with it or
looked at in and scratch their heads for
two weeks and chucked it because they
didn't know how to you know do hello
world mm-hmm you know and you know it
happens and you know unless you have
that you know in the last mile then you
don't connect with the potential
audience and they all go off to so no c
sharp or something yeah so so why I'm
here I mean I don't necessarily want to
learn about decorators I appreciate that
but there but I want to just you know
get a feeling for what's going on in
part
also bring poem closer to python we've
had a lot of people lately coming from
Python into the phone world and a lot of
people as subtle with bone have become
you know python experts because they
really liked what they found so that
whole time that closer together making
everything more saying more lightweight
more modular stuff like that which is
happening but as of three transition
with bunk yeah so that's like the
evolution of soap and blown kind of
ended the evolution of so you know like
the best thing they did was to rewrite
that thing it took forever but they the
people behind that application have this
amazing domain knowledge and they can
start fresh and and and not worry about
time because soap too is making us money
right now sorry will in future very few
frameworks are capable of doing that
stuff like we chose to not rewrite clone
from scratch because it would be insane
and you you can't do that so what we do
we switch out modules one at a time so
the next release will you know rip out
the internationalisation structure and a
couple of the other structures and
replace those the new components do the
same thing we have a very test heavy
culture which is also interesting which
is why we can modify the plane in flight
because we know the tests run ok so then
at least the application did what he
used to do you know and in theory of
course you know never have perfect test
coverage but that's a lot of I don't
know I know wait a little about Python
compared to what I should most of what I
know about Python i get from either you
know dito or funnily enough it's kiddo
that got me working here so it's an
attorney c++ what is it internally C++
yes it's time so anyway oh so what were
I think i can add something is you know
running a community that's what i've
been doing the last five years alone
running business on phone i started my
own company
three and a half years ago I guess which
is still running doing clone consultancy
but I mean the lessons they reply to any
Python consultancy or whatever I mean
organizing things like conferences brain
stuff like that we just had the plan
conference in Seattle we had 300 people
showing up which is interesting because
we're not that visible in the Python
world you know and there's still like a
massive audience out there because we do
different things than Python bus and
it's kind of the the broader your
application becomes some more people are
potentially interested in it but the
more complex the application defense so
right anyway so um I don't know anything
else you want to know about oh I'm from
my way I just moved to San Francisco so
yes yes no I've been here for about a
year but don't tell anyone officially I
i came to be as a couple of months ago
so I've been around but other just just
leaving every 90 days you can avoid a
videotape offer a solution will have to
censor that was it just to note in
passing I mean Eve even the you know the
fundamental question how do I make money
I don't make a stable livelihood out of
open source software sure I mean people
most a lot of people give the right arm
to know where you could answer to that
right so so that's one of the things
that I am really happy about bonus the
whole how many people have started their
own businesses based on it is it's just
astounding and it's so that's the thing
that makes me most happy about bonus how
many people we have empowered I guess to
to go and create their own businesses
and go through that how do I run a
business but at least they don't need to
worry about the how do i sell my
application they literally have people
buying their doors down to implement
because in the loan world right now
there is so much demand and so few
developers so it's it's a very fortunate
situation to be in and I can see how
it's harder to sell something like
Python because python is you know a
framework normal application so but what
I'm sure there are good ways of latching
on to a one other frameworks and in
Python and spending that in a way that
you actually sell you know something
useful I mean pick up Django pick up der
Berger's you can you know you can
essentially do anything you need to pick
something you can just put on your
website i will do anything with python
you know so that whole thing i don't
know i can probably add something there
or talk some about that and i'd be happy
to give talks about clone i'm not sure i
could give it in a technically
interesting way for you guys because at
a certain point i just say it just works
you know like I don't know why things
are built the way they are or stuff like
that i can i can give you the high level
overview which is essentially you know a
lot of times that's what you need to see
if you want to do is on us so so the
tape is is available now from donna's
first poem talk from last year right i
haven't actually seen represent ever I
know who she is but so we have there's
actually a lot of good videos up now
from the long conference on Polaroid so
if you're interested in you know
scratching the surface there is
especially one by that is called plum
for PHP people but I mean it could be
pop loan for any kind of people it goes
through a lot of the things that pwned
us in a very fun way the presenter is
amazing he's like he makes his drinks by
the end of his presentation you know
like I said he's just very laid-back and
talks about what plone does on a very
high level and how used it for his stuff
at NASA and stuff like that so ok cool
yep
see moresee very much louder all right
some of us have hardly seen a project
where there's a lead on the project's
who can not work on the code very much
hoping front rating follows but it's
very interesting to hear you talk about
this and I like to put that in your talk
look like how that's changed things and
cut I'm sure you ask for things
different way than you actually were
thinking about the suffering of the
owner who had to do them sure that one
so um do some of the comparison between
Python cologne in what type of
application this is better okay so just
for the tape his question was probably
one of the few project leaders that
don't actually do code so Ashley I do
write a little bit of Python but it's
mostly like you know this is a list I
don't want to list let me make it a you
know string stuff like that it is super
turbo but but just the fact that I can
do it as a UI designer is pretty cool
from a you know that prospective and and
she wanted comparisons between things so
i'll just say up front that one of the
notoriously difficult things to do with
bone is to compare it with anything
because it's not on any of those levels
and any of the things that i would
compare plone to you haven't heard of
its things like you know on the high end
you have documentum and vignettes and
those kind of things you have a red dot
you have other content management
systems you don't really say you know
this is blown and this is PHP PHP is on
a totally different level but but I'll
try I mean there are a lot of things
that if you see these patterns in your
problem yes you need a content
management system you know if you if you
don't see them probably pawn is nothing
so I can try to do something like that
or from you know from the end-user
perspective like I just want my site to
do XY and z yeah so so our example dot
Donna was showing us how you want to you
want to have a discussion you want to
add a discussion you know box on the end
of their an article yep so that's one of
the key selling points right from her
point of view so what he was talking
about is also how I mean clone is driven
from two things essentially business
needs like if a business comes to us and
say we want pone to do this hopefully
that will get merged back if it's
generally useful and the other thing is
end user driven I used to do a lot of
training which is an excellent way of
doing paid user testing until
of this you get paid really well to see
how people screw up with your
application which is amazing you know
you stand there and you like how how on
earth could they not get that you know
like you spend like hours constructing
this thing and then the tiniest thing
trips them up and all your fantastic
work flow and magnificent you I doesn't
get used because they don't get past
that one little brick that is in the
road that they could just you know step
over or you know ignore and that's
pretty sobering experience I don't know
how much easier testing you've done of
your applications but just you know put
in front of your your mom or your
girlfriend or whatever and just see what
they do with and it's just amazing to
see how how about if I sit and you know
drive application subway it's an
interesting way to 0 so we you know
there's there's a bit too much time
alone so I mean there's definitely a
critical mass and there's there's a
different right on two different ways to
come at it conserve to other frames so
what one of the things I always
mentioned this will be my last thing
sauce trophy cane and scarier it is just
how big it is like we have 200
developers which a lot of people have no
idea that we have that many people
working you know that there is about 500
add-on products which is insane and a
lot of them are bad you know which is a
huge problem because you people install
randomly you've seen people with
computers right they install anything
that is downloadable and installable and
when you do that with a something that
runs your website's thanks a bunch of
them so a lot of interesting things with
eggs and stuff like that we're trying to
move two eggs I would like to know more
about eggs stuff like that so that's a
lot yeah
yeah so I was going to suggest we got a
couple of people waiting to come so yes
you know anything anything be ready
spoken we want to make a brief comment
about who they are and what they want
out of the group what the great hi my
name is Mark got a I had a very deep
immersion bye-bye what was the trial by
fire with Python a couple years ago when
i joined oseph and became one of the
build engineer for the chandler project
i had not worked in python at all i was
struggling with pearl which I thought
was one of the most arcane and bizarre
languages I've ever encountered in over
35 years of programming but Python I
picked up in a snap and I found it
really extremely flexible and versatile
and just really easy to understand now
i'm back i'm out of hosea fat i'm
working another company and trying to
struggle to see how i can put the the
build system that we've got currently
into the kind of a rapper that that ocf
was using and i'm curious to know if
there are other build engineers in the
audience here that might want to share
some ideas and i just like to hear about
all the wonderful things that people can
do is with python and so i put it in a
plug for my other interests which
happens to be a nonprofit that helps to
support people with a DD and ADHD which
i find that a lot of really clever and
creative people happen to have this
particular affliction and there's
there's relief for us so if anybody
wants to learn about that come see me
afterwards thank you yeah i mean i was
going to comment to me I think build
automation it's one of those key things
that's breaking through you know it's
not the world's most sexy topic so you
don't get keynotes about it but there's
a lot of people out there doing it and
if we can get them to share their
experiences that would be great
I'd like to very briefly switch business
card sort of contact information with
any of the those who might want to speak
so I can coordinate okay so is there
anybody else going once before we close
anybody who wants to Kim can't come
briefing mapping announcement I said
that I'd be here with a job opportunity
for people of game programming
experience we won't write an icon and
you know yeah the ICC internet chess
club it's somebody so let me know okay
so if if we're going to move to the
mapping them on clothes out of this I'll
put the slides up and the sequel and
dennis is now going to briefly chair
this who's here for the first time all
right basically what we do is I'm not
this is empty what we're doing now is
mapping where we stand up give very
short 30 second or so announcements
operable to a
just a few words indicating what your
interests are what you would like to
talk with other people about this is not
your home page this is not your mission
statement is just a mountain to butcher
the rest of it so we do rapid fire and
break it
