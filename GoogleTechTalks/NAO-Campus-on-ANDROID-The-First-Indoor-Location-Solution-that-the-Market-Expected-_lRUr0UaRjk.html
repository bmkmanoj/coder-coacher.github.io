let me just briefly introduce Phillipe
Yan in the post our team so we the
Android developer relations team which
I'm on we met Philippe at Mobile World
Congress at back in Barcelona in
February and that was when I first heard
about Philippe's kind of indoor location
technology and we were obviously really
excited about it and so you know things
have happened you know in over the past
couple months and now Philippe in yan
are here to talk about their technology
so with that young take it away thanks
Roman for the introduction and thanks
everyone to be for being here today
um so the topic of the day is called neo
campus that's the name of our technology
and as the title say we're gonna show
you it's actually you're ready and ready
for market and probably something you
want to hear about and use so brief
agenda of what it's gonna be about we do
a quick introduction and then we jump
straight into what it looks like how it
actually works we get a bit into details
about how you could interface with it in
terms of software interfaces and so and
so forth give you a few background
details about why we think it's a good
technology and then we'll open it up for
Q&amp;amp;A s and let you guys file your way as
much as you want okay so let's start
with the only bit that is not going to
be technology related which is why would
you want indoor positioning into
location is has been talked about a
great deal but here we are talking about
a real need that we are hearing from
customers especially in Europe but also
here as well and they really talk about
critical use cases like in big buildings
being able to orient themselves and you
know leverage the signaling potential
problems and so on and so forth and this
is real life stuff it's no longer
PowerPoint although you see it right now
but I'm gonna show you further and
better things to either it goes further
than that so the typical use cases we're
looking at on our side and we hope you
guys would be
stated about is how about you're at the
airport and you want to move around
you've got a little time between flights
what's the best place for you to go
how'd you cut it out and how do you make
sure you actually catch your plane and
leave it on time so that's some you know
typical standard stuff and the thing
we're really deeply looking into is
malls so commercial malls we we hear a
lot about from their owners who are keen
on actually getting closer relationship
to their customers make sure making sure
they get leads about what they are
interested in and how to make sure they
do some buy out and so on and so forth
and the from the users or the say the
mall visitors as they're concerned it's
again orientation and getting around
quickly so without further ado let's
jump into something that look that is
real what you're gonna see is a quick
recording of a what we call a demo it's
really narrow campus running live in a
mall somewhere in the United States I'm
not gonna be able to really tell you
where it is and we start with another
use case that's been proven by
applications available on the Android
Market which is where can I get the
restrooms so let me pose that right away
over there you have a restroom site and
again you're in a mall right now so
we're gonna switch out to your typical
Android phone running naio campus you
can see the position over there we are
walking around in a position of dates
and we're gonna go up to the restrooms
on the right-hand side here there we go
so you can see it's being pretty
accurate I would say we've got probably
in the order of 2 to 3 meters accuracy
here and again this is live running on
the phone so it's no longer just there's
PowerPoint it's real stuff so let's get
it out about what it brings what the
results we've got from our technology
are so the first thing is real accurate
position
with a high refresh rate I don't know if
you noticed that so let's check about
another quick movie about that so again
we're still on tomorrow we're working
from and through another place you can
see that we're following where we are
walking around about the way this is
just demo application it's not really
meant to be an application application
developers for us our customers and here
so we are really indoors so that means
we're essentially using the Wi-Fi
signals to do this and so we turn around
it's at the curler where we turn and
there you go it's just tracking your
every move isn't that okay the other
thing we're interested in is it's
indoors and one of the main constituents
of an in building is floors but just as
we have floors we want to transition
between them so let me show you that we
actually do that
so the position is over there in case
you're not seeing it clearly on the
video so this is again in a mall we're
taking the elevator slowly uh everything
is running in real-time so CP is not
overloaded we've got great smooth
transitions to the next floor is just
about now I think yep here we go alright
so let me pose there
so that's one of the things we want to
offer you guys and again that's a result
that's no longer just talking this is
what the technology does the next thing
is okay what about going out of the
building or going in the building well
that actually works so when you're
starting from let's say passes by way
just out of the building you're walking
around getting inside the building you
have a seamless transition from outside
to inside here it matters to us a lot
because it again it's tracking
seamlessly and we'll talk about that a
little bit in technology white stuff
okay so before we so we've got a GPS
expertise background overall and before
we set out for choosing Wi-Fi as a
technology for neo campus we just looked
around and so what's available and here
are the decision criteria we use to
choose Wi-Fi and we hope they make sense
to you as well the first is it's got an
absolute penetration what we mean by
that is it's present on all handsets for
which we need applications to be
downloadable and that includes 100% of
Android handsets there are other
technologies that are available there
but if you talk about UWB RFID and stuff
like that it didn't fit that category
that we needed and the next part is of
course you have a highly available
infrastructure with network operators
trying to go around saturation and the
cellular bands they deploy Wi-Fi
everywhere and so that's a trend that's
gonna stay for some time the next thing
that mattered a lot is this is still
free bands it's standard technology
already available so that really means
you just use the standard Wi-Fi chip no
modification it's only software it's
running inside so say if if we wanted to
leverage our GPS knowledge using GPS
positioning with pseudo lights we
couldn't do that without modifying the
hardware so that was a problem that we
Seok invented by using Wi-Fi and last
thing
again as you saw it's continuous
positioning so it's not like you go
through one place check-in and then you
move to another place tick and then you
you get positioned only on those places
now it's following you all the way
through okay so how does it work
really overall it's a hybridization of
GPS Wi-Fi and also maps processing I
would say what we really do is yes it's
about triangulation that's a good way to
see it but in details it's about
fingerprinting places and we've got I
mean our research team did a good job at
implementing the prove the proper
algorithms which use statistics motion
olace and so and so forth
there are applying to Wi-Fi especially
in order to get you this results and the
the main point I want to assess now is
not only disease use Wi-Fi but you can
go into places like malls where we've
seen you don't need to deploy any new
access point to get accurate positioning
so the movies you saw we're done without
adding any hardware to the place we went
we just had the phone scan use software
and you had the Polish name so one more
set of characteristics naio campus is
fully running on board right now so that
means we've got onboard calculations
we've got we call an onboard database
about the site where you do this and
it's as you see it's not using too much
CPU either so what's interesting is yeah
it goes quickly and smoothly throughout
every second if you want it to go every
second and
if we're coming back to integrating it
with your application what we're going
to propose right now is a library that
you can integrate within your app
directly and the way you do that is
really you use a service interface I'm
sure everyone in the audience knows
service interface so we'll jump in right
to where we talk about if I we have our
specific interfaces so you just
bind to it with an auto create as you
probably do with most of those
interfaces and the the next thing you
want to do as your register client so
we've got our own specific a IDL class
that's called I know I know location
service that's the one you guys want to
register to and to do that you implement
a an ILO location listener
sounds pretty like standard stuff
doesn't that and the you you're gonna
get two calls back to get your
information out of neo campus the first
one is on location changed with a
location object yes this is an OS
Android location location object
standard staff so has wgs84 informations
latitude longitude and also altitude so
the way we map the floors is with you
listener in absolute altitude so I mean
mean sea level latitude and the next one
you have is on status change which is
just like for any location provider
telling you whether we are out of
coverage in coverage or maybe
temporarily unavailable so if you find
any resemblance to an actual location
provider yes this is intended we just
wanted to hope for some of you guys who
say at some point you won't have to have
this in Android as a location provider
we'd be glad to do that and in the
meantime people can still use it just
like they would a location provider and
again I hope you'll have questions on
this feel free to ask at the end ok the
next thing you want to hear about is ok
so how does this get deployed on the
sides we've taken quite some time to
develop a pretty good tools you to allow
to allow the deployment of the
technology within a site you can get on
the right-hand side some nice snapshots
they're actually coaches over of one of
our partners which is the year Space
Museum in Toulouse called a citadel
Espace they they're a museum in the AR
Kenya
in partnership with us so it's sort of
our sandbox for deployment testing and
also commercial discussions so the the
way you deploy the technology is first
we'd go around to a quick diagnostic to
see if there's enough Wi-Fi so that's
what we're doing the mall for instance
to make sure we're we're doing fine also
check on the GPS signals if you know if
GPS good enough you probably don't want
to bother with this but involves usually
you have to then we go around and take
the blueprints usually you know an
architect format like a luchador things
like that import it into our tool suit
which by the way is is based on Google
Sketchup and with that we do some
processing of the map to allow to define
say areas without and things like that
and we go around and do a site survey
the way the site survey works is pretty
simple you have your phone you walk
around and tap regularly on waypoints
where you've been and that registers GPS
and Wi-Fi information for us to then
take it back into the tools processes
and aerate the database and then we get
the database on the phone so that's the
simple basic way of doing deployment on
our end again we've we've we've got a
significant significant part of the team
working on that and we want to make sure
that you guys be happy with this we come
to license and get to you guys okay
going forward so just to recap we think
it's key for people to know that you can
reuse existing Wi-Fi access points in
malls and in other public places it
matters a lot because from business
standpoint obviously you're not having
any cost there the next part is this is
fully onboard so you don't need any slow
penis because you need to connect back
to a server or whatever it's it's just
calculated on the fly here and here on
your phone and make sure you don't have
roaming costs and the last part is this
is even when we have to deploy we have
low-cost infrastructure because we use
standard access points
again we use any access point from
anybody and I realized I forgot to
mention that we don't connect to Wi-Fi
access points in terms of network we
just check that there they exist so it's
active scan stuff just get the
information from the that the the access
point exists and from that do our
computation okay so this is a quick
slide about where you can you you could
see this life as a matter of fact with
we've been so these are a few pictures
places we've been to as a matter of fact
we've launched commercial this year
which means there's a lot about this
that I can't disclose in terms of
precise places and precise names but I
still want to give you an idea about
what's behind those things so a few
things I can talk about one is with with
fares are concerned we've been at the
sea beat in 2010 and we deployed in a
whole navigation floor so it was a big
haul we had access points on our booth
only and we showed location all around
the booth and as you can guess it's
affair so it rents for three days you've
got a run set up steps to set up stuff
quickly and get it working so I guess
that's proof that our technical teams
been doing a good job at being
productive and keeping things productive
there's stations I can't really talk
about the way they are keen in my mind
in my heart to my heart as well
museums we've we've talked about the yes
atilla's pass it's it's really one place
we've been to and shopping malls again
I'd love to talk about but we're gonna
keep it to ourselves for now are are so
that each of these lines equals one
customer at least in my mind which I
cannot speak for sorry and next segment
where we're looking into as really
industrial sites where we do more let's
say tracking related things and also we
did a fireman training center which was
pretty interesting so I guess that tells
you this
she's not just here for fun it's more
than a demo okay with this on the last
slide you have our contact details just
in case you don't get your question
