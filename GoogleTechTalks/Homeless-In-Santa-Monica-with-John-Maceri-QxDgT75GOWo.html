executive director of
PCC do you mind if I sit I'm more
comfortable doing this is that okay and
my colleague donna miller who's really
the brains behind the operation she just
brings me along to carry stuff but
seriously we're really happy to be here
today and tell you a little bit about
OPCC in the work that we're doing on and
then sarah asked me to talk a little bit
about kind of homelessness generally and
what's going on in the city of Santa
Monica I assume you've been here long
enough if you walk around in the
downtown area you don't have to go very
far to be very aware that we have a lot
of people living on the streets here in
Santa Monica and I know we get asked as
a service provider you know what what's
why are people homeless what's the city
doing about that so hopefully I can
answer some of your questions and then
at the end I'd like to talk about
volunteer opportunities that we have
available I'm at our organization and
ways that you might be able to get
involved so just for your own
information on the back there's a lot of
information here we have volunteer
opportunities there's one of our
newsletters and then a real quick fact
sheet about opcc and then this little
card actually has a client a really
heartwarming true clients story on it as
well so please feel free to take that
information on your way out so OPCC the
story of o PCC is really begins 40 more
than 43 years ago we've been in Santa
Monica since 1963 and actually before
that in the late 1950s Santa Monica was
a very different community than it is
now the ocean park area which is the for
those of you familiar with the city is a
south part of the city is we're
primarily working poor families lived in
there was a time actually that there
were deed restrictions covenant
restrictions on on owning property along
the beach and so a lot of the people who
worked in the service industry and their
families lived in the south part of the
city and the church in Ocean Park which
is a Methodist congregation that's been
there since about 1897 I believe had a
building on it
property that was a had been used as a
church parsonage and had been sitting
vacant for quite a long time and so the
there were several people who lived in
the neighborhood that asked the church
if they could use the house as a
community center and that was really the
beginning of OPCC we were not
incorporated until several years later
in 1963 but for the first few years the
community center and I know when most
people think of a community center you
think of basketball courts and swimming
pools and this was a community center in
the sense of it really being a place of
gathering for people who lived in the
neighborhood and we started off by
providing some very basic things we
provided groceries to families we
provided clothing we provided a meeting
spot for people who lived in the
community to find jobs or housing we
provide a child care which doesn't seem
that novel now but 45 years ago
cooperative childcare was really
non-existent for working families and we
provided activities for what today we
would identify as at-risk youth in those
days it was just kids hanging around
after school getting into trouble
because they didn't have anything to do
and that was really the genesis of our
organization through the 1960s OPCC
continued to be known as the place in
the community that was the resource
center and as the community changed as
the demographics of the community
changes Ocean Park changed then our
organization sort of morphed into this
multifaceted social service agency that
we are today on we our first project was
then called the drop-in center which was
a place where people who lived in the
neighborhood basically every day came by
and got whatever they needed whether it
was information or referrals or if we
had food or we had clothing or donated
items and that was kind of the hub of
the activity in the community in the mid
to late 1970s when the women's movement
really started to take hold and domestic
violence
became more well-known we actually
formed sojourn services for battered
women in their children in 1977 we
actually have the second oldest crisis
shelter domestic violence crisis shelter
in the state of California and that
started because the volunteers who were
working at the drop-in center noticed
that when they came to open up in the
morning there were women and often women
with children parked in the parking lot
these were not necessarily homeless
women but it was clear that they didn't
have any place to go and as the
volunteers began to talk to them they
realized that these were women who were
fleeing their batterers so what would
happen is there would be an incidence of
domestic violence in the household at
night the batterer would either fall
asleep or leave and the woman would take
her kids and she would come to OPCC
because it was known in the community as
a safe place and she would wait until
the morning until the batter or left and
then she would return home so it didn't
take very long before our volunteers
figured out that we needed to do
something to create a safety net
essentially for these women and children
in the 1980s as homelessness became the
social phenomenon that we understand it
to be and unfortunately I'm looking
around this room and your generation I'm
older than I think probably everybody in
here your generation has grown up with
homelessness as as a state of being but
when I was growing up it was not we did
not have wide scale homelessness really
started in the late 1970s and early
1980s with the and actually the movement
started here in California with the
deinstitutionalization of people with
mental illness we had a state mental
hospital system that wasn't you know
terrific certainly there were a lot of
abuses but the the mental health system
state mental health system was
dismantled with the promise that there
would be community resources so that
people could live in the community with
adequate housing and supportive services
well the problem is the first part of
the equation happened that is the
institutions were shut down but the
community support system and housing
never followed and that really started a
wave across the country of massive
numbers of people many of whom are
severely and persistently mentally ill
living
on the streets so over the years in the
last 43 years o PCC has broaden our
scope of services and today we serve
about 8,400 unduplicated individuals
every year throughout our our programs
we serve low-income and homeless youth
adults and families battered women and
their children and people living with
mental illness particularly homeless
mentally ill women and we do that
through a variety of different projects
and I'll kind of quickly walk through
those for you we have our access center
which is used to be called the drop-in
center which is really the point of
entry into the service system here and
every day we see about 300 people who
come in in every permutation of humanity
we see people who are newly homeless we
see families we see individuals we see
single parents with children we see
folks who have been on the streets for a
short period of time folks have been on
the streets for a long period of time
people who are facing eviction and kind
of everybody in between so we just see a
wide variety of folks and we haven't
moved very far from our sort of core
values OPCC operates on the first tenet
of social work which is you meet people
where they're at you begin there and and
and help people and support people and
making the choices they need to change
their lives so that might be something
as simple as somebody needs something to
eat or needs a shower or a clean pair of
jeans or a set of clothing they might
need bus tokens for transportation they
might need assistance in getting to see
a doctor for medical care they might
need mental health treatment or
substance abuse treatment they might
need help finding a job really kind of
whatever someone needs is what we do at
the access center we have our own mental
health center because so many of the
people we serve over seventy three
percent of the people that we work with
our people who are living with mental
illness we have our own therapist on
staff so we have a counseling center
that's available to the clients and all
the opcc programs as well as we see
people living in the community who are
not part of our programs who come in for
counseling particularly because we have
a specialty in family violence we see a
lot of victims of domestic violence or
victims of
violent crime who come to a su of
experienced trauma because we have an
expertise in that area so we have our
own therapists and we also have about 12
interns in training these are people who
are getting their license and need to
get their clinical hours we have a
program for homeless mentally ill women
called daybreak which has a drop-in
center a day center and it's a program
specifically focused on the needs of
women again one of the things that's
kind of unique about opcc is that over
the years because we're so close to the
work our staff and volunteers are very
good at assessing the changes in the
needs of the people that were serving
and several years ago at the access
center there were a group of volunteers
and staff members who notice that there
were a lot of women who were coming to
the access center but they wouldn't
actually come inside they would stay
outside and as we began to talk with
these women we found out pretty quickly
that these were women who were most of
them were mentally ill all of them had
been physically or sexually assaulted by
men and were very mistrustful of coming
into an environment where there were
predominantly men in some cases some of
the same men that they had to deal with
on the streets so we started this
program where the women had their own
space that's staffed by women both women
staff members and volunteers where they
can feel safe and that was the beginning
of daybreak and now daybreak has sort of
evolved into its own continuum we have a
day center we have a transitional
housing program we have permanent
supportive housing and we have an
aftercare program sojourn our services
for domestic violence a better women in
their children operates a crisis shelter
a second stage shelter we have a very
extensive community outreach and
education program we're very interested
in not just treating the symptoms but
trying to intervene early on and that's
true in our work with homelessness as
well as try to stop homelessness or so
we work on the prevention side as well
as actually working with people who are
actually homeless or have or trying to
intervene before a situation escalates
into a battery we have a program called
canine connection which actually is our
newest program
it's it's I see Donna smiling back there
this this is kind of one of our happy
all of our work is happy work but we
really like this one it actually pairs
at-risk youth with shelter dogs and it's
a very interesting program it's some
people think of it as a dog rescue
program and its really not it's a child
rescue program because what we do is we
work with primarily middle school youth
who are have been identified as being at
risk or who have come from violent
households experienced trauma or having
a hard time at school and we pair them
with shelter dogs and the goal here is
really twofold the dogs are really a
modality to reach the kids so what the
kids do is they work with these dogs
over an intensive three-week period and
prepare the dogs for adoption and
through that process they learn
nonviolent conflict resolution they
learn goal-setting they learn to how to
care for some something other than
themselves and it's actually a
fascinating process I you know this
projects been going a little over a year
and the very first program we did we
pair eight kids with eight dogs and the
first day of the program I went to the
site they were working in a continuation
school and there were eight
out-of-control kids paired with eight
out of control dogs and I thought this
is a recipe for disaster what have we
done you know these dogs are going to
bite these kids it's going to be a mess
three weeks later at the graduation so
it's every day for three weeks it's it's
three hours a day part classroom work
with the kids and part field work with
the dogs at the end of the three weeks
it was an amazing transformation I mean
you can't believe what happens in terms
of the change in behavior and attitude
in just that three-week period so we're
actually very excited about that project
and and are looking to grow that we have
turning-point are transitional housing
program which is a 55 bed facility here
in Santa Monica that serves formerly
homeless adult men and women and safe
haven which is a fairly new program for
us we'll be expanding our bed capacity
this year from 10 to 25 beds that works
with
homeless people with mental illness and
addiction substance addiction or often
referred to as co-occurring disorders so
that's sort of the technical rundown of
OPCC and before everybody goes to sleep
because i know it's after lunch i want
to talk a little bit about why are
people homeless what are we doing about
it what's the city doing about it you've
probably heard terms like continuum of
care housing first or these kinds of
things I want to talk a little bit about
that and then I want to open it up for
any questions that you have the wire
people homeless well there are lots of
reasons why people are homeless not
surprisingly and those of you that are
fortunate enough to live in Santa Monica
know that the cost of housing here is
incredibly high the cost of housing in
Los Angeles is incredibly high so we
have a real problem with affordable
housing general even for people who are
working so imagine if you're living on
the streets and general relief which is
welfare is about two hundred and
twenty-one dollars a month if you're
lucky enough to get social security
income you might get maybe 750 to
dollars a month so imagine trying to
live on pay your rent pay your bills buy
food forget paying for a car because
most of the people that we work with our
can't even imagine having a car so it's
incredibly difficult for people just in
this housing market so certainly the
lack of affordable housing as I said
about seventy three percent of the
people we work with have severe and
persistent mental illness that's a huge
factor in people who are homeless and if
you go out and about in Santa Monica
you'll see many people you know probably
who who fit a lot of the stereotypes
that many of us have about homeless
people they're disheveled they may be
talking to themselves they may not have
bathed for a long time they might be
pushing a shopping cart or have a lot of
their belongings or hoarding stuff this
is sort of the image that we have of
most homeless people what I can tell you
is that for every one of those people
there are about 10 people who are
invisibly homeless who come to our
facilities every day who take a shower
we have storage facilities where they
can they're looking for a job or in some
cases going to work and yeah there are
lots of homeless people that actually do
work they'll put their duffle bag or
their suitcase on wheels in the storage
locker will come at six o'clock in the
morning take a shower store their stuff
go to their job come back in the evening
you know get their stuff while they're
waiting to get into some kind of a
housing arrangement so for every one
person that you see on the street who's
who sort of fits your stereotype of
homelessness there about ten people
behind that person who are going on
about their business and you would never
know that they were homeless many cases
going as I said going to work or going
to school looking for a job involved in
some kind of employment training the
lack of good paying jobs is another
reason for homelessness domestic
violence is a huge cause most the women
that we work with have been victims of
domestic violence so they've been in a
stable living situation at some point or
maybe not so stable but they were housed
and decided that it was too much and
they needed to get out of it so we find
that they're all kinds of reasons
addiction is probably the other you know
primary issue or mental illness and
addiction on for those of you that are
not familiar with severe and persistent
mental illness I'm talking about things
like severe depression or bipolar
disorder which used to be called manic
depressive where people will have real
highs and real lows a lot of people will
use drugs and alcohol as a way to
self-medicate so if you're for instance
a paranoid schizophrenic and you don't
have access to medication it wouldn't be
uncommon for you perhaps to drink
because when you drink your symptoms
subside the problem is when you sober up
the symptoms come back with a vengeance
so it's sort of a vicious cycle that
you're constantly self-medicating to
control your symptoms and you get caught
you know like the hamster on the wheel
you can't get off because you're
constantly going up and down also the
proliferation of highly addictive and
relatively cheap street drugs crystal
meth crack cocaine these these are
things that are fairly easy to get a
hold of they're not that expensive
they're very very addictive and so
people will get hooked on this this
stuff and it's very very hard to break
the cycle and then finally economic
reasons I'm going
we see a fair amount of families coming
to our access center we're through
divorce through death then it's it's not
uncommon to have a primary breadwinner
who dies and then the woman is left in a
situation where maybe she hasn't worked
for a long time or their children to
take care of and there's no income in
the family so their house they're living
right on the edge they're not able to
pay their rent and producing their
evicted and find themselves on the
street so I don't want to leave you with
the impression that every homeless
person on the street is mentally ill and
drug addicted and and that sounds an
awful lot like victim blaming but it is
certainly a significant reason for what
we see in terms of chronic homeless
people what i mean by chronically
homeless people i mean people have been
on the streets for a year or longer or
who are living with a disability or who
have been homeless more than four times
in the last three years so we're talking
about people who have had it maybe been
in and out of shelter temporarily but
have not been in a stable living
situation for quite a long time what is
the city doing about this well the city
actually city of Santa Monica is
probably one of the most generous cities
in terms of their support for homeless
services not just OPCC but on the west
side there's a coalition of agencies
called the Westside shelter and hunger
coalition which has about 20 / 25
members that are combination of service
providers and faith-based organizations
that are involved in serving homeless
people and that includes everything from
organizations like OPCC that have a very
broad range of services within our
organization to faith communities who
might be providing meals or in many
cases providing volunteer support to
support the agencies we have
organizations here that serve families
we have an organization that works
specifically on employment placement for
people we have an organization that
works with seniors and together the
organization's try to fill out what's
called this continuum of care where you
think of emergency services on the front
end and permit
housing on the other end and helping
people kind of move through that system
the city of Santa Monica right now I'm
commits about I believe it's about 2
million dollars a year there general
fund revenue to homeless services and
it's just recently focused on creating
two new programs one's called a chronic
homeless pilot and that is a
collaboration between service providers
the police department paramedics and
Human Services City Human Services staff
to identify individuals who have been
the highest utilizers of services these
are the folks that get the most police
calls paramedic calls use hospital
emergency room services and really
intensifying our efforts to work with
these people and get them into housing
with supportive services the pilots been
going a little over a year now we
started off with a about 20 individuals
who had been targeted we have now 71
people enrolled in the program 36 of
them have been housed so it's it's a
very labor intensive program but it also
is extremely effective in terms of
providing services to people who have
been the hardest to reach finally I just
want to talk a little bit about
volunteer opportunities and then I want
to open it up and answer any questions
that you have for volunteering at OPCC
we love volunteers we have right now
about a core of about 700 volunteers
throughout our agency that work in a
variety of ways and that can be anything
from preparing the sack lunches to
helping with the grocery program to
doing administrative work Donna always
needs help at our fundraisers we're
always looking for folks who want to
help out at special events sojourn our
domestic violence program is always
looking for volunteers to work on our
hotline to work with the ocean team to
work in our children's program we have
actually groups of folks who come and
prepare and serve meals at our various
locations so if you're interested in
doing that
as an individual we can hook you up with
another group or if a group of you from
google we're interested in forming your
own group that would be a wonderful way
to be of service to us there are
opportunities internally you could do
things like a clothing drive canned food
drive for those of you that travel are
no people who travel we love those small
bottles of shampoo and conditioners and
lotions and toothpaste that you often
get in hotels because we give those to
our clients so there are all kinds of
ways of being involved and I know that
time is something that's precious for
everybody but we would really really
welcome and encourage you to think about
you know if you could carve out a little
bit of time whether it was weekly or
monthly or every couple of months to do
some volunteer work not only would it
help us but frankly I think it would be
good for you too because I would I hear
from the volunteers and I can tell you
from my own experience because because
I'm in addition to you know my vocation
my avocation is being a volunteer and I
can tell you that it's it's good for
your soul it gets you outside of
yourself and it you know it makes you
realize first of all it helps you with
your stereotypes in terms of who
homeless people are as I think that we
all sort of have an image you know
sometimes we've had negative experiences
with homeless people and so we think
that all homeless people are just like
that person but you actually might be
amazed and surprised to know that
everybody has a life story and that we
don't often know what people's stories
are that often there's catastrophe or
trauma or something dramatic happens in
someone's life that leads them down a
path that results in them being homeless
so being a volunteer is a good way for
you to kind of get the other side of the
story and also to give back a little bit
because I think all of us that are
fortunate enough to go home at night and
lay our heads on a pillow with a roof
over our head often take that for
granted and so I think being a volunteer
also gives you an opportunity to see
that you know the whole world isn't as
fortunate as as we are so that's kind of
my quick spiel what would you like to
know what questions do you have about at
PCC about homelessness about what do you
want to talk about
yes sir I'm going to work this
additional men should be three forms
than that because fully aware
total people in the office say you're
interested in what other agencies are
around you me is that the question how
well the agency's work very well
together actually and I'll just give you
a sampling Monica we have there's opcc
right over the border in Venice is st.
Joseph's Center just up the street here
we have Upward Bound house which is at
11th in Washington which is a program
they have two programs one a senior
housing program and one a program for
homeless families there's chrysalis
which is the employment agency that I
talked about they have a Santa Monica
office and also their base downtown
there's new directions which is based at
the West LA VA campus and they serve
homeless veterans both men and women we
have the Clair foundation which is also
based here in Santa Monica which is a
substance abuse treatment provider we
have the Westside food bank which works
actually with all the agencies provides
food to support all the agencies
programs we have I'm step up on second
which is right down here downtown they
have permitted housing as well as a
little some of you may have been in the
little fresh start market they have a
catering business on that employees on
their clients and they also have a
little like a mini market and they're
building some new housing right down on
fifth Street I believe 46 units as well
so that's just sort of a sampling of
some of the agencies that are around
then in addition to that as I mentioned
we have several of the faith-based
organizations which are for the most
part not providing direct services but
are providing groups of volunteers for
instance in our programs we have several
on faith-based groups that come in on
the weekends and prepare and serve the
evening meals a turning point at san
michele at day breaks we have folks who
who will do that and many of them are
affiliated with faith-based
organizations does that does that answer
your question going to give you been
so there are lots of volunteer
opportunities so if you live outside
Santa Monica I'm certainly in the San
Fernando Valley there's la family
housing me they're great they're great
organizations all over LA County so if
you live in the south bay or long beach
or wherever san gabriel valley there are
there are plenty of opportunities to be
involved yes San Marvin and also
compared to the places like Orange
County drive down there it's not at
least it's not as visible what is it
about Santa Monica and certain other
places that tend to attract homeless
people and is it
is it because the resources are here to
help them is it because I've heard of
I've heard a story while back about
police were accused of driving driving
homeless people to downtown Los Angeles
and dropping mall in water I mean
there's probably one reason I wanted you
to talk about that that's an excellent
question let's rewind a little bit in
terms of particularly downtown Los
Angeles to understand skid row because
the history of Los Angeles is very much
linked to skid row in if you go to other
urban areas you'll see homeless people
and generally there's there's
homelessness in the urban cores of the
city's new york chicago san francisco
and that's usually where you find what
are called single room occupancy SRO
hotels in Los Angeles the only place
that we have SRO hotels are in downtown
in the skid row area and the reason for
that is because years ago really the
turn before the turn of the century the
railroad terminus ended right near Skid
Row and so you had a lot of these hotels
which were boarding houses originally
they were developed for primarily single
men coming to Los Angeles to work and so
they would rent rooms in these boarding
houses over the years as Los Angeles
grew and we became really a suburban
City the urban core where the SRO hotels
were remained in downtown and in Skid
Row so homeless people that was really
where most of the affordable housing has
been historically in Los Angeles and so
down there you have a lot of the
missions in the faith-based
organizations kind of in this urban core
because most homeless people were living
in and around or very low income people
we're living in and around the downtown
core so that's sort of the history I'm
giving an oversimplified version but
essentially that's how Skid Row sort of
developed now relative in Santa Monica
would people say well if you go to
Manhattan or redondo or any of the other
beach communities you don't see as many
homeless people why is that well there a
couple things that are different about
Santa Monica yes those other communities
have beaches but Santa Monica first of
all is a world-class tourist destination
so you have infrastructure
year to support tourism that you don't
have in a lot of those other cities you
know you have the volleyball tournament
of the surfing championship but other
than that you don't have year-round
tourism there are a lot of European
tourists that come here a lot of
Japanese tourists that come here so we
have the promenade we have beachfront
hotels we've developed the pier and so
we have infrastructure here that you
don't have necessarily another beach
community so that's part of it the
weather is more temperate here I live in
the san fernando valley and for those of
you that live in the valley or been out
there in summertime it's very very hot
and so if you go in the San Fernando
Valley of course I'm very aware of this
because of the work that I do there are
certainly pockets of homeless people I
live fairly close to Cal State
Northridge and there are fair amount of
encampments actually in that area but
most of the homeless people in San
Fernando Valley congregate along the 405
or the 101 corridors why well if people
are going to Panhandle you know where
are they asking for money they're
generally asking for money off the
freeway off-ramp when you're making a
left-hand turn right well here you don't
have to do that because you can go down
along the promenade because we have a
very bustling tourist trade and a lot of
street traffic all the time so we have a
lot we have a tourist industry that has
nothing to do with homeless people but
makes it easier for people who are
living on the streets to survive so
that's that's a factor the fact is we do
have services in Santa Monica that we
don't have other places and as a service
provider one of the things we hear all
the time is well if you would just go
away it's like the Pied Piper Center if
you'd go away all the homeless people
would kind of follow you out of town
well certainly some of the homeless
people would follow us out of town but
the vast majority of them wouldn't
because and we know this from our own
studies that we've done is particularly
women and families will stay here
because it's safer to be on the streets
here than it is in downtown Los Angeles
a very scary and dangerous place so a
lot of the women particularly will come
here and stay here because this is the
city that's pretty the weather is
reasonably temperate it's easy to get
around on foot we have a very good and
inexpensive public transportation system
a lot of our female clients actually
will ride the big blue bus at night
until the route ends they'll actually
sleep on the bus because they feel safe
there so you don't have that in other
parts you know of
County so that's certainly you know a
factor and beyond that the other thing
that we have on the west side that you
don't have in other places is we have a
very large on VA complex in West Los
Angeles so you have a fair number of
homeless veterans who go to the VA for
services or for health care services and
so they will come and stay in or around
santa monica on the west side because
the campus is there so it's sort of the
flip side of their services available
there there is what we've seen happening
in the last two years with the
redevelopment of downtown Los Angeles is
the loft conversions began a lot of
those SRO hotels are being converted to
market rate housing so I started off by
saying one of the reasons that we have
such problem with homelessness is that
affordable housing is drying up and is
more and more that housing stock is
converted it's going to be harder and
harder for people to find places where
they can afford to live so they we're
not really solving anything we're just
kind of pushing it out and so if you go
now to areas of you know South Los
Angeles San Gabriel Valley as i said the
San Fernando Valley it's becoming more
dispersed in terms the county cuz people
are getting pushed out of the downtown
area and and a natural place to
gravitate is to Santa Monica the other
thing too that is important and unique
about Santa Monica you don't have any
other beach communities if you look at
the MTA that the master transportation
grid for the MTA the bus system we have
four main east-west bus routes that
literally end at the beach and go to
downtown you know you have wilshire
Santa Monica Olympic and pico you can
get on a bus and ride literally from the
beach to downtown Los Angeles that's not
true in any other beach community
there's not direct access to downtown so
that that also in terms of
transportation patterns makes it easier
for people to kind of get back and forth
so all of those for all of those reasons
yes
skidrow seems so more dangerous than I
thought this chronic almost problem why
why is that why is downtown I mean are
there some reasons to downtown is more
dangerous than santa monica and and also
you know as we are from new to the
neighborhood here we've noticed
obviously lots of homeless folks that we
contact when were walking our cars at
night in both parking situations and
just left it to understand your you know
if you have any statistics
the information on you know how safe it
is or not favorited
well dance the first private question
why is
a lot of people concentrated in a very
small area and if you've been to
downtown recently it's get Skid Row is
becoming more and more and more
compressed for a long time there was
sort of this attitude of containment and
it was contained within about at one
time probably about a 30 block radius
and that's down to about ten square
blocks now so you're just compressing
people more and more that's one issue
the second issue is that a lot of the
criminal activity that happens
occasionally happens between homeless
people but it's often drug dealers or
people who are not homeless who prey on
homeless people because the the the
trade of the street often is drug
dealing that's how people some cases
survive but there's a lot of predatory
behavior for people who as I said are
not homeless drug dealers will come and
sell crack or crystal meth or a
combination of all that stuff to
homeless people and so that creates this
in a sort of perpetual cycle of criminal
activity so you have a lot of people
living in a dense area you have a lot of
people who are already addicted who are
living with severe and persistent mental
illness then you put on top of that this
you know illegal drug activity and it's
really just kind of a breeding ground
for problems so we don't have that in
Santa Monica yes there are pockets I'm
not saying that there's no criminal
activity that goes on with homeless
people here there's no drug dealing
certainly there is but the police
department here is much more focused on
enforcement not punishing people it's
not illegal to you know to be homeless
or not to have a place to live so if
you're you know sitting or walking or
standing with your belongings and you're
not panhandling you're not sleeping at a
door you're not bothering anybody you
know the police are not going to arrest
you because it's not a crime you know
not to have a place to live but in Santa
Monica that the police are much more
active and actually we have been
involved in helping them up near our
access center because we have so many
people every day coming into a very
small space that we have found that some
of the outside influences that I
describe who are not even people who
live in Santa Monica
come from downtown or come from other
areas you know will come to engage in
criminal activity and we don't want that
we don't it's not good for our clients
it's not good for the community it's not
good for us so here we have a police
force it's much more involved in
stopping that kind of activity before it
becomes out of control so that's a major
difference in terms of violent crimes
homeless people are no more apt to be
violent than the general population I
think what's often scary to people is
when you see someone who it is clearly
you know not doesn't have all their
their faculties who may be talking
themselves there's a perception of
feeling threatened and I'm not talking
about somebody getting up in your face
and actually being threatened
threatening and that does happen
occasionally but by and large as a
percentage of the population there's no
more violent activity created or
perpetrated by homeless people than
there is in the general population in
fact you know probably less and most
most criminal activity that occurs among
homeless people is either individual
homeless people one-on-one or as I said
drug dealers or other folks kind of
coming in and preying on homeless folks
so yes well tell Monica that makes a lot
of sense tourism and all the other the
buses and everything I understand now
why Santa lock is
if you're homeless it's a great great
place making one of the best places to
be homeless but I don't really
understand is how you overcome the
challenges to find an affordable housing
and and jobs for the people without
without you know having them move two
places that are more affordable how do
you have out of the or maybe some of
that happens on well if we can in fact
is the vast majority of the people that
we serve don't end up
the Bennett's getting it's getting
difficult to find affordable housing
anywhere in Los Angeles County so one of
the first things we began when we begin
to work with somebody one of the first
things that we put out there right up
front is the likelihood of you living in
Santa Monica anywhere on the west side
is not very likely given the high
housing costs and just the lack of
housing generally jobs are a little
easier because but there are more
low-paying jobs so even though somebody
can go to work they're not going to be
able to sustain themselves for a long
period of time just because of the high
cost of living not just housing
generally so but in some ways it's it's
it's it's kind of counterproductive to
what we're trying to do which is to
stabilize people and build a support
system and build a sense of community
because when people put down roots and I
think most of you would experience this
as well you know you want to be near
either where you work where your family
where your friends where your
recreational or social activities are
where you worship if you you know
participate in those activities so in
some ways we are kind of encouraging
people to build a life in another way
we're saying to them from the beginning
don't put down roots you know that are
too deep here because the reality is
you're probably not going to be able to
afford to stay here so it's a challenge
for us and it's something that we
struggle with all the time we have more
and more people who are moving you know
farther and farther away because they
have to and that's just the reality of
it but most people are willing to do
that in order to you know to have
housing and to be able to work or if
they're not able to work if they're
physically disabled just to be able to
have a roof over their head they're
willing to do that some people are not
some people are very stubborn about they
like it here and want to stay here and
and that that presents some challenges
for 1,000 somewhere east los angeles or
or versus staying homeless some people
will it's a very very small percentage
the majority of people given the
opportunity and the right amount of
support will choose the housing but
there are some people who will say if
it's you know if you want me to go live
in pomona or antelope valley you know i
would rather stay here because i'm more
confidence is where my community is but
that's that's really a very small
percentage of people yes the important
component to a homelessness what is it
was access like to to medication for
mental illness and you will
for people there's actually that
anything is easy but on the Department
of Mental Health has the Edelman
Westside mental health center which is
over at pico and sepulveda and or
Olympic as a little bit I'm sorry and
and so we have a county mental health
facility on the west side that's been
very proactive it's been very involved
with our organization a lot of
organizations and getting people access
to treatment to psychiatric treatment as
well as medications so it's not it's
it's not that difficult we actually have
I'm psychiatrists that come on site at
our facilities a couple times a week and
will often have the ability to write
prescriptions we have pharmacies locally
that will work with that will fill them
so you know between medical between
county resources between private
resources that that really isn't a
barrier an impediment for someone they
could get hooked up now it's very hard
for somebody who's homeless who's not in
treatment to kind of navigate the system
on their own but once they're connected
to services it's not that difficult to
actually get the medications that's not
it's not a primary impediment well
that's another that's another issue the
a lot of our work is really encouraging
people and educating people about you
know that this is your life when you're
not on medication this is your life when
you are in medication you know that said
we're not the police I mean we don't we
don't force people to take their
medications but again I think given the
right amount of support and education
most people will understand that if they
take their medications if they have a
stable living environment that's the
other thing that's really difficult it's
you know it's easy for us to talk about
well you should take your medication but
if you don't have a place to live you
know and you can't you can't even
remember what day it is or what time it
is it's very hard to stick to any kind
of a medication regiment for any of you
that take medication or even take
vitamins regularly now sometimes you
think did I take my pill this morning
it's hard to remember so imagine
somebody who's living on the streets and
you know their their biggest
knowledge is worrying about where their
next meal is coming from staying safe or
getting from point A to point B or you
know last night you know anybody living
on the street when it's pouring rain
just trying to figure out a place to get
out of the rain so what we have
experienced and we work with a lot of
people with mental illnesses once people
understand how the medication can help
them and what the treatment you know can
do in terms of helping them manage their
life and they have a stable environment
then it's much easier to get people then
then then it just becomes routine so yes
this process and I'm probably
oversimplifying this admittedly but it
kind of in this processing that that you
kind of describe this transition for
folks from kind of the emergency care
you know all the way into getting them
placed you know in a home and a stable
situation how defined is that process
and I'm sure that different groups may
define it differently and then then I
guess my next question is is is it
identifiable kind of in that process
where the big bottlenecks and you know
where do people get stuck along that
transition and that's probably where I'm
probably simplifying it may not be as
easy to be able to develop yeah
verifiability the continuum is very
fluid for us because we recognize that
people come in at different points and
at different levels of functioning with
different levels of need so we try to
make it as easy as possible for people
to get into the system and one of the
reasons why we operate so many different
programs targeting so many different
individual groups as we recognize that
one-size-fits-all doesn't work if you're
a pretty highly functioning person not
living with mental illness that found
yourself homeless as a result of a job
loss for instance that's a very
different situation and will will your
your road to being housed and probably
employed again is much shorter and
probably easier than somebody who's been
living on the streets for 15 years with
untreated mental illness and/or
addiction I mean so you can't say that
you know everybody is the same in terms
of the continuum of care I really
described it as sort of very linear
process I think the downside of the
continuum is that it doesn't work well
for people who can't move through a
system in a pretty linear fashion
because it's it presupposes that you
have emergency housing people kind of
get in off the streets have a place you
know temporarily to be stabilized move
to transitional housing and that's where
the kind of the bulk of the work begins
people save money look for a job really
kind of get their life together and then
on to permanent housing where they're
able to function and live independently
so for for people who are able to kind
of do that it works really well the
problem is is that there isn't enough
capacity in the system at any level so
on any get you know we see 300 people a
day coming through our access center on
a good day on a good day there might be
25 beds available for people so if
you're the 26th person you know today
you're out of luck until a bed opens up
so there's there's a huge system see and
that's not our fault I mean it's just
that there just aren't enough beds for
people we have two thousand homeless
people on the streets of Santa Monica we
have you know the bed capacity in the
city you know is less than 400
so you know that's that's not a really
great ratio on any given night so that's
that's just a systemic problem the other
thing is is there are you know sometimes
because of program requirements people
are not able to meet the program
requirements you know people may not be
willing to commit to being clean and
sober upon entry or may be willing to
commit to do that but if any of you have
ever you know struggle with addiction
you know that relapse is part of
recovery that people don't always get
there again in a linear fashion
sometimes you know it takes a while till
people are ready so and that that
creates its own barriers because a lot
of programs will say well if you're not
willing to be clean and sober then you
can't be here so I think I think it's
both a systems capacity issue and I also
think that there are barriers within the
system that they make it difficult for
people descendants your question Oh
one-size-fits-all doesn't work no we
work with humans and everybody's
different
if you have a wish list of your greatest
means for volunteers for any sort of
things that you want people to be
organizationally you're not getting this
point sure well you know time certainly
organized individuals or groups
organized around preparing and serving
food and meals is a huge need that we
have in our organization now Samuel
shell which is an acronym for Santa
Monica shelter is one of our programs
it's 110 bed facility down on olympic
and 5th we're in desperate need of
volunteers to come in and we have a
kitchen there so we but we need the
volunteers and what we ask the groups to
do is to actually bring the food in and
you know prepare it we have the kitchen
there we'll set up and will even do the
dishes but we really need help in that
particular area the other thing too is
volunteers you might be able to teach
any kind of classes we have I talked
about daybreak which is our program for
women they have a program called women
in new directions which is a arts and
crafts business that the women were
actually run created and run is a
micro-enterprise so we're always looking
for volunteer instructors so if you have
any artistic ability that's helpful I'm
in a room full of techies so technology
is always we're limping into the 19th
century so you know people who are
available to teach basic computer skills
is always very helpful because we you
know have a lot of people who are not
that familiar with technology these you
have to be fairly patient because these
are not advanced you know folks who are
going to be advanced in computer
literacy but if you had an inclination
to do that that would be very helpful
for us I'm then beyond that sort of
internally always organizing food drives
we always need food you know canned food
non-perishable foods are a big thing for
us and personal hygiene items we we blow
through that stuff i mean it's its
enormous and how much we we go through
so we were always grateful for that so i
would say those are the and money i mean
that's that's the other thing if people
are so inclined that that's you know
something that we can always use as well
to run our program so other questions no
he said thank God he's going to stop
talking huh okay well if you have any
other questions Don and I are here and
we're more than happy to talk to and I
really do first of all welcome you to
Santa Monica I know you've been here for
a while but it's nice to have you as
neighbors and I also hope that you'll
use opcc as a resource one thing that
you should know is that we do have to
outreach teams mobile outreach teams
that work out of our access center so if
you would ever encounter a homeless
person who needed help you can call us
and we actually were not the police we
don't go out and arrest people but we
have very skilled a lot the other thing
that's important for you to notice about
a third of our staff at opcc are people
who have been formerly homeless who are
living with mental illness or who are in
recovery or some combination thereof so
we have a lot of our staff members who
are not only sympathetic but
tremendously empathetic because they've
been there they know what it's like as
one of our staff members said last week
he said you know when you're laying in
the gutter and looking up in the curb it
looks awfully high sometimes so but I
hope that you will use us as a community
resource that we do have the ability to
come out and talk to people and
encourage them to come in for services
and so we're here for as a resource for
you as well so thank you very much for
having us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
