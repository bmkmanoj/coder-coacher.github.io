Gorillaz in you I from Jason Hong he's a
professor at CMU and along with working
on anti-phishing he works on mobile
computing matchups and he really likes
the color green thank you thanks Paige
Rob ok so once again my name is Jason
Hong I'm an assistant professor in
human-computer interaction which is part
of the school computer science at
Carnegie Mellon University and today
we're going to talk about there are some
of the our current work in user
interfaces and algorithms for fighting
off phishing attacks now I'm sure
everyone in this room and probably their
parents and friends to have received
emails that are like this now please
update your email account click on this
link to do that if you happen to click
on the link you get sent to a web page
that looks like this and you if you
continue to do what the website what the
email ask you to do is fill in your
account name you hit the sign in
securely and then it would say hey
everything's okay don't worry about it
and if you actually did this it turns
out you would actually be a victim of
identity theft and this entire process
is known as fishing okay so this is
where criminals are actually going out
and trying to steal your identity and
then steal your bank accounts or whatnot
okay so here are some fast facts on
fishing so I want to make sure that you
have take this with a grain of salt
because finding accurate statistics on
fishing is actually quite difficult
we've been trying to talk to the bank so
I've been talking to the FBI and Secret
Service and it's very hard to find any
kinds of reliable statistics on this but
here are some of the ones that I've seen
in the media so roughly speaking about
three and a half million people have
fallen for phishing attacks okay so
that's a non-trivial number by any kind
of metric it's estimated cost about one
to two billion dollars a year and this
is rapidly growing the derivative is
very very high okay so the one to two
billion is in terms of fraud in terms of
lost revenues and also in terms of
emptying empty bank accounts they're
about 9255 unique phishing sites
reported in june two thousand six alone
okay so that's just one single month and
I've also heard many reports from
newspapers and media that it's actually
easier and safer to do a phishing attack
men to rob a bank okay so I'm definitely
not encouraging any of you guys to do
this but okay if you think about the
Justice your numbers if you send out say
a million of these emails you only need
about three or four people to fall for
it and if you get about 5,000
per person that's about you know twenty
thousand dollars right there and again
much safer than robbing bank okay so
what we're doing over at CMU is that
we're trying to figure out how to help
people make better trust decisions so
the entire project that we have right
here is called supporting trust
decisions and we're focusing
specifically on anti-phishing right now
we have a large multidisciplinary team
at CMU we're right now supported by the
National Science Foundation the Army
Research Office and by Carnegie Mellon's
a group called Scilab this is actually
our computer security consortium we have
six different faculty five PhD students
undergraduates and staff and we all from
very different backgrounds so i'll just
go quickly through the different faculty
are this is alessandro christie he's in
school public policy he's an economist
by training this is Lori Craner she is
probably best known for having developed
p3p the privacy policies this is sendie
trick he's part of the cert the
computing emergency response team this
is Julie downs she's a social
psychologist by training and as part of
the social decision sciences this
good-looking guys me and this is Norman
sade he's an expert in commerce as well
as machine learning okay so what we're
doing is we're looking we're trying to
take a multi-pronged approach to as
anti-phishing we're doing this both from
the human side and from the computer
side so we inspected the human side
we're trying to do we've been doing a
lot of these interviews trying to
understand decision-making what are the
cues that people look at and how do they
make the decisions when they decide to
trust or not trust an email and a
website we've also been developing
something called embedded training and
I'll talk a little bit more about this
in a second but can we actually train
people not to fall for phishing attacks
so this is the main question we're
trying to ask here and finally we've
also been developing an anti fishing
game so try to make it more fun try to
you know again surreptitiously train
people to not fall for these phishing
attacks in a way that sort of fun on the
computational side we've developed an
email anti-phishing filter that's
actually quite good is around ninety
ninety eight percent accurate in terms
of detecting phishing emails reason it's
great out here is that I'm not going to
be discussing today terms of time we've
also developed an automated test bed for
evaluating anti-phishing toolbars so it
turns out there's probably about 90
anti-phishing toolbars you can install
into your web browser today and what
we've been trying to do is try to
understand well are these actually
effective or not and if so you know what
kinds of strategies are effective lastly
I'll be talking about in anti-phishing
toolbar that we've developed and it
actually is very good it's about
ninety-five percent accurate or so in
terms of detecting phishing websites and
the best part of course is that it's
very trivial algorithm and also uses a
google search engine to do this and by
the way it also outperforms the current
google anti-phishing algorithm to so we
also have a underlying philosophy here
which is ok let's try to automate this
where possible so you can think of this
like spam filters you don't deal with
spam manually yourself so you wish how
to filter the automatically checks
before you and gets rid of it for you ok
so it's the same thing here we want to
try to use automated algorithms as much
as possible and get rid of phishing
attacks and protect people from it but
we also want to try to support people to
make better decisions where necessary so
again how better user interface is
better training and so on to try to
protect people so I'm going to talk
about the human side of things first and
i'll be taking a quick overview of our
results in terms of interviews that
we've done ok so what do people actually
know about fishing so what we did is we
interviewed 40 internet users included
and included 35 non-experts so these are
people who were people who had passed
two different questions one was have you
ever fixed someone else's computer
before ok so if they mated so no to that
one does a positive sign that they
probably were not expert and have you
ever created a web page before we did
mental models interviewed and we also
had them be part of an email
role-playing situation so the mental
models thing means we're just trying to
understand we asked them to think aloud
and we try to understand what are their
thought processes as they're looking to
emails what are the cues that they're
looking at and what do they think is
important not important so for the rule
playing we have them go through about 20
emails or so and the emails or in the
context of you apart your pat jones
you're a member of this company called
cognex inc and
you know you're trying to just clear out
your email inbox and so we asked people
to go through the email inbox and
respond to it as if they were this
person and sporadically spread it
throughout some of these were a few
phishing emails and then we record the
interviews and also coated them up this
work is actually available you can
download this here's the paper reference
right here I'll or you just ask me
afterwards I'll get you the reference ok
so the quickl review of the results only
about half of the people actually knew
the meaning of the term fishing so
typically you would get comments like
this well apply us something to do with
a band Phish I take it ok so the
awareness of just the specific term is
actually quite low there's actually also
very minimal knowledge of the lock icon
itself so a very protocol quote here is
I think I mean secured it symbolizes
some kind of security somehow so
eighty-five percent of the participants
were aware of the lock icon however only
forty percent of those knew that was
supposed to be in the browser Chrome
okay so this is actually an important
result because the sum of the newest
phishing attacks used a picture and
picture attack where you have just an
image and you have the image of your
browser inside of it and this actually
confuses a lot of people so this is
actually a fairly effective attack
that's going on right now only
thirty-five percent had noticed HTTPS
you know so the espar for secure socket
layer and most of those people didn't
really know what it meant either ok so
again probably the main thing you can
take from this slide is general
awareness is quite low of the lock icon
very people also paid little attention
to urls only fifty-five percent of
people said they had ever noticed
something strange with respect to urls
and most of them do not consider them to
be suspicious at all ok so this is
actually a very important thing too
because the URL is actually one of the
few things you can use to identify or
potentially identify phishing websites
ok this is probably one of the most
obvious slides that is efficient website
and if most people aren't recognizing it
as a signal then this is probably pretty
bad people did have some knowledge of
scams a roughly 55 of our participants
fifty-five percent of our participants
reported being cautious when email asks
for sensitive financial information but
on the flip side of things people very
few people reported being suspicious of
email asking for passwords so there's
sort of this general notion that you
know people know that there
nancial information is important but
they don't quite realize that their
passwords are important so this is sort
of an interesting finding lastly
knowledge of financial fish reduced the
likelihood of falling for these scams
but this knowledge is not transfer to
other kinds of scams so to give you an
example what happened in our interviews
in one participant they saw a banking
phishing email that was in our study and
they said oh this is probably a scam and
so they decided to just delete it and go
on to next email and the next email was
an amazon email asking for them to
update their account and they said okay
well Amazon's asking me to update my
account they would have this information
i'll go ahead and do it and this also
turned out to be a phishing scam as well
so it was really interesting because
they knew the defense for a financial
scam but they didn't realize that it
should be transferred over to a
different kind of scam so generally
speaking Nepali the main thing to take
out of this is that pupils knowledge of
these kind of scams are very highly
specific and not very robust people also
have very naive evaluation strategies to
so here are the three most frequent
strategies that people did in terms of
identifying fish in our interviews first
does this email appear to be for me okay
so if you happen to have someone's name
specifically their name inside of it
they'd be more likely to fall for it
it's normally hear from companies that
you do business with okay so if you
already have a pre-existing relationship
with the company then people say okay
well you know the other we see something
from the before I'll probably be able to
expect something from them again and
then also the reputation of the company
itself so here's a prototypical quote
that describes some of these I will
probably give them the information that
they asked for and I would assume that I
had already given them that information
at some point so I'll feel comfortable
giving it to them again okay so there's
some other findings we have inside of
the paper but let me just give you the
quick summary of the rest of them web
security pop-ups are very confusing
they're all so confusing to me too and I
have a PhD in this area so it's probably
not a good sign yeah like the
certificate has expired I don't actually
know what that means alright so maybe we
can even do a quick survey here does
anybody here actually bother checking
the security certificates of whenever
they see this in their browsers okay so
yes 56 people who I'm guessing would be
computer security PhD
also most people don't know what
encryption means okay so we have is so
if you're using that kind of terminology
inside of your system it turns out most
people just didn't understand what it
meant and what the implications were so
the quick upshot of all this these
studies in these interviews we did first
one is people are generally not good at
identifying scams they haven't
specifically seen before so again
people's knowledge of these scams and
very very fragile they're not very
robust of the strategies people don't
use good strategies to protect
themselves okay okay so are they any
quick questions on this before go into
the next part yes so the question is do
people people don't know the specific
meaning of encryption but do they
generally know what it means the answer
is also no it's people talk about I'm
entering a crypt and going into circles
or something like that I mean they just
try to make up terms and meanings for it
but generally speaking they just didn't
even know what it meant yes to the whole
plane like
just got easier
okay so the question was how much
information do we give beforehand did
they know that was a security study so
the answer is actually no they didn't
know as a security study we said that
this was a study on how people react to
email and the reason for this is the
priming effect because if they had known
that it was a security study then people
be probably more likely to act
differently than they normally would and
of course you know if a criminal sends
out a phishing email they're not going
to tell you hey this happens to be a
scam so of course there's also a lot of
ethics with respect to this too so as
you might know a lot of universities we
have to deal with in institutional
review boards make sure that we're
treating our participants ethically and
that we can all use deception if it's
the only way that we get information and
we have to make sure that we have
certain restrictions that we've treated
information correctly and so on so we
did fall all that as well too yeah
now i'm thomas the credit card companies
all
something knows this
they couldn't give bothered enough to
stop their shopping
the pressure issue because they
okay so the question if I could
paraphrase is people people felt that if
the emails ask for a credit card that
they felt it was more the credit card
companies responsibility rather than
their responsibility and probably partly
because in the u.s. you have a
fifty-dollar or liability maximum we
actually didn't see much of that
specifically inside of our interviews so
I can't comment really one way or
another on that one okay so let's go on
to the next part so the next question is
can we actually train people not to fall
for phishing attacks so this is sort of
interesting question because if you go
to a lot of security conferences the
general consensus is no you know people
are generally naive people don't really
know what they're doing and this is not
really a feasible solution okay so
that's sort of the conventional wisdom
on this and we actually came up with
interesting results which is pretty much
the opposite that yes you can actually
train people yes you can train johnny
not to fall for fish so we did a
laboratory study of 28 non-expert
computer users again using the same
kinds of questions I've used before to
filter people to make sure that they
weren't experts we had two different
conditions we and we asked both people
in both conditions to evaluate 20
different websites in the control group
they first evaluated 10 websites and
then we asked them just to take a break
for 15 minutes they could just check you
know they can check their actual email
we could play solitaire or do whatever
they wanted for 15 minutes and then go
and continue and evaluate the final 10
websites ok so again 10 websites take a
break 15 minutes and then evaluate
emerald websites in our experimental
condition we had them evaluate 10
websites and then we had them for 15
minutes actually read some of the
material out there to teach people not
to fall phishing websites and then do
ten more websites so for the material we
actually try to look for what we
consider the best material so this
included stuff from microsoft stuff from
ebay and stuff on the FTC the Federal
Trade Commission okay and the material
is generally talking about here's some
identifying factors here's how you
understand URLs be wary of websites ask
for too much information stuff like that
and try to make sure that people can
understand that phishing websites can
actually look the same as actual
websites so roughly speaking that's kind
of information that was in there
our experimental group so I will
actually want to show you the full
results here there's a lot of the
statistical data and whatnot here but
the main thing to take from this is the
experimental group actually performs
significantly better in terms of
identifying the fish after training so
they actually were less reliant on some
of these night not use strategies that I
was talking about before and some other
ones that other people and we have also
knows too so it turns out that people
naive we rely on how in a website
appears to judge whether is trustworthy
or not so if for example that if you see
a website that looks like it's
professionally designed then people
would be more likely to fall for it as a
phishing attack but I'm sure everybody
here knows that it's trivial just a copy
of an actual website so it's trivial to
copy ebays web pages it's trivial to
copy gmails web pages and so on so it
turns out in our experimental condition
that people were far less reliant on
this as a strategy in identifying
whether their website was fishing or not
if they were also looking at an
understanding URLs so far more often so
it turns out the training was also quite
effective at that and there are also a
lot more suspicious of websites that ask
for too much information so to answer
one of the previous questions before in
this case they actually didn't know that
it was a they were just asked to know
that it there were some scams here and
there just identified scan yes or no and
to rate their confidence in their
judgement this question the back
ongoing studies right now we're trying
to figure out what's the right way of
doing that in fact that's the next thing
I'll talk about in a second yeah well
this is also sort of this turns out
there's two interesting issues here but
I'll get to that in a few more seconds
okay any other questions before we go on
okay so probably the main thing to take
out of this is that people actually can
learn from web-based training materials
if only we could get them to read it
okay okay but of course you know people
don't go to these fishing webs are these
anti-phishing training websites because
if they were aware of it they probably
you know be sort of less likely to fall
for these attacks in the first place and
it also turns out that a lot of
companies send me security Moses the
emails to the companies and customers
pay pallidus is quite often ebay does
too what I guess really the same company
now but these emails tend to be ignored
so one issue is that a lot of people say
when we talked to them about them it's
like they feel like there's too much to
read they also felt like they don't
consider them relevant you know or they
also felt like I already know this stuff
I've received this notice five times
already I already read through it I'm
not going to fall for it and which in
fact they actually do still fall for it
so what can we do about this so another
approach that we've been doing is
something called embedded training and
here's the basic idea periodically we or
some kind of third party would
periodically send lots of people
phishing emails but they're actually
phishing emails from us and if you
happen to fall for the good guys right
so this is white hat white hat hacking I
guess so and if you happen to fall for
one of our training emails and you
actually get an intervention it says hey
you actually fell for this here are
things that you should look for in the
future and here's not how not to fall
for it again ok now I'm sure of course
you can imagine there's lots of
different phrases for frizzy freezing
for this that would be offensive hey
you're a bozo don't do this again you
know that's probably going to be very
persuasive so what we're trying to
figure out here is what is the most
effective way of trying to design these
to make sure that you would actually
understand this and so this is actually
just accepted to KY 2007 and if you want
to get one of these reports just let me
know and I'll send it to the link to you
later on ok so here is one of
the interventions that we actually
created so as you all know here from
seeing too many PowerPoint talks every
stalk has to have at least one slide
with text too small that you can't see
so this is my slide here so let me zoom
in on some of the aspects here that are
interesting so this is one of our one of
our designs right now we call this the
diagram intervention I personally call
this the rationalistic design this is
probably something that any computer
scientist would design off the bat
because it's very rationalistic okay so
in the top left it tells you okay
protect yourself and phishing scams this
is something from Carnegie Mellon
University and you just fell for one of
these scams and you know this tries to
explain to you how not to fall for them
again okay right below it actually gives
you a diagram of the phishing email that
you just fell for and actually tries to
point out some of the things that you
should look for there's a professional
and legitimate looking design is trying
to urge you to do something it has an
account status threat and there's also
one actionable item here which is the
mouse over if you move your mouse over
here and if you look at the actual URL
is going to they actually don't match if
you look over on the top right side it
tells you what is a phishing scam I ask
this question stay up so I'll talk about
that a second that turns out that the
criminals are getting smarter because so
it turns out that most people don't fall
for a lot of the ones that have errors
like missing images and whatnot but the
criminals are getting much much better
so I think that's getting much rarer
right now so that's why we didn't bother
with that one it sort of sort of pain
this is the interesting area because
every design we come up with we had to
find you know how would a criminal
attack it and the criminals aren't boses
they're actually quite smart
into the phd program so the question is
are emitting criminals into the phd
program well we did admit UK John did
okay and the last part which is the
bottom right side is explained some
simple actionable things that you could
do to protect yourself so for example
never click on links within emails you
should initiate contact first by
accessing access a website by typing in
the URL call customer service and never
give out personal information so one
that was sort of controversial within
our own group was called customer
service I mean do we really want to
flood them with all these calls and our
rationale is yes because the banks
aren't doing anything about it they
don't really have an incentive to do
this so this is actually one of the
important statistics that will learn
about this so if you remember the very
beginning I said that fishing is cost
about one to two billion dollars every
year okay now I don't know about you I
thought one to two billion dollars
there's a lot of money it turns out to
the banking industry its peanuts it's
rounding here because the total cost of
fraud all fraud is about two hundred
billion dollars so this is why right now
they're really doing much about this so
we're hoping by having people call a
customer service and by our work right
now to try to make sure that the
derivative doesn't really grow much
faster so basically nip this in the bud
before it becomes a problem yes
and Buddhist perspective it's a very
interesting but we send out a lot
we send out some of this year correctly
documented someone has posted their
photos to this album but this will lead
to get I would want to look at them we
don't have customers
reservation can't find this very so
you know
there's an interesting complement these
so things
and because I thought about well how
would we invite people
we didn't send them
so the previous question is Google sends
out a lot of emails requesting people to
click on links anyways because you know
just got a new photo and your album or I
guess an orchid and social networking
you would have a lot of these as well
too we actually updated this list to add
one more which is to be careful of
things websites ask for too much
personal information and the top one
they don't click on links with sort of a
controversial long within our group too
because it's like well you know if if
you are an expert you sort of know which
links are good to click on which ones
aren't but we're just trying to take
we're trying to figure out should we add
a nuance in this or not and we figured
it was probably easier not to add the
nuance because then we would also have
to teach people what the nuance was and
we figured that would be too difficult
so I would agree that we haven't quite
figured out the right set of heuristics
to teach people yet but I think this one
is a pretty good set and we still need
to figure out what's the right way of
trying to address the the comments issue
or the new content issue that you were
describing
we do if they assume the people are
paying attention to right yes so you're
you're robbing right so Robyn was saying
that we need to we need to educate
companies as well as customers that it
turns out the companies are also doing
lots of bad practices to for example
outsourcing their login sites to other
places or outsourcing your email or
other places is not a typical to get
like email from like some company that
might be in China for example that does
their you know their email services
which is really bad practice it
exacerbates this problem but I think
this is ongoing conversation that really
needs more work ok so this is our first
intervention the second intervention and
what's interesting is that we almost did
this half half as a joke because we
wanted to try something as completely
different in terms of design space so we
said well what if we created a comic
strip that sort of explains how the
phishing attacks work so the top part of
this comic strip you know basically
describes right here this is what the
criminal is doing and how he's actually
doing is work and the bottom part is
just saying what happens after they
receive the email ok so again this is
the this is the intervention we actually
use we have an updated version of this
right now and it turns out that this
intervention actually works far better
than the rationalistic design that we
have so when we did the comparison of
the study where three different
conditions first one is ebay paypal
notices we just use the standard ones
that they sent out we had diagram that
explains fishing and then we had the
comic strip that tells a story ten
participants in each condition 30 total
and roughly what happened is they went
through 19 emails there are four
phishing attacks scattered throughout
and to training emails as well and it's
basically the same store you're still
pat jones you still work for this
company and so on and i won't show you
the specific stats here if you want i
have it as a backup slide but
unsurprisingly the existing practice the
security gnosis is completely
ineffective people again thought they
already knew it or I've already received
tons of these and you know just in care
diagram intervention the rationalistic
one only works somewhat better but sort
of the surprising one is the comic strip
intervention work the best is just a
significant differences and we're trying
to figure out well why exactly is that
is it because it's a comic strip isn't
because there's less text or you know
our current
working hypothesis is it's because it's
telling a story so there's already some
existing evidence in social psychology
or just cognitive psychology people
remember stories really really well and
so you know I might be able to give you
all this tabular data showing you which
car to make and what which car to buy
and you know Priuses get this kind of
gas mileage and whatnot and then you
have a neighbor who says hey I just
about previous is really great which one
are you going to weigh more most people
actually weigh your neighbor so it's
sort of surprising so our next steps on
this is we're good we've already
iterated on the intervention designs yes
or maybe even some
we control the climate
if the user clicked this is spinning out
maybe you should reward them in some way
but im sue dominion then they get
positive feedback as well photo gmail
you could do something ok so the
comments is have people be active in
terms of labeling spam and phishing
attacks and being rewarded for that
labeling the intervention we're gonna
take you to the test email that sells
yes oh okay say I'm in your study and I
get you know for fishing one and two
yeah okay
if I if I label those intervention
emails and you know about it and you
know
and say you did a good job you're right
that is fear basically where people for
recognizing our training emails and
probably possibly also other phishing
emails to which cost we used for Kluber
filtering and other kinds of things too
I think that I'm actually talking to a
company tomorrow cloudmark up in San
Francisco that is basically doing
something that's like that right now but
the reward system is actually a fairly
trivial it's just basically giving you
gold star hey you're doing really well
and it works surprisingly well okay
we're trying to understand why the comic
strip format work better we're also
preparing for larger scale deployment to
include a lot more people we're also
trying to evaluate the retention over
time so again this is almost immediately
we're trying to figure out well you know
well after one week after two weeks
three weeks but we're also trying to
figure out how how often should you send
these kinds of training emails because
you'll try to balance the education and
annoyance level and you definitely don't
to annoy the participants we also want
to try to deploy this outside lab
conditions if possible but this actually
is leased to our most interesting issue
which is real world deployment and we're
actually spoofing people's brand so
effective we're becoming criminals or
cells that we deploy on the large-scale
and in fact i will say that ebay and
amazon have been quite effective in
finding our fake websites because we
have registered a few fake websites so
that we could run these studies and
there are quite proactive in finding
these so kudos to them for that but we
we actually need some corporate partners
but let us proof their brand try to see
how well this actually works in practice
okay and last part of the human
intervention side of things is we've
actually been developing a game called
anti-phishing Phil to teach people not
to fall for fish and so the better
training focuses on email this one
focuses primarily on the web browser and
recognizing URLs so the main goals of
this game is how do you parse the URLs
where should you look for URLs inside
the web browser and we're trying to also
teach people use search engines to if
you're not sure rather than clicking on
the link type in the information to a
search engine like if you really want to
get to ebay or google you know well i
guess if you're on google you would use
that if you won't really want to get to
ebay then type it into a web browser so
it's going to be available on a website
soon here's a zoomed in picture of what
it looks like but you know basically you
are this is you the
Phil and actually that's dad I'm sorry
he gives you information this is Phil if
you go over URLs and tell you what the
URL is and you have to identify it as a
phishing attack or as a real saying if
you you're trying to eat all the
different fit of the worms on here if
you fall for phishing attack then he
actually gets roped up hooked up and
taken away but it's ok because you have
three lives and this is your dad you can
always ask for help one of the things
we're emphasizing is that you can always
ask for help and so that is because in
the real world you can always use search
engines you can also call up your
friends or call customer service as well
too ok so that's the human side of
things any other questions before we go
on to the computer side of things ok so
so again I'm going to talk about the
email in tight fit I won't be talking
about email anti-phishing filter we did
I will be talking about the automated
test bed that we did to evaluate the
Santa fishing tool bars and our own
anti-phishing toolbar so the question
we're trying to answer if the first part
is how accurate are today's
anti-phishing toolbars ok so there's
again there's roughly about 90 or so
anti-phishing toolbars if you go to
download com you'll list about 9000 them
a lot of these are built into security
software suites some of them offered by
ISPs some of our free download some of
them are built into the latest browsers
so for example the latest version of
internet explorer has one built in and
Liz version of Firefox has Google's
built in as well ok so right these two
right here the top one is what internet
explorer's looks like it is a blocking
website it actually tells you this is a
reported phishing website and tells you
the URL this bottom one is the is
Firefox with the Google search google
toolbar install and actually it gives
you this large warning telling you not
to fall for it but again we're trying
we're interested more in how well do
they actually work in terms of detecting
fish so this is sort of a separate
problem too because one issue here is
well how well do people actually
recognize that it's a phishing attack
that's sort of the human side of things
and we're looking more on the
computational side of things right now
which is how effective are the actual
algorithms that they're using ok so
here's sort of a rough time on what we
did in april 2006 we did a manual
evaluation of 5 toolbars this required
an army of undergraduates to get
and let me tell you it was not fun to do
and we do this over two week period and
cost us great deal in terms of pizza
summer 2006 we had a very talented PhD
student that was visiting us from
University of Pittsburgh he created a
semi-automated testbed I've described in
a second more of how that this actually
works in September 2006 we did automated
valuation five toolbars took us about
one or two days and we use the AP WG
feed a PWD stands for anti-phishing
working group it's a consortium of
companies and they actually have a
fishing feed that members of this can
actually acquire and in november two
thousand six we did automated valuation
of ten different toolbars and we use a
different website this time you use fish
tank calm as a source of fishing URLs so
fish tank calm is basically trying to do
with the same thing as a PWG is doing in
terms of anybody on the Internet can
submit a what they think is a fishing
URL or phishing email and then other
people can also rate how effective those
URLs are whether it's actually the fish
are not we evaluated 100 phishing
websites and 5-10 legitimate sites in
just two days okay so this is much
better in terms of performance in terms
of evaluation time so this work is about
to be polish in ndss the security
conference and if again if you actually
I do have copies of this paper here with
me right now so if you want paper copies
I can get them to you after this talk
okay so again the reason for creating a
an automated test bed is that the main
evaluation was very tedious and slow so
the idea was can we just create a test
bed and we just give it a set of URLs
and it just we already know beforehand
whether they're fish or not and then the
tool of the test bed will just run off
invite all the different toolbars and
just come up with statistics at the end
so one question is how do we automate
this for different toolbars because a
lot of the api's are not open for these
toolbars so what we and also they're
also running on different web browsers
so what we decided to do is take an
image based approach which is we know
what the toolbars should look like if
it's a phishing attack or not because
they have some kind of signal there they
either turn red or they put up a block
or something like that so we just use a
very simple image based approach which
is well if we know this web browser
shows green yellow or red
and we know where it should be in the
web browser we just take a screenshot of
the web browser clip out the right part
of it and compare it to our a priori
image so it's very simple approach and
it actually worked quite well for us if
you're interested in this test bed we
just put it together and is available
for download actually I don't know if it
has a URL yet but you can get a copy of
it if you want so roughly speaking here
is the architecture we take a fishing
feed again either from a PWG or from
fish tank calm I get sent to a task
manager the role the task manager is
just to delegate all the URLs to a
specific web browser with a specific
tool bar inside of it and also
aggregates all the statistics it sends
URLs to various workers each worker is
responsible for a single web browser and
a single kind of tool bar it downloads
the web page right now we're using the
tour anonymizer because we also don't
want all these phishing sites know that
we're doing this or whenever we're
scanning for them it comes back it says
whether it's a scam or not and then just
sends the data back up to the task
manager and aggregates all statistics
okay so something that's very
interesting too is that how in terms of
how do we get these URLs to find the
phishing attacks so we need a source
that has lots of fresh fishing URLs we
can't use the tool or blacklist
themselves because or if we do do that
then we can't evaluate the same tool bar
because otherwise we'd get one hundred
percent sites also get taken down within
a few days the average time a website
official website is up is about four and
a half days it turns out we also want
you to observe how fast blacklists get
updated obviously the faster it's get
updated the better it is and we also
experimented with several sources so to
give you more information to a PWG is
very high volume it gets lots of raw
emails people just forward emails and
think our phishing attacks there's lots
of duplicates and there's also some
legitimate URLs included inside of them
so it's also some false positives for
fish tank on its lower volume but it's
far easier to extract the fishing URLs
so it turns out they just give you an
adpi for forgetting these there's also
another fish archives that we've
experimented with we tried accumulating
are ones ourselves but they're also
they're typically low volume we're not
very fresh kinds of emails so it turns
out that the choice of your feed that
you're using actually impacts your
results
the results i'm about to show you there
are roughly order magnitude might be
plus or minus ten percent depending on
you know the weather or how many emails
you get and so on so but I mean roughly
speaking there roughly correct okay so
we tested ten different toolbars you
know I won't read them all off over here
we most of these use black lists and
simple heuristics so spoof guard this is
one that's developed by Stanford
University this is the only one that
relies solely on heuristics everything
else as far as we could tell relies
partly on black list and maybe a few
simple heuristics yeah and now on to our
results oh the next one how do we
actually get our URLs so we used 100
mainly confirmed fresh fish from fish
tank calm so fish tank actually has a
staging area for URLs so whenever a
person actually submits the URL it goes
in one area then somebody else or
several people have to validate that
actually is a fish and then that goes on
to their main feed so we use the onion
validated feed or not invalidate
unvalidated feed currently to do that
and the reason for that is because we
believe that some of the toolbars
already use the validated feed so we
want to try to make sure that we didn't
have any kind of crosstalk there in fact
i think the the google toolbar uses the
fish tank I believe we also had 60
legitimate sites that were linked to buy
phishing messages so we kept those and
try to see how or how bad some of the
toolbars war in misidentifying
legitimate websites is illegitimate so
those are false positives and we also
had 510 legitimate sites that were
tested by another company called three
sharp in a September 2006 report okay so
here's a very large graph that shows the
results okay so one thing that you
notice immediately is that mcafee
protection is not very good and with a
total amount of 0% but since I'm being
recorded I want to add a important
caveat which is that this is the
marketing problem is not mcafee problem
so the marketing website says that it
protects you from these kind of online
scams but when we talk to them
themselves they said that well you know
that's really what the marketers said
that we didn't really claim that and so
I we believe that there's also another
version of this that actually does do
this correctly and they have given us
access to do that so in the next version
of this we will show much better results
for mcafee I'm sure
another interesting one is the one at
the very top that spoof guard so you
notice it's roughly about 90% all pretty
much all throughout so that's very good
results but you also notice that there's
a little caveat there and one of those
little post-it note notes at the very
top thirty eight percent of false
positives okay so that's basically
saying you know you really go to a
legitimate website and it says hey this
is a scam alright so that's not really
that great it's pretty good results in
terms of the false in the terms of the
true negatives of finding phishing
websites but not so great at false
positives I guess one that probably
would be of interest here is internet
explorer so you notice that in explorer
is it's near the seventy percent level
right now so that's actually quite good
that's their latest version of internet
explorer and then there's the google
toolbar which does slightly better over
time you notice that increases after
about you know 12 and 24 hours so that's
a that's pretty good results so overall
if we just summarize the results well
there's only one tool bar with greater
than ninety percent accuracy and
unfortunately has high false-positive
rate several toolbars catch about the
seventy eighty five percent level so
that's pretty good with very few false
positives one thing that's important to
note is after about 15 minutes of
training this is roughly about how
people do as well in the training that I
described earlier so you know maybe if
we do a combination of the two that
might be pretty good there's few
improvements and catch rates seen over
24 hours so this is just that most two
bars are not taking advantage of
available fish fees to quickly update
the blacklist okay so if you go back
again you notice that there's very few
upturns after time like for example next
cape one does the google one does and
that's an netcraft does as well so
there's not a lot of these feeds that
are updated yes
they're using that other
yeah but the problem is that a lot of
these are sure like black boxes so this
more of our conjecture as to how they
work so we're trying to reverse engineer
them oh so the question is is the optic
really uptick really because of using
the available fishing feeds and we
believe so I let's see what else so it
seems like a combination of heuristics
and having a frequently updated
blacklist is probably the most promising
approach yes as question in the back
we're not sure we don't really I can
really say one way or another we don't
have empirical data on that I could
probably take a wild guess if you want
me to it doesn't know that gets better I
mean just being the best approaches just
do as well as you can as fast as you can
i mean this pull the most obvious answer
but i really don't know about how often
people check the emails and what not yes
another question positive this call do
follow this actually matters the
question so if you're sort of our
thinking on this the true positives are
good because that means you correctly
legit identify legitimate site as
legitimate false positives are can be
annoying and if you are that site it
could be detrimental false negatives
where it's actually a phishing website
and you don't identify as the phishing
website are the absolute worst ones so
it sort of depends on your perspective
if you are the user and you get a false
positive is probably not a big deal but
if you are that company maybe they well
they might sue you so that could be
pretty bad just as a question
okay so i understand correctly you're
saying that if you get too many false
positives then people might start
ignoring the errors right right yeah
yeah that's probably good that's a good
point to write which is the human side
of things if you get that many high
false positives you might start ignoring
everything that your browser is telling
you right okay any other questions is
what we're going yes you know right so
the Stanford spoofcard actually does use
a whitelist the problem is that i think
that there's far more legitimate sites
that are out there that you can easily
encapsulate inside of a whitelist and
plus the other problem to which is quite
interesting one is that the way that
some of the scammers are getting past
something's blacklist is that they
attack legitimate websites and then host
their fake website on top of it so we've
seen stuff like you know Rolling Stones
fan club sites that have been broken
into which is a legitimate site but then
that one small part that is a new URL
that actually contains a scam there's
actually a famous incident in Hong Kong
a few months ago where one bank's
website was broken into and it hosted
and probably wasn't them but it hosted
an attack on another bank in Hong Kong
too so you can imagine that being a
serious problem so this sort of a
balanced added me to be taken with white
list too because you know this sort of
comes with vulnerability and you have to
make sure that if you put all your eggs
in one basket you have to really watch
that basket closely okay great question
let me go on quickly okay so we are
planning to periodically repeat the
study every quarter just to see how
things are updated and again you should
only consider this as a rough ordering
so you know depending on which fishing
feed were using things might be up or
down five ten percent we're not quite
sure exactly what but you know again
these I think that roughly speaking
these are in the right order of
magnitude okay the last thing I want
talk about is our anti-phishing toolbar
that we've been using and to do this is
probably good to take a few steps back
into you know I guess in recent history
this this is some work that was
developed at UC Berkeley a few years ago
by tom felton Robert wallensky Tom
Phelps was a PhD student there Robert
lenski is still professor there and what
they're trying to do was develop a way
of having robust hyperlinks that would
survive 404 not found problems okay so
the basic idea is you know you click on
a
link and then it takes you to page not
found you know the servant knowing so
they were trying to see can we solve
this problem once and for all and their
idea was a pretty simple idea that it
seemed to work pretty well which was
what if we added a small lexical
signature to urls and if the actual URL
fails then you feed that lexical
signature into a search engine and then
that search engine would probably lead
you back to the page that you were
looking for or highly related page so
the lexical signature might look
something like this so if your actual
URL you want to get to with ABC com /
page I HTML and then the question mark
after work will probably be ignored by
most web servers and then you can
actually include your electrical
signature there if this URL returned to
404 then maybe your browser could
automatically feed all those words into
a search engine and then hopefully you
would be able to find your actual page
so this all hinges on the question of
how do you actually generate the
signature that is effective and through
some of their and formal experiments and
evaluations they found that an algorithm
called tf-idf term frequency inverse
document frequency is actually quite
effective for this so tf-idf is probably
the most well-known information
retrieval algorithm and let me give you
an intuition to how it works you want to
find tf-idf the TF parts trans for term
frequency you want to find words that
are very common on a web page and the
IDF is inverse document frequency you
want to make sure those words are not
comment on other web pages so for
example if you want to e base webpages
the word ebay and auction are probably
quite common on ebay as web pages but
very rare on any other random web page
out there okay so their idea was if you
apply to UF IDF to a web page and you
find the words when the highest scores
then how many words would you actually
need for this algorithm to work and they
found through some informal evaluations
that five words is actually effective
for finding most of the web pages that
you want okay so this is sort of a
surprising finding you only need five
words and you can usually get back to
the web page you're looking for so we're
thinking about this more and we're
thinking well could we actually adapt
the same algorithm for anti-phishing and
so part of the rationale we think this
works well is because scammers often
directly copy web pages so you notice
here the fake via ebay web page in the
bay web page they're pretty much the
same in terms of the actual content the
only thing that's different is what
URL that this thing is sending the data
to the other thing too which is sort of
the preview of the Google how we use the
Google search engine the fake one should
actually have a lower PageRank too
because there's not a lot of other web
pages that are linking to this okay so
in theory this if you put the same words
into it if you extract the words from
this you should get to this page and not
the fake one because no one's really
linking to this and it should have a
relatively young age again because most
phishing websites are up or only four
and a half days so here's the rough
algorithm how it works given a current
web page calculate the tf-idf for each
word on the page take the five terms to
the highest weights feed those terms
into a search engine which currently we
are using google and then if the domain
name of the web page you're currently on
is in the top and search results then we
consider it legitimate and so we
experimented with n as well to we
discovered that you know after 30 is
pretty much the same results so it's not
in the top 30 results then you know it's
pretty much the same okay so here's an
example what the ebay one would look
like so the tf-idf words for the ebay
web pages i just shown where ebay user
sign help and forgot and you might
notice that let's see which one is it
it's this one right here so this is one
two three four five the fifth result is
actually the correct web page so this is
actually a pretty good result you also
notice that a lot of the other ones the
house I have by ebay com paypal calm
inside of it as well too so again just
by checking the domain names this turns
out that this would have detected the
fake one and the legitimate one would
have identified this correctly okay so
our first evaluation for this we had a
hundred fishing URL from from fish tank
comm100 legitimate URLs from three
sharps study and so we tried a few
variations of this tf-idf algorithm the
first one this this one right here it's
called basic tf-idf it's just you know
just using the algorithm i described the
true negatives in terms of identifying
phishing websites is ninety-four percent
which is pretty good unfortunately the
false positive rate is about thirty
percent so that's not too good so we
also added a few heuristics very simple
heuristics see if we can fix this so the
next one is basic tf-idf plus domain and
so basically this means we'll add in the
domain name of the website you're
currently on
as one of the terms into Google so
basically instead of having five Wars
now at six words and so for the ebay
example it would also just add in the
eboard ebay again so basically we'll be
there twice so unfortunately the true
negative decreases the sixty-seven
percent so that means it's not as
effective for identifying phishing
websites but you'll notice that the
false positive rate also degrees is down
to ten percent so that's one of the
trade-offs here we tried another
approach called tf-idf plus zmp so zmp
means zero results means fishing so if
you don't get any results we identify
that as fishing so just trying it by
itself this just to just as a proof of
concept we don't really intend for this
be a the actual algorithm use but just
the proof of concept you'll notice that
it's pretty much the same as the true
negative as the original algorithm and
it really doesn't have any effect with
false positive however the interesting
thing happens when you combine those two
results together those two teristics so
when combined the tf-idf plus including
the domain name plus including the zero
is also means fishing you'll notice we
get our best results which is
ninety-seven percent in terms of
identifying fish and websites and only
ten percent in terms of false positives
so we think that's pretty good results
yes please
so in this case the true negative yeah
this is something that we also get
sometimes confused because I'll which
ones are true positives and negatives
true negative means it identified a
phishing website correctly try think we
got that one right so basically the
question is is a website legitimate and
so if it's legitimate we called it a
positive and it's negative we set if it
was right yeah so I actually have a
diagram showing this at the end too and
I think we need to come up with better
terms because again our group also gets
confused in the terms as well sometimes
but the main thing is that this is
correctly identifying fake websites this
one is in correctly identifying
legitimate websites okay so some
discussion pretty good results but the
false positives you know ten percent so
you know it's it's okay but not great so
what we did was we added several more
heuristics to reduce the false positives
many of these heuristics have been used
by other other toolbars and other
algorithms as well too so we won't claim
that we invented these but some of these
include the age of the domain so if it's
less than 12 months old if already if it
has known images so for example if has
like google's logo or has ebays logo or
so on suspicious to urls once i have the
the at sign or a dash suspicious links
so any links that i also have the same
characters it has IP address in the URL
my favorite one is number of dots in the
URL it turns out that if you have more
than five dots in URL is probably a
phishing website if the page contains a
text entry field so the rationale behind
this one is that if there's no way for
the person to communicate you know
typing their information then is
probably not going to be a phishing
website so this means that we don't
consider the this one doesn't detect the
email once where they expect you to
apply for a job for example and send in
your resume and then finally we also
include the TF idea so this use is a
very simple forward linear model to wait
these so just the intuition here is we
try to figure out which ones are the
most useful in terms of identifying
phishing websites and then those would
have a greater weight than the other
ones so the ones I turned out have the
greatest way turn out to be these two
and the other ones are you know sort of
a small order of magnitude for the small
effect there
so what we do in the second evaluation
it was we compared this to spoof garden
netcraft so again spoofcard is one
develop I Stanford uses all heuristics
and had very high accuracy in terms of
identifying fake websites but had pretty
had a pretty high false positive too we
also compared this to netcraft the
latest version 1.7 which we believe uses
some cure with sticks but we're not sure
because again it's a black box and also
has an extensive blacklist to it went is
some our earlier experiments neck crack
was the best one and the one I showed
you it was probably number three or so
so we took this time we did a slightly
different evaluation we took 100 fishing
URLs from fish tank calm again and this
time we did for the legitimate URLs we
took sites that are often attacked so we
took city bank and paypal and some other
ones we also took the top pages from
Alexa so these are the most popular
websites and we also took some random
web pages from random yahoo com just to
see how well this would actually work so
roughly about 30 in each of these so the
results so again this is how well the
toolbar can actually identify a fake
website correctly so we final tf-idf
this is the one that I described to you
earlier this is without Andy heuristics
so I did about ninety seven percent in
this case in identifying fake websites
so that's really good and had about six
percent false positive rate in this case
so the difference between the six and
the ten percent i think is probably the
statistical noise but we haven't really
done any tests on this sort of more of
my conjecture here is our algorithm with
the heuristics built in so you notice
that our accuracy and detecting fig
website has decreased from 97 to 89% but
you also notice that the false positive
has decreased down to one percent so we
think that's pretty good you'll see that
spoof guard is ninety-one percent and
has a forty-eight percent in false
positive rate in this case and neck
craft has ninety-seven percent accuracy
and zero percent false positive and we
believe that this is because they
actually do have a person or several
people they're manually verifying every
single one that goes through them okay
so we think these are pretty good
results because here we're using
automated algorithm that does roughly as
well as netcraft except has some of the
false positives there
so false negative is basically take a
hundred percent and subtract from here
so in this case we had three percent
false negative in this basic algorithm
and this one had eleven percent okay and
actually discuss some what are the
actual right so the false positive or
the false negatives actually I have the
wrong term up there that should say the
false negatives or turn out to be
primarily this javascript attack that is
sort of recent among lots of these
different phishing websites so what the
javascript attack is is you go to a
website and then the javascript will
load in the other website and then
change something in the Dom so it
actually redirect the information to
them so we're actually adding a special
heuristic just to detect the specific
javascript attack there's also some
limitations to our approach it doesn't
work very well for non-english websites
the problem the reason for this is
because if you have an Asian language
website for example is really hard to
get document frequency or word frequency
across the entire corpus or across
entire web so this probably requires
some specific approaches for Asian
languages there's some system system
performance issues because here we're
query in Google every single time to
actually get the results of what whether
it's legit amor not and we've also been
considering how would criminal is
actually attack this so the most obvious
one is what there were you doing with
spam which is to use all images rather
than words so this would probably
require some more OCR if you want to do
that which would further impact system
performance unfortunately the good news
is criminals aren't doing this yet the
bad news is again criminals are actually
quite smart and so they probably will be
doing this soon if this is deployed this
question
legitimate companies that's not use them
it's possible again the criminals are
poly smarter than we expect so I mean
it's not clear to me what's going to
happen afterwards but if you look at
what's going on with spam right now I
mean they try images to put these random
dots inside of it just to to foil all
the filters I suspect that they will be
clever and tried to figure out ways of
doing this so probably the best thing to
do is you know work on this early and
try to figure out how they would how how
criminals will defeat it and try to get
a step ahead of them right now invisible
text is another issue but I think this
is easily detectable and circumventing
tf-idf and page rank so we're actually
not sure how if it's actually easy to do
this or not we have our suspicions that
tf-idf is fairly robust it's actually
quite hard to subvert this and my
suspicion is that you know over here
google that page rank is being attacked
all the time by search engine
optimization companies my suspicion is
that that's also fairly hard to
circumvent as well to or to subvert but
again you know we don't have any
statistics or data on how well or how
hard or easy it is to do this ok so the
quick summary this last slide again we
are large multidisciplinary team at
Carnegie Mellon looking at trust
decisions currently focusing on
anti-phishing I describe some of the
human side of things that we're doing
with respect to interviews to understand
how do people make decisions well ques
do people look for and so on I describe
some of the embedded training that we've
been doing to try to train people
surreptitiously in the context of the
regular email use and i'll also describe
anti-phishing game that we've done on
the computer side of things i described
to automate a testbed for anti fitting
toolbars and our current anti-phishing
toolbar that again uses the google
search engine to find a lot of these
scams ok so that's it for me are there
any other questions rigas
okay well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
