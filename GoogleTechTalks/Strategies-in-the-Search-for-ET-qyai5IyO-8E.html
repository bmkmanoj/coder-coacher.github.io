I have a couple of friends and two of
them are competing against each other
one of them is Chris McKay who works
across the street that mass Ames and he
searches for life in the solar system
yes we have Rovers on Mars we have
missions that are planned and going
there and I'm gonna try to find
something to make it worthwhile say that
we have discovered something in the
solar system my other friend is seth
shostack he searches for intelligent
life which we probably won't find in the
solar system but if we find intelligent
life
that'll compare to Chris McKay as
finding I don't know finding in New York
and finding a steak in a refrigerator I
guess it would be the single most
exciting discovery since the discovery
of fire so I want to introduce such a
stack he works at the SETI Institute
across 101 here were very good friends
with the Institute we're trying to
cooperate with them and he's been a
radio astronomer I mean he has a degree
in physics from Cornell University and
the PhD in astronomy for the Cal from
the California Institute of Technology
and he's been working with SETI for a
long time where he is among other things
hosting a radio show are we alone he's
co-written and our third books one of
which is the confessions of an Alien
Hunter and it's just out of print just
out in print and let's see what else can
we say about that oh he was a guest at a
commercial just recently so there are
probably clips of him on YouTube it's a
very funny guy and I'm really really
glad he's here today with us thank you
Thank You Boris and I always recommend
that you don't applaud before the talk
because you only regret that later
listen it's a fairly intimate crowd we
could just all go out for lunch and talk
about this and you could grill me like a
cheese sandwich and you know ask me all
the questions you know I'm gonna
deliberately avoid dealing with here but
I'm supposed to stay behind this lectern
how many of you heard of said he talked
before from Jill tarter or me or anybody
else
okay so mostly you know there the idea
here right we're trying to find the
aliens by eavesdropping on radio waves
maybe light waves stuff like that so I'm
not gonna tell you about that I'm just
gonna throw out some ideas about how we
might improve this experiment you know
thinking about it from the aliens point
of view because generally speaking the
aliens don't get a whole lot of
representation here on earth except for
the ones that occasionally haul you out
of your bedroom at night so and Bohr
says you've got to be out of here by
5:30 so I thought I would just talk at
you for a little bit and then we'll open
this up to questions all right
improving say why we think they're out
there let me just back up here for a
moment because some of you may doubt
that they actually are out there how
many of you think that there are aliens
out there to be found
hi you know this is preaching to the
choir how many of you think no probably
not
all right yeah I want to talk to you
later yes this is the reason we think
they're out there okay this is just one
of the Hubble Deep Field photos tiny
little bit of this guy really very small
part of the sky you see a couple of
nearby stars here just a laser pointer
it's a pan I'll just name this okay but
but virtually everything in this photo
here is a galaxy right our own galaxy
has 300 billion stars in it plus or
minus maybe two yeah hundreds of
billions of stars and if you took photos
like this all across the sky you'd count
about a hundred billion galaxies right
so you've already multiplied those two
numbers together in your head that's the
number of stars we can see in the part
of the universe we can see like 10 to
the 22 that's roughly the number glasses
of water and all the beach all the
oceans of the earth so that's that's a
big number
of course what really counts is how many
planets are out there and we don't
really know that I mean those of you who
open up the papers if you remember what
a paper is
and read about planetary discoveries you
know that we found maybe 350 planets
around other stars that per say it's not
a very interesting number what's
interesting is what fraction of stars
have planets and I asked Geoff Marcy
he's a guy here in the Bay Area who's
found probably more planets than anybody
else on this this on the earth and I
said Jeff if you had perfect telescopes
what fraction of stars do you think
would show planets and he can judge that
on the basis of the statistics of
discovery so far and his answer was well
maybe half maybe three-quarters well to
an astronomer of course those numbers
are the same as all right I mean what's
factor of two don't worry about factors
to do maybe IRS does but we don't so in
fact what that's saying and since you
know as Karen Rick Anderson pointed out
to me planets are like kittens you don't
just get one you know you get maybe a
fiver we used to have nine now we have
eight but you know you get on the order
of ten that means the number of planets
is like ten to the 23 which is you know
roughly the number of grains of sand on
all the beaches of North America so for
the gentleman here in the second row who
thinks this is the only grain of sand
where anything is interesting is
happening this guy believes in miracles
and you should you know get to know him
better because he's got you know that's
a very audacious point of view and it
could be right but it might be wrong all
right if there's another bit of evidence
here indirect evidence that suggests
that maybe you aren't the only
intelligent beings in the universe this
is a photo I made of the rock in
northwestern Australia the Pilbara Hills
couple years ago this rock is pretty old
we know how old it is it's three and a
half billion years old we know that age
actually to 2% there's no doubt about
that
you can see these sort of cauliflower
like things in there and those are what
are known as stromatolites are
fossilized stromatolites
they're just big mounds of stuff built
by bacteria three and a half billion
years ago now those have you been paying
attention know that the earth is about
four and a half billion years old and of
course for the first couple hundred
million years earth wasn't such a
wonderful place and all these big rocks
slamming into the planet all the time
ruining your
day keeping the place hot molten and
unattractive but that stopped 3.8
billion years ago and by 3.5 billion
years ago there were already traces of
life life had gotten started so the the
point here is that as soon as the earth
could support like BAM there was life
now that sort of like walking into a
casino in Vegas you know putting in a
quarter and hitting the jackpot you know
a couple of conclusions you could draw
one is that must have been an easy bet
or you were really lucky and since you
only have a sample of one of course you
can't really say very much more than
that but this is at least suggested that
maybe this is an easy bet that maybe
life is something that's going to infect
a lot of different worlds however there
is this bottom line we've not found any
evidence for life beyond Earth and that
includes pond scum to quote the former
president dead or alive right
you may remember 1996 they thought they
had found dead pond scum in this Martian
meteorite remember that big story big
you know big headlines in The New York
Times you can read those headlines from
low-flying aircraft it was really big
and a lot of my neighbors are saying you
Seth why should I be impressed by this
you know they're talking about dead pond
scum from Mars
I've got live pond scum in my bathtub
right so what's the deal here and the
deal is if you find that there was life
on the next planet outright that tells
you life's not a miracle just just an
infection it's all over the place okay
but unfortunately that turned out not to
be very compelling but any case now I'm
gonna talk about intelligent life Boris
already told you about Chris McKay's
search for life here in the solar system
chris is looking for a stupid life and
that's okay by me there's undoubtedly a
lot more stupid life than intelligent
life I know that all I have to do is
look at my neighbors here in Mountain
View and I know that's true but when you
talk about intelligent life that would
be interesting to find because at least
it might hold up its side of the
conversation right now what do we mean
by intelligence I've said this before
here at Google our definition of
intelligence is very operational
straightforward if you can build a radio
transmitter you're intelligent good
enough right so ask the guy sitting next
to you hey can you build a radio
transmitter and now you know how to
treat them for the rest of your tenure
here at Google
you see this guy here he's uh you know
he's clearly 30,000 years after this
photo was made he's building a radio
transmitter so he's gonna be intelligent
you can tell he's intelligent he's
adding some RAM to his computer there
okay the crowd which was not attracted
to begin with turned ugly okay we don't
know how likely that is by the way
because if I give you a million worlds
with life what fraction of them are ever
gonna cook up intelligence and you might
think well look what happened here and
it did but you know maybe that was
really accidental I mean it could be 65
million years ago those of you who are
reading the papers then may recall there
was this big story about a rock that
slammed into the Yucatan wiped out the
dinosaurs and three-quarters of
everything else right and had that rock
arrived 20 hours earlier you wouldn't be
suffering through this little
presentation there would be dinosaurs in
Mountain View okay so it's a little
unclear whether you actually get
intelligence but there a lot of people
who are a lot of people there at least a
handful of people who are working on
various theories about what made us
smart I'm not going to go into that but
let me just show something about well
the increase in cephalization this is
sort of interesting because it shows
that they say every time you show a plot
you lose 10% of the audience oh yeah I
got 12 lori moreno who's a biologist at
Emory University in Atlanta but yeah
what she's plotted here is some dolphins
being everybody's favorite intelligent
animal other than our simian relatives
okay and so right you can look at their
SAT scores and convince yourself but you
know they develop echolocation at some
point here about 35 years ago
two million years ago the smartest
critters on the planet were we're
dolphins right and I know what your
hiring policy is with regard to dolphins
but they were pretty smart at least two
million years ago they beat us or at
least our ancestors but the point here
is that you know some dolphins have
gotten quite a bit smarter and the fact
that the Dolphins have but also you know
octopuses some birds and obviously
simians that suggests that intelligence
is not really just a niche market deal
that there's actually a market for
intelligence in various niches and it
might arise on many worlds
here's another theory that I kind of
like signaling for fitness this is due
to Jeff Miller at the University of New
Mexico he's that got books out on this
it's got a new book called spent but I'm
not sure what that has to do with its
but it has something to do with it he
says the reason we got smart was because
of the dating behavior of our ancestors
right it says look for a lot of if you
will complex critters the whole mating
ritual consists of the male's display
and the females decide it's mostly guys
in the audience and you know this is
true but in the canonical example here
are our peacocks right the peahens are
sitting around looking at these peacocks
on their blue feathers right and say wow
that guy's moved feathers pretty good
but this guy's blue feathers are better
and they take him home to mom now what's
in it for the pee hand with her little
pea-brain to pick the guy with the blue
feathers I mean they only attract
predators like that they're dangerous to
have all those blue feathers but the
thing is if he made it this far he's
still walking around he's clever enough
to avoid the Predators good genes and in
fact the very fact that he grew those
blue feathers in the first place must
mean that you know he's got good genes
because it's not easy metabolically to
grow those things well in the case of
primates we don't blue feathers but our
brain is very tightly connected to our
genome if your brains wired up correctly
and probably for some of you it is then
that means you don't have too many
mutations in the genome okay so for the
bet the best strategy for males here is
when you go to parties you know you just
take off your skull pass your brain
around all the women hey check it out
and
and if they see it's wired up correctly
then you know they might be interested
because not because they're interested
in having you be smart don't kid
yourself because you don't have too many
mutations in the genome the kids may be
healthy right that's what it's all about
so you know you get guys like this who
you know very popular because obviously
you know a few mutations so so the you
know the men's IQs are all being
ratcheted up of course the Miller always
immediately gets asked why the women get
smart you said well the females under
are under a lot of selective pressure to
be charismatic and interesting because
otherwise the guys wander off you know
and don't pay the bill or something I
mean you know they take the resources
somewhere else okay well you know this
is slightly controversy other people
agree and other people who don't agree
but my point here is that this is a very
simple mechanism that you would get in
any sort of Darwinian system and
consequently maybe intelligence is
fairly commonplace okay how could we
find it well we could just look for big
things
this doesn't mean if in marine worlds
yeah you could do this and we don't do
very much of it dyson sphere's whatever
yummy remember the universe is three
times as old as the earth most of the
stars out there are older than the Sun
there's been plenty of time when I say
plenty of time I mean billions of years
for other societies to get way ahead of
us now you worry about the competition
these guys are billions of years I had
all right and so maybe they've done
something that's so big and so obvious
that we could just see it right we don't
look for this stuff very much
but we could if you can think of an
experiment you know you might want to do
this in the privacy of your own home
okay another way we might get in touch
is just to look for signals and that's
what SETI is all about but you know it's
mostly radio but we also do optical SETI
which is to say look for flashing lights
and that makes sense
fine diamond city here's here's a star
like the Sun alright g-type star you
know when I say it's like the Sun I
don't mean it has the same personality
as the Sun I mean it has the same
brightness and mass and you know that's
how many watts it puts out like 10 to
the 26 by the way the earth
or should I say Homo sapiens runs on
about 10 to the 13 watts that's a good
number for your next cocktail party no
that number you know that's all the
automobiles the trucks the Wiis that you
know the iPhones the power your the
lights all that stuff about 10 to 13 so
you see we have plenty of headroom here
you got 10 to the 13 watts sorry 10 to
the 13 times as much power is available
from the Sun if we would just not let it
go out into space where it doesn't do
anything except show up on somebody
else's star charts hell yeah okay so 10
to the 26 watts is what the Sun puts out
that's more or less that number of
photons per second and at a hundred
light years if you're looking at the Sun
with a with a telescope that has a
mirror that's you know that big you'll
get a hundred million photons per second
however the interesting thing is this if
you take the world's biggest laser which
after all they're not very far away
they're over probably in Lawrence
Livermore whatever you know they're
using them for fusion experiments and
all that protect our nuclear weapons
from other nuclear weapons or whatever
you take the biggest of those lasers
which produce really short flashes of
light like a nanosecond
right yame one of those babies into a
mirror the size of this table over here
1 meter mirror and aimed at a hundred
light years away just work the numbers
it's a one line calculation and it turns
out that you will put a hundred to a
thousand photons in to that mirror at
100 light years where's the light from
the stars obviously less than one photon
I mean oh you just put this in words
lasers we can build a day 50 years or so
after the invention of the laser are
already powerful enough to outshine the
Sun if you have a 1 meter mirror and you
only care about out shining the Sun for
a nanosecond we can do that already so
you know they could be sending pulses to
us they could be sending bits this way
using a big laser we can do it we can do
it they can do it all right so we should
look for these flashing lights in the
sky and in fact up at the Lick
Observatory which is after all only an
hour and a half away from here we've had
an experiment we don't have it running
now because we don't have a labor to
open up the doumitt light at night any
of you that happened to live up on Mount
Hamilton come see me later well get you
to do this
UC Santa Cruz it just has a bunch of
photomultiplier if you're very fast
photon detectors right you're just
looking for flashing lights when you
point this thing at some nearby stars I
think this is a very good experiment to
do very little out of little of it as
being done it's being done by UC
Berkeley or was who was being done by us
or was it is still being done by Harvard
but that's it you could be in this biz
alright of course mostly what we do is
this you know radio SETI you've heard
about this before have you have you seen
this movie yeah okay
there you see jodie foster in front of
the Very Large Array there in New Mexico
waiting for the aliens because the Very
Large Array it's never been used for
this kind of work but still it's
photogenic Matthew McConaughey it
doesn't actually do anything in the
movie but you know whenever you say that
a mixed company the women all say
doesn't matter so there he is
but this was based on the work of our
Institute I was actually one of the many
many consultants at the Institute for
this film and Warner Brothers would call
up just about every day with a yet
another question and one I remember is
so Steph what does it look like when you
fly through a wormhole did that last
week let me tell you about it yeah more
stories but you know later hi
historically prefer to approach by the
way the fact that it's historically
preferred doesn't mean that it's better
in terms of the physics right there's
too much history and SETI it's my
opinion it's 50 years old and that's
that's part of the problem and we
invented radio before we invented lasers
I think that has a lot to do with the
fact that we continue to look in the
radio but it makes sense to look in the
radio we've always used other people's
antennas like this one down to Puerto
Rico the Arecibo telescope it it's
appeared in several movies you may have
seen it there if you haven't visited
this thing you know book a flight to
Puerto Rico this afternoon go down and
take a look at it before the National
Science Foundation takes it apart and
carts it away because they're
threatening to do that but it's a very
big antenna it's a thousand feet across
told four billion scoops of
baskin-robbins not a good idea in the
tropics but we could only get it now
then right we couldn't use it all the
time because it's being used for
conventional astronomy research all
right so that meant we were trying to do
SETI the way you would have to do say
cancer research but you always had to
borrow somebody else's microscope right
obviously that slows you down and
that's been a problem only occasionally
listen what we're looking for these
narrowband signals the things you see
there because those are the kinds of
signals transmitters make but not nature
quasars pulsars they make lots of radio
noise but it never looks like that so
that's what we look for okay
you're just some numbers let me just get
to the bottom line on these numbers if
you get nothing else out of this and
they've got a transmitter aimed at us
and they've got an antenna behind that
transmitter that's the same size as
something we already built in Puerto
Rico 40 years ago then we can hear them
if their transmitter and a power is 10
to the fourth that's 10,000 watts 10
kilowatts well your local easy-listening
am station has 10 kilowatts right so so
the bottom line here is that despite
what you might think given the enormous
distances involved it's possible to send
bits of information from one star to the
next using the kind of technology that
we already have a hundred years after
Marconi that's really the bomb line it
really makes sense to look for signals
because it's easy this is easy this is
easy okay but we've only looked at 750
stars you know people say but yeah all
right it sounds like it makes sense we
haven't found anything have you and the
answer to that is yeah I haven't found
anything we haven't found anything if we
had I wouldn't be here I mean you guys
are nice and Boris gave me a pretty good
lunch there but if we'd really found
something I'd be in Stockholm collecting
a check and having dinner with a king
right
hey would that be better than pata okay
and I think that the reason for that is
because my mom says you know when you're
gonna get a real job Seth mom I don't
want a real job but 50 stars that's just
a tiny sample it's not surprising in
fact if we had found something already I
would have you know I would have eaten
my chapeau because that's such a small
sample would be astounding if we trip
across CT we need a much bigger sample
okay and this just gives you some idea
of the phase space we've looked at it's
virtually empty I mean all the SETI
experiments put the
in the last 50 years of barely scratch
the old proverbial surface okay now let
me just talk a little bit about strategy
because that's really the heart of this
what do we do we we normally point these
antennas at nearby stars that arrow is
sort of like the Sun figuring they may
have planets sort of like the earth that
might have inhabitants sort of like you
right and that's that was the original
idea here and you know it sounds good I
mean if you don't know anything more of
might as well do that it's conservative
and there's nothing wrong with being
conservative but maybe we shouldn't be
so conservative we can look at the
entire sky that's another alternative to
this approach this is what the UC
Berkeley guys do they look at the entire
sky but that's only because they can't
control the telescope they're looking at
the entire sky you might think well
maybe that's better don't make any
assumptions just look at everything
right and and and that that appeals to
me but the point is that if you look at
everything you don't look at any given
direction very long and consequently the
sensitivity is much lower okay so you
know this is looking for your your car
keys not just under the street lamp but
everywhere but you know then the search
at any given point isn't very good you
can do what we do we look at individual
stars this is what Jill tarter and Frank
Drake have been proposing for years and
years and years and we continue to do
that
what kind of stars we look at stars like
the Sun already said that we also are
beginning to look at smaller stars those
of you who aren't astronomy majors here
may not realize it the Sun yeah they say
it's an average star it's not so average
it did pretty well on the verbal but
it's you know one in ten stars is kind
of like the Sun and so 10% of stars are
more or less the same size and
brightness as a Sun 90% of all stars are
dimmer and smaller right and then all
the stars that are bigger and brighter
the ones you see with your naked eye
those are the remaining percentage which
i think is zero but you know it's still
only about 1% so you're not missing much
if you don't count the big guys right so
90% of all stars are smaller than the
Sun you say well why don't you look at
those is there some reason and there
used to be and the reason was well you
take a little dim bulb of a star and the
only way it's going to support life is
if the planets really close right so
that you know it gets enough warmth that
the whole planet does you just freeze
out well it was figured that that wasn't
such a good idea because if the planets
that close
then it
becomes what's called tidally locked
just the way the moon is one side begins
to always face the start that happens
very quickly okay and if one sides
always facing the star then that side of
the plant is going to be toasty and the
other side is gonna be frozen and all
the atmosphere is gonna freeze out on a
pile of snow on the on the cold side and
this is no place for ET but that turned
out to be very naive computer models
show that actually what happens is you
set up weather patterns that convey the
the heat from the hot side to the cold
side and actually a lot of the planet is
a-okay right so that that's a good thing
we can stop looking at you know one star
in ten we can look at you know nine
stars in ten or ten starts at ten really
I mean and maybe this is good news maybe
it's bad news it increases the number of
targets but yeah it's a development we
could also look at other things we could
look at stars that are known to have
planets well we'll do that but you know
I mean we found 350 the might as well
look at them special targets are kind of
like special targets pulsars mystic
pulse ours look one thing et will
recognize is the fact that everybody
where the radio telescope is gonna be
looking at pulsars because you know
they're grad students who need to get a
you know low paying job in academia
somewhere right okay so they're all
gonna be looking at pulsars and why
don't we set up a big transmitter around
this pulsar so anybody's looking at it
they'll also pick up our signal that
says you know join our book club or
whatever it is they want to take say to
you okay we don't do this but we
probably should okay that's not a bad
idea the galactic center all right
here's the galactic center for those of
you who haven't been there recently the
lactic Center which is it's a terrible
place there's a giant black hole down
there and there's all this intense
radiations over time but it is special
aren't you special well it is special
because it's in one place in the galaxy
everybody knows about like I mean we
Captain Kirk or whatever beam somebody
down there's some godforsaken m-class
planet you know I don't know where I'm
supposed to be how am I gonna meet you
down there they always meet one another
somehow but if you just say it's either
the North or the South Pole everybody
can find that right well in the galaxy
there's one unique spot there can never
be more than one but okay and that's the
center of the galaxy so maybe some
really advanced society is set up a big
transmitter in the center of the galaxy
you know here's your GPS for the gun
here's the weather report for the galaxy
here the Google servers for the galaxy
whatever it's all in there okay we all
look there the problem is problem is
it's hard to see from the northern
hemisphere because it turns out that
it's in this southern hemisphere sky you
know among astronomers it said that God
put all the interesting astronomy in the
southern hemisphere and put all the
astronomers in the northern hemisphere I
guess he doesn't want us to know
all right the galactic center we all
look at that black holes black holes are
great if you were really in advanced
society you can get a lot of energy out
of a black hole you know you might think
living near a black hole would really
suck but you don't know you get all this
free energy lipsync binary this was an
idea I had about ten years ago wrote a
little paper about it which garnered
absolutely no interest but let me just
say about half of all stars are doubles
they have buddies pals right and a small
fraction maybe one in 50 of them are
aligned in such a way that the stars
actually occult one another they get in
front of one another and there's
animations Boris's computer runs at 0.2
megahertz but imagine that there's some
aliens hanging out on planets around one
of those stars they'll immediately
colonize the other star system because
it's only a short rocket ride away if
they're really advanced then they'll
have all sorts of telecommunications
between the two systems and when the
stars line up you're looking right down
the data pipe of that society right so
this scheme tells you where to look and
win that was a good idea I'm alone in
that but okay
Solar Annie's Center well look you know
we're also eclipsing the Sun so you can
imagine that you know we're in front of
it where's the Sun the sun's over there
so somebody in the anti sound direction
that direction will see a little dot
moving across the Sun well they won't
actually see the dot but they'll notice
that the the brightness of the Sun went
down by 0.01 percent for a few hours
when we went in front of it our planet
right so maybe they send a signal that
gets here just when that happens because
that's the sort of clock that's a clock
that tells them and tells us both window
you know pay attention so if they did
that the big advantages they know
exactly
to send a beam and you know for the
price of a automobile headlight in terms
of the energy cost you could send bits
of information to us
that's only 100 bits per second but hey
it's 30 watts it's a high school science
fair project for the aliens okay we
don't we don't look in the any Sun
Direction either all right but let's
consider this strategy from their point
of view this is this is it why are they
broadcasting to us why should we expect
them to be broadcasting to us because
SETI does assume that right if we find a
signal what do we do well we can't
continue to follow it across the sky do
you still see it Bob yeah I see it now
all right we come back the next day when
this star rises above the horizon yes
still see it yeah okay and after two or
three days of this you actually call up
somebody at another Observatory and say
you guys ought to pay attention to this
right will you help us out go look we're
expecting that et will be targeting our
world for days at least because if you
only get the signal once you're never
gonna claim that you found et that could
be anything right you have to see it
over and over and over and over if
Newton had had the Apple phone and said
just once but it never happened again
right no matter what he did with the
apples you know he probably wouldn't
publish anything so the question is from
the aliens point of view why would they
be targeting you for all this time four
days at a time and I think maybe they
probably wouldn't be now you might say
oh yeah you know they're they're
interested in the fact that we were you
know wrecking the environment or
threatening one another with nuclear
weapons and all that I mean come on
that's what Hollywood thinks but you
know that isn't true how would they know
about any of that right we've been
broadcasting into space since the war
say 60 70 years high power high
frequency transmissions so that means
the fraction of the galaxy that has been
exposed to I Love Lucy or the nightly
news or you know films about nuclear war
or the environment or Inconvenient Truth
right if they're not within 70
light-years well but in another way if
they're not within 35 light years there
has not been enough time for them to
learn about us and send back a message
saying you know we've got a lot of used
cars for sale okay so the bottom line is
and I think you can say this with
confidence at your next cocktail party
assuming that Googlers ever go to
cocktail parties you can say with
confidence
the aliens don't know we're here so when
your next-door neighbor says you know
they've been hauling my sister out of
the bedroom for these experiments every
other night you can be justifiably
suspicious because why are they here now
they don't know we exist
I think that's safe oh I'll bet my next
month's paycheck which is not a lot but
I'll bet that on that that the aliens do
not know we're here okay so they're not
gonna be targeting us why should they
target us we're just another star in 300
billion stars why should they be
spending all this money sending all
these photons to earth they don't even
know we're here now what they do know is
that the plants are here right they know
about photosynthesis because there's all
this oxygen in the atmosphere now you've
probably noticed you certainly notice if
it weren't there and and that they can
find with optical telescopes and that
signal has been going out into space for
a couple of billion years so they know
there's life on Earth right but it might
all just be photo plankton right it
could all be stupid plants they don't
know that there's anybody here building
big antennas okay but maybe there are a
lot of worlds that have life there's
also methane in the atmosphere right
which you know due to what slightly
called bovine flatulence or porcine
flatulence oh you know they would say
pigs in space okay they know there's
life here they don't know that there's
intelligent life okay so that's that
summarizes the argument so far they
don't know we're here so they're not
responding to I Love Lucy right be nice
to think that in that whole conceit in
in in in in cosmic cosmos the you know
contacts re-contacted Carl Sagan novel
where they're responding to our early TV
broadcasts in the 1930s that requires
that they be very nearby and it's
extraordinarily unlikely that we're so
lucky that they're nearby so that
doesn't really make sense they're not
responding to us so forget that they are
aware that we have life because of the
oxygen in the atmosphere so maybe they
have a long list of planets that are
known to have life now if life is a
miracle if life really is very rare then
they won't have this list but let's
let's proceed on the assumption that
life is not such a miracle that there's
life all over the place it's kind of an
infection they might have long long
lists if they're even 100
is more advanced than we are of planets
that are known to have for example
oxygen in the atmosphere or methane so
you know there's life we're in that list
we're in that list okay they're not
doing either those things they can't be
fishing with a galaxy Y broadcast that
takes too much energy they're probably
we're never gonna hear their leakage
radiation we're not gonna pick up their
equivalent of I Love Lucy because as you
know we're getting rid of all that
that's very energy inefficient all those
big you know red and white transmitter
towers on the hills outside of town
they're all going away you're gonna go
away you know you're gonna get your TV
your internet everything is kind of
coming in on a fiber-optic or a Direct
broadcast satellite or a cable of some
sort you're not gonna be broadcasting
all that goes away you're not gonna hear
from them that way all right but suppose
they do this suppose they say they have
this long list of worlds known to have
life I don't know if it's intelligent
life right there's only been intelligent
life by my definition here on this
planet for 50 or 100 years out of a
history of life that goes back close to
4 billion years that's a tiny fraction
but if they have a long enough list then
some of those guys in the list may have
intelligent life they've got a big array
it takes a really big array by the way
like 10 to the 10th wavelengths but then
they could target sequentially this long
list of planets known to have life just
trying to wake people up they'll send
just one bit of information that's
telling us hey there's somebody over
there we saw a flash in the sky but if
you saw that flash in the sky and then
you saw it again three days three weeks
three hours later and then again and
again you would pay attention to that
spot on the sky you would expend
whatever resources you could muster to
study that spot on the sky and maybe
they have a low-power omnidirectional
antenna there that's spewing out the
equivalent of their Google servers by
the way I've written a piece I wrote a
paper once and what we should send to
the aliens you know we always send them
pictures of nude couples you know stuff
like that
that kind of nutty why don't we just
send the Google servers I worked out how
long it would take to send the Google
servers using various techniques I think
it's great to send the Google server you
you're not gonna be in conversation with
these guys are too far away you know
it's all one-way communication but at
least if you send the Google servers
there's so much redundant information
that they'll figure a lot of it out
right
that's what I would do somebody pointed
out to me this but there's a lot of
pornography on the Google servers so
what I don't think the aliens care but
all right okay so indeed that may be
that there's an omnidirectional
transmitter that's you know forever
cranking out here's all our stuff right
here it is but in order to locate that
to know where to look and to know where
to put all the investment to pick up
that signal you have this one bit
transmission that says we're here okay
so could you build this big array well
this is just some plot of the size of
our own telescopes and you can see that
within a century we could build an array
that could do this right you know what's
one century that's not very much
okay so here's here's a sort of a
strawman the project for them that maybe
they have not just a few hundred
thousands plans say they have a billion
star systems that are known to have life
and they give each of them a nanosecond
ping and so forth and so on well you
know that's kind of the power that laser
they need to do that right five
gigawatts that's a lot you know would
impress the neighbors have you built
this in your burrow garage but on the
other hand you know probably within a
hundred years it's not so hard to build
a five gigawatt laser so we could do it
and this suggests that et might be using
this to tear transmitting strategy
namely pinging lots of worlds over and
over and over again so the youth is our
attention right with just one bit of
information look here we're here that's
it because you get the position right
and and then the low-power you know
Google server information in the message
so once again the logic we're not going
to pick up their leakage right that goes
away on our planet it's already gone
away on their planet we have to expect
deliberate transmissions don't expect
responses to us or our information about
how we can improve the environment they
don't know about any of that or asking
for you know your Facebook page or
anything like that we're not special
we're just in a list we're in the list
that's what the best I can hope for and
in order to address that list in order
to not to burn up too much energy by
trying to broadcast everybody at once
you have to do it in serial order and if
you do it in serial order you've got a
long list then the pings will be very
short and they'll be intermittent but
you could do it and we ought to adjust
our SETI strategy to
look for this because we don't look for
any of this we don't look for short
things that might repeat you know three
days later we just don't do it and I
think we ought to okay because I don't
think that they'll send us a single
that's always on alright let me just
finish up with an answer to this
question I don't know how many of you
know who this guy is this is Frank Drake
and he sort of invented this field back
in 1960 did the first experiment
Frank Frank still comes in the August 79
this year I guess franÃ§a is the world's
nicest guy and also a very clever guy by
the way he's been a professor down at UC
Santa Cruz and also Cornell Boris told
you I was from Cornell in deference
anybody who actually went to Cornell I
did not go to Cornell went to Princeton
but what that hey okay all right here's
Frank and he gets asked all the time so
when are you guys gonna find et I mean
you've been at this for a while you
started family thing Frank comes in
every day he writes out a question on
the board we don't know what it means
but I noticed that he always answers the
question when we're gonna find et right
actually with some of my other
colleagues like Jill tarter and Peter
Backus I mean they're only four of us
really and and I answer the question but
I noticed that the the answers they give
correlate very well with the estimated
number of years until they retire right
so they're telling you somebody hears it
isn't until they retire Joe is a little
different she says well it could be my
granddaughter that finds et if she
figures this is all like building
cathedrals in the Middle Ages it's a
long-term project you got to be in it
for the long haul all right I'm here to
tell you that's baloney we're building
this Allen telescope array I think many
of you've heard about it it's up in a
place called Hat Creek California it's
much much faster than anything we've
done before because it's dedicated to
this kind of work also the radio
astronomy at UC Berkeley it's called the
Allen telescope array because Paul Allen
a name that you probably know gave the
money to build the first 42 antennas
here the idea is to build 350 of them
okay yeah whether it's the death or a
receiver and this is a little animation
which maybe I can make it work can make
it work no I can't of course didn't copy
over the video file but any case the
idea is eventually to have 350 antennas
we have 42 now by the way you can go up
and see this thing and go around and
kick the tires there no tires you can
kick the metal
okay it's from here it's like five and a
half hours depends on how fast your
Maserati is but I recommend you do this
if you happen to be up in the you know
in the Cascade areas in your Mount
lassen it's about 30 miles north of
Mount lassen go take a look at it but in
a case the real point here is that's
gonna speed things up because it's
something we can use 24/7 okay here's
some of the electronics nobody cares
about that here's actually one of the
critical well that's kind of encouraging
those of you who are still conscious
after you know 45 minutes of this may
note this is a semi-log plot which is to
say the speeds increasing exponentially
now of course exponentially is a word
that the newscasters love to use but
they don't know what it means but this
really is exponential and you notice
from the red line it follows Moore's law
okay alright and that's because so much
you said he is really just digital
electronics not surprising okay but it's
doubling in speed every 18 months that's
what it's doing and that that's going to
continue to be the case for at least a
decade or two so here's the bottom line
that solid line shows you how far out
into the galaxy this array would be able
to check out all the good star systems
assuming it gets built and that's a
money issue
I think a small figure to 617,000 have
some off was smarter than these other
guys so he can figure this out they're
two decimal places
and on the right 10 to the 4 10,000
that's the estimate by Frank Drake now I
say estimate that's a euphemism for
guess but you know I made my fast Frank
I said Frank 10,000 huh where'd you get
that number in Frank will say look you
know driving in on highway 17 this
morning I put my finger out the window
and seemed like a good number okay so
nobody knows but this is the range of
estimates that people who have motivated
this whole line of research have made
ten thousand to a million all right try
that top factor one hundred maybe not
and the point is that if any of these
guesses is even approximately right
success is not far away right what this
means is that we'll find et within two
dozen years and I'm willing to bet you
all a cup of Starbucks that that'll
happen so here's the deal either within
two dozen years you pick up the mercury
news well you won't be able to pick up
that mark there he knows you'll open
your browser and if any of you you'll
see you know scientists find signal
coming from et or you get a cup of
coffee so it's not so bad obviously
they're always caveats
maybe we're barking up the wrong
arboreal fixture here I mean it could be
that you know maybe maybe we got wrong
physics but I mean that's no incentive
to just sit on your hand so might as
well do the experiment what would the
reaction be
there's always a bottle of champagne at
the observatories this was done a Puerto
Rico they're really there although I
have to say every time I go down there
there's another bottle of champagne so
it says something about the engineers I
don't know people assume that if we were
to find a signal of course the feds the
government would swoop down on the
Institute and shut it all down right I
asked people why they think that Nissa
because the public couldn't handle the
news right look
one-third of Americans believe the
aliens are here right sailing the skies
in their saucers and occasionally
hauling you out of your bedroom for
experiments that your mom wouldn't
approve up okay so to think that if they
heard that here's a signal coming from
750 light-years away that they would say
that's
it Marge I'm not going to work today I'm
just gonna ride in the streets I mean I
think that that's a reading of human
psychology that's slightly what's wrong
okay now this is a picture made a
thousand years ago at the SETI Institute
when we were across the street from you
guys on landings drive this was 3:30 in
the morning
and we had picked up a signal that first
for about 16 hours look like the real
deal now it turned out it was a
technical failure we were getting
confused by a satellite never mind all
that this was great because it actually
was a torture test of the system it
showed what happens if you pick up the
real deal right okay now with this 3:30
in the morning you notice nobody's gone
home to get some sleep nobody goes the
in-and-out burger they're just sitting
there watching these monitors I was so
nervous I was so nervous I had to you
know I was walking around couldn't sit
down walking around taking pictures just
give myself something to do now six
hours after this photo was made I'm sort
of half asleep at my desk the phone
rings it's bill broad of the New York
Times asking about this right the New
York Times already knew about it I just
know a policy and secrecy
it'll be out there and I told him well
you know we're following the signal but
you know it might turn out to be
interference how about if I call you
back in three hours and three hours
later we knew that it was interference
so no story but you know all that time I
was waiting for the feds with an arrow
ties to show up and shut us down I was
waiting for a phone call from the mayor
of Mountain View whom I knew personally
but no nobody was interested except in
new york times of course all right so
that's what's really gonna happen it's
not gonna be the men in black and all
that stuff they own them right now and
finally what could we learn well who
knows to begin with I don't think the
aliens are gonna be anything like these
little gray guys you know graze their
eyes are a lot of fun you know they're
just projections of what we think we're
gonna become right we're losing our hair
these guys have lost it all
we're losing our ability is smell we're
losing our teeth you know you notice
they have small noses small mouths
except for the guy in the middle they're
short you know they don't load trucks
for a living in fact judging by those
eyes they probably sit in front of
computer monitors all day like you so
this is fun but it's not gonna be like
that right think of the chronology you
invent radio right and and within a
hundred years after inventing radio
people are already talking about AI
artificial intelligence now you're all
sitting
say hi guys they've been saying we're
gonna make thinking machines in ten
years and they've been saying that for
30 years but you shouldn't confuse lack
of success with lack of progress right
these guys are making progress and
probably within another ten years twenty
fifty depends on whether you read
reycarts while or Vernor Vinge's guys
you know what do you believe any of that
I it's it seems reasonable that it's
gonna happen to say within this century
so that's good enough because you all
know by 2020 your laptop will have the
same compute power as a human brain
right saying compute power is you hope
you don't lose your job people ask me
what are gonna do Seth when the
computers as smart as you are I'm just
going to turn the keyboard around you
type whatever okay but the point is the
point the point is that's the time scale
you invent radio C go on the air and
then within a century or two you invent
your successor and it's not soft squishy
protoplasmic intelligence you've moved
on to something better than that
my wife would certainly agree with that
okay so I think that if we find a signal
coming from et you know you can learn a
lot because they're gonna be way ahead
of us they can't be behind us because
they're not building transmitters
statistically they're gonna be way ahead
you know 100 years a thousand years a
million years a billion years and maybe
they tell you all sorts of nifty stuff
here's all of physics here's all of us
follow me here's a cure for death here's
whatever all this stuff and that would
affect your guts are grabbing free
living lifestyle on the other hand maybe
we don't understand any of it it's like
giving you know like a the modem output
from your modem output at home give that
to a Neanderthal you know they weren't
all that stupid but they're never gonna
figure it out okay
so maybe we'll never figure it out I'm
sure that they'll distribute all the
bits we collect with the radio
telescopes put them all on the web right
people be downloading these bits trying
to figure them out the way they figured
out the you know the hieroglyphics and
probably they'll never figure them out
but you know after two centuries people
begin to worship these a bit I don't
know what happens but but even if you
don't figure them out even if you don't
figure them out I think that it was
worth the candle because you will know
something important and that is that
what has happened on this planet is not
a miracle and that you know while we
like to think we're special we're not
only not the only kids on the block
but every other kid we find is more
advanced than we are
okay why don't I stop there and we can
open it up to questions in case you have
any anybody stills still awake
no questions sign of a bad talk yes sir
what are the estimates of what are the
estimates on the number of possible
intelligent planets out there in life
and intelligent planets in our galaxy
according to the Drake Equation well
that's sort of the the number of planets
in our galaxy that have sentient life
you know thinking beings and those were
those numbers and those were for our
galaxy along with anybody six that's
that's for our galaxy yeah okay yeah
yeah that's our galaxy and just multiply
it by you know 100 billion which is ten
to the eleventh and you'll get the
number in the visible universe and
that's a lot of you know a lot of people
to invite to a party are you thinking of
looking into other galaxies as well
should we look at other galaxies I've
done that actually and some other people
doing said II have looked at other
galaxies the big advantage is you know
you're looking at maybe 10 million stars
in one go the disadvantage is that even
the nearest galaxies right are at least
10 times farther away than the other
side of our own galaxy and and more like
a thousand times farther than the
farthest star systems we look at well a
factor of a thousand and distance is a
factor of a million in signal strength
so you know they've got to be they have
to have a real honking transmitter for
you to be able to pick them up and it's
a little unclear why they would do that
given that why do they want to send
somebody in another galaxy all this info
but you know I never try in second guess
what's on the aliens minds because
that's alien sociology and in our
knowledge of alien sociology that
dataset is rather sparse
you know the questions sure I was just
curious do you get pushback from anybody
who says well you know maybe you find
them in they're actually not all that
friendly what if they're not friendly
yeah well you could worry about that
a lot of people do but keep in mind
they're far away also they don't know
that you've picked up their signal right
you drive it into work and you tune in
Ron Owens and just because you tune in
Ron Owens how
often does he jump into the backseat of
your car and start molesting you not
often right I mean if he does I want to
hear about but hey you don't know you
tuned them in we did they won't know
we've tuned them in now of course it is
true I'm being a little disingenuous
because of course you know there will
everybody who can build a transmitter
which is all the intelligent people will
rush to their backyards set up a
satellite dish and start broadcasting
their personal philosophies that the
aliens I'm sure of it and some people
want us to deliberately broadcast just
to get their attention and if you want
to worry about that you could but if you
really are worried about that then you
better shut down NBC ABC CBS the BBC and
all the radars at the airports because
those signals are going into space and
the radars are actually pretty powerful
TVs harder to find but could do it so
once it is this one once we do find them
what what do we do then what happens if
we find them that's really good question
is to say we've sort of ran a little
experiment to see what happens in the
first few hours it'll be a big story of
course but I think what you would do is
you would get the attention of everybody
who has a telescope and they would all
be studying this spot on the sky for
sure and I think that SETI which runs on
unfortunately a very thin shoestring
budget would you know and you'd get real
money to build a real instrument and go
back and look for the modulation the
message yeah I think that's what would
happen but who knows maybe the entire
populace would go nuts but then in terms
of like telling them that we're here in
terms of telling them that we're here in
terms of telling them yeah so one part
of it is like I think what you're saying
is like picking up the signal again so
so I'm not sure if I understood you
right when you said everybody pointing
at the same girl oh yeah well I think it
would be human nature to start
broadcasting to them I think some people
would want to do that yeah I don't know
that the SETI Institute would but we
might okay well I want to thank you very
much for taking the time out of your day
and you can come up and talk to me later
Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
