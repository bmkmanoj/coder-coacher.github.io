of winning them and doing all these
different things and I go whoa whoa what
are you doing you know how are you
winning these science fair projects and
sort of best in County such and he said
well I'm on this i'm a board member of
this one company you know called
knowledge context and the directive of
this company is its grassroots it's
basically trying to instill life skills
at a very young age in trying to educate
them on how to use technology what
technology is so the fact that he was
asking a ten-year-old miguel was asking
a ten-year-old to be a part of his
company and direct it was pretty
interesting so for the last couple years
I've been trying to sort of understand
what how I can help and this is one
mechanism of doing that so I will turn
it over to Miguel who's recently
published a book so that's one of the
things that we're trying to do is
educate people on what he is trying to
teach so technology challenged his
background is various it varies from
NASA he's a teaching professor at
various schools and he basically is
coming in to teach you what knowledge
context is thank you thanks Patrick
so how do you understand technology how
do you evaluate it once you understand
it and how do you take that knowledge
and have it influence the decisions you
make I like the small decisions like
what TV do you buy or what kind of car
and then the big decisions like do you
use an experimental drug and then really
big decisions like what sorts of
technology does our company or our
country or our society use it all boils
down to three points that I want to make
today it's a I've got my little crib
sheet here and I've also got it large so
the three points that I'll make today
and everything else being just examples
and stories is one technology changes
the world ever faster I obviously don't
need to make a strong case for that here
have you live that the second is that we
can understand and evaluate technology
and by that I mean not just that the
technological elite can understand on a
technical level but the society as a
large can understand enough about
technology on a contextual level so that
they can be involved informed
consciously making decisions that have
technology underlying them so we can
create this intentional future and the
third point I'd make is that you can
help society to guide technology and
that's really why I'm here I was
thinking so here I'm coming to Google
what's the whole point what should I
actually design the talk and the point
is to evangelize and I believe this is
very important personally and societally
for our civilization even so my intent
is to present these ideas hope they
resonate with you so that you say yeah
this is important maybe these ideas are
the way I've approached technology and I
would like our schools to use the same
approaches these same critical thinking
approaches so that all people eventually
would be taking that same thoughtful
approach
I'm starting off with this slide a quote
from Carl Sagan because although the
approach that we take to understanding
technology has impact on on personal
levels like what kind of car do I buy
I'm really taken by this conceptual big
picture ah well the context that's akin
places so he says it might be familiar
progression transpiring on many worlds a
planet evolves planet formed placidly
revolves around a star life slowly forms
a kaleidoscopic procession of creatures
evolves it telligence emerges which at
least up to a point confers a normal
survival value and then technology is
invented in a flash they create world
altering contrivance 'as some planetary
civilizations see their way through
place limits on what may and what must
not be done and safely passed with the
time of perils others not so lucky or so
prudent perish you probably hear an echo
with bill joyce the future does not need
us if any of you read that wired article
that made a big splash bill joy was
talking about genetic technology nano
technology and robotics saying that
there's this cascading runaway
developmental path which could very well
destroy civilization well Sagan was
taking a similar approach or taking a
similar review and I like to set this as
the context for why do I even care about
how we understand and evaluate
technology this is a depiction actually
also from from a Carl Sagan a series
called cosmos this is a depiction of the
Library of Alexandria which at the time
was the greatest repository of
information ever and actually for a long
time Africa was destroyed it still held
that that title and I bring this up
because tethering information allowing
the distribution of information is not
just a technology but it's a driver of
technological change and Google you
certainly have an appreciation for
gathering technology and or gathering
information on it this is a I borrowed a
New York
cartoon which turned the Lions in facing
screams and then I put Google's book
search beta on each of their screens so
you're creating a world in which it's
ever easier to get information to
combine it it's ever leading to ever
faster technological change and it makes
it ever more important for us to
consider how do we guide that what
change do we want do we sit on the
sidelines and let technology take some
sort of fateful path or are we preparing
society to think about what's good for
me what's good for my community what's
good for the environment I give a quick
background of the history of our
relationship with technology just so
we're starting from the same spot if you
go back about 2.6 million years of the
first signs of stone tools there are
probably tools before then made out of
wood animal skins but they've rotted
away so we know at least that our
forebears were creating technology about
two and a half million years ago and
you'll notice something that the the
pace of technological change has been
accelerating obviously there's some
arbitrariness about what technologies I
put on the table but certainly if you
look at how dense things get just in the
last thousand years which I wasn't able
to present other than a solid white
block there's this the clear sense and
of course we have it intuitively that
with you know microprocessors doubling
in power every 18 months and hard drives
doubling capacity at least that fast
that the technological change is
accelerating and so it's becoming even
more important for us to be able to
understand how it's changing and how
we'd like to direct that over over this
period of times tool offer tools offered
survival advantage and so we use them we
showed our children and certainly those
adapted using them flourished if you had
good eye-hand coordination so you could
throw a rock you had a better chance of
your genes getting into the next
generation and that meant that the
generation after generation humans
co-evolved with technology developing
newer and better technology
it built in itself it's autocatalytic so
the more technology we have the quicker
we're able to develop new technology and
almost well almost unfortunately the
faster the technology changes the more
we can become entranced by specific
technology looking at say computers and
thinking this is the only thing that is
technology instead of stepping back and
looking for the patterns in the big
picture clearly it's part of educational
career political and economic choices
and this is one place where it's
important not to have a myopic view of
technology because if you recognize the
technology as part of systems and
protocols and pharmaceuticals you'll see
them underlying that many of the major
decisions we make it what do you decide
to study in school given your knowledge
that a fiber optics has made it
inexpensive to move jobs to India to
China certainly that technology is
influencing a decision you make an
education influencing a decision that
you make in career and it changes us
starting back when humans good with
tools had a better shot at procreating
the the choo choo train is a is from a
story about how long ago before we had
mass transit it was typical that people
would marry and procreate within their
own small village well with trains it
was much easier to meet somebody from
far away and spread our genes and create
a greater diversity of jeans so it's
actually there's been a genetic
modification of humans given something
as simple as the Train and in the 20th
and 21st century are getting to the
point of augmenting humans with
technology whether by direct genetic
engineering or by implants cochlear
implants for improving hearing and
people talking about augmenting memory
augmenting processing power there was a
great the very back page of Wired
magazine has artifacts from the future
and one of them had effectively a future
Google where people walked around and
they could see these bubbles popping
over all all the people that they walk
by on the street showing them multiple
degrees of connections for how they
related to those people
and of course technology can exterminate
us ever since the the atomic bomb we've
been keenly aware that we have the
ability to destroy ourselves and then
more recently with terrorism this is a
small pox on the right technology allows
us to genetically modify smallpox so
it's immune to conventional treatments
and it gives us the ability to
distribute it this Marshall McLuhan
quote so captures our relationship with
technology I don't know who discovered
water but it was not a fish I see us as
in a sea of Technology there's so much
around it us that is very difficult for
us to get a sense to step outside of the
fishbowl and look at technology and see
the patterns we are demanded to
understand more and more about how to
operate technology how to interact with
it how to select it and oftentimes it
doesn't give us the the luxury and I I
hesitate to call it a luxury but the
opportunity to reflect to step back and
think about what is it we're doing is
this the direction we want to create is
this the future that we want to create
and sure enough surrounded by technology
humans rarely discover it there's
there's been a push for years that we
need to introduce students to computers
earlier and earlier and there's also a
push back saying that they're not
learning how to socialize well this
cartoon with an infant already learning
how to use a computer and there's an
extreme example so we're uh you know at
this stage we're almost tactically we
assume that technology is computers and
understanding Eagles operating if you
can get your children or your friends
children to learn how to operate a
computer younger then that's must be a
good thing but understanding is not the
same as operating and computers are just
one of many technologies that it's not
to denigrate operating computers that I
studied electro engineering and computer
science so if anything I've got a vested
interest and saying hey operating is
good because that makes me more valuable
but I believe in fact that it's great to
have the vocational skill
often times very sophisticated to use
program design test computers but it's
it's not some it's that vocational skill
is very different from the critical
thinking that we need its technological
literacy is critical thinking and it's
looking beyond the trees to see the
forest or the example before that i
mentioned beyond the fishbowl to see the
water if computers are one tree
technology is the forest and by stepping
back we're able to see the patterns that
are going to predict what sorts of
technologies and what sorts of costs and
benefits will face in the future when
when technology may not even resemble
computers or computers are so hidden
away that there they go unseen william
wolf the president of the National
Academy of Engineering had a quote that
the captures as well there's a major
difference between technological
competence and technological literacy
literacy is what everyone needs
competence is what a few people need in
order to do a job or make a living and
we need both for fixing your car for
operating on a tumor obviously you want
great technical competence for society
making choices about what they consume
how they vote how they invest what's
what's legal what's promoted we need
technological literacy and actually it's
it's completely unrealistic to think
that society in general could be
technologically competent across all
technologies nobody can be technology is
invented ever faster than we can keep up
with it and every so often I'll look at
the nature journal or science just to
get a good dose of humility I look at
the scientific advances and I don't
understand most of the words being used
the jargon is so specialized it's it's
well beyond me in there are multiple
fields in which it's well beyond me so
we do have people that specialize and
understand specific technologies and we
have the opportunity to have many people
society at large understand at a
literacy level technology
technological literacy is critical
thinking I contrast literacy versus
competency err literacy understanding
and evaluating considering the big
picture a timeless kill critical
thinking and competency operating design
you are fixing knowing which buttons to
push specifically technologies and it is
a technical ability so one complements
the other it's not a matter of saying
one's better than the other replaces it
here's an example of where technological
literacy is maybe much more important
than technological competency or at
least not matched by it if we're
evaluating control versus freedom and
certainly after 911 we were faced with
this balance of how much do we have
technology monitor things to make sure
that there is security that terrorists
do not repeat an attack and how much do
we give up of our civil liberties there
isn't anyone answer for this if i lived
in baghdad i would certainly say control
or security be paramount my freedom
wouldn't feel that meaningful to me
given that I didn't dare step outside of
my my home given the number of bombings
kidnappings murders and we make
different choices along the way so with
technological literacy we can recognize
that control and freedom or security and
liberty are often things that we trade
off and different technologies come
along and allow us to make different
trade-offs so even though we cannot
necessarily understand actually
definitely cannot understand every
technology that comes out if we
recognize some of the patterns that
technologies as a whole from thousands
of years ago allow us to to make or some
of the patterns of what decisions they
allow us to make then we're better
equipped to look at a new technology and
say okay I like that technology because
it gives me more of security or more of
freedom whatever it happens to be my
primary value so it's finding patterns
will be true for tomorrow's technology
if you're learning about a specific
technology that oftentimes does not
translate to other technologies but this
kind of thing this translates whether
you
looking at radios when Marconi first but
the first radio in the world over to
England from Italy and the customs agent
asked them what it is and Marconi said
it's a wireless it allows you to use a
telegraph even without stringing wires
well the customs agent pretty sharp guy
smashed it broke it into pieces he
recognized that this technology
undermined the control of the British
government it could lead to the even the
overthrow of the government ironically
after Marconi went home and rebuilt it
and built it better came across and did
not declare it he formed the Marconi
radio company and his vision of what our
radio was all about wasn't broadcasting
to many people it was the ability to
communicate with ships offshore well the
British Navy found gets so immensely
valuable to be able to communicate with
their ships offshore they nationalized
the Marconi radio company so they went
from seeing it as a threat to seeing it
is immensely important so here's this
trade-off control versus freedom and it
applies whether we're using the total
information awareness which has been
renamed terrorist information awareness
so that no one is really too worried
about it looking into our lives or
radios or even earlier technologies and
certainly future technologies so we're
looking for patterns that are
transcending specific technologies so
how would you go about doing this hey in
in this room and in this audience
there's probably a great deal of
technical knowledge about various
technologies and over time you've
probably thought about well how do I
look at technology how do I evaluate it
we unfortunately are in a small minority
how do we get society to a point where
on a broad basis we have people that are
not making decisions out of fear or out
of emotion without the the intellectual
understanding but are making their
choices based on a foundation of
technological literacy and one answer is
that we teach young people in schools
and we give them some sort of timeless
tulle a strategy for understanding and
evaluating technology so that's my
answer sir
you may come up with others you may have
heard of others that maybe even I don't
know about but my answer is if we can
teach young people to not just operate
computers but to think about and
understand and evaluate technology then
we're on our way to spreading this
awareness so that we can make informed
conscious choices about what sort of
future we want and every time I look
back or look back at when I think back
to how much technology has changed our
world and say the last 10,000 years
before agriculture before we had cities
and villages we lived entirely different
lives in that period of time at 10,000
years the largest factor that I can see
is that is different from then to now is
technology we have chosen various
technologies to form cities to form
organizations technologies allow us to
interact share information clearly as
google shares information and so if
we're going to look into the future and
everything's happening faster so if we
look into the future 50 years rather
than looking back 10,000 we can be
rather assured the technology will
continue to change our world and if we
want that change to be intentional
here's one way to approach it so the
nonprofit corporation that I'm a part of
knowledge context said how do we teach
young people to think about technology
well for starters we don't know what
technology they're going to be facing
when they're adults so what if we have
them ask questions what do we have them
ask questions that are applicable
whatever the technology is and so we
came up with these nine questions and I
talked to folks at at Oracle and IBM and
Google and later Google because we
formed pretty young one Google's just
coming about and ask them so you
understand technology what questions
would you ask in order to understand and
evaluate so we start from the bottom
left asking is what is technology
clearly a question of you could ask
10,000 years ago and then we asked why
did we use it as it turns out that the
the reasons why use technology has not
been changing all that rapidly
communication survival
select in warfare entertainment if you
understand some of the reasons we use
technology when something new comes
along you have a tool for understanding
it where does it come from how does it
work i'll go into these more detail
later so these first four questions what
is technology why do we use it where
does it come from how does it work form
a foundation of identity and certainly
there's there's not the only way to
approach it but we thought it was useful
to have them ask questions about what
technology is and based on that to build
an understanding of how it changes and
then how it changes us and how we change
it there's a Simpsons cartoon actually I
had included it in the slides and I
thought cash for copyright reasons I
certainly don't have the rights to use
it but if anybody watches the Simpsons
cartoon series Moe the bartender decides
to go into the restaurant business and
so he buys a deep fryer off of an
aircraft carrier and it will deep fry a
buffalo in 40 seconds Homer is
distraught he does not want to wait 40
seconds clearly technology changes our
expectations it changes our perceptions
of what's possible with information
available like CNN Fox News al Jazeera
it changes our awareness of the world
that's there's a couple examples of
number six how it changes us how do we
change it many different roles that we
can play not just inventing it but
managing investing questioning it
educating about technology and once we
have this foundation of identity and
then change the evaluation levels what
are its costs and benefits and how do we
evaluate it so we have these nine
questions and we call them ice nine
business identity change in evaluation
in nine questions and it's um there's
always somebody who says have you read
kurt vonnegut's cat's cradle here's the
nod actually we came up with ice line
before any of us had read cat's cradle
but in the story it's a science fiction
story about a technology that will allow
water to freeze at high temperatures
this is a dangerous proposition because
if the water in our bodies froze we
would die if the water in plants froze
most of them would die at least all of
our crops would and if you allow this
technology to get away
it could destroy all of life as we know
it so there's a case a stellar case for
when you'd want to know more than just
what button do I push how do I operate
this technology you would want to know
what are the costs and benefits based on
what values would we decide to to use it
when when the United States was
developing the atomic bomb towards the
end of World War two there was
discussion of Los Alamos about whether
the atomic explosion would cause a chain
reaction causing all of the oxygen in
the atmosphere to burn off would it
actually get hot enough so that the
burning wood just spread and it would
envelop the earth in a little envelope
of fire cleared that would be bad for
not just the our foes in World War two
but also for all living all living
things and the scientists debated about
it and finally they came down to a
decision that it was highly unlikely but
you have this case of a select group
applying their values which may not be
your values to decide whether the costs
outweigh the benefits the more we are
able to educate people to understand
technology and evaluated the more we can
have society involved in those very
questions rather than a select elite
making those choices so given that we've
got these nine questions which are
rather timeless we decided we needed a
curriculum for the schools that would
provide some answers and the answers
could be nearly as timeless certainly
they would not apply specifically to
computers any way that we could answer
one of these questions that applied only
to one technology we were not interested
so we came up with a curriculum and
we're trying to decide where do we
target that and we decided that in
middle schools grades 5 6 7 8 that's
when young people are starting to make
connections they're understanding the
interrelationships of history and
science and the technologies that play
with so we said that's where we're going
to put it and this is back in 98 when he
first had the glimmer of idea that we
could teach how to understand any
technology and since then we've not only
provided this
curriculum online for free teachers can
download it and use it but it's been
adapted by teachers often unbeknownst to
us at the high school level and the
college level and I discovered one of
the college's users of our curriculum
when we got a call asking how do we get
a hold of your book that I wrote a book
called technology challenged and I said
well this is how but how did you even
hear about it because it's going to be
printed in two months and the person's
at all I'm the director of new
initiatives at this Becker College in
Massachusetts we downloaded your
curriculum last year adapted it for the
community college level and we've been
teaching it ever since so we just want
the textbook to go along with it so
there are people out there who are
thinking about how do I get people to
think about technology how do i get that
understanding that evaluation so to
illustrate the ice nine questions i
figured we'd start with the north korean
radios here's a earth at night which is
also a wonderful example of technology
if you went back ten thousand years none
of the lights would be there there might
be forest wires but not all of these
signs of civilization and as we zoom
over to the eastern hemisphere and then
zoom in you'll notice that there's
apparently an island right next to Japan
Japan is is down here and the island
inside the circle is the island of South
Korea it's not truly an island it is
actually connected to the mainland but
it's connected by North Korea which has
very limited technology and so it does
not light up at night except for a few
small points kind of a scary thing to
see that it well it's scary if you
understand that what's connected with
that is a great deal of famine and
repression so I read this article in the
new york times about how little
disposable radios are being smuggled
into North Korea and I thought wow what
an incredible story because it's this
wonderful drama of people risking their
lives to get radios in and then people
risking their lives to listen to them
because unlike in the United States you
have to register your radios in North
Korea the United States we resist
registering handguns because we're
concerned or some of us are concerned
that the government will come in and
take away our guns
denying us of our Second Amendment
privileges I believe well in North Korea
radios must be registered so the police
can verify that they are tuned only to
the North Korean station if you are
listening to Radio Free Asia or any
other Western source it's grounds for
being taken away to a work camp so the
the radios that you buy in North Korea I
have a fixed tuner they actually don't
have a tuner they you turn it on and it
brings into one station and it it is
possible to buy a radio and bring it in
but the tuner has to be soldered in
place and in the middle of the night the
the police can come to your door demand
to see your radios and make sure that
they are still tuned in place and this
in the the prospect of being sent to a
work camp for the next five or ten years
is pretty daunting so what do people do
they've created South Korea they've
created disposable radios they smuggle
them in and they're so small and cheap
that people can listen to them for a day
or two and then destroy them bury them
somewhere where they'll not be found and
that limits the risk that they'll be
captured so I thought what if we applied
the ice nine questions to understanding
this so that's what I've done and
actually I've gone backwards because I
like backwards so we start with question
nine how do we evaluate it and the whole
point of what I'm going to do in the
next three slides is just to say it what
is this this ice nine thing this is an
example of how it applies so how do we
evaluate it the government of North
Korea evaluates the radios in terms of
their power by promoting dissenting
views this technology is a threat to
their control now other people evaluate
the radios based upon the values of
liberty or freedom so others might
evaluate them economically what's
interesting is that different people can
agree on everything but question nine
they can agree on technologies identity
and change and even what are the costs
and benefits and come two diametrically
different conclusions as to whether it's
a good technology or not recently excuse
within two weeks I've been trying to get
the video for this and I cannot find it
on the on the net other than streams and
I couldn't I wanted to capture it
recently the Taliban is
experiencing resurgence in Afghanistan
and they have been making videos and
distributing the DVDs in town so you
wake up in the morning and on your front
step there's a DVD and it's got video of
mullah omar it's got video of taliban
firing rockets and they're using this to
promote their cause now what makes us
interesting is that the taliban had made
television and satellite dishes and
video illegal in afghanistan prior to
the united states going in and
overthrowing them why were these things
illegal under their control because
their value was very much the same as
North Korea it was of control versus
Liberty and televisions and satellite
dishes undermined their control the
Taliban has always favored technology
like Stinger missiles ak-47 rifles and
pickup trucks because those supported
their power and as things change their
values may stay the same but their
evaluation of a technology differs so
unless we understand how a person or an
organization or a country evaluates
technology we may look at their choices
and say my goodness they're there
they're dumb or they're stupid when in
fact they simply are employing different
values and with socrates the greek
philosopher who said the unexamined life
is not worth living so i paraphrase by
saying unexamined values are not worth
applying we get people especially
students middle schoolers to think about
what are my values and we start off here
with North Korean radios to apply it so
question 8 what are its costs and
benefits like many technologies radios
offer trade-offs between such goals as
control and freedom in this situation
radio subvert control and promote
freedom in other situations like in
Rwanda radios were used for control disc
jockeys in Rwanda during the slaughter
back in the mid-90s were broadcasting
where there were refugees hiding and
they were directing these bands of
killers with machetes to find the the
hiding civilians and actually to kill
them so there's a gruesome example of
radios having a different cost and
benefit
so the next three questions under change
how do we change it engineers design
radios activists distribute them
organizations fund them and North Korean
police hunt them clearly are lots of
ways they were influencing technology
and their many more that we could list
number six how does it change us
independent news sources heard over the
radios change Lister's conception of
reality they discover the starvation is
not normal and that their nation is not
the world's most powerful that North
Korea receives food aid and they're told
that when they see these bags of rice
mark USA that that's a sign of tribute
that a subservient United States of
America is offering the more dominant
North Korea it's not explained that the
United States has a good deal more power
or even at South Korea is a far greater
economic powerhouse so the that
knowledge is certainly changing the
entire worldview of the people that are
looking at these bags of rice question 5
how does it change electronic
technologies in particular have become
smaller and less expensive at an amazing
rate making disposable radios feasible
certainly if radios were large and
expensive you could not do this kind of
thing and the last four questions the
foundation how does it work many
technologies can be characterized as
either centralized or distributed unlike
a large transmitter the radios are
highly distributed so many could fail or
be destroyed without affecting the rest
here's another case of how these
patterns transcend technologies I've got
a slide later on that shows how a
thousand years ago in England there were
about 300 people for each power plant
and power plants it in the 1100 s were
waterwheels now in England there are
300,000 people per power plant being
mostly nuclear power plants oil oil
generators that you put in oil and get
at electricity so there's been this
constant they had a distributed system
of 300 people per power plant thousand
years ago now it's centralized and you
also see patterns of people putting
solar cells on the roofs which is highly
distributed so we're looking for
patterns that are so
broad that as new technologies come
along people can look at them say oh
I've seen that come up before I
understand some of that question 3 where
does it come from these radios came from
specialization designed by experts in
like electronics broadcasting however
was an accident Radio was invented
nearly a century ago for one-to-one
conversations where telephone wires
could not be run the example of
communicating with ships why do we use
it communication is one of the oldest
reasons we use technology and it's still
drive such devices radio satellite cell
phones email and so on and what is it
radio is a tool to extend our abilities
allowing us to hear something from far
away but a physical radio that we can
touch is just the tip of the iceberg out
of sight of our systems of technical
standards and networks of energy
distribution and manufacturing jess is
important clearly when you're using
something like the internet a lot of its
invisible and not just invisible but
completely intangible is the protocols
the internet protocol so in the in the
next 15 minutes or so what I'd like to
do is step through the nine questions
and give a few more examples of what the
pattern is but the overall intent of the
talk is showing that there are patterns
that virtually anybody can understand
about technology and then suggest
welcome you to decide how you might get
involved it doesn't it could be working
with young people informing them about
this it could be getting curriculum into
schools it could be promoting online or
through the media these concepts of how
do we understand and evaluate technology
so that people that are so fixated on
how do I operate this new thing can get
this more contextual view or it could
even be working with knowledge context
the nonprofit so what I'll do is I'll
step through a few examples I had
promised a story about Hawaiian bobtail
squid in the present in the description
of the talk so here it is the Hawaiian
bobtail squid survives by coming out at
night and it doesn't come out in the
daylight because it would be eaten is a
picture of a Hawaiian bobtail squid and
the problem that it encounters is that
on moonlit nights especially with a full
moon it casts a shadow
and as it's floating along eating
predators maybe below it watching for
the shadow to pass so what is the wine
bobtail squid done it's done something
amazing there's a bacteria called Vibrio
fishery which is luminescent but only
when it's concentrated enough so the
Hawaiian bobtail squid ingest this
bacteria concentrates it there is a
center is a quorum sensing chemical
signaling among the Vibrio fishery that
allowed them to recognize when enough of
them are together and they start glowing
the Hawaiian bobtail squid has evolved
shudders lenses and filters so that that
glowing bacteria is projected downward
onto the sea floor in the same color and
shape as the moon so the predator
looking up sees the moon sees the moon
sees the moon sees simulated moon sees
the moon sees the moon as the Hawaiian
bobtail squid floats by when I heard the
story that just is absolutely amazing
well I thought is this technology and it
occurred to me that there are some ways
that we might say it's not well it's not
an external technology it's not designed
and it's not conscious but certainly it
is a way to manipulate our environment
and there's another story related to
this which is definitely external
there's a relative of the Vibrio fishery
which are the Vibrio cholerae there the
bacteria that cause cholera in humans
and other animals and what the Vibrio
cholera do is they live in water when
people drink contaminated water they go
into the stomach and they have a really
tough time of it because they're not
adapted to the highly acidic environment
that are natural new bacteria the good
bacteria have evolved for in fact only
one out of a million of them survived
because of the intense stomach gases
that we have because there are many many
of them billions maybe more some of them
survive and they attach themselves to
the walls of our stomach and then they
do something clever they inject a little
bit of toxin into the stomach walls that
toxin is not enough to actually
us but our reaction to the toxin is to
try to flush it away so our bodies start
flushing lots and lots of liquid through
the stomach trying to knock off these
bacteria what what happens is the
bacteria are holding for dear life onto
the walls of the stomach and all of our
good bacteria that are used to sitting
in the stomach juices are flushed out
humans dehydrate the stomach it's a very
low acidity and suddenly the environment
is much nicer for Vibrio cholerae
oftentimes humans die because of the
dehydration unless you're given
electrolytes and some means for staying
hydrated but this example as gruesome as
it is shows the Vibrio cholerae changing
their environment in order to get an
environment that's far more suitable to
them you might say that they're doing
something technological but for my
purposes technology interests me when
it's changing and when it's accelerating
and that's certainly something that's
required if you're going to look or
what's required for that is that it be
designed and conscious but then we build
on technology so all the foods are
interesting examples and certainly give
us some outlying points to understand
what are the limits of Technology it's a
it's not technology that I'm following
the technology I'm following is is
illustrated here and we have an iceberg
and a ship approaching it often times we
focus on the visible part of Technology
like I took an example of a personal
digital assistant but it could be
anything what's not visible below the
surface is all of the things that
connect to that technology and the ship
could easily run aground if it's unaware
of techniques for use applications
wireless network means in its
infrastructure migration plan and so on
so you are very likely aware of all the
elements of technology that tie in to
the visible artifacts that we use but a
lot of people aren't and in schools
we're teaching this way of looking at
technology so that when they're making
choices they understand there's a lot
more than meets the eye in fact
technology are our tools and systems and
information I uh I'm wearing nano pants
today they have nano fibers in them so
what really works well is like with root
beer or
something bright and it just sheets
right off whenever I do pour root beer
on my pants the custodial group wherever
I am make sure I'm not invited back so
i'm not going to pour root beer on but
these are these pants are a very
primitive early form of nanotechnology
it's just fibers that stand up and the
dimensions though the cross dimensions
not the length are down in the several
hundred nanometer scale well the promise
of nanotechnology whether we reach it or
not is assemblers and matter compilers
so if we had something like a microwave
oven that allowed us to download the
designs for something from Napster and
then have it fabricated out of a feed of
various different types of elements that
came in like we currently get water gas
and electricity then you could
manufacture anything you wanted the
reason I bring this up is because the
third bullet of the information it
technology being almost anonymous with
information would become pretty clear at
that point because you're you're not
buying anything except for a design in
order to create whatever you want the
commodity is whatever's being fed into
the back of your matter compiler the
interesting stuff is a design why do we
use it I mentioned that communication is
a reason that we use technology for a
very long time here's an example going
from scrolls to the printing press the
Telegraph the telephone then a
photograph I took at the Smithsonian
Museum this fellow had a bluetooth
earpiece and now they're pretty common
but back when I was at the Smithsonian
it was the first one that I had seen so
I wanted to get a picture of him
contrasting the statues in the back of
in the background with this very new way
to communicate we are and we teach young
people lots of the different reasons why
you use technology so they recognize
them as new technologies come out where
does it come from it comes from a number
of places one of them is other tools I
just read a short analysis about YouTube
and how come you tube came about and it
was based obviously on other tools it
was based on cheap video hardware making
it easy to capture video cheap video
editing
software web 2.0 and web two point O
being built on all sorts of other tools
both artifacts protocols software the
examples I have here you see a fisherman
down in Australia it turns out that
dense populations are rather important
for technology one time ago Australian
Tasmania the small island that's
currently just off of its sure are they
were connected and the technologies of
fishing and needles and so on that were
present on one were present on the other
as the ice caps melted and water rose
Tasmania was isolated and they actually
lost those technologies for thousands of
years they did not fish and
archaeologists can tell that they had
starvation during those years so they
certainly had the motivation to fish but
they just they didn't even think about
fish as a food they didn't have the
technology for getting it which raises
the question of how could they lose the
technology the best explanation that
I've read actually this is my mom Jared
Diamond and Guns Germs and Steel was
that they had such a small population
that they actually forgot the technology
that at some point there were only one
or two people who remembered how to
create it and somehow they passed away
without passing it along plan an
accident I represent that with Napoleon
and the light bulb Napoleon was wont to
start wars and in one of his Wars he
discovered that the only source of
graphite was in England and England was
unfortunately one of his opponents so
the loss of sorts of graphite which was
critical for pencils pencils were
critical for the people that kept the
books all of the accounting that a
government depends upon so Napoleon said
as a national priority I wanted to
substitute for this pure source of
graphite which England controls and
there was a fellow lecomte who
discovered that you can take impure
forms of graphite mix it with clay and
create a very fine writing implement and
in fact you can vary the amounts of clay
and graphite so that you have different
hardnesses and now we have the pencils
that have h and h be like the number two
pencils that have
different hardnesses because you have
those mixtures of clay so there was an
intention the plan to create a new
technology and the light bulb relates to
an accident Edison discovered that if he
put a third wire into the light bulb you
can actually measure how much
electricity is going through the
filament but he couldn't see why there
was any use for this so he patented it
and moved on and it was someone later on
who figured out that this was actually a
vacuum tube and allowed you to amplify
signals which led to the transistor
which led to the integrated circuit and
on from there so it was actually an
accidental discovery that brought us to
semiconductor technology the vehicle
wheel has it was patented rather
recently not thousands of years ago and
in that way it was done as a stunt to
show that our patent system is not
working that well in some ways their
patent system does work well that it
does give you the chance to invest in
discovering and Technology and then have
the time to profit from it before
copycats move in but it also can give
people the opportunity to simply squat
on ideas and not develop them so we go
into the various places that the
information comes from in one of the
point of dense population one reason
real estate prices are expensive in
Silicon Valley is because there's that
benefit of dense population there are
people from google and the other high
tax and from stanford and berkeley in
asset interaction that sharing of ideas
that's so valuable to companies how does
it work here are a few answers patterns
that answer the question how does
technology work I mentioned that in the
11th century in England you had roughly
300 people for each power plant and
currently in the 21st century in England
about 300,000 people for each power
plant certainly a centralization and
also that we can decentralize with
computers we've had centralization with
mainframes decentralization with PCs
being everywhere re centralization with
server farms and there'll probably be
continual cycles and fluctuations so
centralized vers distributed is one
pattern technology that transcends
technologies there's also repetition and
layers if you look at the example the
bottom left
we have silicon with impurities
semiconductors being the foundation for
making transistors being a foundation
for making logic gates which are used to
make like of processors on which we run
machine languages on which we run
operating systems on which we have
application software so we're able to
operate or understand at one level
without having to understand all the
other levels and one a an illustration
of why this is good to know is that say
you're evaluating a technology and it's
a very complex technology you may have
to go to experts to find out what are
the costs and benefits understanding
that experts may specialize in one layer
and not really understand the other
layers gives you the caution that maybe
they don't understand how interactions
could lead to costs or benefits so as we
build up this this pyramid we're
building on this understanding at the
identity and change levels in order to
understand the costs and the benefits in
order to understand how do we evaluate
there's an example of Santa bots which
is a merchant behavior among lots of
little robots believe this is from s RI
and control and feedback algorithms it
won't go into the details on these but
you may well recognize how these
patterns underlies of different
technologies so this is the kind of
thing that we can teach young people
that will not become obsolete in 18
months or 36 months when the
applications that they learn may become
obsolete but these are the patterns that
will last throughout the rest of their
lives how does it change there's obvious
example of computers becoming smaller
faster more ubiquitous here's a these
are the for the answers that we give in
the book which is actually aimed at
adults and in the curriculum necessities
mother and daughter sometimes the
there's the the saying that invention is
the mother that's the necessity is the
mother of invention you really need
something so you invent it oftentimes
its flipped around that you have
something so you start looking for an
application the microprocessor was a
case in point Intel developed a
microprocessor we were supposed to go
into a calculator it turns out the
microprocessor was far too expensive to
go into these calculators that boosts
accom
was trying to build so Intel had this
technology that they needed to find an
application for and they went off
evangelizing and it turns out that there
are some good applications for micro
processors other than calculators
advantage compatibility risk visibility
auto and I get to aetna the next slide
auto catalysis which is technology
feeding off of itself to create new
technologies and evolution and memes the
whole meme concept that richard dawkins
started it's a fascinating way to look
at how technology changes so if we let's
go into advantage compatibility risk
invisibility from 1700 BC there was this
disc called the Phaistos disc or phase
those discs discovered on an island in
the Mediterranean and apparently it is
the earliest example of printing mass
printing because it had these 45 symbols
which were repeated but it never took
off it didn't take off like printing did
in China Korea or in Europe with
Gutenberg's printing press and we we
look at these elements of advantage
compatibility risk and visibility to
understand why the face those discs did
not take off why did it fail as the
technology why did it not diffuse and
the it did not have much of an advantage
because few people back then could read
so there's no market for printing there
were no pocket back books or pocketbooks
compatibility the people that controlled
writing were in a very powerful position
so they did not really want a lot of
other people to learn how to write or to
distribute they would undermine their
sense their their position of power
there was risk casting multiples of 45
symbols and testing clay mixtures would
require investment because there wasn't
that much demand that risk of investment
really wasn't that that justified and
finally visibility carving symbols and
pressing the tablet was actually slower
than a stylus so if you were going into
say a venture capital meeting with the
face those discs 1700 BC it might have
been a pretty hard sell to get them to
invest in it and in fact the venture
capitalists from 3,700 years ago did not
how does it change us for ways that it
changes us Methuselah is Burton
technologies allowing us to be healthier
lives longer and change a lot of the
ways that we interact with our
environment how we change education how
actually it changes crime levels it
turns out that there's this strong
correlation between suicide rates and
murder rates and lifespan there are
crime statistics in the the domesday
book from England from actually 1100 the
Year 1,100 there abouts and it shows
that murder rates were far far higher
than suicide rates and over time their
murder rates dropped steadily in suicide
rates increased steadily they cross
somewhere in the 19th century and it
correlates very closely to life span it
seems that the longer we live the less
likely we're inclined to kill someone
and the more likely we're inclined to
take our own lives I don't know why that
is but it's it's one way that technology
extending our lives extending our health
may affect a lot of things about society
this cartoon is an example of working up
the pyramid about how technology allows
us to do things that well actually
cartoons proves it but technology does
allow us to work at higher higher
intellectual levels and allow the
technology to care take care of many of
the underlying routine measures and I
know we started a bit late I'm going to
go through step through the last few
slides quickly so I can get to the
finale and not delay the the next talk
that's coming up we do have to stop for
this cartoon we're neither software no
hardware were your parents technology
changes the way we look at things and
certainly here's this young kid who's
used to hardware and software and
everything must fit into one category or
the other mustn't it we change it in
lots of different ways education is
certainly a way that you can have a
broad impact on changing technology
costs and benefits is a picture of from
China where a lot of our ewaste is sent
for recycling and the picture woman with
a hammer about to knock the yolk off the
back of a cathode ray tube and if she's
lucky it will not in
plode and then explode but simply crack
easily so she can take the copper coil
off of the back unfortunately it can do
that it can explode and it has lid on
the inside the lead protects us from the
electron beam is we're looking at it but
it will get into water reservoirs
wherever it's being broken up in this
case China and it's a poison how do we
evaluate it in the curriculum actually
in the book we go around the world if
you look at all these different examples
from the year you ron's aboriginals and
Australia evaluating stone axes and
canoes to priests and water temples and
small-scale agriculture nuclear power
lots of different ways that we our
values come into play when we're
deciding whether a technology is good or
bad we look at these different value
systems here's an adaptation of a far
side cartoon this is not Gary Larson's
title it's my own caption I don't care
that we have only one technology I vote
that we understand and evaluated before
it's too late certainly now we have many
technologies and we're at the point
where it's valuable to understand and
evaluate so the summary is technology
changes our world ever faster we can
understand and evaluate technology and
you can help society to guide technology
so so my appeal to those of you been so
kind to come is reflect on how you
evaluate technology and then share your
approach with children and Friends use
technological literacy to or use
actually use technology to wrote
technological literacy use blogs use
whatever techniques you have for
promoting this idea that's so important
to us choosing an intentional future
promote technological technological
literacy curriculum schools and if you
like help knowledge context which is at
knowledge context o RG if anyone's
interested in talking with me afterwards
I'll be sticking around for lunch and I
thank you very much for coming to this
