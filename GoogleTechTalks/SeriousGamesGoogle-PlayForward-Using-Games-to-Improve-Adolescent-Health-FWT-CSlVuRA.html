falstein I'm a game designer here at
Google and it is my pleasure today to
introduce this talk a couple of former
colleagues of mine dr. Lynn Helene and
Ben Sawyer Lynn is at Yale and is a
physician as well as a researcher there
and ben is a longtime serious game
progenitor and and massively connected
person who has been doing a lot of
wonderful creative and production work
in the field and i'm introducing them in
part because i was privileged to work
with them on the project you'll be
hearing about and it's very early stages
and just want to say having seen how it
has grown up it's just tremendous as you
you look at this contemplate how much
science and positive social good is
coming out of this as well as a variety
of really interesting gameplay
alternatives that I don't believe have
ever been used before certainly not in
this combination to try and affect very
serious change for some important
societal problems and doing all that and
making it fun getting people activated
and happy and raising the funds and
doing the research it's just a
tremendous amount of different problems
that our speakers today have managed to
admirably handle and with that I'll pass
it on to them thanks Noah and I'm happy
to be here my name is Ben Sawyer and I
have a company in Maine called digital
mill and we work on games beyond
entertainment specifically we do two
projects two types of projects we do a
lot of public facing efforts around the
serious games space one of them being
the games for health project which is
funded by the Pioneer portfolio at the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and then
on the other side of our business we
work with groups that are building games
and game technologies for purposes
beyond entertainment and help them bring
these
ideas to fruition so I'm going to start
off by just doing a rapid overview of
what the games are health field is and
some of the new thinking that the
project and our work with RWJ has
brought about and then transition that
into a discussion about the play forward
project at Yale where I was one of the
early design workers on it with Noah and
then transition to executive production
along with linds team and so hopefully
contiguously what you'll get a sense of
is how we can use games in sort of broad
public health opportunities so just to
talk about the games for health space
it's really about using the promise of
video games it's about trying to figure
out what they might have is comparative
advantages seeking those out and then
applying them to the types of problems
that we see in health and healthcare and
it's really you know we talk a lot about
engaging and motivating people we talk
about changing and supporting them
through those kinds of activities and
then we think about the ability to use
games to scale and sustain these ideas
and you know when you think about using
games to help people make better choices
I mean that's kind of what you're doing
in a game to begin with so there there
might be some natural congruence two
choices in life choices in any kind of
dilemma situation and gameplay we are
host a conference every year I just held
the ninth one two weeks ago in Boston we
bring together hundreds of researchers
game developers health professionals
basically get all together in a room and
start talking to each other share
projects share best practices and it's
been really neat over the last nine
years to see the field grow up to use
the space as a barometer as well as to
see projects actually get formed when
you bring people from different
disciplines together and get them
excited to work with each other it's the
the opportunities and the outcomes can
be quite interesting now one of the
things that we've done on this project
is build like sort of a taxonomy looking
at like what are the intersections and
the opportunities to apply games and
what this chart really says is that
there's a broad strategic opportunity to
use games in health and healthcare and
it's really needed our conferences and
when I look out and survey the work
that's been done over the last year at
any given
wait to see you know half to
three-quarters of these boxes light up
with different projects research games
coming to market other initiatives
taking on and even you know more obtuse
things like epidemiology there's
researchers who are using virtual worlds
and investigating them to understand how
infectious health actually takes place
within these worlds there's been design
flaws and games like World of Warcraft
and they've actually been you been able
to observe and and examine these worlds
and types of things that have happened
in them and then translate those into
the models and confidence levels within
those models for real-world infectious
disease so very very cool stuff this is
just a slide of some of the games that
you would see in the space if you're
paying attention to different work
that's going on and I really just put
this up to just say when you look at
some of the more interesting work there
just it immediately looks like something
you want to pick up and play with they
look like games they look there's
interesting work around user interfaces
there's like somebody doing a sort of
breathing mechanic for an anti-smoking
game there's stuff with diabetes
management walking transm translating
what it might feel like to be depressed
to help build empathy and understanding
for caregivers so it really does start
to look like an eighth of software
that's being built that's out at a
different kind of level than what we
might have seen previously with the way
we used media to engage people about
health and of course a lot of this stuff
is going mobile all of these games that
are on here on different mobile devices
or using different mobile technologies
and we did a big segment at em health
summit last year and brought a lot of
these together and so the space much
like many software spaces is is taking
advantage and moving to the mobile
platforms some of the more interesting
areas that are emerging recently it's
this sort of area of neurotherapeutics
Achille interactive labs which is based
on some work at adam gazzola's lab at
UCSF is bringing a product to market
that's helping to help people who are
distracted or dealing with interference
and help
the focus on concentration and and it's
a very interesting piece of work a lot
of research has gone into it and is now
actually moving towards a market
deployment Daphne babble ears lab is
doing some work with Eli mania and Joan
Ganz Cooney Center to look at how some
of her work which looks at how video
game players in and high action gameplay
can help people with ability to track
multiple objects to be engaged in
different ways so there is this so whole
area of neuroscience coming into play in
this neuro plasticity and direct work
out of that that's being put forward in
games for health and well-being another
area that we're seeing some really
exciting work in is crowdsourcing in
citizen science many people are familiar
with the folded project at the
University of Washington which was about
game players learning how to fold
proteins and doing that work better than
experienced scientists but there are
actually a number of these over the last
couple of years that have been built
Philo at McGill malaria spot out of out
of Europe as well sell slider from
cancer research UK and I wire at MIT
recently Google Facebook and Amazon did
a participated in a sort of game jam
with cancer research UK to build a
mobile game to pursue some citizen
science objectives within analysis of
cancer data in the UK and they're going
to be working to mature some of those
prototypes to something that hopefully
will come out in the next year it's
really been exciting i've actually had
all these projects speak of the games
for health conference and it's a real
neat bleeding edge of the space with
some exciting work where we see the
space sort of going we see a lot of work
around sensors a lot of interesting
stuff around the sort of quantified self
movement and then this whole area of
connected health has systems become
online as people become socially engaged
with each other around topics including
health as health professionals allied
health professionals are able to engage
patients and people in the public in
general around health and the
application front ends that can feed
into it and take data from it we're
creating a new platform for people
around health and healthcare another
area is this idea around positive health
which we'll talk about in a few minutes
the sensor is in wearable space is
exciting we're seeing a lot of activity
not only where there are also some
recent acquisitions in this space but
there's a lot of you know things that go
beyond the sort of norm like gecko cap
as well as asthmapolis or doing sensor
enabled asthma inhalers and then
building gamification strategies around
them to encourage kids to make sure
they're maintaining their asthma as well
as enabling them with GPS so that they
can see where an emergency inhaling
might have taken place then mapping that
and looking for perhaps environmental
issues where they can go and mitigate
those so a lot of really exciting work
in this space and a lot of people within
this space see games as a layer that
runs on top of this that drives some of
that engagement but also drive some of
the information architecture interfacing
between a user the information why
they're doing it contextualizing it and
motivating them to live healthier of
course you know taking this slide from
Sonny vu started misfits wearables he
sort of talks about like we're in a sort
of wearables one point o space and will
eventually start to see this stuff kind
of fade not go away but but become more
ubiquitous become almost you know part
of our everyday existence and when at
and as we're moving to that again
software becomes more important
experiences become more important in
games become part of that what this all
really means and what we're thinking
about in the game trail project is this
notion that with games we can maybe
potentially start to get to you earlier
in life and build up a self-efficacy
about healthiness to as Robert Wood
Johnson now talks about to create an
engaged culture of health and this other
idea where we can imbue and provide you
with health assets earlier in life so a
simple example would just be say hands
only CPR that you need to know it before
you need it and so can we like with that
and other types of health behaviors for
yourself or for others get those to you
earlier so that they're in position
when they're needed engaging people from
those those ages earlier in life where
they tend to fall off an engagement
around health simply because they're
sort of normally healthy but eventually
behaviors can catch up to you and age
can catch up to you and then all of a
sudden we're trying to cram into you at
40 45 50 everything that we wish you
knew because now you need it and so the
idea would be to try and improve that
and engage you throughout life around
that and change that model of self
health and biometric games may be part
of that along with a larger used to
drive a culture of health what we've
seen however is that a number of the
early projects in this space sort of
fall into kind of three categories one
would be large sales of various types of
health gains mostly around exergaming
and fitness but that had a low health
impact that's not to say that people
didn't use these games and that we've
seen really interesting you know
anecdotal stories incredible stories of
people whose lives have been changed by
this style of intervention versus others
but the numbers in comparison to the
sales are not the same on the other hand
we've seen things like remission from
hope lab which is had a high health
impact this is a game that has driven
adherence for pediatric cancer patients
but it's a narrow target audience
there's about I leave 50,000 cases in
the United States so a very well
targeted amazing study great design
well-crafted journal articles everything
that you would want from a sort of
seminal project but can we move and see
that at a different scale and different
targets and then of course a lot of
stuff we see are just bad games and bad
targets so what we're trying to think
about on the project is how we can solve
that Delta with the things that are
moving successfully and but then also
having a much higher coefficient of
health impact and then moving beyond
this sort of disease state based games
that some that at times come sort of
trapped in an assertive crucible in
terms of scale and impact in their own
ways and then of course looking for
those better games and better targets
where we've been thinking about is this
notion around positive health so dr.
Martin Seligman
sort of the father a positive psychology
and was a keynote at or conference a
couple of years ago is working with
robert wood johnson foundation on this
larger notion of positive health where
we could find biological markers
psychological markers functional markers
really measure those out and can we
instigate sort of a super health or a
positive set of health assets take you
above normal so that when you in get
when you when you would encounter a
health anomaly you don't fall below
normal you regress to the mean and you
sort of move through it so you actually
have less and frequent and briefer
ailments you're able to recover your
have greater psychological physiological
reserves these types of things and can
we instill that so what we thought about
in terms of moving towards that is this
notion of just what should everyone play
what are the health games that really
everyone should play that they're not
disease based that their consumer and
business distribution model compliant
they have multiple health issues they
could address and ones that adds such
there ideally globally capable and you
could be healthier immediately after
playing them although there could be
decays obviously or sustained points
that you need to maintain and as such
they offer population health effects and
that they address this sort of new
health model and new health literacy
needs that we have and such that the
developers building these games can have
a lot more flexibility about getting
them out the right ways getting them to
the right people addressing the market
needs that they also need and not
encountering sort of disease state
gatekeepers that may be problematic for
them even if they're showing efficacy
for their project so what we think is
that there are a bunch of areas that
we've seen so far in new areas that
we've identified that fulfill this that
become the kind of games that you can
play irregardless of your underlying
health condition and benefit from and so
what the project is doing now over the
next 18 months is actually looking
specifically into these areas and saying
what can we do either by design
prototypes creative common design
documents white papers supporting other
ideas or other people working in this
space to bring these kinds of games up
and through to the market
you the to the public at large because
what we think is that we can actually
match these things up really nicely to
the types of platforms that are
available the distribution methods and
actually get these out in a much more
broader way much more scalable way and
that actually the types of games that
we're talking about in the way we're
talking about them mean that not only is
the person who plays it healthier as a
result but the other people they
interact with our healthier even if they
didn't play it so if I play a game about
healthy cooking and I'm cooking better
for myself i'm also cooking better for
the people who i cook for and so that
starts to look much more like a public
health strategy as well as an individual
on positive strategy for them as well
and it takes games out of this notion of
these are for when you're sick you know
this is about being the healthiest most
high-performance person you can be and
as a result of that there are lifelong
health benefits available to you as well
as surrounding you pervasively with
tools in the form of games and software
easily accessible when you do need
things and when you want to engage so
ultimately one of these games the way I
look at the world and the way is play
forward and this is a game that we're
going to talk to you next I'm going to
introduce dr. Lynn Faline to tell you
more about this project which looks at
what I call a sort of longitudinal
health strategy for young people around
risk-taking and their ability to
navigate risky situations
so thank you to Noah for his
introduction and for all of you for
joining I'm Lynn Faline I'm a physician
at Yale University School of Medicine
and have been spending the last few
years working with a large highly
collaborative team around developing
this video game which is called play
forward Elm City Stories and as you can
see it's a video game specifically
targeting Risk Reduction and HIV HIV
prevention and teens so first question
is why develop and ultimately evaluate
this type of a game so if you look at
the statistics in 2009 about thirty-nine
percent of new HIV infections were among
a younger age group 13 to 29 year olds
and that was an approximate twenty one
percent increase from 2006 the majority
of these cases are ethnic minorities and
due to sexual contact when you look at
National Statistics only about six
percent of adolescents engage in sexual
activity before the age of 13 so
therefore an age group of 11 of 14 year
olds may be an optimal window of
opportunity for primary HIV prevention
and so with that in mind we submitted a
grant to the NIH specifically to the
National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development specifically to
develop and test a video game for Risk
Reduction and HIV prevention in young
teens and receive funding for this grant
in 2009 and so started our adventure in
terms of creating play forward elm city
stories and I'm going to walk you
through a little bit about that and then
leave some time for Ben to actually show
you the game itself so the first thing
we did was create the play to prevent
team and as you can see this is a highly
collaborative multidisciplinary team
from the science side from the game
development side and also from the
community side and each of the parts of
this triangle are equally as important
and we worked very closely and I think
very successfully in the development of
this game we have folks from the
sciences involved with
specifically around HIV helps behavior
pediatrics adolescent medicine social
and community psychology folks in the
game design world including Ben Noah and
then team at shell games which is in
Pittsburgh which helped develop the game
and then a number of after-school and
summer programs in the Greater New Haven
community that were instrumental in
terms of the formative work and then
also in terms of a lot of the play
testing we did of the game so this just
shows you some of the images early
meeting that we had where I shipped both
Noah and been out to New Haven to talk
about different components of the game
and how we would move forward with them
farnham neighborhood house which is the
fairhaven section of New Haven who has
been a partner from day one and you can
see here some of the Farnham kids who
really helped play a major role in
developing this game and giving feedback
on the artwork on the story lines on the
characters and ultimately on the game
itself so this is a very early image of
the initial design of the game and
obviously we moved from there but really
starting with you know with a lot of
different concepts that ultimately came
together an important part of this work
was doing the format formative work and
that involves spending time with the
kids bringing strategies to them to
elicit information from them in a way
that was meaningful and salient to them
so this for example in the upper left
hand corner is a graphic that we
actually had designed we couldn't find
anything in magazines or newspapers that
would depict teens in sort of a benign
situation with nothing overtly risky
going on and so we asked a graphic
artist to design this picture and sat
down with a group of kids and
essentially all we ask them is what do
you think is going on here and from
there poured out all sorts of stories
really coming from inside their heads
around what they thought was going on in
this story so for example all the way
back in the middle you can see a little
girl talking to a boy and probably about
99% of the
girl said she just found out she's
pregnant so these were stories that came
out from the kids that we then were able
to transport to our game development
team and were ultimately embedded into
the game this was another example of a
strategy we used we use the my life
timeline which was assembly essentially
just simply giving kids a piece of paper
with a timeline from ages 11 to 21 and
asked them to fill it out and probably
doesn't transmit very well here but it's
everywhere from graduation at age 13 is
sweet 15 to a hair salon business at age
18 somewhere fit in there is a belly
button ring and then at age 20 helping
my mom out so again giving us a real
sense of what's on the life spectrum for
these kids where they see themselves
going over the next 10 years what's
what's important to them so given all
that all these pieces came together in
terms of the initial game design in
terms of information from kids and
allowed us to end up coming up with this
game design model which i think is
aesthetically really beautiful but it
also served as a way that we as a large
team from different disciplines could
all come together and see what all the
moving parts were sort of double check
that we had all the components that we
needed in there and as you can see this
sort of outlines you know all the
different aspects of the game that
ultimately ended up really being in the
game so this was a this was an
incredibly important document for
reference for everyone on the team
another critical part of the process was
was the need to design our behavior
change manual so the the focus of this
game is not just teaching but is
actually the goal is changing behavior
and teaching kids a set of skills so
that they can keep themselves safe and
healthy and avoid the risks that you
know inevitably come with with the teen
years and so we went through the process
of creating a for each of our four
mini-games a behavior change manual and
you
see an example of of this one here for
one of our mini games and in each of
these manuals they they followed the
same format it they helped explain what
the science was what we were actually
trying to do scientifically there was a
section around what the design elements
were and then that allowed us then all
of these documents many many many many
documents were actually posted on google
docs so that all team members would have
access to them real time highly
iterative everyone can talk back and
forth add edits communicate about
changes and this allows then the game
developers to help add in some expanded
designs ultimately building out these
these documents which led us then to be
able to create what we call a logic
model which essentially allows someone
to say that these are the components we
need in this in this intervention in
this case a game and we can double check
to make sure that we've included
everything that we feel is integral to
leading to behavior change so you can
see on the left hand side we have each
of our mini games and what their purpose
is ultimately they lead to some
individual determinants so you have to
take into consideration what other
aspects of the individual may be
contributing here ultimately leading to
our key behavior change elements that
we're looking to impact and then
ultimately to our goal so all of these
things came together to allow us to
create this logic model so that we would
know that we were following through with
what we had set out to do
where we landed was with our game and
you can see some again some of the the
Finnish aspects of the game we have me
power which is our aspirational avatar
we have refusal power which is one of
our mini games people sense which is
another mini game priority sense no
sense the challenge stacks which are
really the narrative forming the
foundation of the game and then the
epilogue which is an important aspect of
the game that really allows the player
to reflect back on everything that they
did in the game thus far and going
forward so when we show you the game
you'll have a little bit better sense of
what what each of these components are
and again you know going back to some of
the the work that we did along the way
with the players with the kids in the
community it was absolutely key to us
the same way that the stories that were
generated from the graphic picture I
showed you as well as some other
strategies key to have it be authentic
as well the artwork really had to be
authentic we really have to feel like we
were getting seeing through the eyes of
our target audience and so one of the
strategies we used is we we got together
a group of about ten kids we gave them
disposable cameras and we said go out
into your community into your
neighborhoods take pictures of
everything you want to take pictures of
your friends your family your houses
everything that's important to you real
and ideal not only what is but what you
might want it to be and they did they
came back and we developed their
pictures so I had close to 400
photographs and really and then
discussed a lot of what what the images
were and what they meant to them and
that allowed us then to build the
artwork specifically from what was what
was coming through the eyes of these
kids and so you can see you know we had
a photograph of hair in the upper left
hand corner and that that gave us a hair
for character shoes a bedroom and then
neighborhood shots as well in addition
our colleagues at shell games came
to New Haven several times all with
cameras in hand we loaded them all into
a van and we all drove around all
different neighborhoods of New Haven and
they took photographs of everything that
was in the area we went and visited the
insides of schools they met with
teachers so it was it was really a
highly educational process so and these
are some of the some of the graphic
drawings that came out of that whole
process many many iterations of of all
the artwork until we ended up with the
game so this again is sort of just shows
a to the process of developing people
sense which is one of our mini games and
kind of following along from the
left-hand corner down around and really
seeing how it evolved over time I mean
each of these minigames really has their
own story their own process to end up
where I think we all felt really good
about what the product was loop jump had
and these are just for screenshots from
some of the challenge stacks some of the
stories that that make up the part of
the game again focused on certain
content area that are particularly
involved with risk with kids so late
night visitor sexual protection and
unexpected bad reaction and seven
minutes in heaven and so these again
were are highly relevant stories to kids
a lot of this coming from the kids
themselves that the player has to
negotiate through and travel through
successfully in order to continue in the
game so the other half of this project
was after designing developing is the
evaluation because again keep in mind
what we're looking for is to accomplish
something we want to see something
change we want to see bit behavior
change attitudes change knowledge change
so we have now embarked on the
evaluation in the form of a randomized
control trial we started the end of
februari our goal is to enroll 330 11 to
14 year-old teenagers we have conducted
we're about halfway through our second
wave and have enrolled about a little
over 100 kids so far
and have engaged six after school and
summer camp programs so we just go to
the sites we bring all of our tablets
and our staff and the kids play the game
and and we follow along with them kids
are randomly assigned to either play our
game or a set of 12 attention time
controlled tablet games that means that
we just have all kids playing the games
for the same amount of time and some of
these are some examples of some of the
games that the control group plays and
we collect a lot of data we collect
baseline data on the kids we collect
gameplay data so everything they do in
the game is collected we do a number of
offline instruments that are validated
assessments of to collect data on their
knowledge attitudes and behaviors we
also do qualitative interviews at the
end of the six weeks of gameplay overall
they play 12 gameplay sessions for what
would be about a total of sixteen hours
and we do six follow-up assessments over
a period of two years and the goal is
being this specifically is that we want
to look for documented change in
behaviors knowledge attitudes over time
using data from standardized assessments
and we want to evaluate behavior change
in knowledge that we collect from the
gameplay experience so we can see not
only we could collect self-report data
from the assessments but we can also
collect gameplay data and see what the
kids are actually doing and deciding and
the choices they're making in the game
itself and some of the exploratory goals
are does behavior in a game review what
someone does in real life and I really
feel like that is just that is a hugely
somewhat philosophical but also very
practical question about you know what
they do is that what they say they would
do and isn't what they actually do and
if so it can a game can be used as a
vehicle for behavior change by fostering
positive health behaviors which is what
we're hoping to do with this
intervention but also it can potentially
serve as an assessment aid so it can
actually help us assess what people
would do in real life without having to
move in with them they can play a game
and we can tell something from that
so in terms of our next steps were in
the throes of our evaluation so we're
doing that and and we're also archiving
the whole development process in terms
of all the all the aspects of that we've
been publishing some of our initial
findings and some of the process aspects
of doing the project and then also
forming looking for new ways of
evaluating what what we've created as
well as forging some new collaborations
we're in the process of looking at
additional games that we're planning to
develop and looking for funding for
those as well as doing potentially doing
some imaging studies using neuroimaging
so we could actually catalogue what may
be happening actually at the level of
the brain in kids who are playing these
games and then also some of the sort of
additional play forward versions
including a parent version a game
focusing on teen dating violence and
bullying again a lot of the aspects of
those behaviors or cop are consistent
with the risk behaviors we've been
targeting in the current game as well as
drug and alcohol and drug and alcohol
focus so I thank you and I'll pass it
back again Ben to play ok and give you a
short preview of the game I'll let it
pull up here ok it's decided to require
my password so everybody look away and
then I will load one of the games so you
can see we can have multiple saved games
and a lot of this is instrumented this
way just simply so that we're able to
collect data on the right player and
make sure that they're all of this is
captured so that we can do the analysis
so it's called play forward Elm City
Stories Elm City being another name for
New Haven so what you see on the sort of
home screen of the game some of this
would be locked this is a game that I've
been
playing for a while but ultimately you
have these stories in up at the top
seventh eighth ninth and so on grade
levels these are different moments in
life where things have gone wrong and
you're going to explore them and then
ultimately resolve them to the point
where where that things didn't go wrong
and then benefit from the fact that
those risky moments in life never took
place but in order to do that you have
to have certain senses and powers at
certain levels you have to bring them up
to a certain skill point that would have
enabled you to get past that and it's in
those mini games where you actually
practice and take on the skills so
there's a bunch of narrative emotional
elements going on there's visualization
going on there's actual skill
development these are what we hope is
taking place and so I'll give you a
sense of the story sort of challenge
stacked areas first so when you go into
this area if you were first going into
the area when playing the game you would
have been presented in interest one day
and had an idea hey your grandma left
her pills sitting here we could take
some and get stupid hat and she never
noticed seriously come on we could get
high without anyone busting us so the
game is specifically geared towards HIV
prevention HIV acquisition being at the
top of a pyramid of risky behaviors that
might involve drugs and alcohol other
kinds of risk-taking situations that
ultimately may lead that person's
behavior into acquisition of HIV so the
game doesn't focusing at very much
specifically on HIV although there are
HIV elements in scenarios in the game it
focuses on the continuum and spectrum of
risk encounters that kids may may have
in life and helps them to develop a set
of unified skills across all of those
that they can call upon when engaged as
such so in this case as we saw your
friend has come over and is thinking
about trying to take the prescription
drug pills from your grandmother because
you can get high off them so
prescription drug abuse is a very
fast-growing element
of drug abuse in general and among young
adults and kids now when you start in
the stories you start sort of in the
middle moment of it you can see the
other areas are locked what this part of
the game is it's mostly an exploratory
narrative there's not necessarily a lot
of strategy going on in this part of the
game first but what you're trying to do
is find different hidden elements to
assemble the story these key points so
in this case a small story element of
your friend who is clearly reaching for
these pills I can turn a different sense
and find that now what I'm actually
doing at this point in the game is I'm
trying to I'm trying to capture these
key points and you can see at this point
I need five of them plus i need a
refusal power and a no no sense of a
certain level to unto go to the next
part to move up temporarily in the in
this story to a point where i didn't my
friend didn't take the pills i talked
him out of it i said no way so now
what's going on at this case is you see
that there's a red button in a green
button try the pills don't try the pills
this isn't a moral dilemma being placed
upon the player quite the opposite these
are just pathways in the game we want
them to go down both this is about do
they put in the effort to explore the
whole thing so we're not having this
false assumption with them that we know
that they want we know that we they know
that we want them to do the good thing
they're they're saying oh I'll just do
that this isn't isn't that kind of
design in fact some of those key points
me we go please won't you answer me I'm
calling 911
some of those key points that you need
to unlock that scene that we were just
in are actually housed in in this scene
so I would have I've now gotten this one
and then I could go I would collect the
other ones and then go back and you can
see now I have four of them and so I
still have two more they happened to be
priority point ones that I want to get
and I would do that and then I would
move up in this story what happens is we
show you that risk doesn't just go away
automatically so yes you convince your
friends not to take the pills so you can
get high but he goes oh why don't we
sell them instead we don't have to take
when we can sell them and then you go to
school you get caught you get out of
getting caught and you eventually
resolve it to the point that you
convince your friend not to do anything
with the pills and you just have a good
time now some of those key points if I
did not have enough on people sense and
priority sense and no sense I wouldn't
have been able to capture them what
would have come up instead is that the
dialogue that says you need more
priority sense here in order to capture
this key point would you like to play
the priority since game and level up
your power so that's where we're
transitioning moving people back and
forth between our narrative and the
minigames that drive the skill
development and further narrative points
and further understanding and
capabilities so I'll play a few of those
one of our favorite in the favorite of a
lot of our players is people sense so I
don't know how many people are parents
I'm a parent I've encountered the fact
that I can have my son's meet somebody
in five minutes later they're supposedly
best friends and I'm like no they're
just somebody you've gotten to me and it
takes a little bit longer so there's not
a gradient that that youth tend us
sometimes have they tend to see people
is either really bad or really good and
it's it's hard for them to make
decisions and so what we're trying to do
is give them a little bit of an a way to
sort of build a process and to build a
more elaborate process hopefully that
they then take this and build up a
higher sensitivity and a more deliberate
practice of thinking about who are the
people in my
social circle how how do they clue me in
on whether or not there's somebody who
could who could be more good raised my
risk level or lower it so in this case
you have these friends you're actually
helping at this point you're helping
someone else so that we can explore
other storylines beyond things that you
personally might feel or reflective of
you so we can move them across all kinds
of different stories in this case what
we're trying to do is just see little
bits and clues about people the kinds of
things that you might notice on a social
network that you might notice just out
and about in the schoolyard or in your
neighborhood or something they might say
to you it in these types of clues very
causal clues that over a few encounters
you might pick up some of these things
and then you kind of think about where
you want to place them on the social
circle so we could see here this person
wants to hang out you just talked about
getting really wasted at a party she's
always hanging out with Tyrell photos
with her teammates seems fairly oh hey
Emily let's see dance team dance team
photo album with the dance team feeling
pretty good Payton doesn't talk a lot
finishes likes to post crazy science
videos so fairly good I think actually
some of these people are a little bit
more probably see oh come out drinking
with me so let's maybe put them away a
little bit more now once you do that now
you get invites from your social network
and you have to decide at this point is
this an invite I should take or not and
so what's going on is there's a
mathematical risk and the invite in and
of itself and then there's a
mathematical risk of where the invites
coming from both initially where the
envelope is and then who else is coming
so we're able to model a lot of
different simple situations we're able
to model that person who seems really
nice has lots of basic clues but they
will invite you to do something very
risky we're able to model the risky kid
who just gives you a fairly benign
invite along with other good kids and
may
that's enough to say okay I'll try it so
in and then in the case of the score you
get more points for saying yes to
something but you don't get it you you
don't lose a lot of points if you say no
to someone you've pushed away initially
on your social networks so you're trying
to optimize your score of course in demo
I already did something wrong I got a
strike because I went out and I drank
too much with a group of kids who
probably I should have picked up on the
clue that this was an invite that was
not going to be great again I accepted a
very innocuous invite but from someone I
knew from previous knowledge with
somebody who may have who may have been
a high-risk person let's see if I get
something good yeah let's go to the game
alright so something good came out of
that well that one was already about
sneaking out so now I got three strikes
against me and I fail at the game I
could replay it and every decision being
made there's recorded we can follow the
gameplay we can see which scenarios
people had were stumped by we could see
where they were thinking where they were
manipulating the the board and so forth
another area that we have is priority
sense so I'm priority sense what we're
trying to do is just model some simple
decision making processes around how do
you get towards the longer term goals
that you have through making good
decisions about short-term opportunities
so in this case I'm trying to actually
optimize both my school performance but
also my personal happiness and I have
different cards here health money school
friends happiness and family and within
these cards are opportunities so i can
start eating breakfast every morning at
home and that might help my health I
could give up drinking soda I could also
do some schoolwork I could do a project
for the science fair I could go to the
library every week for study time I
could make a video for extra credit in
Spanish I can take the PST pSATS but you
know what i'm going to do since I'm at
Google I'm going to do a project for the
science fair and now there are risks
involved even with good opportunities
they're still risked their things you're
giving up when you make a decision so
what would they might be so I think oh
well will the guys think I'm lame this
will be a lot of work the supplies cost
money now I can decide whether I want to
do this or walk away from it I'll decide
to do it but I can cover one of these
priorities I can basically mitigate the
risk a little bit more and so I'll
mitigate my happiness because that's
another area I'm trying to optimize and
I'll go for it now I have to spin the
wheel of life and I take my chance and I
I did I this was a good decision a good
decision to do it a good decision to
cover a certain particular area I had
thought this sort of through a little
bit and it wasn't just like oh yeah I'll
do that oh I'll do that no I won't do
that I'm thinking about towards a pro
set of priorities and expressing them in
better near-term decision-making so my
school performance went up and my
happiness didn't go down too much now I
could choose to I need to optimize
happiness as well and a lot of these are
a little bit more tempting I think I'll
try drugs ones just to see how it feels
and I'll think about what were they
offered what were the things that might
happen so not only are we practicing the
model but we're also doing a lot of just
simple visualization and suggestions to
kids about what kinds of things could go
right or wrong for them and expanding
their knowledge base of those ideas
without just overly preaching it we're
making it part of a strategic decision
making process rather than a rhetorical
process so I could do this and I'll
think about covering my hell my
schoolwork and I'll go for it and our
game respects the fact that in life
something that might you know ideally as
a parent I'd like it to come up health
and have them you know go through that
but if you play through the whole game
the odds are going to catch up to you
just like in life you keep spinning that
wheel it's going to come up and you're
going to have those bad moments and
they're going to cost you dearly in the
game and you're going to experience that
but we didn't want to we didn't want to
rig the integrity of the game because
the players would have seen that right
away so I did get what I wanted but I
also could have had a quite a calamity
so at any given point you can walk away
from these cards you can walk away you
can mitigate so we're getting a very
rich set of data about how they think
about different opportunities and the
risks and benefits associated with them
and so are they I'll exit that in no
sense we deal with just the knowledge
that underlies all of this curriculum
and while we know that knowledge alone
doesn't change behavior it's still a
component of it and so I can so what we
do is we modeled this after just like
the way kids argue about things on the
playground like when I grew up like
eventually would just be talking about
something and someone would say
something like oh spider man could beat
Batman right like we could clash the
comic book universe together and we'd
have an argument and then all these
facts would fly out and people would
just you know eventually it would just
get out of hand probably but so what we
did was we modeled this idea we're
basically disguising a trivia game in
the form of a schoolyard argument so one
of the kids actually said something and
then you have to decide whether you
agree with that or not to start the
argument aw in this case he's saying
that a common misconception of kids is
that you can't get pregnant the first
time you have sex and so I will say
that's wrong I get some extra points my
cred meter goes up and now i'm actually
going to use evidence to back up my
argument right so you know spider-man is
stronger than Batman because he was bit
by a spider so I'm pulling out that
evidence that i have in this case i
would put i would pull out the fact that
it's a risk any time you have sex that
you could get pregnant
and i'll use that and it's just really
interesting because it's actually a
Common Core standard to get kids to
understand to use evidence in the
support of arguments but now it's on
because he's not going to back off he
still is holding to this mythology that
this is true and so now what we're going
to do is a little bit of reinforcement
but what we do is we actually turn it
into a fun argument so in one case two
of the at every point two of these are
right and one is wrong and the one
that's wrong is sort of you get tricked
into agreeing with his position like I
say something and all of a sudden he's
like Oh Oh see you agree with me but the
reason to our right is twofold one we
want them to read the right answer twice
but then the second to make it fun one
of the answers is really snappy that
gets to that sort of schoolyard argument
item it so in this case we could say I'm
going to get paid soon as your
babysitter if you keep believing this or
I could just say you're so wrong you can
get pregnant the first time so I'm going
to go with the real sort of zinger and
you can see I got two points instead of
one point so I'm actually going to win
this argument faster in it and it
doesn't go away he comes back and so
there's a little bit more so we're
really trying to give them this moment
this emotional win moment that they
really reinforces these things and see
their knowledge rise as a result so I'll
come out of that you see we used a lot
of game motifs so we are setting that up
almost like Street Fighter right we
really are trying to engage them in the
medium and then the conventions of that
medium interpreted through our sort of
curriculum that way and then finally we
have to and I won't play these too far
but refusal power is basically there is
a lot of work around how to teach people
refusal skills to elaborate them and
allow them to be more confident saying
no to things no to other people and
understanding that often in a risky
situation when someone is offering you
something what we call peer pressure is
really manipulation and getting them to
have a higher sense that when someone is
trying to manipulate you to do some
thing that seems ostensibly good for you
it's really about them and that you're
being used and that there are strategies
you can use to understand that to
counter it and to ultimately be
empowered against it and so it steps you
through this whole process and allows
you to do that in this case this person
is really asking me about getting high
and so what's happening here is I'm
building up my power meter it's a power
meter to say no to him so I'm basically
building up my internal capacity to say
you know this is really not for me now
he's actually trying to get me to do it
and we're trying to show them that peer
pressure isn't just something that
happens but we can relate to you the
peer pressure takes specific forms they
don't need to learn all these forums
like I like a textbook but to understand
the the sort of overall pneus about it
and then think that you can also
manipulate back in the other direction
with different types of excuse
strategies so I think he's sort of
selling it so I blocked his attack and
now I can say something I'm going to be
funny about it I'm going to say what
could be more fun than biology you could
see now I'm winning the argument I'm
sort of pushing him away I'm not
necessarily compromising who I am I'm
not getting in his face and creating a
giant argument about it I'm trying to
find my comfort zone that enables me to
extract myself from the situation and
this is based on a lot of role-playing
strategies that are used in in in
classrooms and stuff and we're just
translating it to a system that we think
could be more scalable and finally me
power is sort of the Avatar rethought as
a set of like scrapbooked ideas for what
you want life to be so many kids these
days especially kids in low
socio-economic strata are just not
engaged in a way where they're told
anything's possible our game says that
our game lets you build out all kinds of
things you want careers you want to have
you know my future job I think I'm going
to choose
20 let's see here i'm going to i am
going to choose to let's see i'm going
to choose to work at Google and we give
you points just for deliver getting
giving us this information and and what
we're trying to say to you in this game
is we're open we want you to achieve all
of these things and so you would gain me
power of doing it so you can think of me
power as being the selfish self self
esteem that encourages you to say no to
things short term to achieve long-term
objectives now ultimately they were
trying they're doing all of these things
to mitigate all those stories to move
through all of these levels to practice
all these skills but in any given moment
they can cash out their progress in the
form of the epilogue where they could
sort of get a sense of how much is my
effort paid off now I haven't actually
mitigated any of those stacks so you can
immediately get a sense it doesn't take
long to understand this life hasn't gone
well enough yet of course if I had gone
through a lot of the game I would start
to see very positive outcomes in this
again trying to stretch out that
lifeline past 20 and belly button rings
to 40 and 50 and a full life that's
fully accomplished and that that does
have bearing on the short-term things
that may happen to us and then power us
to move through that so with that that
is played forward and we're happy to
wrap up and talk to you more about it
