seamer who is an organizer our first
session on additive manufacturing
Michael who's excited to be at Google
I'm really excited to be here my friend
told me the other day said you're going
to get smarter just by being there so
it's a it's a public true statement
little osmosis first thing I want to do
is thank Janet and Andy and Elizabeth
and a few all the others at the National
Academy of Engineering for inviting me
to help organize that a manufacturing
session I also wanted to recognize
Carolyn super sad from UT Austin who
cannot be here she's actually having her
second child soon and couldn't fly but
she put a lot of work into the event so
I wanted to thank her as well this is
going on my third event that I've
attended and to take a whole industry
and compress it in 24 hours
approximately there's a little bit like
sipping water from a fire hydrant and so
the great thing about additive
manufacturing is compared to artificial
intelligence and some other areas is
that it's stuff it's physical things and
so we hope and a half days time and a
lot of conversations that take place in
the next two and a half days that you
get a good grasp and what's going on the
industry and there's some good good
outputs of that the technology typically
to date is used a lot for product
development making one-off models and
you'll see today that that's that's
changing a good bit but things that are
medical communication models to
basically mechanical parts and pieces to
launch a new product faster it's
starting to make a big impact in the
area of rapid tooling both pattern based
its kind of the de facto standard for
investment casting of metals and then
also a new area which is kind of grown
in the past five years is rapid tooling
that's where it could print tools
directly and poor metal or make plastic
parts from that and one of the big
things that will be covered today is
direct part production both plastic and
metal parts and hopefully you guys will
get excited about that this is an
example of thousand batch piece orders
to a tier two supplier that ends up
going on a Land Rover so it's little
wire guide
unique applications that come up you
need to make a one-off crown for an
elephant you know what are you going to
use how are you going to make it has
undercuts in it so machine doesn't work
out that well well this is an impression
that was made a laser scan of an
elephant's tusk and 17-4 stainless steel
crown was was produced and put on this
elephant down in Orlando Florida so we
make stuff right but but what's the big
idea I mean that making stuff has been
has happened for a while but the real
big idea is compressing the product
development cycle to eventually right
when you get to the point of idea
creation and going from the beginning as
a marketing request something their
ideas are going to sell a bunch of a
bazillion of units by the time he gets
down to the end is that what the
customer really wanted well with this
technology it's an enabler to allow you
to compress it to the point of having
the thought having all the engineering
and manufacturing constraints behind the
scenes and get what you want it's
starting to get out there this year it's
really exploded not only these magazines
The Economist was one of the biggest
articles but it's also showing up on the
colbert report jay leno and it's getting
mainstream recognition and really what
that's doing is its spawning a new
industrial revolution in my opinion and
that's allowing people to go right from
an idea without being an engineer
necessarily and you'll see that today to
create new products quickly and make
them in new ways so without further ado
I'd like to introduce brent's Tucker
with the University of Louisville known
Brent for a long time he's a great guy
and he's going to give a stellar talk
I'm sure this is my contact information
as well thank you let me welcome break
thanks Mike so what I was asked to do
when I was asked to speak here was to
come and sort of give you an
introduction to what do we mean by this
whole concept of additive manufacturing
what what are the technologies that we
mean and sort of an introduction to what
are the implications of these
technologies in a sense of how are
people using them today but what could
they be used for in the future so let me
run you through a few wat if questions
what if anyone could make almost
anything they needed anywhere in the
world
whether it's shoe textiles a replacement
part for the car not in a big factory
but distributed however you might need
to produce it wherever you might need to
produce it what if all it took to set up
an advanced manufacturing facility was
just electricity some access to some raw
materials and maybe a computer plugged
it in and ran what if an entrepreneur
could start selling a new product
without ever needing to buy a machine
purchase a tool proved Adam old and they
could just start chipping the day after
the design is finalized or what if
something like your your watch broke and
you didn't want to buy a new watch band
so use some sort of free sketching tool
like Google Sketch to design replacement
you uploaded that on a website and you
ordered that printed out in the material
of your choice cost you about five bucks
or let's say what if you wanted to
change the way hearing aids were made
all the in the in the air hearing aids
what have you just wanted to scan an
impression of the year print out that
impression so it's an exact fit and just
insert electronics start shipping them
to all the millions of people who needed
those and what happens well a thing
within the year hearing aids is they sit
out a little high speech squeal so one
of the main reasons they go bad is
because the dog eats it because it's
it's like a dog whistle so instead of
having to go through and get another
impression while they've got the digital
file they can just print you out another
one right or what if you want to control
here's a little more engineering side
what if you want to control not only the
overall geometry of the part but also
have that geometry made up of a trust
network where each truss has an
optimized thickness and not only an
optimized thickness but you could
individually control the material in the
microstructure in that strut for
precisely the performance you wanted to
get the optimum overall performance but
what if all of these things were already
happening and most people had no clue
all of these examples I've just given
you our precise are happening and all of
the pictures that I've shown you are
things that people are already currently
doing in different ways with additive
manufacturing so look I want to step you
through what is additive manufacturing
and what are some of the business
implications just to start seeding some
of the conversations today and introduce
it for the rest of the guys who are
speaking so additive manufacturing what
do we mean by that it's really the
process and this is the new ASTM the
definition for the for what we mean by
additive manufacturing it's the process
of joining material to make objects from
3d model data usually layer upon layer
as opposed to subtractive manufacturing
methodologies so sometimes for instance
my father-in-law he he was in the
printing industry so I say the word
additive manufacturing yacht it
automatically thinks its additives to
put into polymers to put into inks or
whatever that's about the only confusion
I see so that's why they put the as
opposed to subtractive here so in the in
the technical community people have used
the terms rapid prototyping solid
freeform fabrication additive
fabrication people are now coalescing
around this concept of additive
manufacturing but you find in the print
in the in the regular print New York
Times economist whatever they tend to
use the terms 3d printing and those are
synonymous in essence let me step you
through just a little video if you
haven't really seen what does this whole
process of additive manufacturing this
little about one minute video kind of
does a nice job of explaining what we
mean by that whoops purp sound the
process of additive lay manufacturing
starts with a computer-generated
three-dimensional model the model is
then converted into a triangulated
surface mesh which we call an STL file
stl is now the de facto standard used by
all additive manufacturing systems after
inputting the stl file some additive lay
manufacturing systems will automatically
generate structures to support
overhanging parts of the geometry
the amount of support structure will
depend on both the geometry of the part
and the orientation of the part so
here's the first part where I always
posit teaching my students because some
of the technologies you're going to see
it right away their self supporting you
don't need to generate these synthetic
supports to hold up something so some
process is when you use it if you want
to build something with an overhang you
have to put something underneath that to
hold up that overhang other processes
you'll notice if you're building in a
powder bed for instance the powder will
support it so that's one of the key
differentiating factors between
different technologies that will
introduce here in a second let's
continue on with this in addition to the
amount of support structure needed part
orientation will also fake the surface
roughness of the part and the time it
takes to build that part in the additive
low manufacturing system so this is the
second part where I always pause it and
the reason here is because if you look
at if you look up close to an additive
manufactured part you're all it's always
made up of these thin layers and you're
basically going to get a whole
stair-step effect and and so I teach my
students is just like in calculus as
Delta X goes to 0 you get the perfect
solution the same thing in additive
manufacturing as the layer thickness
goes to zero you get the exact
representation of the part but at some
point a thinner layer becomes
meaningless it doesn't help you in any
sort of a practical engineering context
and so we just we basically go with the
limits of what the technology can bring
about once the parts been orientated and
the support structure to be generated
the resulting three-dimensional geometry
is then sliced electronically into
two-dimensional layers each to delay our
representing the profile of a physical
layer which will be made using the
additive low manufacturing system once
all the layers have been sliced their
then stored as slice files on the
additive low manufacturing system
waiting to be used on completion the
slice files are then sent to the
additive lay manufacturing system one by
one where they're reconstructed from the
bottom up into a solid three-dimensional
pars alright so let me talk
about how we actually construct once
we've got all those that layer
information how do we build those up to
make a three-dimensional part how many
of you feel like you're pretty familiar
with additive manufacturing raise your
hand so maybe about a third of the
people in here so what you find is this
is a whole collection of technology
starting in about nineteen eighty-six
the first technologies were developed
first patents by a guy named Charles
hole and they created a company called
3d systems and so you have this whole
all kinds of inventors all over the
world have come up with different ways
to add material together to create
three-dimensional objects layer by layer
but but it's only recently we've been
trying to categorize these things so
that we can help in educational purposes
is helping teaching people so recently
we r balloting actually with asked ASTM
we have a new standards committee in
this area and I'm the chair of that and
so we've come up with seven process
categorizations and I think you'll find
for those of you who've been in the
industry or don't know or know nothing
about it it's really nice to be able to
compare and contrast technologies based
on what's the sort of general approach
they use and is it you know but what's
the benefits and drawbacks of these
approaches so what you're going to find
is I'm going to use some terminology
here that maybe is not widely used
because everybody knows it based on what
this entrepreneur called it or this
business called it and what we're trying
to do is come up with some broader
categorization so I'm going to use these
broader categorizations the first type
of technology is what we call a
photopolymer of that process this was
actually the first one ever
commercialized and the build material in
this is a light-sensitive polymer resin
when you shine light on it it converts
from a liquid to a solid and so this
little animation over here basically
illustrates how that works we're
basically scanning the surface of a
liquid that and it solidifies we pull
the platform down one layer thickness
and we scan the surface again and pull
it down and scan it again we're creating
a three-dimensional object so for
instance how many of you have heard of
the the company aligned technologies
that makes dental aligners they sell
tens of millions of dental aligners a
year every one of them the pattern is
made this using this process and then
they thermoform a little plastic piece
over it
and then basically people can not have
to wear braces they can get a series of
impressions that basically change your
teeth from what they were to what they
should be and so this process is used in
that another category is what we're
calling material jetting in material
jetting we're actually using an inkjet
printhead to deposit the build material
itself and typically that's one of two
kinds of materials one is it's either
wax or it's a photopolymer and so if
we're using an often we can print more
than one material just like we have more
than one color we can print what more
than one material so this is sort of the
standard way a material jetting system
is set up and this is an illustration of
what's called the object companies
machine but anyways they have a build
material which is represented by yellow
here I mean excuse me by white here in a
support material that's represented by
yellow so what they do is every layer
you print either support material or a
build material in that region and then
and then it follows up because those are
photo polymers they're a liquid until
the hip with a light then they turn to
solid so light sweeps past it turns into
a solid we put down the next layer and
and so on and so on so this is truly
three-dimensional printing if you want
to think about it that way one of the
unique things about this company's
objects machines is they now have
basically a three-color machine and so
one is a support material and the
support materials are usually
water-soluble so you throw it in a vat
of water in it and it basically comes
off but they use the other two materials
one is a flexible material and one is a
rigid material and they then they create
what they call digital materials where
you can have any fraction of the two of
those printed together and change the
stiffness of that part in any region of
it and so for instance if you're going
to print out a razor or some other
toothbrush or something like that you
can have the stiff region you can have
the soft squishy region but all printed
from a single file in a single machine
and it's kind of a fun technology people
are starting to use it more and more for
that multi much
capability another type of technology is
binder jetting and this also uses inkjet
printing but in a slightly different way
so let's watch a little video here the
sound is unimportant so we can whoops we
can keep the don't have to have the
sound turned up and I'll just sort of
illustrate what's going on here this is
a video by a company called Pro metal
and a spun-out of some MIT work and so
we start out with this box that we put
that we're building the parts in this
build platform in this case we have the
bill the powder build material comes
along so we distribute a layer of powder
and then we come back in with a
printhead and we print the binder to
hold the powder together so this can be
done with polymers where we're using
some sort of a glue to glue the the
powder together it can also be done with
sand this is an example of the sand
machine where we put printing some sort
of a say a thermoset resin and now we're
making a Sam casting core and cavity
directly we can also put metal powders
in there and print a binder in there and
make a metal green shape and then run
through a furnace operation to d bind
and center the metal so there's all
kinds of things you can do here's some
examples down here well you'll see the
process finishing their just continue in
the illustration here's an example of
where you were using a full color
printer to print the various basically a
complete assembly and that color goes in
there and now you can see all the
various parts you could for instance
print your finite element mesh results
right on top of a turbine blade and a
lot of people do that so now we can see
what's the stresses and strains in the
park and that around in an engineering
meeting and people can say all we need
to redesign it this way here's the
example there's some artists out there
who use this process a lot just to print
out interesting widgets and actually you
can go on a website called shapeways and
that five dollar watchband example is
when i pulled off the Shapeways somebody
then watch little piece on broke on
their watch they they sketched it up and
I have an automatic quoting routine on
there and it quotes it out it for less
than five bucks and they could just
order it sent to their home and they've
got a replacement there so again this is
that the
category now let's go on to the fourth
category the fourth category it's just
material extrusion there's all kinds of
ways this is done but it's basically
think about taking a child's hot glue
gun like Jews for crafts and automating
in three dimensions so you're basically
extruding out of a nozzle and building
up layer by layer and you can see right
away that if you're doing this now we
have we're basically using little
extrudates little round cylinders that
are build volume and so if you want to
pack that a hundred percent dense then
you can't get really good accuracy and
if you want really good accuracy where
you have to leave some voids in there so
there's some immediate trade-offs there
there's little machines out there now
that you can buy for less than a
thousand dollars and people are starting
to do that in their house and in fact in
the last year there's more of these
cheapo two thousand or less dollar
machines that were sold than all of the
high-end machines in the whole industry
this last year so that the
do-it-yourself home kit has now become
more popular than the real manufacturing
machines and there's also people who are
who are scaling this up and looking at
extruding material to make an entire
housing development another a process is
were using a powder bed again we put out
powder layer by layer but instead of
printing a binder we use a laser or
electron beam or some other directed
thermal energy to melt the surface of
that powder and do that layer by layer
so here's an example from there's a
company out there called freedom of
creation which makes things that are
somewhat artistic and used by designers
and and models and Paris and stuff and
here's an example of a handbag and so
now we put out the powder this is a
nylon powder layer by layer laser comes
in and scans the mesh powder this is in
a sped up thing it doesn't know this
fast goes through puts down a new layer
scans again the whole mesh layer by
layer and basically this outside heart
is the shipping container it goes in so
now what you're going to see after
they're done scanning is now we've got a
big pot you know mess of powder and it's
like an archaeological dig you go in
there and you find the part that you
created you shake out all the powder you
put it maybe
in a bead blaster and you sort of blow
off all the loose powder and they have
created both the product and the
shipping container in the same machine
at the same time and they ship these and
sell them for anywhere from five hundred
dollars to several thousand dollars
apiece and so not only is this done with
nylon and polymers like this in fact
this exact same process is being used
and we'll hear from Boeing for some of
the fighter aircraft and for other
applications in aircraft but the metal
versions of these using electron beams
or lasers are used to make hip implants
and now in Europe they've been doing
this for a number of years and have
implanted probably I think they're up to
about 15,000 of these hip implants made
this way and we just got FDA approval
for that in the US in the last couple
months so we're going to start seeing
people do that in the US as well another
process basically just uses sheets of
material and you could that the sheet
could be a piece of paper it could be a
piece of plastic it could be a piece of
metal and you basically just cut out the
layer contour and stack it and there's
all kinds of ways people have done that
sometimes if you're using metal you can
use ultrasonic welding techniques to
bond those at room temperature we do a
lot of research with that and so if
you're bonding metal at room temperature
that means that we can now in that
electronics then sensors thermocouples
other things inside a metal component
and now you can make a fully integrated
multifunctional metal component with
plastic and other things inside it and
then there's no other way that you can
actually buy well you have to use
solid-state bonding in order to do that
you can't do a melting type process in
order to get those low temperature
materials in there people are using
ceramic tapes stacking them up firing
them to make little microfluidic for
microfluidic devices and lots of other
things with sheet lamination the last
process is what i'm calling directed
energy this process you either use spray
powders through a nozzle or you feed y
metal wire and the energy is either a
high-power laser beam or it could be a
plasma gun or
could be an electron beam some sort of a
focused energy beam and it melts the
powder or it melts the wire as it's
being deposited and basically you just
build up a structure by scanning it
around back and forth and moving a layer
and scanning some more and this process
is really good at adding features two
parts so for instance let's say this
over here is an example of a missile
housing design at Sandia National Labs
and so it's a thin-walled structure with
really deep slots that they want to put
a lot of lectronimo you'd have to trach
a big hunk of metal and machine out all
of that and that wasted a lot of
material and takes a lot of time but if
we can just add these thin wall
structures there then we've saved a lot
of material a lot of time and we have a
much more functional component so that's
a great use of this kind of technology
so those are the processes the
categories of process is what are the
implications of these processes well one
is we can get more complex geometry we
can basically get geometry for free it
takes it's it takes the same amount of
time to make a simple cube as it does to
make a cube with the Declaration of
Independence written on it and internal
channels and all this stuff so so we get
complexity for free we can have internal
complexity external complexity we can
take something that would be a 12-part
assembly and just print it out as a
single part but then for the next Rev we
can just tweak it and print out the next
one this is done right now again by
Boeing he'll talk about in a minute so I
want to steal some of his stuff there's
no tools there's no molds there's no
dyes you're basically it's direct
production and one of the things that a
lot of us in the research community have
been doing for years is we can control
the microstructure because we're
controlling the deposition of material
basically voxel by voxel we can change
for instance the the solidification rate
and therefore change the microstructure
in any point in three-dimensional space
or in many cases change not only the
microstructure but the material at any
point in three-dimensional space which
brings us a tremendous amount of design
flexibility that's impossible with any
other type of manufacturing methodology
some of the business implications and I
think we'll talk about this more later
but let's take a look at the 2d printing
or photography market right now you can
print a photo at home you can send it to
walmart there was a whole fedex kinko's
sort of model that is now the kinkos
part of it is less and the FedEx part of
it is more but you can see that we can
now start to think about this in the
three-dimensional physical product realm
we could print those at home with the
do-it-yourself type device we could
design something to have it printed at a
local kinkos like shop or we could have
it shipped to us from an Amazon like
store where we actually can create some
of that content or select our content to
have it made for us and sent toothless
and we're not going to be able to
compete with things like this
pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in
China where we have to have you know
thousands of people in a bunny suit we
just can't ever do that we need to go to
you know ways where we can automate this
and print them wherever we want to
another way to think about this is as
factory to point o in the same way that
web two point O change the web
completely from just people putting
content to the users being able to
generate their own content factory two
point O is becoming a reality on there's
again the Shapeways website i
materialized and others where users are
creating content that they print out and
consume themselves and so it's a very
interesting change in a business models
another another impact to think about
this is on legit logistics really we're
eliminating any drivers to concentrate
production why would we want to
concentrate production if we can print
it out for the same price wherever we
need it in the world so design anywhere
manufacture anywhere is a buzzword
that's starting to come out what if we
could do that or if we can really design
anywhere we can design at our lake house
in northern Scandinavia and print it out
in China for the consumer or wherever it
really eliminates a lot of the barriers
for physical part production that have
been eliminated for for digital
materials through the internet so
there's a whole a whole new way of
thinking about this so what are some of
the big picture possibilities I think
really additive manufacturing has a
potential to make local manufacturing of
products normative again now we can we
can build a lot not everything not it's
not going to change all you know we're
not going to take cute things that are
now huge castings and make them with
additive in my backyard now the little
widgets a lot of the sub assemblies a
lot of the little consumer goods toys we
can produce these four in the local
niche way and we don't have to make
millions of them to make money we can
just come up with a cool design that
maybe a few hundred people want and make
money on it there's an ability to
reverse a lot of the urbanization of
society why did we urbanize because we
need to concentrate labor we don't have
to concentrate labor with these
technologies maybe that'll have an
impact that really makes jobs resistant
to outsourcing because there is no job
to outsource it's really dependent on
the person's creativity more than
anything on for success so from an
engineering standpoint where are we in
the research community what are we doing
with these things well really the
current additive manufacturing machines
are based upon the prototyping market
how do we make a 3d part that we can
hand around in a in a design meeting and
and really these machines are now being
transitioned into a production
environment and a home use environment
so I expect to see really specialized
machines that are made for higher volume
that have different size envelopes that
have different speeds optimized for
different for different envelope sizes
rather than the one-size-fits-all
prototyping machine that currently is
out there so if you think about the CNC
milling or something like that that's a
really well developed market place you
have huge machines you have desktop
machines you have all these different
machines high speed low speed we're
going to start to see the market go in
that that way I think we're going to see
a lot more materials if you think about
polymers how we're injection molded
materials developed for their developed
to heat slowly and cool quickly we do
exactly the opposite we heat almost
instantaneously with a laser and then we
cool nice and slowly in an insulated
powder bed that totally changes the
performance of the polymers but nobody's
really gone in and reformulated polymers
based upon heating quickly and cooling
slowly so there's a lot of interesting
research there
we need a lot better repeatability
closed-loop control quality monitoring a
lot of the modeling we do in academia is
really focused on making that happen and
we're starting to see that in machines
so in conclusion additive manufacturing
i think is poised to transform the
production of physical goods in much the
same way that the internet transformed
the production of informational goods i
really think it's going to happen I
don't think it's pie-in-the-sky anymore
and I think a lot of people recognize
these opportunities you see new
businesses you see new products being
developed for instance GE Aviation is
now claiming that within the next ten
years fifty percent of every aircraft
engine new design that they come out
will have will be made with additive
manufacturing fifty percent of the
components and why because they can
increase the complexity and the material
optimization therefore increasing the
efficiency of the engine which then
drives all your costs and in the
aircraft industry so I think now is the
time actually if you never come into
this industry and spend much time in it
now is actually a really exciting time
to get involved so I'm hope you enjoy
the rest of the talks and the
opportunity to talk about this with that
I think we're not doing questions now
we're holding them for a panel are we
doing a couple questions yeah we're
going to we're going to have about five
minutes for co-captains right now so if
you could there's two microphones jen
has one over here and if you have a crew
up question raise your hand and then
we'll queue up the next one it sounds
yeah
they got so thank you for an interesting
presentation you described with many
different kinds of techniques but you
did not mention about size limitation
israeli mid to house small can you make
this can you apply this to
nanotechnology for example yeah a number
of companies are actually looking at
this at the nano scale of course you
have different ways of moving materials
and joining materials at the nano scale
but fundamentally most nano processing
is additive but usually it's gone about
it in a totally different way where we
scale up a big factory and we make a lot
of the same thing what you're finding is
a lot of the Nano and microscale people
are starting to say why don't we make
from the beginning a more flexible
factory that basically uses the same
kind of layer by layer simplistic
approach and make it a lot more flexible
so there's some drawbacks to that you
might lose some efficiency in mass
production but you're going to gain a
lot of efficiency in changeover and yeah
it's definitely being looked at nano and
micro Thanks okay hi nice to talk I was
wondering since you're building things
up layer by layer if you could comment
on the mechanical properties and the
wear properties of them it would seem
that that may be compromised convergys
something that you would injection mold
are their strategies that you used to
try to mitigate that you showed tipping
of the part just commenting on
mechanical properties well depending on
the way that you're building it again we
have these different categorized quick
categories so for instance let's say
we're extruding and layer by layer so Y
or Z direction which is between the
layers is always the weakest because of
of adhesion issues but if we're doing a
melting process we're using a laser
electron beam and we actually melt
through the the entire layer and into
the next one we actually can get grain
growth and and have no reduction and
properties what you typically find for
most engineering materials made in
additive just in general is that you
have a higher strength but a lower
ductility that's all that's a
ninety-five percent rule and that
usually the Z Direction is weaker than
the x and y direction and so to mitigate
that you can use orientation for
aircraft components people are using
hipping sometimes we go through a heat
treatment operation with polymers there
a whole different animal so you know
you can't use all the heat treatment
metallurgy techniques but we typically
with the metals we can we have enough
metallurgy metallurgical understanding a
lot of these alloys that we can heat
treat that a nice up and I saw trippy
outta there yes hi chris pendler
Carnegie Mellon nice talk I'm curious
about the implications for this
technology for design patents and
possibly infringing upon on intellectual
property right having this just riveted
manufacturing capability of course it's
basically impossible to enforce design
patents and so is this possibly ed
incentivizing that you know filing
design patents possible there's been a
lot of discussion about that and I think
the same way that people are controlling
copyrights with digital information
people will try to control you know
design patents with with digital
information at some level but it's very
difficult if you're you're going to try
to work around it you're going to almost
always succeed so it becomes a series of
incentives and and hurdles and and so
there was actually a meeting in
Washington DC earlier this year that
talked about that at great extent and in
fact we have a new version of the file
format that that these machines use that
that were just came up with a few months
ago and HOD Lipson who's presented a few
minutes was led that effort and that was
one of the main question should we make
these things should we make the file
format inherent so that people can lock
it down and we decided not to for a lot
of other reasons but yeah that is a
major issue once you can print anything
anywhere you know we were talking to
dart but what if it's if it's so easy to
print anything anywhere well then the
bad guys can print their own gun too you
know and so now the the whole the threat
analysis is just completely different
changes the playing field for everything
yeah I as far as with additive
manufacturing how complex can you get
with multi-component creation so for
that you can do can you know very
complex single objects but how how well
can you do with kind of say like can you
print a car can you print something that
is you know complex mechanically well it
when you print multifunctional
assemblies or something like this
there's a couple of different ways to
think about it if you're using a single
machine with a single material you can
actually create gear
and other things that are fully
assembled but you have to leave some
sort of space in between them as you're
creating them and it sort of depends on
your approach if you need supports in
there can we get the supports out are
they water soluble or is powder in there
we can just spray the get the powder out
of there but a lot of other people are
looking at combining multiple kinds of
additive together including electronics
additive manufacturing so that you're
you're actually some cases you'd use a
little robot to insert a prefab
component into the into the assembly as
it's being additively made in other
cases you you combine we have for
instance in our research of combined
ultrasonic additive of metals with
plastic extrusion with an extrusion of
electronic pace and material so that way
we can create things that have metals
plastics and and resistors and
conductors and other things all made in
one platform so it you kind of have
there's nothing no good generic solution
but you can work around those issues I
guess does that mean you could actually
create cloud manufacturing like meaning
having come an assortment additive
elements that actually can allow you to
program your kind of complex device yeah
in fact that's that's a lot of people
are looking at that that sort of thing
yeah yeah futuristic it's not here today
so yeah I just wanted to follow up on
that comment we in future really pure
thinking about cloud manufacturing it's
not feasible to have all sort of
functionality material available at each
center so any comment on like combining
these mechanical property needs versus
multifunctional material needs I think
what you're going to find is that just
in the same way that certain kinds of
other manufacturing we don't you know
it's it it said there are going to be
capital intensive still you know
additive manufacturing machines too and
there's only going to be a limited
number of them and know they'll be
available in a cloud in essence by a
resource sharing but a lot of the other
ones that are going into consumer goods
and do into higher production stuff will
be distributed to everybody and I think
you know there's all kinds of analogies
between the digital world and for
instance what Google does and the
physical production world and that's
really if nothing else I think that's
one of the things I want you to come
away with that additive manufacturing it
creates a way that manufacturing can now
be a lot more like the digital world as
being done it really opens up that
possibility more so than forging and
other things that that are traditional
kind of manufacturing processes I think
I'm getting cut off right yeah we're
also going to have the panel discussion
so we'll have a good a good amount of
time to get your questions and then and
if we could um if you could when you uh
stand up and ask your question just say
your affiliation and your name would be
good to help us with networking as well
cool great job thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
