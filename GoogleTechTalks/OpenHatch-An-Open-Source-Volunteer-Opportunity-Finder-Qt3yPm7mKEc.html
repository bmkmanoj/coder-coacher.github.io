to the talk today about open hatch I
have with me ashish Mariah who is the
co-founder of open hatch she's also a
former google Summer of Code mentor from
2008 where he worked with the Creative
Commons project he left Creative Commons
to co-found open hatch with Rafael Cruz
Landau the two of them who's right here
the two of them met while they were in
college together at Johns Hopkins
University Rafael works on the user
interface for open hatch so both of them
traveled here today from Philadelphia
Pennsylvania so please join me in
welcoming la raya and Raphael yeah so I
hear tell you guys some things on the
topic of how you can be involved in open
source and how your products can get
more people so I have some questions
I've want to structure this around first
of all if you don't know what you want
to work on how can you become a
contributor to a project find the
product that needs you and find issues
to tackle in that project that
particularly enough to keep you going
that's for your core developer there how
can as a product maintainer how can you
attract new people and make sure that
you've the work you're giving them
exactly something they want to do and
that they can do and then how as sort of
long-standing contributors how can we
tell our story to the community and say
what we've worked on and finding things
to work on based on that so I'm asking
these questions I admit because we have
some ideas all right so I'll say the
suggestions from us how you can use our
website to do it and but I want to hear
from you guys how you what your
experiences have been if you think what
we have what we're telling you is useful
and how you might imagine yourself you
see you so ratty we'll talk a bit about
how you might find oh hey thanks yes
this is my favorite part of the website
so so I was just talking to Chris
earlier well a few minutes ago
and so it chris is a kind of perfect
example of what we were going to talk
about I think he's a talented developer
here google and but he you haven't had
much open source experience and you're
sort of beginning to think about you
know well how do i get involved so the
first part of the time we're going to be
looking at what's the what's the
onboarding process like like what's it
like to to kind of arrive on the
internet and say well you know I word on
it I like making software i want i use
open source software and i want to be a
part of this kind of world this culture
where do I begin so we're going to show
you a tool we've got to make this
hopefully a little bit easier so so you
know suppose I'm I'm Chris and I rather
the the open hatch front page which you
see here so the first thing I want to do
is no mrs. you'll learn some
volunteering opportunities that open
hatch has to be here so here's the next
screen and this is our volunteer
opportunity finder and what you'll
discover here are it's mostly bugs but
we also have documentation requests and
other kinds of requests for help and
this is from across a lot of open source
a lot of different projects here so this
is a kind of good place to begin if
you're not really short project you want
to work out you might for example have
in mind a particular language that you
know or a particular kind of project you
want to work on and so we're trying to
do is sort of connect you who'd you know
who has information about you you know
what you know about your interest you
know about your skills you don't
necessarily know what project out there
is going to be useful for you so we're
trying to bridge the gap fitter so take
a look at this page on the left we have
bugs in different languages the second
column lists different projects so the
way to explore the database and but one
thing I want to look at right now is is
this third column toughness and
underneath I see that this link called
bite size so what do we mean by bite
size well there are many projects and
open source who've decided that they
want to make life easier for newcomers
so they go through their bug trackers
and
they identify bugs that are appropriate
for the members so for example bunk like
this is a good way to kind of get a feel
for how the project works sort of
learned the ropes it's not a very big
intimidating blog it's maybe one that
you can solve in a day or a few days and
it's supposed to be a sort of rewarding
engaging bug for print new covers and I
don't mean necessarily newcomers
different source but someone just good
for me coming to the project if you're
moving from project data project be so
we collected as many of these budgets we
can find so I'm going to click on that
link and we scroll down the page and
you'll see the most recently indexed
bite-size bugs from across open source
it sends a variety of projects here this
about 1500 total open wide size books
right now but you know I'm thinking well
you know this is a lot of stuff let me
let me drill down let me get more
specific here about what I want so let
me go back up to the top of the page and
you know we pick a language that I know
like Python and here I see there's just
under 200 bite-size bugs advised and if
you look under where it says projects
you'll see that there's a whole bunch of
projects and so one of them catches my
eye supposedly twisted this uh this is a
framework for developing a high
performance networking software now
maybe I don't know that maybe I'll just
kind of browsing so i click on twisted
and i see that there are 33 bite-size
bugs in the twisted project so i can
keep exploring the scroll down the page
and i see that there's to the whole
bunch of stuff going on here so i can
explore this bug about dependencies for
instance and the whole idea is that
we're going to try to push you out to
position where you can begin solving
about so for example there's a link here
so you can go to the original bug
tracker so I you know I I can click that
Here I am at the twisted bug tracker and
here I can learn more about the bug when
it was filed I'm going to go back to the
open hatch volunteer opportunity finder
and see what other resources we have for
this new contributor who wants to learn
more about twisted so let's go back
here's that but we were looking at and
on the left does this link that
is more about this project so we check
that out so this is our twisted project
page and when I see here is a variety of
different stuff when we that open
hatches a zone has has got the victim
sir and twisted so on the right here
they see that there's this button that
says I don't want to help and when I
mouse over it it's quite it's a bit more
specific if you click this button you
can add yourself to a list of people who
want to contribute we'll talk a bit more
about this button later but it's one of
our newest intact I think whatever more
exciting features a scroll down the page
a little bit more and you'll see that
open hatches sort of started a
discussion forum going and we've seeded
these discussion forums with questions
that we think are really important and
that are not really being asked enough
so for example this question says what
how can I pitch in if I don't want to
write code today or if I don't know how
to write know what is there do and of
course there's tons of things to do an
open source project that don't involve
code like answering questions managing
bugs as they come in and categorizing
them explaining all the software works
an open source projects don't just need
to get technical people they need great
writers need good explainers that needs
good like social people who get social
skills you can kind of manage the
project organized meetups and things
like that and you can see one of our
contributors has come in and lovingly
prepared a great deal of information
about twisted and how to get it up is it
nan-oh to contribute so now let's I'm
going to look over the other side of the
page and I see that puts a list of other
contributors so let me go see who's on
this project and if i click that button
i'm taken to the open hatch people page
and this this on this baby i see the
there's a variety of people who
contribute to twisted of course this
isn't remotely comprehensive list is
just people who signed up for open match
and also who contributed twist and one
of the nice things about this page is
here you can figure out whether or not
there are people who work on the project
who live in your area because if you're
looking for an open source project
that's that's pretty it's a pretty nice
thing to be able to go and they actually
hang out with a real human being you
know
in the flesh and like you know true have
a drink together or something like that
so you know suppose I live in San
Francisco I can scroll the page and this
is filled here that says you know search
for people in the project twisted and I
could search the near a particular
location and learn the whole Derek
here's someone who lives in my area and
who works in this project and will show
you a little bit later about how you can
contact people so you can kind of get
the ball rolling can see hey you know
you want to get together and talk about
this project you know I'm not kind of
knew but maybe you can show me how it
all works and I think that a lot of
people go print source find that these
are the most valuable moments they have
when when we're participating in the
community so trying to make more more
this cancer than this hat all right so
so we have this tool but what's what's
actually do about this well the first
thing is that this is I think the only
this is the only way you can search for
bugs across projects and so really this
is a good place to come if you don't if
you want to get involved but you don't
really know exactly what project America
secondly I think that a lot of bug
trackers are they're quite well designed
some items for people who are already in
the project so if you look at the bug
tracker there's a lot of data on every
bug tracker page about all the open bugs
and one day to be done but to make it
more efficient to lots of jargon and if
you're a newcomer a lot of that darkened
can kind of turn you off then it can be
the reason you don't participate we
tried to make this launch opportunity
finder intelligible for people who are
not aware of this jargon I think that
hopefully this can make make a bit of a
difference you know create a more
friendly atmosphere for newcomers and
finally I muncle features that yet you
can find able to live in your
neighborhood which is which is very nice
so the next part is something the sheets
is a said that I know he wants to come
out and talk about it yeah
so I think that one as as someone who
works our product and is a maintainer
like you said you work enclosure you
might want to help people join your
project and so somebody who has a lot of
in open source my coming different hat
site and start at this link document
your open source contributions where we
say you complete your story together and
import the products you've worked on
into your profile so let's say I will
who maintains miro and pipe Watson to
big Python projects let's please I start
here and sign in my google account or
other open ID and i'll end up at the
portfolio editor where I can upon
clicking here start entering in my
identifiers like my github user name the
user names like you to commit subversion
repositories email addresses that used
in Burton control systems and then we'll
slowly start to import those things from
across the web and once we do that we'll
give you a space to write about your
project and what you've done for it and
we'll hear it a lot in that box but the
most important thing is the last
sentence where he writes I do a lot of
work from your own so upon saving this
will go back to his profile and see miro
in his own profile as well the products
worked on but from here if you might
click on the mirror link and find out
what is this a perhaps thing about how
can happen help me get people to our
project and right here we see there's
and I want to help button that rocky
mentioned just a moment ago and that's
something that new contributors can
click on assuming they find the open
hatch page ramiro the sheath answer some
of these questions like how to
contribute in other ways in writing code
Miro is a big desktop rich beautiful
video application and so it needs it
runs on windows mac OS angular linux and
kimmy's testers and all those platforms
please written note about that here but
i wanted to draw your attention to this
question at the bottom which is
something that i thought would be really
interesting to ask probably maintainer
is something I wish people ask me what
something I haven't been working on
because I don't want to think about it
but in my case there I maintain a
package called Alpine a debian and
there's there's a patch somebody has
written that's not properly licensed but
everyone wants it in debian and
immigrants adds this very useful feature
which is reading mail your email schools
very useful if you use the helpline on a
system administered by dub cot using
system in but that's me ah so there's
actually a bunch of people on the bug
but it's really tough for me to solve
that problem so we're about it here and
if someone else comes by to the site and
find the open hydronic page they might
safe level yeah i can write that and
there's the only place that there is
save what stresses you out not just what
needs to be done but will as interesting
getting more people on this project so
what he's going to do is pull out this I
want to help there's a link that says
you can embed the I want to help button
in tie your own site so he can just
click there grab the source code copy it
to the clipboard and go out to the
mirror website find the wiki from your
own and had this I want to help button
to is the key when you contributors find
that button and click it it'll take them
open hatch and say hey it can sign in
and tell us about yourself will hide you
the people want help and that's exactly
what another wiki so this is kind of
neat first of all will has been able
Jones portfolio product has worked on it
imported stuck from love pad and olo and
other resources automatically but the
once people will click this button if
they do we can talk without a minute um
he can reach out to them knowing what
they know they will those people know so
if you click spoken to making a profile
on open hatch you can say i want to i
want to write in French and if there's
work that he's gone that way we'll know
and by adding these peoples its list of
perspective perspective contributors be
sure them right on top of the current
contributors so it makes them feel like
part of the community already and I
actually think so I love and hatch we
we've had a source code etc link on the
website sitting at the bottom we talked
about how the gplv3 project you can get
get the source we only got one person on
the IRC channel instead of that um then
we added as I want to help button and
we've had 11 button clicks over the time
and we have three more people on the IRC
channel who've asked us to get help get
the source and let it build on arch
linux linux systems that we don't
support the well that we don't run ah so
is I'm actually seeing very anecdotally
a big uptake in interest doesn't people
who click the button I think Oh what's
the button then I can probably do
something so i want to ref you talk a
little more about what happened then hey
I'm just kind of tell sort of continue
the story of will the project maintainer
who works on the room and I'm going to
show you a bit more concretely about how
you can use that I want to help button
to make your project figure so so here
we are back at the new road page and on
the right hand side of the page that I
see that there's some ways clicked on
that button Matthew so let me go check
out his profile and see you know maybe
he can help and on the left hand side of
Matt's profile talks a bit about what he
knows you know some computer languages
he also did some natural languages and
they say you know is Russian that kind
of gets me thinking well hey no mirror
was this big TV distribution platform
and we have a bunch of Russian users and
we're about to come up with a new
release now we're really actually could
use someone to translate are released
into the Russian so I can so now I'm
thinking well I want to contact man so I
can assign any known just say like hey
you know I saw an open hacked you know
how to write Russian and I saw your rich
and helping marrow well actually we have
something for you to do so that's one
way you can use the one you don't have
to go through the button you can just
search for people out right so here's
our kind of people page and seething
mass of everyone on the site and if you
like you can search for keywords so
let's say you want to do some mac
testing you don't have time to do it
yourself when you're in maybe
else out there is willing to pitch in
with some some of their max skills so it
turns out there are there's a few people
and you can feed like this this button
in the this link in the middle of pages
you can seek a duluth specifically said
that they can pitch in with their max
goods not just that they know something
about it but they've actually willing to
help help you out with their mexicans so
so he remembers here's someone who knows
who knows that about mackin is going to
help you and you can do this profile and
here he's mentioned that you can new you
can email him so I'm thinking bow you
know I'll you have this kind of bum
craigslist style email forward so people
can feel free to share their contact
information and now here i will tidy up
in emails to andy sank hey if you're
willing to help we've got something for
you do I'm such just one other way you
can you can use the truth um i think
that's that's just life I'm so I think
yeah the first few things you target
great yeah so
yeah so rock you guys are talking about
how you can get people to test your
software in the mac or write up release
notes in Russian but I didn't want to
hammer on this point that other source
products are about more than just code
so when you think about open source
projects you think of all these
attributes right using the software
that's beautiful fully tested super easy
to use and has false documentation so
when these are true it's because of
African amount of effort by the
developers but also by other people not
necessarily coders you can reach out to
people who use your application and say
hey would you download the latest
release maybe then we can find some of
these bugs before before it's too late
before the real users who are in my
friend see it maybe you can reach out to
people like rocky said to write
documentation how people know how to use
the product so I just want to take this
moment in for you guys using open hatch
or not eat through run an open source
project reach out to these people ask
for help and you'll find that if there's
something you want done that isn't code
there's probably a user that's willing
to do it so some other other question
that we've gotten is this list of
helpers right on the corner why don't we
just make a list email list mailman list
or something of people you can blast out
a message and say dear 1000 people would
you please write me somebody's notes in
Russian well uh in Rocky's example the
the Russia and the example it's sort of
opportunistic you find someone willing
to help in that way so he targets
something at that person if you know how
people can help you you can ask them
especially to do something they can do
also there's something nice about being
personally invited to work on something
receiving of one of my emails a lot
nicer than a mail to a big mailing list
and you're acting more likely to do it
and finally if nobody answers it's okay
no one will know there's no public
archive of me emailing Matt deagle bell
but there's a public archiving the email
like a giant helpers list so it'll be
sad to look over the dark I've months
later
I mean it's actually this is sat on the
dengue mentors list we have all these
excited new perspective Debian
developers and they have packages they
want someone to look at and there is
just such an influx of requests and
after the time it's a good discussions
like you didn't do this correctly you
did this right but you could even better
if you comply with new format that's the
best case but the worst case would
happen pack the times no answer and
that's just no fun to look at yo guys so
I want to take a minute to reflect about
where open hatches right now and then
talk a bit about where we'll take this
so by the numbers we have more than 200
projects who is bite sized bugs the
index and that's product with bite-sized
bugs that are good for you covers not
just bugs at all we have almost a
thousand members and they come from
every continent you might be thinking
and practice with contracts and there's
a user who says he's from Antarctica Oh
actually when we discovered we this
triggered a bug you know I'm a presage
we really expect that to happen we need
to make a map taller to learn hello room
tour that place there's doesn't the
product that have started conversations
about how you can help out and what
dozens more people who click that I want
to help on to say they won't help on a
project and this is just like 160 three
days a little less than five and a half
months of an edge so we have a bunch of
big product participating but I really
want a more part of why I'm here to have
you guys like we can in extra bug
trackers and how can you find ways to
get more people involved I really want
to boost this not dressing quality than
quantity to get more projects reaching
out the real power the volunteer
opportunity finder is if anyone can go
to it and click a few times and narrow
hole open source world down into how
they can contribute and what they can do
so this right now is a big bald code and
Django and it's running on just one
virtual machine
and that worked out really well until
they got slashed on it and everything
collapsed in out of memory disaster so
now we do a lot more caching and we can
come get my pretty well I'll just 1 p.m.
we'll see how things go I see all that
because i'm happy to say that doesn't
take huge amount of overhead to run the
site and the the backend code most of
its most the exciting start is scraping
data out of bug trackers or cone hosting
sites like tagging gave the profile
information and a bunch of bug trackers
do of AP is but i think i think we only
api the only bug tracker type all we
sorry for all the bug trackers that we
index bugzilla track and round up and
launch pad most of them have AP is but
we actually scrape the pages of three
out of those four because there's some
information not in the API and also we
have a nice a nice series of tests that
means that when we break stuff we
usually don't pretty soon so the future
everybody want more bugs in the vaults
opportunity finder we are working on
getting you getting local meetups so
Radley talked about finding a project
where you reach out to someone who lives
near you and say hey I want to join
twisted comment super happy death house
or something with me but something we
want to do is get get meetups of new
contributors saying hey a dozen of us
live in Philadelphia we all want to do
something we don't really know what
let's all sit down together get our
laptops and browsers thing and find
something and that's something we can be
doing the next couple weeks in Philly we
also as I said are here to talk with
contributors and party maintain errs and
find out how this matches what you want
and what new contributors might like on
top of this and there's a lot of magnets
were to do as always so the team is
rocky and me working on this about half
time but we do have as I said 11 people
who click I want to help on the site and
that's just such if it gives me such a
warm fuzzies to know that people are
excited about what we do and I think
that fighting this sort of I fear of
isolation
an open source you know I hope I could
have to the whole lot and makes a big
impact to make other people happy here
and helps people find products to work
on but you know if all we do is have
product maintainers feel less lonely
because people click this button I think
that's huge like burnout is enormous and
debian and all the other products I've
worked on so well that's I said we've
had these three or four people three
recently and one in the past have looked
more stalls in the site and work on
generating patches and we have
thankfully Google's not recur students
will accept it on Monday and like epic
yay the google Summer of Code stated so
um John some pho and I came up with the
idea of adding training missions of mash
so there's in order to participate in
open-source you there's a bunch of
skills you need to know you need to you
might need for example to know how to
use patch then people say things on the
how to contribute page like oh it's easy
to sign up for a product just join our
IRC channel or send a patch in the bug
tracker or make a format patch file you
can get and you're a bunch of people
these all seem very reasonable but
that's not actually the majority of
prospective contributors a lot of people
have it every use IRC needs another good
programmers that's not really related
and many people haven't used diff many
people haven't used gif format patch so
we sort of in open source the end up
accidentally including excluding people
from the community by using this jargon
and forgetting that there's different
kinds of people we don't have the same
experience we do who can totally help
out if we reach out to them but it's not
like every product maintainer wall to
sit down with every prospective
contributor and teach them at ease RC
that's often why they say if you can
figure it out great otherwise I don't
care but robots might care so what we're
going to build is is the automated
agents on the site that you can enable
for yourself and say I want to learn
about let's say tar balls I want to know
how to make a patch file so we'll give
you a training mission in that sense
take these two files unpack them with
this command right here
two new mysteries and make make me a
unified diff and upload it to open hatch
and if it actually is unified if not a
context it will so great and if you made
a mistake for identifying give it some
cases let me think you've me and say
that were the context if you pass I can
you do the kinds of things that annoy
probably maintainers and the kinds of
things that robots can teach people so
yeah and other birds I really looking
forward these training missions we have
some planned out for subversion ingot
and making tar balls I mean I it is only
very recently I've actually memorized
the command syntax to making it our wall
like tip the yeah there's all this
Arcana that we can teach people
automatically if the interactive so
that's that's giving possible thanks to
the Summer of Code and hopefully we'll
have even more excited announcement the
end of summer saying well no hopefully
other people we blogging on their own
sites about how they learn these tools
without bothering party containers so
it's really important to the community
to be listening to new contributors and
listen to what they find difficult to do
and pay attention to where they drop off
and so that's really the core focus of
open hatch as a project nessa website
and I want to just conclude with a few
few highlights thanks and get your
feedback the this is really crucial open
source projects live and die based on
more than just code they will and I
based on the feeling of the people
working on it as I see me smiling about
my I why people think I might I want to
help button and they also live and I
based on if anyone knows about the
project and that's something that
speaker is a writer the very natural
language cannot do it and so you can
help get more people contributing to
your project you can on your own bug
tracker independent from open hatch
that's where you can label button sides
bugs and if you want to import them
there's an edit link on the open app
search page that says add a bug tracker
and we gave you a form to fill out and
for the prospective new contributors
here I I sort of discovered this few
years ago and it's something not what
the user of absorb discover which is
that you can be contributing to the
software your usage and that feels
pretty great so we want that happen more
and as a as a developer you can reach
out to users help them no help know what
they can do and then bring them in so
thanks to Ellen for bringing us here but
yeah the website aren't you see the
cartoons on people page those were drawn
by Chara's dad she will beget join the
brook the school of information in a few
months I guess and Nelson pavlovsky is
this invisible link that is how wrapping
I met at Hopkins and he helped bring us
out of our other lives into this new
life and of course thanks people who use
a site and let us know what they like so
this how can contact us and I wonder
what you guys think and what would be
useful here thanks Mac iza in the
beginning Matthew was described as one
user experience but a lot of glucose
this site is us / programming and
collaborating lot so it's not just you
like we're both precor yeah
yeah so one question is whether you
support the google google project
hosting android google com right we
don't have an importer for right now
just because we haven't found it
projects that label by the time on it
but it's pretty easy for us to export
data from it so add your project and all
right back end but we and i said we do
really prioritize projects but I label
my right and the other thing is how are
you trying to solicit people to come as
contributors as I was talking with some
friends who are faculty at UC Merced
yeah you know in their University out in
the middle of Central Valley and so they
don't have a lot of high-tech around and
they keep wondering how they're going to
get their students enough experience
this actually seems like a great way to
get their students a chance to actually
start doing real development in the
outside world so they have something to
show on the resume yeah so interesting
to see how you get get faculty at small
colleges to know about this so they got
on their students there one thing that
we've been doing is working with a group
called teaching open source that's
primarily based out of the fedora
project is that and they've been
reaching out to universities and running
so-called posse events I can't go to
stands for but basically they get
professors to run a semester course
teaching students about open source and
they've been deactivated text book every
few weeks ago I so I guess to enter this
bit of a question about Mercer is that
right I said we're set um like have that
person that a professor and teaching
open source or you need to meet up and
they can do that you can do that father
and we value me here then go to the site
probably better to do my email in case
they forget yeah i think that students
are relieved i like students are a huge
population that could use a site but i
think it's also important to remember
that so many other people there's a a
website and organization up trying to
find
name of because i don't remember right
now that ring taints a bunch of mailing
lists related to getting women and
underrepresented communities into not
just open source but technology in
general yeah and I'd be happy to track
down the name and the URL incentive to
you because they're eager to find out
about things around open source that
they can spread the word to their
community about yeah that's so great we
should like I can't wait um we like the
revolution it's in tech as a whole women
are about twenty twenty to thirty
percent of of employed tech workers and
in open source it's two percent maybe
one depending what you do say and that's
just tragic because we're we're just
leaving on the floor huge number two
perspective contributors and I think a
lot of that has to do with how the way
people learn about open source is mostly
sort friend networks and the way you
gain these skills like knowing how to
use patch knowing what knowing how to
use these vertical troll skills it's
from impressed interactions with people
and so to speak in the most grandiose
I'm if possible i hope the robots help
us get more live in open source and and
of all all kind of people too I mean
there's to diversity problems it open
source women are just the most obvious
category missing angle yeah so
especially I'm interested to if there's
any it is people there who do have some
open source experience and in the word
into quality roof we can really help
them tell us what would help in the list
it's good too because the group has sub
lists specifically for small community
colleges Regional schools etc yes with
the idea being that the tech community
needs to reach beyond the big population
centers
yes I guess just a comment that you know
I really like the UI that you have is
just on the site it's really easy to use
it's very clear especially because
you're trying to attract new people so
from that perspective it's just really
easy simple to use and navigate through
and kind of find what you're looking for
so I'm really impressed with that and i
love the images that you have there its
kind can even tell you try to build a
community and you've got people on there
and really taught engage them so that's
really cool I and who doesn't say thanks
Dorothy and again to Karen and a lot of
the open source projects due working
silos it's really encouraging to see
something that's project you know you
mentioned launchpad there are few out
there but it's really encouraging to see
as someone that's kind of bridging
across the various projects to bring
together in all the tasks that need to
be worked on an encouraging
participation across all levels not just
code often thanks yeah I think one of
the reasons that we try to reach out to
all your different products is because
we're stealing something kind of new so
we can't afford to we need to we need to
get people attract people who like the
site from wherever they are first I
launchpad a google code github forever
I loved your message about open sources
more than just code no and I was
actually and going to or the next week
to talk to students at OSU OSL and I was
that was actually my intent to talk
about how open source is more than just
going to call the other different
opportunities and so now I'm going to
refer them to your site also has a way
for them to find opportunities is there
anything else that you think is
important for them to know like with
like a message that I should pass along
about your site or in general I'm in a
bath open source in general one that
most I think that there is one thing one
thing I like about our site is that
non-code contributors are highlighted
just in the same way as code
contributors you're part of the list of
contributors you see the same little
badge on people's profiles and I think
that that's true on our site but it's
not true in the entire community so I
think that there's a like a second-class
mess of nam co con tributions that
people feel as i think that if you can
get credible people to say that nanako
stuff is important you're not going to
parade in a dozen project maintainers
who are all but if you're great if you
get someone to say i don't like writing
release notes someone else could write
good i want be something else and users
will see that they actually want to read
them then they'll realize how important
it is as for our site I guess I can't be
with you off something heavy on this
what I would say is if you were so your
UI designer your graphic designer you
have an opportunity to make a really big
difference because a lot of projects
knowledge like that and yeah although I
think she sure I didn't get it's true
that there's some historically and many
systemically code is prized more than
contributions if you walk around talk
about with your people and you ask them
about this kind of thing that will get
really excited about like the UI the
need for you I the neighbor people who
have a sense about the project
management so you're likely to make some
friends quickly if you got to do you I
step regular details and that sense that
that getting party maintainers makes the
whole story so more credible but I think
there's sort of a shyness or a fear of
the half behalf of the Islam these
prospective non-code contributors that
their work wouldn't be valued in fact it
would be but the other thing is that
like I right non code and I also record
and I actually I mostly got started the
first product I really collaborated on
with xbox clinics where I put together a
wiki with some documentation for how to
how to modify xbox and software without
without modifying the hardware and that
was a hugely valuable and I know that
and I don't want to fun I think that
yeah the documentation came up with is
now very central in xbox linux thank you
sure yeah and I guess like tells me
click I want to help honey and also it's
helping to reach out to Prada containers
right i mean i'm i'm talking as if party
maintainers all want to spend their time
reaching out to people that's not always
true I please all I'm really doing is
increasing the quality of people they
would have to reach out to but a lot of
people have talked to you or who are the
core developers say I don't want to deal
with more people but then there is like
like second tier developers or
communities for people or documentation
writers and those part of the teams they
always a lot more people so basically
keep reaching out tell that that's
really the most important tether are you
doing anything to to train maintain errs
on how to break up problems well on how
to set up p some training sets that kind
not yet I guess that would be great
though I have a suggestion actually yeah
I actually came upon one of those
buttons at one point it's just the I'd
like to help ya when you click that you
feel like you're committing to something
I think if it was how can I help me more
people to click the button would say how
can I help yeah just instead of a
Baltimore let's go cuz you're teaching
them to the information page you're not
taking them to signing a sign up for
something oh I said yeah well I guess
maybe you know I want to help and then
the next page they can just build stuff
in I just I didn't click i want
marceline what I actually came upon it
because I felt like I was good and I
have no idea what I'm today right now
you're committing to a panelist right I
realized you know it's actually fun but
especially mostly for the one that
appears on other sites please ask
relevant for one that appears on that
site that you mean I want to help with
what would be clicking right yeah yeah
I'm inside in our case that I've got
sticky jizz on page and then we'll run
attributable to your necklace I mean
there's a way to get out of it yeah I
get through you me about this window I
Miller feedback or questions I think
what we're looking for by the way it the
Holy Grail would be away a very
lightweight keep it but I guess so
that's once you've made it your kind of
you know you've registered a sort of
affiliation with the yeah but I
still think you want the after I've seen
your site right it may well be I might
be a little more transparent yeah I make
it just like a little yeah we can really
be doable the only other feedback out
happens so in your surfing browsing
projects on the front page the first
thing you see is the list of bugs would
be very I think if you haven't ate
erza's somewhere in there
description the project room into their
main page or something that's fun right
asanda do you mean if you're serving
through the serving through the bite
size of bugs oh yeah you can click on it
and it comes up with the senseless to
pubs and right okay I think like right
at the top is how little this is what
the product is it be a little bit more
motivating description of what open
hatches or what up the image what the
project is so on this page in particular
you might imagine Mike you're saying
that when you click on Python and look
in the bugs there we put a little box in
here McDonald sure just a suggestion
yeah yeah I mean right now you have to
open up in the bug and scroll down and
find this link the last thing I sick
right because you already have that
information that people have builded
that brought it is about yeah great
looks real cool awesome i like the idea
I I once took a class where I was
supposed to I was trying to get to do an
OS project for an open source project
and I spent I actually got really
decorating the class because I kept
trying to find projects and failing
right it's really hard it turns out in
the current environment yeah and the
thing is that the product dictators know
so much more than you do when there we
go they know how hard that bug is that's
why that's why I haven't touched the out
I know that it could be some sake but
right but like all these bugs they
rained on such great and so some people
asked us how come you don't cut
automatic a droid categorize bugs and if
you maintain smellin don't know that
it's difficult to know from the title of
the bag or from the description of the
bug what they need in terms of occurred
mix how much effort it takes that one
sentence means refactoring our project
yeah
yeah order pizza Iran's pretty sad and
then the fact that you using you know
bite size so especially for new
contributors thing that's really
important is to have a handle on
something that they feel they're going
to be able to finish and they can see
something they've done and they can move
on otherwise I've been go into this you
know you know what I can't get it done
it will not have encourage them to
continue participating yeah and yeah I
ran an evening event at PyCon a few
months ago where we got I just put a
sign on a door I said if you want to
contribute open source projects and you
haven't come in the door and love a
clock and I we got two people and so of
them we we browsed the volunteer
opportunity fighter here and we found
something to work on and actually we all
found bite-sized bugs and Python to work
on I am other person wrote some
documentation that was missing and a
third person started looking into one
these python by size bugs and and yeah
like the idea that at the end of the
night this person you could never like
run subversion before could use its
generating the TIFF file and attached to
the bug tracker and dispatches now
murdered that's a pretty quilt so that
explains the other really cool thing is
that at least in that episode you were
able to get feedback loop really small
bike um more I assume you were actually
able to accept him and checking man oh I
know I don't work okay now I mean so
actually waited like two or three weeks
for the pack to get reviewed but then it
wasn't any commerce wouldn't be cool to
get actually get the projects to say
okay I'm during this week we're going to
have you know Oh overnight turn around
or something yeah and to label bugs
beforehand and act like this is one of
the good things about google Summer of
Code the products tell me like it's
really nice to have all this code
written over the summer but it's only
one or two or three or four or five
students but the product lists that
there's the product list that products
make up like those really liking because
now the products know when
one else comes by oh you could do this
it would take you a summer maybe half a
summer but we know what it would take to
do yeah and so just thinking through the
process of labeling buzzes as bite size
or the bug tracker and then in
showcasing that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
