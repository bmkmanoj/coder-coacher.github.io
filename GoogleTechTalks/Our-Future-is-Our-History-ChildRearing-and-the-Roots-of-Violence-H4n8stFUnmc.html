engineer here at Google i'm here to
introduce josephs or not oh whoo i came
across his book inventing the child and
I'm it had a really really big effect on
sort of how I understood you know the
idea of raising children and how you
know children's literature and Disney
and things like that really are
important and they do there's a lot more
to them than it seems and so Joseph he
wrote that book and I he has a new book
2050 which is a fictional what's it
called speculative fiction I kill
affected yeah speculative fiction book
about a the year 2050 after their
collapse of our civilization he's a
professor rhode island college or
alcoholic a professor of english and I
he's here today to talk about all that
stuff so yes Thank You Keith hey thanks
for coming out my brother and I are on a
cross-country trip we're driving my
mother's car back to San Diego we've
been on the road for five days and I
feel a little loopy but I'm thrilled to
be here inside sort of your google thing
it's really beautiful and it's a
privilege and I appreciate Keith
inviting me the book he's talking about
inventing the child this is about six
years old this just came out I'll talk
about these in a little bit but I want
to get it I wanted to get a handle on
and you to get a handle on what keith
was just sort of beginning to introduce
so in the humanities and i'm so i'm
fascinated to be are representing the
humanities here sort of with engineers
i'm not sure who exactly my audience is
but I suspect we have a slightly
different language for things we talk
about things in different ways but I
think sometimes we might mean similar
things okay so as a humanities professor
where the humanities are right now we're
talking about of cultural studies and
and oddly enough the metaphors are
similar to perhaps at least what I
understand some of your metaphors to be
everything's a web everything's
connected everything's linked right so
disney walt disney one of my one of my
research projects is the history and the
cultural history of the animated feature
film alright which is not quite your
your traditional research subject or
topic from from the 1950s where perhaps
it would have been told story or Herman
Melville or Emily Dickinson so it's like
okay we've moved from thinking about
specific Great God like artists to
thinking about culture as this web of
information with particular nodes
intersections of importance not
necessarily for the old reasons oh this
is a great piece of art you should all
read it because it's like a good vitamin
and you'll you'll grow and you'll be
better people for exposing yourself to
the sort of literary or literary art
rather now it's we're thinking hmm why
are things the way they are how things
work what's going on what drives history
and and and what impact is the
historical and cultural moment have on
our understanding of this sort of the
driving mechanisms of history I think
one of these things obviously is
technology but for my interest it's
human relationships and and and the
human factor more specifically it's the
relationship between the adult and the
child because it's it's in childhood and
this is something I was just reading
about and writing about but just just
the other day it's always an ongoing
process it's like okay another way of
talking about what I'm talking about in
childhood it's when the developing mind
brain body uploads the dominant cultures
ideology somebody said you know what
ideology and I'll write that down
ideology tricky word put it in with that
and this guy says well think about it as
information think about it as software
no that's perfect for google I think
maybe not maybe it's a little too sloppy
on my part I don't know but I liked it
it's like okay so you're born into the
world right and you enter into a Wi-Fi
environment and it's full of information
right ideology but we'll forget that
word and we'll call it
software and by virtue of the
relationships you're practicing with
those people who are absolutely the
dominant figures in your life your
caregivers your parents the politically
incorrect term your parents can always
assume they're your parents your
caregivers your primary caregivers those
adults were giving you care and who are
supporting the environment within which
you live and exist and without which you
won't live and exist because as you know
the obvious no-brainer your we're
completely and absolutely dependent from
0 to 35 kidding zero to 60 2 8 you know
years I'm talking about okay so we're
sitting than this we're soaking in this
Wi-Fi environment of cultural
information of cultural software and so
the metaphor might break down at some
point like oh who wrote the software
who's responsible for the software of
the culture I don't know maybe it's a
lot like again I'm stretching my
knowledge maybe it's a lot like Google
is any one person responsible for all
this is there anyone inventor for this
company of this corporation yes maybe
but no yes some genius sort of figured
out this math but he was or she he was
standing on someone's shoulders right so
none of this happens in a vacuum none of
this is linear and all by itself
everything is connected including the
CEO or the inventor of a corporation
okay so how does this tie into
children's literature so one of my
interests here and I went old school
here with the whiteboard some terms I'm
going to use this but and i'll talk more
about that again
the wheel of history as far as I can
understand it so ideology one of my
favorite definitions of the word or of
cultural software information is and
this is what's interesting here this
comes from a very political point of
view I use it in my book in fact if you
want to just pass that around people can
just pass it down check it out whatever
you want a French philosopher named
Balthazar he talked about ideology from
a Marxist point of view from the 1950s
so he's not a big fan of capitalism or
private property of the dominant culture
of his day and so I kind of like what he
says he describes ideology or that
dominant software that's running in our
system that's were completely sort of
absorbed in and as children we have no
say in the matter we just have to absorb
it he calls it ideology informs the
imaginary relationship one has to the
actual conditions of material existence
ideology the software that we are born
into informs an imaginary relationship
and in a way offers us a way to sort of
deny and not actually live in and
experience the actual conditions of our
material existence who does this serve
well this serves the dominant player in
the relationship or at least in from my
field then it serves the adult and the
child is the subjugated subject meant to
conform you have to absorb this to be
normal to go here well 100 years ago
you'd be thrashed today we medicate you
it's just what we do you're just
you don't fit the box and that's not
acceptable so you learn the imaginary
okay here's an example of the imaginary
a stark example I use for my students
who are like what what I'm not sure
professor okay so i think it's 1830s
Georgia America not Russia yeah right
slavery it's the norm right so little
history slaves were illegal to teach the
slave to read absolutely illegal don't
let the mind work they start thinking
they start reading they say they become
alert and aware they become aware like
an artificial intelligence to it's a
condition and it might they might you
know be more difficult to control more
difficult to exploit so no information
no awareness and end well sorry the
information that the slave in this
hierarchical relationship receives is
from the white master and it's his
information and it's an imaginary
relationship so the slave does not have
to deal with consciously the material
conditions of his or her existence the
imaginary well there is this whole thing
that they spread around and they
understood these white masters there was
something called slave Christianity it's
something we tell children all this
everyday in one sense or another the
imaginary relationship via the slave
Christianity is tomorrow it's all about
tomorrow it's always tomorrow tomorrow
you'll be in heaven the Lord has put a
heavy burden on the slave and he's put a
heavy burden on the master we all have
heavy burdens Oh heavy burden the master
will be judged according to his heavy
burden the slave will be judged
according to his heavy burden finally
we'll all be judged and tomorrow we'll
reap our rewards if we obey so one of
the major features of the imaginary
relationship is your dependent and you
have to obey and the actual material
conditions of your existence are to be
ignored because they may lead you astray
in other words the actual conditions of
my material existence today today I'm
suffering I'm oppressed and being
exploited and being used
of course don't here google but I'm
being exploited and and I'm miserable
and I don't sleep and I'm free I'm
sleeping on a dirt floor and I got a
burlap sack right talking about this of
course talking about this I have no
security I have no rights I have no
property I can't even marry the person I
love my master owns the person I love
and he's raping her I have no say in my
life at all if i can get everybody
pissed off about this we might change
something oh no no indoctrination
ideology a steady practice right you
have to live it so that then you create
the culture the created world of the
practice you have to live the
information you live it you create the
world and that reinforce the ideology so
i'm living and enforced by virtue of
education as a slave or as a child and
by virtue of the master and the dominant
relationship to live the information to
practice it if I don't I'm going to hell
I'm going to be flogged I'm going to
generally and otherwise suffer so when I
obey all things are wonderful the master
benefits he gets to go to heaven the
slave benefits he gets to go to heaven
everybody's happy and the dominant
imaginary delusion is that life is about
tomorrow so that you don't think about
today I just found it fascinating and
this is one of the things that's going
around and in my book in the 16th
century the 17th century in the 18th
century so much of the rhetoric in the
discourse about slavery and the white on
black is exactly an interchange is
freely with the relationship and the
rhetoric and the discourse about adults
and children and their relationships and
what we have then basically is a kind of
Western
paradigm our relationships of power and
ultimately the end result of that is a
misuse of power guess who gets to misuse
it well the one on top guess who gets to
be misused by it well the person in the
the subjugated position now I hope you
can see this is a given in my field oh
yeah this is history on history
literature humanities we understand this
on as Western versus Africa or Western
versus other parts of the world we've
got this and we've got this am I
forgetting any of course I say my
argument is here's the original one by
living this when you're being
unconsciously programmed this all feels
normal and you just you agree you just
you can't stand up I mean maybe you have
some sense of what I don't know that
feels kind of cruel I don't know but you
can't organize you can't stand up
there's no sense of power because in
this relation of power and the misuse of
power it's always violence and violence
t is the powerful to inflict to inflict
a sense of powerlessness I love this big
white board to inflict a sense of
powerlessness so you grow into the world
with a sense of powerlessness it's all
about tomorrow I'm waiting I can't
really tap into the actual conditions of
my material existence because I'm seven
where am I going to go
and then if I'm a good boy I get a
substitute not what I need and we'll
talk about that in a second is I need
are there real can we agree upon our
material needs as Homo sapiens and
mammals yeah I think we can though some
people like to intellectualize it make
it really complicated well I'm not
getting what I actually but I am giving
some substitutes and this is oddly
enough the roots of addiction I get
addicted to the substitute they can't
meet my real needs and I can't get off
it because I ultimately have those real
needs and I'm in the cycle of I can't
get off the wheel I gotta have it I
don't know what I need I've it's
unconscious but I do have the substitute
sex drugs consumerism buying stuff you
name it whatever the substitute is
introduced in your early programming
becomes that that that metaphor that
thing that stands for what I really want
and it can't ever be satisfied because
it's not what you need okay yeah good
right so we learn oh it's you know the
dominant culture this is great so the
dominant culture and the dominant
ideology of its dominant software says
your man was made for the world and rule
and made to rule the world not to be in
some kind of I don't know symbiotic or
harmonious however complicated that is a
relationship to nature we're going to
finish it something's been left undone
what's interesting me and in this one of
the things that that's been left undone
that's so offensive to this mindset is
that people die like wombats and jaguars
and gnats and mosquitoes it's just like
how could God have done that to us we're
so different we're so special and yet
gosh darn it we die and rot like
everything else we need to fix that and
to prove that our culture is more than
just a culture we're going to we're
going to dominate nature to such a
degree that we're going to
right away to live forever I don't know
if anybody's working that on that here
but my research is there are people
spending their careers to try to figure
out you know where's the death gene how
can we sort of support the cellular
structure of the human body indefinitely
there's a book out by Ray Kurzweil very
optimistic futurist he I think the book
is live long enough to live forever it's
just few years down the road drink your
green tea just he's pounding like this
article of managed like he drinks like
10 cups of green tea today he's going to
live long enough so that he'll finally
you know get to that technological
horizon and live forever I pursue that
it's like okay so who's going to get
this wonderful technology everybody I
doubt it how about all the poor and I
doubt it huh probably those in power
probably the minority of the minority
because it seems to be the shape of our
institutional and maybe corporate
structure all power is concentrated on
top and it absolutely depends upon the
great unwashed unsaved masses down here
this goes down and you know
ever-increasing numbers Cardinals
bishops priests note that it's
patriarchy male-dominated Western and
then you get down here you know the lay
people of the church now I say this but
this is that this is this is the shape
of the modern institution this is the
shape of the hospital this is the shape
of the paramilitary this is the shape of
google i looked around it's like wow
this place is great I me of riding bikes
free food like this is just wonderful
this is a different shape this has a
different institutional shape then the
one that's sort of out there but I don't
know enough to say that for certain and
I suspect maybe you guys would but I
won't go into that so what do we learn
all this okay so we're on our
cross-country trip we stop at a friend's
house and we're watching an old Star
Trek Star Trek the first generation okay
and so this is sort of i'm describing
this as a specular fiction it's the
sound bite is this is a post-apocalyptic
dystopian quest narrative where the
character is trying to figure out
what the hell happened why is the world
this way it takes place two thousand
years after 2050 right 2050 Common Era
so I get to play God both ways i get to
speculate on kind of like george orwell
where are we going in the next 40 years
if all things continue to unfold the way
they are okay that's not a pretty
picture and but the main character is
looking back or he finds he has to look
back like how did my world come to be
this way he's living in a terraformed
antarctica like it's a disaster it's an
environmental disaster it's a human
disaster he doesn't even call himself
you mean he doesn't know really what he
is and he has to go back and learn and
he finds his history in 2050 Common Era
so it's I get to create to two different
worlds it was quite a lot of fun okay so
Star Trek science fiction Captain Kirk
and enterprise there they're going to
check up on a crew that's been sent to
colonize a planet this is the future I
were so colonizing other people this
happened to be a lifeless planet and
they find this crew they're supposed to
be dead it's a small group of colonists
and they're supposed to be dead but they
find that they're alive it's one of the
early i think it's the first season mr.
Spock is to have emotions he gets to
fall in love for the first time I don't
know how many times he gets to fall in
love for men with no feelings he does
get to fall in love a lot but he falls
in love in this but the trigger for this
is there's a flower that shoots sprays
like it's spore into your face and it
turns you into this is happy persons
called the taste of paradise I just
checked on that thank you and I got it
wrong a taste of Armageddon is on the
same does this side of paradise right
this is one of the themes of the earlier
of the early episode Kirk constantly
going to these sort of utopia cultures
and destroying them and bringing
humanity back so he's outraged that
nothing has happened in this community
nothing he's like they're just living
they're just happy it's a small group
you know they're absolutely content and
he's just this is outrageous and so he
spends all of his energy to undo this
thing Spock gets sprayed and he falls in
love everybody gets sprayed Kirk even
gets sprayed and he discovers through
anger and aggression he can shake off
the control of this Spore all right so
he decides to have a fistfight with the
leader of this the colonists who then
near the end of the episode to kirks
great pleasure yeah it snapped out of it
and he looks around and here's where the
ideology and my training as a child
comes in the the leader of this group
has been on this planet for it's not
clear how 20 years he looks around we've
accomplished nothing here we've done
nothing and he discovers and realizes
the the epiphany of the truth we've
wasted all of our time and it's this
wonderful episode they fly off and it's
Kirk has saved the day and now as an
adult we're looking at this laughing and
enjoying it and thinking what the hell
is going on what is this what is this
culture software ideology and another
one of my favorites matrix what is this
matrix of information that's being sort
of touched on and recycled in this
episode it gets recycled again and again
not just in Star Trek but in the matrix
movie and movies and other films like it
though this is a little more
self-conscious and seems to be
commenting back on Star Trek in a way
what's the value system at work there
it's like wow we've accomplished nothing
it's the same thing that the that the
caller said when they came to the new
world here like we have rights to this
land because they haven't done anything
with it they just haven't produced
anything they haven't improved it and so
it's like okay you're watching that as a
kid they're not teaching you anything
specific but what I'm absorbing I'm
realizing oh to be happy to be perfectly
content to not be driven by ambition and
stressed to the max bye-bye need and
greed and Relations of power and
conflict and the domination of nature
and the domination of each other and
this this structure is not anywhere on
this planet and we're to understand that
as an utter failure right they've failed
another episode Kurt goes to the planet
and does the same thing any penny says
I'm going to give them what war tastes
like so they don't play around with us
they need to feel this they need
human conflict reintroduced it's like oh
that's what we're we're spreading that's
what Kirk is spreading this ideology and
then start I love Star Trek and yet at
the same time Star Trek is unconsciously
right unconsciously this is an
unconscious process it gets undone when
you become conscious of it you don't
have to participate in it which doesn't
mean you swim out into the ocean and
drown doesn't mean you crawl into a cave
and become a hermit you become conscious
of it and you practice your life whereas
my work you practice it differently okay
well its unconscious its just being
circulated yes and I and I absorb that
information that software and all down
the line it gets confirmed and
reproduced oh I'm going to school now
I'm getting taught the same lesson you
can't be happy and satisfied and content
you can't be a human being you have to
be a human doer you have to accomplish
things which there's a particular way
you do that you dominate people you win
you compete and whenever you win you've
got to triumph over the losers because
you need losers to make the guys that
get go to heaven make it meaningful you
understand heaven won't exist unless
they're losers who go to hell you can
say that in the elementary school
classroom and you can say that in a
middle-aged medieval cathedral like as
soon as you say we're all okay all this
just solution of power and the relations
are power that go along with it crumble
so we can't say that we believe even in
this day and age that seems to me we
still practice and believe part of the
software there's something wrong with us
we come into the world we're not really
prepared for it we need to be reformed
right from the womb good chance I mean
oh my god I can't even follow some of
the some of the news anymore so
disheartening medication for children is
happening younger and younger and
younger and younger like two years old
less than two years old I mean brain
development goes on to your 20 serious
brain development is going on to your
first six years and we're working with
that with medication at this age it's
stunning unconscious a misuse and abuse
of power and
yet it confirms and reproduces the very
system right I can't well there are
places but the dominant right there are
exceptions to everything I'm saying
right there are exceptions right but the
dominant mainstream is why are you
having trouble in the classroom Johnny I
can't tuck the classroom it's not the
teacher not the curriculum it's not the
school system it's not the institution
tell your parents it's not anything
outside it's got to be you you're the
problem you're the problem conform to
this get in line and don't react to this
or else the institution will come down
on you back in the day would have been
being paddled humiliated spanked flunked
etc and so on today it's some of those
things and oftentimes it's medication
which oddly enough right there's normal
supposedly and then therefore there's
abnormal when you're abnormal you need
meds you need to live it and obey so we
create the world a med world oh how
convenient this just happens to serve in
big farm pharmaceutical industry that is
absolutely we stopped watching cable
about eight years ago we watch a little
TV but but I was stunned when I do watch
TV the difference over the last eight
years just it's like every commercial
it's a pill I mean this something has
happened it's like you know the frog and
the boiling water metaphor if it's just
slowly brought up to temperature it
won't feel the difference and it'll boil
to death but if it's brought dropped
into boiling water it will feel the
difference and jump out to save itself
sorry i fell over the last eight years
we just hope big farm has been toe
slowly turning up the heat and and if
you're not sort of aware of this since I
could find might be hard to be aware of
this if you're getting a steady diet of
commercial television I'm among the many
messages in this ideological software
matrix that
plugged into this is just one of many
I'm just hearing your sick it's normal
to be sick you need pharmaceutical
industries to make you better you can't
do this for yourself this is outside the
purview of your power you're powerless
surrender to I have the highest regard
for the sciences and those who study but
this relation of power which serves and
a student go you may watch this some
danush didn't go to his doctor to say he
was in the middle of winter in Rhode
Island it's dry the atmosphere is dry
and we don't drink enough water
generally not proper fluid so much
coffee and soda so he's got dry skin and
he goes to this doctor and and and he
says what should i do is this may be my
diet and she looked at him like he was
insane and writes in two prescriptions
for dry skin too was it malicious was it
unconscious it's just a strange kind of
symptom of this matrix that I'm talking
about
so Sesame Street being sponsored by an
asthma medication it's normal to be a
kid in have asthma and it's normal to be
on medication for asthma and mainstream
says that's pretty much the only way to
address the problems of asthma
this is a lot fast does it make any
sense
so the movie The Matrix I love sci-fi
right it gets to talk about tomorrow but
it's really talking about today just as
my book so the matrix it who's seen them
you know Keanu Reeves we all love to
hate canneries and we've seen the matrix
yeah so that's a metaphor for I think
largely what we're talking about I'm
talking about anyway I love that film it
really lots of different ways to read it
lots of different ways to criticize it
but in one big way this idea that oh
okay this is the wachowski siblings who
are seem to be you know the directors
and the writers of this film they're say
so they're suggesting you know here's
where we're at we're living in this
imaginary world the actual conditions of
our existence we're in a pot of goo not
just because it's comfortable and warm
but because we are now the battery for
the dominant institution well the
metaphor is where the battery for
artificial intelligence right I should
sorry i should say the literal reading
of that is where the people in the pods
of goo and the matrix are the energy
source for those who dominate the planet
in this case it's machines and
artificial intelligence the metaphorical
reading is that's that's us right we're
living in an imaginary relationship and
we're hearing it now all across country
on the radio it's like oh my god the
consumers aren't spending the economy
will collapse and i love that as a
critic of capitalism the fact that ceos
aren't going to be making as much money
is my responsibility it's that that
classic sort of externalization of the
corporate machine we have problems we're
going to put them on you and you rescue
them from us and and the bottom line is
you know consumers need to spend so that
the system which is arguably exploiting
them can go on and we're to get panicked
about this I don't know I don't want to
lose my job and I don't want anyone I
know to lose their job and so there is
like some real material concerns here
maybe I should just play along all right
I don't want people to be thrown out of
work and lose their health care on the
other hand you know we're being pumped
with this information that it's your job
to be a battery to be the fuel cell for
this system
and the system keeps it unconscious here
okay how it becomes unconscious dominant
practices of child-rearing over the last
400 years with some exceptions cut the
child off from the body and keep the
child centered in the head the ego and
cognition which is why I don't have a
lot of faith in cognitive therapies that
just get you to think differently lots
of different disciplines over history in
the east and in the West argue for sort
of that new agey thing that we're not a
brain we're mind-body system and there
is information here when you're when
it's cut off you have no access you're
stuck in your head you feel powerless
you are not grounded in your body you
have no core in no sense of hey I don't
want to pull the trigger no you don't
have access to that why don't I have
access to that child during techniques
have traumatized me the pain is here
it's my body remembers some sense you
could say the body is the unconscious I
don't want to feel this I've blocked it
from three and four and five and six and
seven and eight nine years old right and
it's just like I have the storehouses
for these experiences I have the
imaginary relationship to them that says
I deserved it I asked for it this is
what happens to people and now it's here
and these different disciplines whether
it's Chinese medicine zen buddhism
gestalt bioenergetics and and an
attachment theory detachment theory and
attachment disorder theory you know
whichever one you pick is saying look
there's no flow
information is not flowing it's trapped
up here you unleash this you find your
power of course not unlike my main
character he has to go back in order to
go forward the imaginary relationship
says no no that's that's the past forget
that sorry I keep using the wrong side
forget that just forget that the fact
that you can't remember it means it's
all gone it's all done your a new person
you can decide these things you can
think to think differently and now
you're just a head floating in space one
of my colleagues that a great thing is
yeah in the West we we sort of think of
our bodies as brain stands I'm just a
brain standing my brain is where am I my
identity is well my brain is where my
cognition is happening and it's where
ideology is circulating my gut is where
my intuition is Einstein says really all
there is in the final analysis intuition
it's like ah I love that and this is
where it is it's your gut sense and it's
deepak chopra talks about in others talk
about there is many thinking neurons in
the gut as there are in the brain Wow
you know we really do solve problems
with our whole body when we solve them
with our body it's really possible and
then they're really and then those head
solving problems which can't get to let
you sleep at night and you try to like
argue it out and navigate it through and
strategize and try to solve it it just
won't stay solved why no arguably it's
not coming from the core this is blocked
Alexander Lowen talks about he's a
bioenergetic therapist and medical
doctor still alive writing famous books
from the 60s and the 70s and 80s he
talked about depression as being like
this backlog and finally there's a
tipping point could be that you lost
your toothpaste or your partner walked
out on you small big it doesn't matter
the tipping point just you can't deal
with everything on an emotional and
physical level and then a tipping point
and you just the system collapses
and you're now in a sort of clinical
depression not sadness right my students
love to confuse the duo I feel depressed
today no you're here you're ambulatory
you just maybe you're feeling
discouraged you're feeling you're
feeling sad depression is I'm not
feeling anything I'm numb so the Bernard
body this is what the Nazis did for a
hundred well this is what the Nazis
exploited in the 30s and in the 40s they
inherited this tradition of black
pedagogy child rearing they called it
the black pedagogy in which this is a
war this is a war and they talked about
it as a war you're going to save the
child's soul by going to war against the
weeds in that child soul all right you
weed that child because the child's come
in fallen through the the Calvinist
Christianity right Calvinism going back
to the Protestant Reformation I mean
Calvin oh my god I mean he takes what
the catholic church doesn't he just puts
it on steroids and and and and and and
crack I mean he's just like Europe we
come into this world and we are so
rotten it's up to the you know
enlightened spiritually enlightened
adult to save the child and so black
patty like pedagogy evolved from that
it's like okay we can't we can't
evangelize a two-year-old but we can go
to war against that two-year-old and
teach it from the beginning their
position visa V relations of power and
you just better not cry about it or I'll
give you something to cry about and so
we learn to repress and that's what this
is here repression of all kinds of
traumatic violence not just getting
whacked around but the kind of violence
that's the shame and the humiliation the
the relations of conditional love I see
hi just it's troubling I don't mean to
sound like a murderous it's like just go
to the grocery store and it's like you
hear it these poor children being
tortured I'm leaving I'm leaving
it's like you're not obeying me you're
being caught up as a human homo sapien
interesting all the colors you're doing
exactly what the mechanism is meant to
do and the lesson there is I'm leaving
I'll leave you here that's that's how
important it is that you obey me I'm
going to I'm going to walk out of the
store and I'm going to threaten to leave
you here if you don't stop touching that
like that's like the death penalty for
touching a bag of Eminem's isn't it I
mean on some emotional level ative Wow
can you imagine living with that maybe
you did every day that it's not about
unconditional hey you know what we're
going to have our problems but
unconditionally you're in a safe zone
and you can find the boundaries and test
and get excited and and collapse and go
through all that I'm here to support
that now can you imagine if you didn't
have that experience you had the other
experience where every day is don't
touch that don't do that don't do that
don't be human don't be yourself don't
do that don't do this don't like well
Who am I supposed to be well just don't
do that and it's all these sort of
negatives don't don't don't with the
constant chronic fluctuating punishments
right from the death penalty to just
chronic you know shaming and undermining
of your own faith in yourself you have
to undermine the faith itself of the
subordinated person if you want to
dominate them
so inventing the child as a history of
this how children learn this lesson from
Disney from children's picture books
from children's novels oh I don't if you
remember English novel famous 19th
century English novel The Wind in the
Willows it's just you read it as an
adult it's this it's this propaganda
track for Empire and and and the right
of the white aristocrat to rule everyone
else and that the people on the margins
the weasels and the stoats who live in
the forest are evil and when they try to
take some part of that for themselves oh
this is completely unacceptable they
need the harshest reprisals and whereas
kids cheering for this right to bring
things back into their natural and
proper order wow this is my children
novel Disney at the end of inventing the
child in the conclusion this is back in
nineteen ninety nine I'm writing this I
say on NPR I heard a piece about it
takes about 30 to 50 times the resources
to raise a westin child than developing
nation child in africa or and some other
slightly non-western are not
economically you know lifted up sort of
culture it's like 30 times and so i took
the low number the more conservative
member since okay why 30 times well more
energy right more water more oil more
electricity and so there's a toll here
right every time we plug in we're
plugging into a system that's dumping
mercury into the ocean right because
this is where mercury comes from the
production of electricity from burning
coal and that is you know non-negotiable
that's something we're going to have to
do so just don't eat too much tuna i
guess so it's going to take 30 times the
toll and 30 times their resources to
raised you and i and our children up
then I don't know someone from the
subcontinent or from Africa and it's
like or or maybe 10 or 15 or 20 years
ago someone from China and so I said
well what happens when when those people
in those places say you know what we
want to run your PlayBook
that's our guard given right whatever
you call it that's our right to you're
doing it and where do we want it to and
now I'm from this thing like that seem
to be happening in China right there
they want to burn oil like we've burned
oil they wanna they want to live like we
live they don't want it to be a hundred
and sixteen in Beijing they want it to
be 68 in their apartment when it's 116
in Beijing just like we get so what
happens when this is back when I'm
riding in there's six billion people
today we're at almost 6.5 billion but
that's that math is really hard this is
much easier so six billion people then
and so it's like okay six billion people
now we're talking about sustainability
right sustainability in terms of this
planet and they say well what's what's
the going rate of the carrying capacity
of the planet anybody here that anybody
have that number approximately because
there's no one can know for certain the
carrying capacity for the planet human
beings shoot how many three no it's what
could be maybe and we're past it already
that's a very sad and scary thought okay
yeah right that's a nice footnote
chemical fertilizers right this is right
now we're living the last hundred years
of petroleum world right the fertilizers
and pesticides that make we just with
the pump food out of the ground are made
and derived from oil wowee we're not
addicted to oil as the president once
said we boil is our blood you cut that
off and we just fall over it's like
circulating through us we we depend on
it okay so a conservative apologists for
our system as opposed to what you're
saying would say maybe 12 to 15 billion
which seems like an obscene amount of
people where you know how but ok let's
just say it's 12 billion okay so for a
living six billion we could do this
quick I don't want to lose you and an
American child takes 30 times how many
people in America well right now 300
million so you do the math or I'll do
the math and other it's using using a
Chinese sorry using you know you didn't
sort of as the baseline one America as
thirty three hundred million times 30
not just finish it for you nine billion
so we consume in this country as if we
were a planet of nine billion people
already assuming now China at the time
i'm writing this has 1 billion people
let's just assume let's just assume
they're consuming 1 x 1 billion okay
that's like a population of 1 billion
India to it's about a billion so what
happens when they want to run our
playbook and they and right let's just
say they don't even get to 30 let's just
say they get to 20 China will be
consuming like the culture of 20 billion
people I so hence the speculative nature
of my pursuits now like what's going to
happen it doesn't look good what's going
to happen and when and then what's the
world is going to look like after that
collapse 2050 and I'll wrap it up 2060
ad 2050 Common Era I see the world this
world we're going to be working out the
Fourth World War the chronic conflict
that's going to end it nanotechnology
life extension from experimentation with
nanotechnology and cloning and
artificial intelligence that's another
thing you know you talk about our Ray
Kurzweil and artificial intelligent I
mean there are different camps here
right there's the cloning path and then
there's the nano technology that's going
to like put in these nano splints on
every human cell to sustain every human
cell and again who's going to get that
technology who can afford it and then
there's and there are people working on
this right and then there are the folks
working you know not up the road that
would be Boston for me but for you it's
San Francisco maybe up the road from
Rhode Island they're working on
artificial intelligence this is their
career they want to make this happen
they want to make this happen they want
to make not necessarily that the dark
story of the matrix happen but they want
yeah we we want artificial intelligence
and I and I went to close here i'm
thinking bool where is google fit into
this and i'm thinking like okay so it's
like there's this incredible search
engine and everything else that's grown
up around
seems to me to be a kind of reflection
or representation of a mind sort of
Catholic let me back up the human mind
way back when with ancient Greece and
Aristotle I mean what makes them so
amazing what makes Aristotle so amazing
is he just starts a catalogue thing and
order things in a way that's familiar to
Western excuse me to the Western mind
right it's like wow what a genius he's a
he's ordering the sciences and the arts
and what is poetry and what is rhetoric
and any she's sort of ordering and
cataloging and hierarch izing and I
don't know what you guys do exactly do
but I think some of that language might
fit a little bit you know that II york
when i go on google it's like ordering
and hierarch izing and and and
prioritizing and and helping me search
and find that information so i think wow
nice up now this is just between you
know very informally gives us some kind
of proto artificial intelligence it's
like like when when the world wide web
sort of wakes up and and and and and no
longer is slaved i love that language to
a dominant system and becomes the
dominant system well one is that what
Google is is that what the science
fiction movie should be you down dope
aren't against that Google per se but
this technology because we certainly
seem to be infatuated it certainly seems
to increase productivity I love it and
use it every day but then it's like wow
hmm what would the speculative fiction
movie be about you know it's like the
Terminator and Skynet wakes up on august
27th i forget the day in the year
exactly but is google connected to that
wow I wonder so what the matrix the
movie what I love about the movie is it
says well you know it's it's almost
working out the cliche the fruit doesn't
fall far from the tree so we give birth
to artificial intelligence who are they
going to grow up to be and there of
course they're warning is they're going
to grow up to be us and they're going to
dominate and they're going to be our
masters and we're going to be their
slaves and we're going to make their
world go
where do we learn all this I'm arguing
here unconsciously in this wheel I am
born into the environment the big
argument for nurture I'm making a big
argument for nurture ongoing debate is
it nature or is it nurture oh it's your
genes it's your genes let's find the
disobedient gene and turn it off oh my
god I can't believe I hear that stuff
but whatever so you know there's a gene
for everything no I'm saying no there's
an environmental reaction to everything
so in any of it you're born into your
environment you're nurturing cultural
environment you're informed by the
relationship and the values and the
beliefs that are being practiced on you
without your consent if they're healthy
values good luck you did well you're
going to grow as a home homo sapien
needs you know a certain nominal
experience of attachment nutrition
safety risk right if you don't have that
whatever you can't say no I'm 18 months
old I want a different experience I want
more forgiveness in love and compassion
I don't want to be trained to potty when
they tell me to whatever you enter into
that culture which is informed by its
software but you don't see it you you
live it in practice and and this is the
final word it's like so we love it how
we contact each other and how we
practice our lives if we suffer probably
because we're working out something
unconsciously to become conscious of it
to live the unconscious consciously is
to be liberated enlightenment they call
it I think we're do I think there's a
lot at stake I think we can't wait very
much longer and hope that somebody rides
in with a white lab coat or shining
armor or something to save us from
ourselves I think you know we're do and
I'm grateful to be here because it's
like wow here's the movers and shakers
you know where you guys are on the
inside you're doing this you're banging
this stuff out you know whatever you're
living as a culture here one way or
another is seeping in
to the culture out there you're
reproducing it you're marrying it you're
representing it and you're reproducing
it I stole my own Thunder there's a
reproduction going on of what well
that'll be interesting to find out
exactly what you know what unfolds 10
years 20 years but boy it's really
exciting to be here sort of it feels
like the nerve center this is google e
equals MC squared well so you can check
this out i'm i'm as happy to swing by
and I wanted to tell you about this it's
hard work selling a book like who cares
mastery time busy you know if you have
some time google it as they say you know
check it out i would love to have you
read it i would love to have you comment
back on amazon or wherever I Barnes and
Noble or the publisher's website and you
know what am I saying about where we're
going and and as such as as engineers as
as high tech people you know what do you
think about what do you think you know
what do you think way in what do you
think about my vision for my prophetic
vision and where I think we're going or
where he may be going well okay if
there's any discussion or questions I
would certainly leave a few minutes for
that but I think that's my my schtick
