would like to welcome you all once again
superplex and sorry for the last minute
to change your venue but it looks like
you're probably here make your way there
I'd like to thank our distinguished
panelists and before I begin I like to
do too short announcements okay what is
the deal who are we and what we do the
web deal is the largest professional web
organization in Silicon Valley we focus
on three core areas usability develop
networks and SEO and SEM are we have 15
thousand people on a mailing list and
through our affiliates we reach about
25,000 people about forty-two percent of
our members CXOs VPS 41-percent
technical ten percent entrepreneurs or
self-employed and sort of soccer points
some of us in on Crows the concentration
of the companies of the makeup are bye
bye bye health department Yahoo Apple
Google Microsoft Cisco verisign in a
treat sounds like a recruit is green
right there so having said that the
quickly look at our website it explains
our three core areas of expertise each a
usability developer network and design
and on the usability jared school who's
a guru and usability headset group he's
an advisor to us the developed network
is headed by bill scott of yahoo who
runs there one of the people who run
they developed network and the internet
marketing group is going to be run by
somebody from ebay i just spoke today
with rajiv data who is the president of
paypal at paypal ebay and they'll be
helping us with some resources in that
area so why is that important because
based on these three core areas that's
how we come up with our topics so we
find themes that are operating in these
three core areas find companies that are
executing on those themes and find
speakers around those in this case it
was vertical search so we have become
calm we have simply hired and we have
blinkx com companies that are really
disrupting the marketplace so next month
we have social social search and we have
dick delicious and stumble upon and the
following month we have our conference
I'll get into that a little later
so having said that if you have any
topics or any speakers that you're
interested please go to the website fill
out the form and we'll do our best to
find a speaker in the area we'll try and
have it covered like to get into a
little bit about the conference the
conference is on october and the theme
of the conference is the new web the
focus again will be user and the user
experience and having said that we are
for the keynote speaker is going to be
around three round rom was one of the
executives at Netscape at amazon and is
one of the founding principles of google
so he has a lot of insight into building
consumer internet companies and he's
going to be sharing some of his his
recipe in fact his secret sauce and
ingredients of what he's looking for him
in doing that the other node keynote
speaker speakers Marissa Mayer who is
Google's guru of user experience she's
going to be talking about what they do
to measure the user experience and how
they roll out new products across that
area and then it's going to break out
into two tracks the first track is going
to be talking about technologies the
methodologies and the platforms into
which user the user experiences is going
such and geron spool is going to be
talking about usability I'm sorry Yahoo
and Microsoft and a few others are going
to be talking about Ajax and other tools
that are making building the rich
Internet applications and finally so
Kelly gotoh is going to be talking about
the mobile web and the other track be is
going to be talked about how you
monetize this user group once you build
it and a new ad platforms so before we
wrap up I turn you over to Rachel who's
going to make the introductions next
week or early this later this week
you'll get a survey from us and we would
like to know how we're doing we'd like
to know how your membership is working
for you so before we get into that I
would like to give you some idea of
where we fit in the landscape so some of
the groups that we compete with in the
events
the events area is SD form SD form has
an annual fee of $125 each each event is
fifteen to thirty dollars and and they
focus is basically everything in this S
phase they they are about a hundred
dollars and each events between
forty-five to sixty dollars and their
focus i think is to be like st forum and
then there is then there's Ty and ties
average monthly fee sorry annual fee is
about a hundred dollars and each event
is about 25 to 55 dollars and then there
is the web guild and we charge $65
that's basically a tank of gas these
days and and in and each event costs
about five dollars and that's basically
the car you know less than the cost of a
big mac and a small fries and a meeting
coke I guess so so I think we deliver
excellent value in this space so why why
have we been able to go from the bottom
to the top and attract keynote speakers
is because we focus on one thing that's
a web at the three core areas in the web
so we're moving now is into the
conference arena so we have a conference
coming up our conference is $135 it's
going to be jam-packed it's going to be
super it's the best minds out on the web
you know and it's you know you gotta
love it and we compete with search
engine strategies which is charges
approximately 1500 ad tech around 1500
Ajax world around 1500 and O'Reilly 3200
by the way John battle who runs or Riley
network is helping me with some of the
speakers so that's why we've been able
to get a huge roster so but having said
that we're not really competing with any
of them directly we're taking the top
areas where they focusing on the web and
that's why you should come and we are
nonprofits so we're not in the business
to make money where the business to
deliver value to you and if you get
value you come back here great so that
was my I'm sorry Oh October October 19th
it's it'll be on our website very
shortly
also by the end of this week we'll have
our jobs board launched so again it's
going to be a very focused jobs board
all Internet focus we're going to be
giving craigslist's real run for their
money and the format of tonight's
presentation after rush makes
introductions we'll be having a
discussion for about an hour and a half
for that x QA since we don't have a mic
I think some you'll have to come forward
ask a question this mic apparently does
work or doesn't work the does okay
there'll be a conclusion a podcast of
this event will be made available on the
website within 24 hours and the speakers
will make their presentations available

satoh go pan is a research analyst at
Jupiter research where she is focused on
online search covering a search engine
marketing SEO and the overall search
experience prior to joining Jupiter
research Sapna worked as a consultant at
pwc so my great pleasure to introduce to
you all of our distinguished speakers
this evening thank you Miss tisha
because I'm the third kind of speaker I
start off pretty loud but then it goes
down a bit so yeah my freshman said I
cover search and search engine marketing
for Jupiter research and obviously it
started to sort of spread out in a lot
of other zones and vertical search is
definitely something that we are
focusing on a lot more in the recent
times and obviously sort of the hotbed
for that is where we are at right now
Google in essentially what we are
covering is the main general search
engines but vertical search is something
that I think I've spoken with the east
room of the palace at some point of time
to discuss that so I think it should be
an interesting session I just wanted to
set a base to the discussion in terms of
understanding where why we are so
excited that our research from about
search engine marketing or online search
and I promises the only data slide that
I would put in here I just have a couple
of slides but this is precisely the
reason we think search is getting more
and more interesting this is the
advertising forecast in billings so
we're looking at about forty percent of
an advertiser's budget that's going to
be focused on search by the year 2011
and that is exciting because the growth
has been phenomenal the marketers
interest in it has been phenomenal and
it's easy to understand why it's getting
so bad a couple of reasons for sure a
lots of other lots of people going to
search engines with this can be Google
Yahoo any of these engines and the
marketers are starting to notice that
there are lots more people coming in to
put their ads on it to put there whether
it's going to be Adwords or Yahoo's at
to be able to reach these searchers and
that is essentially the main reasons
getting pushed up a lot more and one
more interesting aspect
or the push factor to why search is
growing itself usually for the
advertisers it's also the reason that
they are opening up to a new set of
search engines and not just focusing on
Google and Yahoo and Michael promptly
noses a lot of if I'm a retail marketer
i'm selling some kind of shoes and i
know i go to google and put my master to
be able to access the people searching
for shoes i also know that there are
these bunch of other vertical shopping
search engines becomes a calmness
shopping.com bunch of other shopping
search engines that i should also be
focusing on and that's definitely
another contributing factor to that Oh
in one and this is just sort of a
snippet of what line I think it's going
to be interesting in retail for sure
there's a question we ask consumers and
how useful they find any of these types
of content in trying to purchase
something and I've sort of highlighted
the shopping comparison sites from
shopping.com becomes a compound which is
starting to really rise and how useful
it is in how searchers are basically
using it search engines is right on top
but it's and it's obvious the top right
is where most of these content providers
would want to be yet but it's an
interesting point in it because shopping
search engines has actually gone up a
lot more on the x-axis and that's
definitely an encouraging trend one more
example help search emerging information
destination when this was a question
post again health consumers on how they
went about looking for information about
health and wellness and sixty percent of
the news general
search engines to look for information
about it 42 a person to use search
engines are sites that focus on health
so the blues and government-related
engines yahoo health and well health as
where people are going to to be able to
look for this information so essentially
the bottom line is there's there are
sort of the initiators the market a
couple few of these industries are sort
of poised to be able to take advantage
of search more the search engines are
vertical sides by virtue of the fact
that they've been around awhile a lot
more retail is one example travel is one
example sidestep.com is another travel
search engine financial services is
something which we are starting to see a
lot more interest especially from the
marketers media and entertainment this
is another area which is well poised to
take advantage of political search
because they have been online quite for
quite a while now the emerging
categories and this is where the
interesting part really starts up
calcifies health there was their health
search engines health line.com only this
one of them real estate there are a
couple of real estate I think search
engines from the bay area itself jobs
which is what Simply Hired is sort of
focusing on automotive it's something
that we've heard a lot of interest from
the marketers and it's definitely an
area that we think either it blends into
classifieds are in sort of takes up on
its own but essentially the general
search engines are starting to create
these graduation grounds for each of
these vertical sites when they get
bigger when they get more and more of
the volume from researchers it becomes
an interesting point where the
motivation to start a vertical side
starts off so with that I know we have a
quick introduction to each of the
panelists that I would love to hear from
Michael government surround that general
tilik in which I can actually pronounce
because I do watch cricket and I know
so things like that in there um I'd like
to sort of get a sense of what do you do
with become that calm simply higher than
the links and where you're sort of
companies started off short this is so
good evening my name is Michael yegg and
I'm very happy to be here I wanted to
start by asking a quick question and see
a show of hands here how many of you had
an experience where you were looking to
buy something so you wanted to kind of
get some more information reviews or
products and you cannot really find that
information on the internet whether your
search using search engines or any other
sites can you raise your hand okay
that's about 50 to 60 percent and you
know that's it this is one of the
reasons why we decided to develop a
vertical search engine that specialize
in product than shopping information so
just a brief background we my partner
and i started my son back in 1998 it was
one of the first online comparison
shopping sites and we got back together
about three years ago to do something
that's very very different and new and
going after some problems that the
general search engines were really
delivering so let me start by giving you
a quick overview of our website and then
I have a few slides that gives you a
little bit more background information
about the company so if you go to become
calm one thing you'll notice that we
have these suggestions at the bottom but
as you're typing something in let's say
you're looking for a it gets them in
more information about BMW you see a lot
of suggestions here like BMW 3 series 5
6 7 these are information that we gather
from crawling billions of
edges of web documents so we are able to
come up with intelligent suggestions to
help you narrow down your searches or
find products that that you didn't think
about but you are you're actually
interested in so let's look for
something like plasma TV and type in
every term one thing I want to point out
is that we have two buttons research and
shop basically research allows you to
find all the great information like
reviews and buying guys to get more
information about a product like whether
it's mp3 player refrigerators or any
kind of product and then shop is when
you're ready to shop for products and
you want to compare prices then that's
what you push so a default here is we
give you a research results on the left
hand side and shop results on the right
hand side so here we find you
information from consumer research cnet
on TV buying guide so these are very
expert buying guide information on
products and if you are trying to
understand the difference between plasma
TV and LCD and and high-definition that
this is a great source of sites for for
that type of information and once you're
ready another thing that we have that's
very unique is this search zoom feature
where you can narrow down the results by
buying guys or product with you so you
don't have to flip through so many pages
to get to what you're looking for so
this is a real nice feature we use a
expensive machine learning technology to
make this possible you can narrow it
down to the product reviews or buying
guys here and once you're ready to shop
you could click on the shop button and
we show you many different product
brands and models and their prices and
you could narrow it down by particular
brand or price or by particular online
store so you could click on one of the
brands that you might be interested in
and then like for this pioneer 42 inch
PDP model you could compare prices
and we find merchants that sell their
products so we're here in Mountain View
so we just type in the zip code to
calculate the total cost including
shipping and tags and we give you the
total price at the bottom so once play
sells it for 1,600 another place el 24
29 9 as there is a pretty wide gap
between what what some of these
merchants are selling the identical
product for another feature that we have
is let's see if you're looking for like
ipod nano let's see looking for this for
mega x 4 gigabyte ipod nano black what
you see here on the right-hand side is a
nearest store so once we understand the
location of the user we could find the
stores nearby that person to help you
find so in this case there is a circuit
city and the apple store in Palo Alto
and mountain view area so you could
actually click on this to see where the
store is located we use yahoo maps here
with a diamond at dynamic zooming
capability so that you can see the
store's address phone number and store
hours and even a driving direction so it
makes it very easy for people to compare
buying online versus offline if you want
to go down and actually take a look at
the product and see how it feels and
make a decision and a lot of times
offline stores would match the online
prices so you could actually print print
out this result and bring it down to the
store and that will usually match it for
you the last feature that I want to
point out is this after my favorite
feature so if you're thinking about if
you're considering a few different
choices then you can actually put those
up on the work space at the top so that
you could think about it look at them by
side by side or you could add other
kinds of products let's say you're
looking for a ipod docking station to go
along with it and you want to take a
look how they would live together or it
could be a t-shirt at a pants or even a
any kind of product that you could think
about you could put them up on the sport
station and this this information is
stored for you based on the cookie so
you can come back later and make your
decision and we're expanding on that so
that's a brief tour of our website it
combines the best of search engine
that's fine that finds reviews and
buying guys and we help compare prices
on thousands of products so it's just a
few slides on the company
the opportunity that we're going after
is as Sapna pointed out earlier search
engine is incredibly powerful general
search and vertical search combined is
about a 15 billion dollar business this
year going to 30 billion by 2010 that's
according to Piper Jaffray our research
report and a lot of the monetization is
a through the shopping and commercial
related queries and today currently
approximately 350 million queries are
done that are shopping oriented so
there's a lot of people looking for
different kinds of products that they
didn't want to buy or they want to
research so the general search engines
are very useful if you're looking up any
kind of information about any topic but
a lot of times they're off topic when
you're looking for particular product
reviews are buying guides because let's
say you're looking for television it
brings back information about history of
television or television station
websites it's a hodgepodge but a
vertical search engine gives you just
product information like buying guides
and reviews and discussion forum so you
can learn more about different
television technology to help make a
better buying decision at our product
and technology so we have created this
brand new search engine using a
proprietary ranking algorithm so we have
3.2 billion pages of documents that that
are only shopping that compares to
Google's latest published numbers of
eight billion pages of everything so
we're just specializing in all the sites
that are shopping oriented and our air
technology is sort of our core crown
jewel of our technology this is a
patent-pending technology that looks at
not only the incoming links to a pyit
page but also outgoing links and we also
look at the context of weather links are
coming from so a bunch of links are
coming from off topic pages or spam
pages we don't give any additional
ranking for that but if it comes from
sites that are related to your topic
product or shopping then we give you a
lot of ranking boost so it's a much more
targeted and relevant search results and
much more spam resistant and we
integrate that sure I'll make it real
quick so it's a it's the only site that
combines the research and shopping our
business model is CPC we have over 5000
merchants who are selling their products
on our site over 20 million products and
our revenues are ramping up rapidly and
founded by founders my Simon and wise
net and the management team from yahoo
ebay altavista nextag located here in
Mountain View we have launched the
Japanese company Jim joint venture so we
have 42 employees here and 18 in Japan
and we're one of the fastest-growing
shopping search engines and brief
explanation about our technology and the
kind of a coverage that we got in the in
the press so that's all I have for
become that time right Gotham did you
want to explain a bit about your own her
and just a quick question between the
con-com how many people have actually
gone to become calm to search for
progress why bad Simply Hired I'm
Kennedy the Silicon Valley might be
slightly bit more with all the job so
far no it's generally popping and
how many have access oh there you go yes
so first of all thank you very much it's
a pleasure to be here I'm Gotham
California i'm the CEO Simply Hired and
since Michael started off with a
question I'm going to indulge in the
same so I'm going to ask you guys to
raise your hand and keep it up if you've
ever looked for a job can I keep them up
I will see you see the man
okay now I want you guys to keep your
hand up if you enjoyed the process so
that's that's kind of a value
proposition for simply hired a nutshell
simply hired as you know operates a
search engine for jobs we index jobs
from a few thousand sources around the
internets sitting job boards newspaper
sites nonprofit sites government sites
employer sites anywhere where the jobs
are we go out and get them today our
index is about 5 million jobs total
which if you know about sites like
monster and careerbuilder were about 15
times the size and when we started in
march of 2005 to give you a sense of our
growth we were about eight times the
size in addition to that simply hired as
a number of other features for example
we integrate referral data salary data
mapping data so that you have a really
really great job search experience when
you come to the site the company was
founded in October of 2003 we came to
market in March of 2005 and the company
has now raised about seventeen point
seven million in funding total a couple
of months ago we announced a partnership
in the u.s. corporation and launched
myspace so we now power myspace careers
so if you have a chance check out
careers myspace com I think the the
excitement for us and the company really
stems from the fact that we really
believe we're working on an important
problem if you look at the life of an
individually and if you look at our
lives we believe that there's really
three important decisions that each of
us are going to make the first is the
spouse we choose the second is the house
we choose and the third of the job we
choose and you know things go smoothly
for you're probably not making those
first two decisions very often so so
that leaves jobs and and if the bureau
of labor statistics is correct then
we're going to each make that decision
ten times in the next 20 years so that
makes job search the most important
decision that we will make again and
again in our lives and so simply hired
as determined to help people find jobs
they love and I would say that we vet
we've probably executed in about fifteen
to twenty percent of our visions so
we're pretty excited to other some great
times ahead some
to be with you thank you I guess when I
mean there could still be a daily
surgical site for the first time that
there could i bet yes thank you yeah
yeah I don't have a question for you he
said I have a request when she asked
when someone asked earlier not if you
put your hand up saying you've been to
blinkx com so the first demand i have
off people who love you is to go to
blinks tonight and have a look at it I'd
so much more interesting it's much more
teasing than sitting here we are staring
at me or listening to me so blinks is a
video search engine the company is
 in half years old we looked at
you know my team I founding team and I
all come from a sort of background in
audio and video search in that kind of
area I'm a reef first looked at the
space but to know almost three years ago
now we were amazed at how little
technology was being used in in that
particular area at the time if you tried
to look for a video online even for the
few videos that were online was
amazingly difficult to find things you
basically stumbled on things if you are
lucky on an honest of existing search
engine Google Yahoo that kind of thing
so we focus very heavily on on changing
that problem of fixing that problem we
use all kinds of interesting technology
which we can go into later using things
like speech recognition visual analysis
face recognition all that kind of stuff
to really get computers to understand
what's going on inside video content and
we do that across the web so you know
I'm sure all of you have read articles
or checked out videos websites in the
last of the six months it's become a
very hot topic but what you'll notice
with a lot of those sites almost all of
them is that it's all about stuff that
it exists on their own site blinks is
very different we're up about what's out
there across all these different sites
so from our single search box you should
be able to find everything from you know
a bloomberg reports on Condoleezza
Rice's latest flight to the Middle East
all the way through to probably a more
compelling video of a skateboarding dog
so
just get of justice or give you a few
miles place in the company we're still
relatively small and sense that you know
we were sort of angel funded and sort of
personally backed right now but despite
that on that on that shoestring budget
we've managed to get a pretty popular
site and recently started announcing a
couple of pretty large distribution
deals that we've signed the first of
which when our couple of weeks ago we
now power video search on an AOL sub
portal called study buddies education
portal which is a very exciting sort of
piece of news for us at the moment the
from the point of view of kind of where
we see things going we're amazed that
you know even today video online is if
you look at what people are doing the
online it's pretty nigh even pretty
short-sighted you know it's still sort
of short clips that okay have fun for a
while but people don't seem to grasp
just what is possible you know the
internet is an amazingly powerful
distribution network it's very very fast
it's already piped into millions and
millions of homes across the world it's
only getting faster and more pervasive
it also is very very quick to adapt to
new display technologies and devices
whether it's bones whether it's your TV
whatever and at the end of the day the
media of choice for most of us is
television or video content but more of
us watch TV than read and immunity books
or newspapers or magazines and whether
you like that or not that's because of
the emotive nature of that particular
medium we think that intersection is
really really exciting you know it's
about technology but it's also about
what a lot of people really like doing
for lots of hours every day and you know
we're hoping to play a small part in
hopefully connecting those two together
thank you so
some of the questions that I had for
this panel and then you'll definitely
open it up for questions from the
audience but here's my question this is
probably extremely basic to start off
with but it's a question that usually
gets a lot of interesting responses why
is vertical search but here's the reason
I ask this question because my mom and I
know it's sort of a cliche person to
return to use but so person to use when
asked her what's a vertical surfside she
says it's expedient because she could be
able to look and search for information
about travel teams and some form there
she thinks amazon.com could be searched
as well but there is definitely a
difference there and what you guys do
which is spider out and be able to
collect that information and pull it in
so I'm get people to submit that so my
question to you is one what do you think
is vertical search and to how important
do you think it is to distinguish
yourself from the side switch this off
take submissions you're actually going
up there to gather information from the
web so my right so I think that vertical
search engine is different than general
search engines like Google Yahoo in that
general search engine gives you all
kinds of documents that matches the
keyword that you're looking for so a
vertical search engine is really a
specialized search engine that has a
separate index or database of
information that is specialized in one
particular topic so that you don't get a
lot of these off topic or unrelated
irrelevant results to save user a lot of
time in getting to the information that
they're looking for so whether it's
shopping medical job video these are all
vertical search engines so there's
clearly a need and a room for a
specialized surgeon of all different
kinds of different things oh well I
guess I'd say that that by definition I
think the reason that search as a whole
emerges is because you have something to
search and if you have just a few items
searches trivial you don't need to
search you can just see it so I think
general search emerged because there
were a lot of web documents out there
and as the number of online destinations
that's proliferated I think you see that
now there's a lot of documents or a lot
of information within a lot of
specialties so we give you the example
of job search today in addition to the
big boards that you hear about monster
careerbuilder there's 5,000 other job
boards then there's 3,000 newspapers
there's five million employers more and
more which are putting their job sites
online and by the way every state and
county has their own job site now I'm
going to tell you that the biggest job
site out there like monster has only ten
percent of the jobs that you might be
interested in so what are you going to
do and that's the reason that vertical
search emerged but I think that the long
term promise of a vertical search
actually I think is going to make that
term a bit of a misnomer because i think
the vertical search player is really at
the end of the day are specialists there
are specialists in a particular area
that requires great specialty and when
you look at job search and what a
complex process it is when you go
through this three to six months job
search process where you do everything
from going search for a job filter
companies see benefits data find
referrals create a resume that's where
the specialty comes in so I think that
you're seeing an era of specialist
emerge and that's fundamentally I think
the most exciting part of all vertical
job search the fact is that simply hire
is known as a vertical search company
but we're actually an employment company
we help people find jobs that's what we
do and search is just one mechanism the
door is it important for you to make the
distinction to people who come to simply
hire for example to be able to tell them
that we go out and get as many jobs as
we can that's applicable to you versus
telling them this is where this is just
a job site is to be coming here to look
for is it important for you to point out
that you go out and spider and get the
content that they were actually need
absolutely and we go out of our way to
point that out if you go to our homepage
will tell you that we index 55 million
jobs from literally thousands of
different sources it's right there yeah
listen two three four marks that
typically yield a vertical search engine
you know the first is essentially a
topic or an area
is of great importance to people at
certain points in their lives you know
and will be so no the list you should
search out early all sort of Porter's
that category but then it's also about
that content being out there and being
you know they're being lots of it but it
being in certain areas or certain spaces
or certain sites so again the big
problem with general search engines is
that when you do your product search you
get down into the mud sorts of things
that aren't doing product that still
match the keyword for example and then
the file area which is probably the most
important really after the long term is
that this area that we're talking about
has to be one which requires some kind
of very specialized approach whether
it's to do with you know something as
simple as how the interface interacts
with a user or something more complex
like some deep technology requirement to
actually understand the content that's
their the data that's there that's where
it really matters just to sort of not be
you know sort of self advertise
constantly I'll use an example like
Zillow which is a real estate search
engine now what's really neat about
zillow is not that it taps into an
information that wasn't already there
it's all already there and people who
are really good at searching could
already get to most of auxiliary could
do but what probably read it that was
smart was pull all those things together
so you can type in a zip code or an
address or whatever and get not just you
know the thing you're looking at but
also the crisis historically and all
kinds of legal information and
information about the neighborhood and
so on and so that that's really where it
gets very smart and to do that on a
general search engine is extremely
difficult I mean even if you look at
Google or Yahoo yes their general search
engines that's the core business but for
both of those companies but but they're
also in many ways vertical search
engines they all have separate tabs and
so even even in their case you can see
this is admission of the fact that it
makes sense to separate separate you
know frugal from google web search or
whatever else i think and outer learning
does the son of one of the reasons
the 11 search box is not something
that's really working anymore it has
been great for so long that you could go
to one search box search for whatever
you want but then you want the kind of
flexibility what you want to search for
so keeping that in mind and you can
probably start around understand what do
what are the sort of three main
priorities that you have when you design
the interface off your homes or search
sites if they're there some of the
search bar and you can click on search
and that's what Google does but when you
design your own interface is what are
sort of the three top things that you
have to keep in mind or you try to keep
in mind to make it easier for these
people were coming to your site so fun
this protocol better that's okay in that
sense that you like it while we are a
video segment the answer will be some
high level what we are more about is
probably best analogy is remote control
then she access video
there's a bit of a TV remote controller
calcium channels we should be sort of
month ago and in that sense given equal
comfort control with slightly different
things so that's the way we can we
literally go through a person thinking
you know the average user to all the
different average users it were what do
they all come to systematic sites do and
you'll see that our site you know in
that way it's physically collapse there
is a certain essential people who are
after a specific piece of the video or a
piece of information they
what is and they're willing to type that
in to find it well if you go there's
also a whole bunch of people don't
really know do you want to drop browse
and entertainment console or ransom
toppy story today whatever I mean
provide them as well so I think you
don't search in the difference becomes
overly simplistic searchers has gone
after the dream of finding self you is
so shocked and but the next way it's
actually a lot more complex than that
and that's important things very might
be still use the surgery next logical
it's all about search I believe but you
can have very different incidents of
energy in a good example it's on to
something on the fact that they have
this concept of to look she does when
you are buying something research and
policy very separate things so here that
that's where you search helps you find
information how you access that
technology can contain quite possibly
favor borra in terms of our interface
certainly with a name like simply hired
I feel compelled to say that
simplicities are the very first thing
that we pay attention to and I think the
effort that we've made us to really look
at what the user really wants to
accomplish at the end and to be able to
use a very directed interface to get
them to that so obviously when you go to
our home page you'll see that in fact
it's a very very simple interface very
Google esque if you will because we
believe the users coming to our site to
accomplish a very specific task
efficiency of the interface is the other
aspect of this is very important to us
when you have a database of jobs for
example that's on having them find an
efficient way to get down to something
they really care about is important so
for example our filtering interface I
would venture to say is the deepest on
the web you can search jobs by the size
of company the number of years of
experience on the job lately you can
search it by whether the company's dog
friendly so there's all sorts of
different ways you can drill down
literally with a few clicks and that
efficiency is very very critical to us
the third area I would highlight is
is contextually integrated and what I
mean by that is that if you're in the
middle of actually searching for jobs
and you want other relevant information
you ought to be able to find it that's
why next to every company name there's a
link where you can see background
company information with financials and
a link to the site next to every
location you can drop down a map and you
can actually then start to map it and
see commute distances next every listing
you can see referral data so you can see
if you know anyone at that company next
every occupational category their salary
data so you can see how much the job
pays so what you have is a job search
process that is that that is very simple
very efficient and highly integrated
because at the end of the day if you
have more information it just shouldn't
take more time and that's where the
challenge comes in for us this gives me
more questions what so you're
essentially I mean what to do is go to
the company websites they're jealous
page is that something that exists on
those pages are as that knowledge that
you have on companies of dr. no it'sit's
knowledge that we have a lot of the
additional work that we've done is to
essentially go out and and figure out
the data sets the data stores that are
relevant to our users and to go out and
get them and integrate them into the
site so for example we actually in this
case worked literally with dogster it's
a you know a social network for dog
owners to say what are the most dog
friendly companies and they didn't have
it either so we worked on that together
and found a way to get that info so
whether it's salary data or company data
or benefits data or anything like that
we will go ahead and do that so to give
you a couple of other examples we've
partnered with care to to highlight so
socially responsible companies we
partnered with working mother magazine
to create a set of filters that are mom
friendlier family-friendly companies and
so that's really the focus of the
companies is to provide very very deep
targeting so that you aren't spending
more time with less time
little tour beyond what you are able to
describe so at become there are three
sort of design goals we use a simple
clean and easy to use it's pretty
fundamental you know keep it clean keep
it simple and keep it easy to use and we
conducted a focus group study of our
site in New York and LA a couple of
months ago and that we were very happy
to hear that they really liked site
because it's simple clean and easy to
use and a lot of companies up put a lot
of blinking ads and others and i found
out that consumers really get turned off
by a lot of ass and lot of busy things
going on there just one simple a site
that gives them the information that
they're looking for now in terms of sort
of approach of the philosophy we use
both structured data and unstructured
data and what I mean by that is web
pages are very unstructured codes or
documents and then they're structured
information that merchants have they
have product images prices and
descriptions and other specs so we're
not biased toward any one or the other
we just look at what does users need and
what is the the best information that we
could present if its own structure we
have to develop crawler based search
engine technology to crawl billions of
pages of documents if it's a structured
data that merchants have then we take
that and display it rather than trying
to extract those information through
technology because in those instances
technology can never be as good as
structured information that's already
available so why do you try to do
something that's not as efficient or
better than what's already available so
we combined both structured and
unstructured data in our site to make it
more easy for people to find their
information the last point is that we
try to have our users spend least amount
of time on our site and that sounds kind
of counterintuitive but we're not driven
by page views or our CPMs we're driven
more by how quickly can we help people
find the information that they're
looking for and just have them go on
their way whether
looking clicking out another website or
clicking out to go to a merchant to to
look at the product there because our
business model is driven by cost per
click CPC rather than page views or CPM
so unlike some of the first generation
portals that are trying to have have a
walled garden of information that they
want you to stay there as long as
possible click as many pages possible
because ultimately their revenue model
is based on the CPM but our model is
very different we want people to spend
the least amount of time on our site we
want them to come back often but spend
the least amount of time to just click
out to the information that they're
looking for and that's how we sort of
measure how well we're doing as a
company and helping consumers find
information that they're looking for
it's a question just question so you're
in the research phase does that generate
revenue is owing when they go to the
Vipers yeah research we don't make any
money so that's organic results very
objective unbiased but when when people
click to go to a merchant by clicking on
buy button or click on one of the
sponsored links at the bottom then we
generate revenue the revenue model then
you explain a bit about it but could you
go a little little bit more deeper into
what is what is currently in place and
how you planning to skillet because
they're there I guess two ways that
becomes our comfort sample of the family
so we uh we generate revenue through
some 5,000 merchants who advertise on
our site they give us product feed of
about 20 million products so whenever
user clicks to to their site to look at
the product or purchase the product and
we get a small cost per click fee and we
have a standard rate card we also
generate revenue through google adsense
so we're one of the larger google
adsense partners we put google sponsored
links at the bottom and when people find
some relevant merchants or other
sponsors that has the information of
product that they're looking for we do a
rapture
Google so it's all CPC we have one CPA
which is sort of a portion of the
revenue but that's just one out of five
thousand margins and it's a fair yet
unique unique case there but that would
be sort of worked most merchants might
be possible interested in as well trying
to push the perform and so that's right
but CPC is a better model for us and we
think it's fair model because it
distributes the responsibility the risk
of the reward to both us and emergent
whereas CPA puts more burden on us
rather than the merchant to try to
convert that into a customer gotcha my
sense is that the companies like ours on
this whole vertical search category
fundamentally our lead generation
companies in our case what happens is
that you have a candidate show up to our
site over the three to six-month job
search process we develop a very deep
profile of that candidate and then we
end up matching that candidate to
targeted destinations now whether that
candidate is then delivered to those
destinations we click or as a profile of
resume whether they are delivered to a
job board or whether they will look for
employer we're agnostic because we make
money in all those cases so the way that
the company makes money is using clicks
others paid job listings where a
candidate can click on a job listing
that's at the top of the page and go
through and we make money that way and
when a candidate creates a resume we
match that resume with targeted
destinations that also pay us money we
don't advertise in our own site today
primarily because we use our own site as
a sort of space or an area to do lots of
experimentation regarding things like
interface and how the system works what
we do instead is advertised with all of
our distribution partners so when the
partner of ours use the technology on
their own site used advertising is
placed alongside the content the
interesting thing about a video is there
you know three is a possibility of video
advertising which right now is extremely
popular to both of users and also
advertisers but the beauty of our system
is that it works perfectly well with
text
as well and actually you know many of my
partners use that instead of this stage
just because the the market there is
more efficient more fluid good area that
we have coming up which is very
interesting is the ability to sort of
you know splice together content and
advertising based on searches so the
interesting thing that we get is now we
know what someone's interested in a
given point in time we know why they're
watching that particular video about
Ruby spheres or this particular video
about you know with the news or a
particular company or whatever and that
gives us the ability to match that piece
of quantum it's a very well advertising
if you look at video content online
today most of it does have advertising
before or after ordering it but it tends
to be very sort of you know dare i say
bland brand oriented advertising which
works to an extent but doesn't get as
far as as it as it could do we have the
ability to sort of I guess bring the
sort of AdWords desk model of
advertising into TV advertising so we're
doing a few trials in the area right now
today there isn't enough of that
advertising to make it sort of as
scalable as it is on it on a Google or
Yahoo but you know that's Stephanie the
future for that kind of all time I think
actually you're giving them in
considering this video this definitely
is a question um is there an editorial
sort of layer to obviously I mean this
just like John is talking about there is
sort of a second layer of how you go
about some filtering that information
but is there an editorial aspect to that
in what you consider to be sort of okay
to put on your side and what you
consider me not to be the other thing is
there an editorial layer after
incorporating yeah so not on our site
you know we we try to stagger everything
whatever it is wherever it is from the
very site Eric to the very mainstream
many of our partners focus on a
particular area you know if someone's
building a vertical portal around a
particular topic they might only have
video from certain sources we obviously
offer lots of filtering options to the
user so as a user you can select if you
want things that are very recently if
you are sort of news oriented person you
can select what sorts you want
information to come from so you want
only information from entertainment or
do any more information from you know
the sort of user-generated side of the
video content world you can also do
things like you know more
rudimentary filler since I Fidel filters
and so on as well we technologically
it's actually quite a challenge you know
a lot of the technologies that have been
used to make web search good at
relevance things like no linking
analysis things like domain louses don't
really work so well the video you know
video piece piece of video already
linked to each other in the same way
that web pages linked to each other or
blog links to each other so we've had to
go the whole lot of new technologies
around how that works but beyond that
that's all about relevance that's not
about filtering filtering is it the
options are there but we either let the
user doing or the partner do it ok and
then considering you're in Google and
this is sort of obvious questions that
Google video yeah there's there's
definitely out there and I'm guessing
Google jobs if it came along or Google
Shopping it's a setup fertile in a way
but insurance if you think about a block
and sure it's sort of a question on how
do we approach this a google dot into
our space and if they did how are you
planning to sort of work around that
what's what's your sense of how much
Google can provide on how you're
competing with Google and especially
Google and Yahoo everything well what is
your sense of the competition from the
general search engines so yeah sure um
well that's a funny question for us we
worry about it a lot to start off with
in reality it seems like we could really
have nothing to really worry about at
least so far google video isn't a search
engine it says so it has search engine
built into it but it only searches its
own content so that sort of it solves
very different problem does that
relatively well but it doesn't really go
beyond visual so if you do a search on
Google you're not going to find a CNN
com video clip you know and yet many of
our abusers want to find CNN com video
clip so from that point of view there's
no real direct threat and in general
we've seen that the bigger players
online you know Google AOL yahoo even
though they have search capabilities at
hand in some cases how it really deploy
those are going after those for them I
think you know going back to point
Michael made earlier it's more about
building not exactly a walled garden but
certainly an experience where you stay
on the site and their advantages to that
near the beauty of google video for
example this all the video is played on
google com so there's a lot of control
that Google can have on the viewing
experience for example whereas the
problem that any search engine has is
that once you click off we can't really
control how fast that video plays
we we don't want to do that we want to
be a gateway we know we re upsets also
about getting someone from the front
page of the site as quickly as possible
you know as many times as possible sure
but as quickly as possible so from that
point of view we're pretty unique in our
space there are a few smaller companies
that have gone after the to the video
search area in the main maybe the
focused on you know specific sub
verticals which we think misses the
point you know if you look at what our
users search for they search for
everything and the same user will come
back and search for very different
things even in the same day or week and
then other players also you know are
basically retrofitting existing
technologies to try and sell video
search which again we think mr. point I
mean a lot of video search engines are
there still depend entirely on text so
it's all about computers going on
reading words that are supposedly about
the video like a title a summary or
metadata and that gets you so far but
it's all too easy to trick that kind of
engine and you can say your videos about
one thing it can be about something
completely different and we're already
seeing that kind of spam happen a lot on
sites like YouTube and r ever and so on
where you know if you can get lots of
views then you get to be cool but your
content may not be as cool as the views
you get and so on so the great thing
about technology like ours which
actually watches the video and cracks it
open is we have a better to stab at
getting sure making sure that we find
something relevant and accurate using
YouTube is kind of having a problem now
that they're trying to put some
sponsored content we do they have the
Paris Hilton video on their homepage the
comments to that or really were feeling
but it's definitely a problem that that
even at YouTube seems to be having and
trying to sort of potentially make money
out of out of what they had in terms of
content and trying to get sponsored
folks to come in and put their concept
i'm yeah i mean i'm fortunate can't tell
you who it's with but we're about to
launch a distribution sort of
partnership with a very large portal
very big us-based globally large portal
and you know they're very interested in
the broad demographic they want they
don't want to advertise just two
teenagers or college students they won't
have to has lots of people and they want
to have sort of professional traditional
content alongside which to advertise
that's what links can offer because we
do have content partners like you know
Forbes or Reuters or whatever it that
sort of thing and you know yes as a
demand for the sort of the garage video
YouTube
the world and so on but that's only one
part of the you know it's like selecting
them all of online video will be you
know america's funniest videos and
movies it's not going to be like that
there's going to be more to it and
that's why i like the idea of breath you
know yes that's important but so is
everything else nice ah so i certainly
would say that that again companies in
our category spend some quality time
from time to time talking about Google
and as a philosophy I wouldn't like to
see us really underestimate any company
much less companies that have market
caps that are larger than ours as a as a
result I I would say that that you know
certainly with respect to Google as a
generalist you know being a generalist
like Google it's very tempting to think
that a generalist can be a specialist in
every area and as it turns out that's
not the case because by definition a
generalist is actually not a specialist
and to give you a perspective on that
for those of you that have searched for
a job if your job search stopped with
search when you entered the first few
queries if I asked you how far were you
into your job search after you finish
entering the first few queries into the
search engines I suspect a lot of you
would tell me maybe five percent if that
and that's really the advent of a lot of
these specialized verticals which is
that when you go deep when you get
specialized there's just a lot more for
the record i would say that Google does
have a Google jobs it's called google
base and when you look at the jobs
offering within google base you will see
that in fact Google base this is
objective is not to create a
comprehensive job offering but in fact
to capture data that is not already in
the Google index that's why Google
departed from its philosophy of going to
other sites and for the first time
became a primary collector of data where
you can actually put jobs into Google
because they wanted to collect
additional data now as Google creates
this data store they're going to have
two choices one is going to be to create
a walled garden to bring up the term
earlier and that would go against every
philosophy that Google has
or the other one would be to open up the
data and if they do that then simply
hired will index google data just like
it indexes the thousands of other
sources of data around the web the other
issue that I suspect google has to
contend with is that what they want to
do is to continue to increase their
advertising revenue if you saw that
slide earlier that's really the revenue
they want to increase and when you face
the fact that some of your largest
advertisers are in fact job companies
that are your competitors you end up
having a pretty serious channel conflict
and that's why I suspect that Google's
objective and jobs has been very very
different it's to capture additional
data rather than go ahead and compete
with its existing advertisers so I think
we do sort of watch Google closely and
we do compete with frugal on our
comparison shopping site because there
is definitely a similar functionality
and a product search and comparison
shopping but on our research side where
we find product reviews and buying
guides that's a more of a specialized
search for shopping remains to be seen
whether Google would develop a
specialized search for product
information like become calm I
personally don't think Google will
because Google's goal is try to get any
and all searches to go through google
com and use the general surgeons for
everything so it wants to be like a
Swiss Army knife you know whether you
want to get a screwdriver or knife or
bottle opener or wine opener it wants to
be everything to everybody we beg to
differ we think that there is a need for
a power screwdriver if you want to screw
a you know lots of things to a lot of
job to do so you know it remains to be
seen but we're not terribly worried
about Google getting into our space but
we compete more with Google a general
search engine because a lot of people
are still going to Google for doing
product research and our challenge is to
how do we deliver even more compelling
user experience and better information
quicker so that user will start to
migrate over and use become
vertical search engine and we also get
additional other traffic through people
clicking on our you know favorites
bookmarks other web sites that link to
us as well as some partnerships that
we're working on and then you have
embarrass your traffic come from and I'm
sure partnerships are looking for uh
most oh yeah the British you mentioned
earlier structured and unstructured data
yes so what he showed us was really well
the content choice was really organized
and he's pretty well organized to be
just crawling so I guess it is that fed
from from vendors and over from vendors
anybody's isn't it how does this
interfere or does it interfere with the
search results and he's in the search
results of the research
providing van estoy vendors for
providing or feeding data like in two
days for example oh so we have two
sources of data is essential that's the
question I can just it's really nice
with shoulders right so I mean you could
you could try it out but we have the two
buttons in the search box in the front
page you know research and shop so and
when you when you are just type in a
query and hit a return on the left-hand
side you get research results and the
right hand side you get sharp results
the research results are unstructured
data from our work crawl we have three
billion pages of web documents on the
right hand side are structured data that
we get from merchants so merchants feed
us data all 5,000 of them and there's
like 20 millions it's pretty large
volumes of data and it includes product
images prices and
right in so we have a separate ranking
algorithm for both web web search
results research engine so it looks like
look at content link analysis contextual
analysis so it's got some advanced
mathematical techniques above the
average value the other we have a
different ranking algorithm for those so
for that we look at a factor is like the
content is this most relevant product to
what user is looking for is this offered
at more than one merchant so that it
seems to be a more and then we also look
at the click-through rate is this
product getting click more often than
others so we look at click-through rate
we look at CPC bid amount so we have a
dynamic bidding system where merchant
could bit higher just like google adword
and that thinks that's one of the
factors that we consider in ranking a
particular product or particular
merchant and our comparison shopping so
it's a two very different engine running
simultaneously and we present the data
to the user in a way that's very clean
and organized so that it makes it easy
for user to go or where they watch the
shopping person the person is actually
purchasing something the listings that
they see are not the listings that you
spider phone but those are I mean there
are the listings that you go out and get
from other sites but those are the
listings of people who submitted it so
our product search results shows
products from submitted by the merchants
okay there is no data coming in from
your spider comfort that's correct okay
we provide a research it length or if
you want to research that on the web
that we automatically and show you the
click on that and we get the research
results that are from the web okay and
there's no real mixing updating its
numbers we're not mixing the data okay
yeah so so is it possible that you can
find something in the semester results
but you can't buy it yes yes because you
know on our web index you have some
200,000 merchants and added a hundred
million products or more so it's very
very comprehensive and and sometimes we
don't have the merchant from a product
of the merchants even with a
five-thousand merchants that we work
with everybody from amazon to walmart to
to target but a lot of times they are
offered at small merchants somewhere so
sometimes our users find products
offered through merchant on our web
index rather than from the product
search results and that's part of the
power of the comprehensiveness of the
web search in the shoddy wouldn't I'm
sorry and then you can add sense right
Adsense which is another source so we
like provide information from the web
information from the merchants and then
the Google advertisers and between those
three ninety-nine percent of the time
people find information the product that
they're looking for do you find that
it's necessary for you to share that
information with with the searchers so i
guess if i go to about become calm with
that the information that i would find
on that page which specifies that when
you research it's information that we go
out and seek but when you actually
purchase this is information that is
submitted by by the merchants or
something that you find it important to
specify on your about page i think that
people have sort of certain expectation
of search engine results as well as
composition
results so and we offer many different
sort of drill down capability by looking
at particular brands so I think it's we
haven't had a it's pretty
self-explanatory our search results as
well as product search result okay so
people could go back and forth between
the two pretty easily but we could
always use a improvement in how we make
it more usable so I'll be a photographer
so there are a couple of more things
I've been go ahead is there any thinking
between people who hope in where I would
be on the favor of them in dec thing or
the result that comes up and then I
think we crawl onto the side side or is
there any linkage between the product
martes scrum masters at the web results
no complete it's like there's there's so
much this that there is no linkage at
all so what web result web search engine
is you know who are crawling and through
our indexing and ranking that's
completely separate from our product
search results that are based on the
data fees from the merchants Vivian both
of any than somebody providing the data
people that is not at all it's possible
it's possible we'll just take one more
question then you go you'll go into that
during the question and answer session
ok so my glide the other part of the
question are all the product is things
sponsored listings yes they are products
that are provided to us through the
merchants that we have a relationship
with we also have to be everybody said
yes they do players on a CPC basis now
defined I mean one
part of the rate card that I cannot be
in it that's correct and this is
actually important to the quality
control because if we make it free and
open to anybody a lot of spammers days
to submit all kinds of junk data and
this is what's happening on football so
the user experience is quite poor on a
lot of the product searches on fool
because again it's free and when you
have free people don't care they just
want to get the clip so they would put
wrong descriptions as to get to click
that would use all kinds of spam
technique so the user experience become
suffers as a result of that and cool
base is another example they just throw
in recipes and job listings and product
results and you get all kinds of
hodgepodge so you need certain amount of
quality control and the best way to do
that is by having a kind of Billy system
where I would be an opportunity where
you can really develop it we also need
to generate revenue to continue to the
best so it's it's a it's an important
issue that we we think that our current
CPC model is it's good for the user as
well as for the merchants on us and
that's that's something that is that
popular across shopping search engines
usually for example talking
come do most of the talking marriage in
search engines to work on the city yes
most comparison shopping sites work on a
CPC model and they have some 12 results
and I don't get that's just like us we
don't get paid right people click on a
travel search results even though it's
emergent and I guess we can go back to
the question 2000 about partnerships
yeah the sources of traffic yes um most
of our traffic actually is is word of
mouth or organic we do receive some
traffic from the search engines but not
significant and our partner traffic has
continued to ramp that's the other
significant source of traffic we're very
very partner focused company
particularly the relationship that we
announced with the news corporation and
Fox interactive media so you're seeing
us on sites like MySpace and others but
still our organic traffic tends to be
the predominant source yeah the same for
us between youtube Danny but search
engine marketing and it's sort of the
same results but it's not really a major
thing tool again we're advanced made by
powerful for us and also true partners
we're getting increasing lots of talk
about it then I'm guessing there's also
a strong sort of PR process I'm trying
to get the word of mouth kick-started
and going back I've never any specific
sort of i'm guessing blogs or any social
sort of iron marketing aspect to how
you're getting your name out there with
explains are simply hard or become what
are your strategies and how you're
getting your your site to be popular
well obviously if I was raising funding
right now I'd say immediately they're
mine my site is completely viral
everything we do is file
one of those meaningless turns to Valley
but notes there are lots of our aspects
to what any side does you know female in
particular is is is a you know just the
whole concept of word of mouth the fact
someone used to the side finds it useful
and then tells a friend they found
useful is itself a viral so we've done
various enzymes like to make that easy
so you know whether it's a search you
like you want to save or share whether
it's a result you find people say more
share you can do not something very
easily and that definitely works but we
found that you know how far all sort of
viral mechanisms you build into the
system most people will actually share
things in their assigned enjoyed so you
know you could get some cotton on things
that that actually plays a prompt links
itself you can embed those those videos
on your own side for example you can
give her an email as a friend Nick and
passing that I mean I'll call you a song
but actually what we found through some
interesting analysis is that many people
don't do that but they'll this copy that
URL drop that thun team on themselves
and set up so I think as long as you
build a very compelling service you know
it stick to your guns on that then
you'll find that people will also push
it around beyond that you know blogs and
so on there's definitely opportunity to
offer more services to to the sort of
fast-growing parts of the web whether
it's the social networks whether it's
the blogs and that's something to look
into more in the future but right now
we're getting pretty good growth just
from straightforward man choice question
them
I
yeah so I'm index well mark I've just
enough it's a tiny difference but right
now I think you go in the sign will say
four million hours I can exclusive for
this conference I can tell you that it's
more like about six million hours today
if the speed depends on how we analyze
the content we some part of these
analyzed walk that the content one very
obvious distinction i can give you as an
example is that your podcasts have no
visual analysis whereas video content is
but even on the the most sort of
analysis heavy content we can do it at
about twice real time the speed of the
continent self now some content can't be
played it twice real times that's in
help you but that's how fast we can
access things so for example if there's
in useful is breaking up cheers on
cnn.com nctc loco de UK in a few other
big news sites will have it within you
know if it's if it's of one minute or
two minute clip which it typically is
will have it about two or three minutes
later at that boast and that that quite
you know that the counter all different
things that can happen the speed in
which the index is growing is difficult
for me to say it was sort of doubling on
a six-month basis but it seems to be
accelerating of anything right now but
of course a lot of that is content which
is very long tail and in style which
probably isn't going to get looked at so
I don't know how meaningful that member
really is but yeah like I said right now
we have about six million hours worth of
content in the index says everything on
from the skateboarding dogs to these
wise we had one more question for sale
yes a new person for independence
indexing a video search like to
understand was the state of the art of
indexing the actual content of video it
means like if I'm looking for a specific
episode of The Simpsons where does that
line you know what is going to be
available yeah character development you
know tacky calm down to the team video
and actually going straight that's sad
man yeah that's what works with you too
by the way I mean it's a tagging aspect
that's going to help me pull up the
particular video yeah yes or no so
there's a complicated question part of
our reasons that the first reason is you
know technology and son so that the
actual state of the art video search is
amazing very powerful stuff and there's
some demos if I had access I could have
showed you that you know if we have a
demo which works for a large archive of
movies for a particular movie studio and
there's a prototype of building with
them and you can literally type any line
any of those movies alone just be
straight to that point and it's very
very cool no you can think that they
have a big archive some really the
classic movies that you'll remember some
really cool vibe from you can jump
straight to it it'll show you every time
that lines repeat it so imagine you know
with something like this a Star Wars or
you get a line is repeated over and over
again you know use the falls you get to
see you every single piece of force
throughout
I get the period this audience might
like that so that is that kind of thing
very powerful in this that ties in boat
you can then overlay visual analysis
there is actually some pretty good these
days sort of facial recognition based up
particular with movies and produce
content because actually you may not
know this but lots of stars like to have
lots of scenes where their faces head on
so that they get brand recognition so
Tom rights to hear that there are points
in mission impossible where Tom would
stare at the camera for a few seconds
the 10 is good enough in altus ok how
about handshakes Asian you can say you
know use the force but I want to see it
when you know this character say that or
this card is face on the screen and so
on so that all exists technologically
there are a couple of problems porting
that to the web experience that you'll
see on a sign like wings today the first
problem is making that to abroad and
fast enough to look across all this data
and that's really really hard so while
it's easy to sort of pick one hundred
faces and say we can spot for those
hundred places it's very difficult to
pick the two thousand or so celebrities
that you actually need to be able to
track some of these have searched for
boats on our site because the
scalability issue hits you there the
other big issue that we have all the
time is content so things like the jump
to the line in a peak in a groovy oil in
episode you know that's only really
compelling when you have so much content
that becomes a problem so for example my
favorite Simpsons joke is one of our
psychedelic as I'm telling chili which
you may or may not remember the home and
a ones and and I'd love to go to type
that in a jump straight to that line and
show someone that particular scene but
today you know I guess it's Fox works
that haunted hasn't put all that content
online so although I could build your
demo with a bunch of DVDs to show you
that in action you know I can't actually
make that of any use on links TV so for
that reason that the state of the art is
very very powerful it combines a lot of
speech oriented analysis a lot of visual
analysis things like patient Eliza's the
reading of text on screens works
extremely well with sports content
because if you think about
like them an American football game you
often have information about the current
plays you can jump straight to a
particular point in the game things like
this is stuff that people would love to
have you know if you're a baseball fan
with football fan whatever but you can't
apply a lot of it because it either
doesn't scale technologically or you
know even more frustrating the content
isn't yet online so that there's no way
to actually share I think the question
was involved how we get the word of
mouth yes oh thank you brett kidding me
so in terms of actually a getting bored
of mouth and I thought I think we were
talking about media coverage as well you
know just after the site initially about
going we found the organic traffic grew
just based on word mouth but we were
very fortunate that that we received a
fair amount of media coverage and I
think that happened because the category
was generally being very well covered
searches were hot for a pretty long time
and vertical search has been hot so
there was a lot of coverage within the
category and the company was fortunate
that some of its own features and some
of its new launches were covered as well
we we do we did do some other things for
example you know within job search
there's a lot of interesting stories to
tell and the company owns a site called
simply fired and I will tell you it's a
yeah so they're sweet to say that that
was our number one source of media
coverage anyway I would go so far as to
say in it yes people like Simply Hired
and they love simply fired I have a
question
for example they're empowering NIH
the kind of tag
and so their time one friend is there
any more more metadata
where's your businesses or in general
search how does that in fact you or
the surface
yeah so if I have to send your question
correctly this this area of
user-generated content is a very very
interesting area for us and so we're
currently developing new social and
community features for side to a lot
user to not only rate and review
merchants and products but also create
wish lists a lot of different kinds and
create any kind of Lists that you want
to create based on the particular
passion that you may have so whether
it's motorcycles or anything that people
have a passion for they could create a
list of products and to share that with
other people who have similar affinity
so you know that's that's one area that
we're actively developing right now to
to offer more community and social
services to the users answer actually
could be just shoot a couple of
questions and then you can open it up
for question answer if that's okay I had
one more question especially to count in
jeans and I think it's also because I
mean there there has been some news
about how sites are not allowing your
content to the spider they're not all in
their content to be shared and I think a
huge example of thousands Fudo which is
a classifier
some search side and I believe
craigslist was side that did not allow
them to spot it is that something that
you come across something where I guess
not often but is that something that is
a bit of a challenge for you do a deed
the answer that for us is pretty simple
it hasn't happened to us and the reason
for that is that people are coming to
our site to search other content sources
that they want to get to and those other
content sources as it turns out want
people to get to them so every time
somebody comes to our site as you know
when they click through they go to a
place that really wants that traffic in
general where that doesn't tend to be
true sometimes it's with the really
really large sites that have big sources
of traffic but even there we found that
because the space is so competitive that
it's possible to build really great
relationships with them and while those
relationships today are not formal
relationships we continue to engage in a
dialogue with pretty much sites at all
levels on including sites like
Craigslist that we have actively reached
out to and talked to multiple times so
from from our perspective I think what
we want to do is to be able to help the
job seekers but also be able to work
with a lot of the other sites out there
that themselves are working very hard to
make sure that they get jobs on to their
sites so there really isn't I think a
sense from us that we want in some way
keep those users there I think that was
the the point that Michael made earlier
so as a result I think we have a very
very good relationship with a lot of
those sites it's it's difficult for me
to say what will happen there I can tell
you for example today that an increasing
percentage of our database in a very
significant percentage of our database
actually comes to us not via crawl but
via feeds and that's probably the most
significant statement I can make in
terms of how complementary these sites
erm you know see us to be saranga is
there some kind of challenge in how
you're getting content to ya know
that she would sort of echo exactly what
was this phone in a sense that it's it's
difficult I think for people who have
some kind of inherent channel conflict
which is you know I think probably
challenge that I'm guessing here but
it's what the issue that's okay well as
to deal with right now in the sense that
they have a video search capability in
our space but at the same time to have a
little video content themselves because
they're part of Time Warner so you need
to do a search do you put the CNN click
ahead of the you know somebody else quit
for the fox news clip let's say and
we've never tried to do that we're
trying to be gay weighing we want to be
a place that feeds it somewhere else
that what is the video you know play
video is a very expensive thing know
that storage your video the host team of
it these are the bandwidth involving
it's non-trivial from a fun funding
point of view so we don't want to do
that too much and we can possibly help
it and we'll do some little thing who is
lot rather you went and saw it somewhere
else so because of that we have a pretty
good relationship I mean we've in
fashion as well as sort of broad-based
spidering of the web we have something
like a tiara hundred explicit
partnerships where people you know
actually feed things to us on a regular
basis to make sure their content gets
into our system so it's pretty good sign
for how happy people are to sort of
spider are happy for us despite their
content one other thing I was going to
bring up was the previous question are
there about metadata because it's an
area which really frustrates me metadata
is one of these things which if it work
will be amazing and create utopia that
walking and happy and run around it and
but it's just amazing how badly actually
know how bad it's actually implemented
in our world the big metadata standard
everyone's talking about this month is
media or assets which you know has its
faults for a start it's you know it's
attached to RSS which works for things
that happen over time but not
but putting aside that kind of argument
I have with it it's amazing how even the
court meditations that are heavily
involved with it for example a large web
company that is a fool that's based near
here heavily involved in it yet still
won't do everything in it you know for
whatever reason and and I'm actually
blaming them for being difficult or
anything like that it's just it's the
natural reality of the fact that it's
very difficult to define standard that
that's both shareable and effective and
well-defined you've worked in all these
different context and that's why we've
seen that there really isn't very much
sanitization so where there is we
embrace it whenever we can't because you
know it makes our lives much much easier
but the reality seems to be that it just
assumes that there is no single method
silent that seems to work for everybody
the other big problem is that even if
you do find something that's so
broad-based and simple that it could
work for everybody do you immediately
get particular with any kind of active
vertical area like all of our three are
you get immediate sort of spam effects
which are very very difficult to combat
so you know it's the same with web pages
you know if you remember the old web
search engines you know they're used use
just the meta times that leads to search
web database of attacks you know this
amazing thing when Alta Vista desire to
read the homepage and people was like no
why were you need to read the whole page
and became very operative because
otherwise people just use the web sex
over and over and over again meta tags
and we get their paid up so we subpoena
the same thing with our thing I mean
it's amazing how you know if there's
something big in the views right now
people on YouTube will tag their video
with that term even though it's got I
think do the video so for that sort
reason we are always inherently a bit
suspicious of metadata and that's why
we'll try and go to the data itself that
we possibly found i will just finish I
look like a London can have medical
questions so problems in how you're
going to write so I think Oh what the
other parents have mentioned we
had any problem with calling sites in
fact all of them want more visitors to
their website so has been an issue we
also obey the robots protocol so if a
particular website doesn't want their
site well they could just put up a
robots.txt file so we are that so it
hasn't been a problem for us actually
the part about RSS is that something
that it's kind of sort of the pool
versus fish to to how you're trying to
get their cut into the people javelins
wearing ankle or if somebody is able to
sort of subscribe to a particular feed
of for coming from particular source or
a particular type is that something that
you offer on your side sorry oh yeah we
do and I think that to us technologies
like RSS are really one step toward the
fundamental fact that frankly I hate to
say this within Google but I don't
really enjoy searching information on
the relevant information should just
come to me and I think that that's
really the place where we all want to
move to an ideally it should come to me
by just knowing about me as opposed to
me having to specify that so these these
technologies that are that are coming up
I think are one step in that direction
yeah I mean we use RSS for example that
that's a feature any search chemical RSS
feed an addition we have a bunch of
suggestion technologies which will
hopefully do the right thing to the
right time and so on so but it's still
early days I think there's a lot more to
go in that direction I think that's
wrong it's kind of hard answers to work
for your kind of a thing there's a
concept of you can go to his huge mall
and just go through aisles and aisles of
information and be able to pull up the
one you like or you could go to a
smaller store where you just sort of
look for information in point and sort
of culprit
Salem not in that color and that
particular size and be able to campuses
it's definitely a question of how do you
want Serj to work for you I know
somebody had a question out there but we
can open it up for questions that is
fine except for certain areas SBA
remembering you guys we talked about
what your state
I'll give you a slightly a different
philosophy we believe that in order to
solve the job search problem and
fundamentally what our company is doing
is it's literally walking into work
every day making a list of job seeker
pains and going on to listen solving
them that's that's pretty much what the
business is and we really believe the
business stands on four legs search
tools content and community because we
are a small company we tend to have a
singular focus and so we very much look
like a search engine today but as you
can imagine when it comes to tools and
various applications you'll see us to a
number of the things in the area
particularly related to resumes and as
you go forward with content community
you'll see us create additional
functionality I mentioned earlier
there's a number of interesting areas of
content whether it's salary data or
benefits data of a company day or others
that we have small forays into today the
the community partner is very important
for us because first of all job searches
a very very lonely process as I'm sure
many of us known and and secondly even
today half of all hiring is done via
referrals Simply Hired was actually the
first we got some coverage right when we
launched because we were the first
integrate with LinkedIn and really blind
job search with social networking and
you'll see us to a number of other
things
that area so we really believe that
those are the four components I didn't
specify the percentages but I think
you'll see us have a very singular focus
on one of those areas at a time until we
get it to a point where we were happy
with it many more so you know we're a
hundred percent focused on shopping
search to become the best shopping
search engine and within the shopping
search we invest heavily and our core
research engine that's what based
crawler based search engine and we also
invest heavily in the contingent prove
our command as a shopping on the product
search engine we're also investing in
the social community shopping thing that
I mentioned earlier so i think these
three arts the core legs who are
offering the research shop and social
community as it relates to shopping yeah
so again I guess I'm much velocity we're
very focused on our particular boat
supposing we really doing incident in
the videos of space the three ways that
we see people to access our system and
use it or through surgery who you
browsing and flick suggestion so search
it's obviously
unboxing time people browsing is eternal
as I really know what one foot and start
clicking on things running rings any
amount of England get more focus and
then suggestion is where you confront
the site design for ski would say take
an illusion over this right now because
we are still pretty early if I were also
but its end up things I probably put it
once an 80 10 10 it's very well think
that i saw research but I think over
time that the shape in general I think
the web inserting more towards that
suggested type of model you know I I
agree with that comment made early that
it's insane that we always have to hear
that the web experiences keep starting
that you know a little box and certain
be much better if it's tips that's our
game push to us so I look for suggestion
between living a part of that person for
a count of simply heart that was curious
we haven't been to your site well but
one thing that's frustrating is
oftentimes you go to Monster of those
places you click on a job and then it
takes you to that company site no sudden
they want you to fill out a big thing I
mean you get around that or do you just
do the same thing in the sense that
you provide more focused information
from other other sites that feed it to
you and you have your own that you
gather but you get around that house
about at all sure that's that's a very
good question because I think entering
your information again and again is an
incredibly frustrating process from from
our perspective I guess the simple
answer I would give you as if you'll be
patient with us just wait and see Simply
Hired is going to make some pretty
interesting announcements in the area we
believe that sought the sites that are
out there today are very motivated to
make sure that the application process
is easier and it's more automated and
simply hired is actually moving down a
path of being able to do some of them so
over time in an ideal situation you
would actually be able to apply with
single click because both sides know
enough about me that you don't need to
go any further and I frankly don't see
why that's not possible in nature right
cuz a lot just to follow comments a lot
of times you go to some place and then
it's like okay type in your
password
I guess I'll tell you that it's on our
list of paint research
coming boy be hard to focus
what
I
sure so so your question really goes to
how much of it comes to your feeds
versus via crawling so while we don't
put forward the exact percentages it
actually depends a little bit on how you
measure because their secondary and
tertiary feeds and so forth I will tell
you that we we expect that before the
end of the year the vast majority of our
data sand come from feeds so it's a very
very big area for us to the other so are
you referring to are you certain parts
in crypto but some part of it and kind
of the pole
at some part of it yes so are the to
know they're they're mixed together yeah
do you when you say who needs do you
mean I'm making that definition based on
RSS technical feed before we say the
Potteries paper whether it's even hate
okay so so by the way when I refer to
feeds I'm not referring to paid feeds
that's that's not the implicit
assumption that i'm making it all art
the the listings that we have are sorted
by relevancy so there's there's no
concept today of the partner paying in
there all i'm going to say so we'd have
done a lot hottest place being system no
no Sophie's for us mean that we have a
relationship with a partner what we get
the jobs via fetus opposed to having a
call the site has nothing to live
whether it's paid but was using a
different context there nothing you can
get a very little comment that results
should come to me
spending all this time and you all spend
on campus can you any one of the
examples guess she wear this model might
have worked out I mean we go and find
comfortable sir I think one out so when
I talk about that I would argue that
things do come to anybody that uses a my
page on for example or anybody that you
know is this going ahead and getting in
free stream to the dr SS has come to
them the issue that comes in is how much
do you have to tell that side of that
destination before things are connected
and how much do you have to tell them
before meaningful things start coming to
you and I think the challenge for these
sites is to say that without you having
to go in and do a lot of modification or
putting in a lot of explicit data that
the sites are actually smart enough to
get you that information and that's
really the the challenge I think that's
that's ahead of us in our space we're a
bit fortunate because what you have is
job seekers actually putting together a
fair amount of information and things
like the regiment so we have a bit of a
head start of your low but again we
think we ought to be able to look at it
users profile that already exists or be
able to essentially glean information
about the use of already exists and
bring the relevant
can we relate it anywhere you have your
profile well linkedin is one of our
partners so once again I guess latency
that's a nice person I've evolution
genetic you talked about the community
aspect developing on the site where for
example in Zuma Braves and Taylor
company based on there
also you these companies are your client
Ellison is there any way where is that
community-based Rankin's on their
customer service will play into how you
rank that on your site in a sense
rewarding them for providing good
customers by bringing them higher on
your site so that they may receive more
quick that sort of thing I know that
your user experience is probably very
fine but then going to the vendor and
working with that vendor sometimes users
berries fall out at that point and they
have bad results and I've seen in the
rankings all right right in fact the
merchants repetition is one of the
factors in our ranking algorithm for
product search so it's already built
into the system we on the merchant
ratings and reviews we do two things we
will aggregate different merchant
ratings that are already out there from
like opinions or this rate and also
provide our own users reviews and
ratings so that people will be able to
look at different ratings for that they
get many different angles to a
particular merchants so that it's not
biased by the particular company so yeah
merchant reputation and how good their
services is a factor in how we rank them
so that the merchants that provide
better services and that's high
high reputation will require the
merchants that are that are not do you
how do you evaluate the services part so
we have a small team of people in the
company who actually evaluate merchants
that we have a relationship book and we
have seven different criteria that we
look at and the reputation part i'm
guessing is from the ratings that the
users okay right there their manufacture
that we look at we look at the return
policy whether their sign looks very
professional and whether it's there
there's many factors that we are working
portion for michael crichton shocking
internet price level the last couple
years I just love similarly between your
shopping features and price level so
told me what are the reasons why
consumers lose your sight in it Bruce is
priced right so right so we offer this
research capability where you could get
product reviews and buying guide
information that is not available on
pricegrabber or as any other compression
shopping site too much shown on the
shopping part we have a local shopping
that's not available in the pricegrabber
or other places so if you want to look
at a product at a local store then we
allow that and it's not available on any
of the other compression shopping sites
so that's that's one major feature and
we're going to be launching additional
features that is pretty unique and
differentiated from other sides but they
think need have one more than 5,000 none
stores you know my recollection is that
other comparison shopping sites have
anywhere between three to five thousand
so that's about the about the number of
that other completed compressive
shopping site so we're very
comprehensive so my question is out as
buckle saying more comes to get to get
dad's keys multi-speed on these sites
and get data and control you see it as a
friend happening more than the other
companies and will get fifa sourcing are
your competitors actually pub so i think
the trend is as i mentioned earlier get
feed if that makes sense that's a
structure data or crawl it from the web
if that makes more sense so I think it
depends on the kind of article and kind
of application who the users are so I
think it's important to take a look at
what the what the user is looking for
and how can you best provide that
information and go from there rather
than just say well I'm only going to
deal with feed or 12 results yeah we I
think in general the trend is producing
movies at a time there are couple
reasons why pizza always worth one is
historical sense so you know space for
example there's also video
they're a long time ago universe designs
on that interesting but photography so
you can't we throw that aspect away and
tiny definitive see mark Peters that a
lot of sites are using these as a
marketing tool or they are true exposure
or their content and that's even true of
you know fairly your web to old type
Thurman so for example of the video
sharing sites have RSS feed you can
subscribe to but those be learning top
10 or 50 videos on that side it will be
everything on site so the working
comprehensive you almost always end up
having to call you so probably all these
pieces but that's not a very competitive
so the barrier to entry to like chopping
engine is how do you sign up five
thousand margins because he feeds exist
they feed round there I'm sorry I add
more more merchants and people started
getting feeds anyone can access between
the simple answer is no because getting
ass potato is only one part of a problem
so you know beyond that you have the way
you are live states that were you played
with the install and related
here in the form of the drop serve serve
the fact that again it's not just IAM
search for for jobs aren't that wide
it's about integrated back with
everything else as well times that
became a search experience in our case
it's about not just reading the night
say that people give you but also beyond
that what Jillian what's going on inside
it so it definitely is it easier but by
no means here in regards to job search
in fact little the job search right now
one of the dollars monthly Tyson
is that they pitch appointments with one
particular job type or description on
your resume a lot of the whole length
with five resumes online at my foot one
that's active and I may have three
different job positions that i would
like to open myself up to on the market
is that a problem for you
Simply Hired for can you post more than
one John type more than
and how viable chance sure Simply Hired
just released the first of its products
that i guess i will say goes the other
way today what we were doing was
allowing you to search jobs and
effective than pull jobs to you we just
released a product where you can
actually take your resume and push it
out to the various sites that are
relevant for you are such as they push
your resume on two sides that are
relevant for you over time as you can
imagine we're going to enhance that so
that you can push multiple copies and
actually manage multiple copies of your
resume so 206 it's very natural that
that you would find more than one
opportunity compelling and that you
position yourself differently for those
opportunities but I think that a lot of
the sites today not only don't allow you
to do that but they don't do it very
they don't make it very easy for you to
do that and I think that's the the
bigger issue i would i would suspect
that another go so far to say that I
think if some of the people were to go
actually use some of these products on
the tail they would they would find yeah
as you said it's very difficult and and
so for us it's it's I think critical to
release something that actually is easy
to use and recognizes that in fact
you'll find multiple opportunities
compelling positioning something
multiple words you don't even have a
question is
tell your search of your certification
is very sophisticated you use any third
party like search platform I know
realize that and there's a lot of bombs
no search at home providers and if not
why do you choose to use a bitch so in
our case there isn't any search engine
soft foam that we could buy that works
for us there are few enterprise search
companies out there but that's very very
different technology for different
application than what we're doing so we
had to create our own search engine
platform starting from scroll ER to
indexing system to ranking algorithm and
it's in fact sort of a new generation
search engine technology to sort of
Google and Yahoo is you know technology
that's already eight to ten years old
and it's part of our competitive
advantage as a company that we keep this
and control it we have a lot of phd's
working on this kind of technology that
gives us advantage in the business we're
actually built completely on open-source
platforms we've had to make a pretty
substantial investment of her own and a
lot of the technology the company
beyond search also doesn't data
extraction that's an area where we've
actually created a fair amount of
innovation a lot of the patents have
come here in that area as well yeah
there is no platform that could be what
we assume and you know frankly would
have got its business doing what we do
if there was already a bad one that did
it making sense so that we do what we do
is have you noticed that nobody else is
doing this one thing well it was pretty
young but so while they might you use
components of technology whether it's
open source or license or whether to do
certain bits your performances are not
go ahead so does it sorry just for
Michael ND esta where is where data come
from your screen value to search in bed
and do you do yourself in debt
where people load and you notice i mean
people tend to get to your side and
click on the search side or the content
to click on the other side right so i
don't think we made that information
public but we obviously get extensive
use on both sigh both research results
as well as shop results and also it
depends on whether the user comes
directly to our site the organic traffic
forces some of the traffic that we get
through other sources so there's there's
a significant usage of both frog results
as well as our feed results use your
drain it stayed pretty uh pretty much
the same so we don't we don't see any
one particular side pulling away so
they're they're both equal ratio from
from the beginning of the launch
cousin talked about the problems of
creating multiple resumes of feeding
lots of here we can actually search for
a job it is also written anonymously I
mean especially in the job market
there's a lot i'm even wanted monogamous
if you don't want anything about
themselves how you've ever dated who
such people that's probably one of the
issues that's going to be solved longer
term but what we're finding is I think
one of the benefits of vertical searches
are by definition of a huge amount of
context and so when a user does a search
on a vertical side they're essentially
saying the exact channel they want to go
down and as a result of that our ability
to tune that search also is far higher
because again we're dealing with a much
more limited set so you know I would
tell you that that's a problem that's
going to take a long time solving it I
think users are going to end up allowing
these sides to get information from them
at different levels in in different ways
and and and for us you know we have a
privacy policy that's probably stricter
than most sites so for you know we're
certainly going to be very very careful
about what we do but at the same time i
would say that even today just with
keyword and location something as simple
as that we find that most of the time
users are specifying their occupational
category and there's their code which is
pretty significant starting point
compared to what you would do sale you
had a Chrismukkah yes you have any
there's there's insight other surveys
that are done in two into how effective
the job boards are and today I mentioned
earlier half of all hiring is done via
referrals about six percent of hiring is
done via the big job boards about
fifteen to twenty percent of recruitment
is online from a total dollar standpoint
do you have a question what do you have
we talked about Barry's birth injury
went from IP protection where you both
think about provisional pads do you
actually a cleanse can you give me a
little understanding I'm not sure we did
file a provisional patent that we
actually went ahead with a to patent
applications and we're filing a third
one pretty soon and intellectual
property protection is very important
because there's some novel ideas it's a
new invention about ranking billions of
web pages that is very different than
how Google's page rank does it so we
invest in hiring the best IP a patent
attorney to work with us in drafting the
document and going through the filing
process so that's that's very important
to us we are pursuing patent protection
as well as i mentioned i think the data
contractionary is one area that's very
big for us and there's a few other
patents but
emphasis on search there's a few search
happens then yeah the same with the city
that was mainly on extraction on my
dancing perspective things square meters
different special some there is also
some stuff to compete for the Dragons
image from the time zone so far about
how we rather than civilian facility so
vertical search is a narrow field every
3 80 companies in space to sense a solid
ation or bottom one winner take all and
also that lead to make the strategies I
feel be having that thing tomorrow so in
the shopping vertical the market is
about 1.5 billion dollars it's a big big
vertical and there are a few large
players many of them got acquired last a
couple of years like eBay hard shopping
calm and scripts of choir shopzilla
pricegrabber was acquired by experian
you know I think it's a large enough
vertical there is a room for many
multiple players and it is pretty
competitive but I think company could do
well as an independent and the can I
toward when an IPO or partner up with a
larger entity of that makes the most
sense for the company you know of
for me it's it's the third time I'm
trying to feel something from scratch
and you know every time you go through
all these processes from time to time
you know somewhere in the corner and
dark rooms founders and management teams
have these discussions usually that
happen right after significant milestone
for cheating on their the other and
probably I'd say we've had our share of
those conversations it's it's kind of
natural but we try not to focus on it in
general I think if markets consolidate
and when they happen it's extremely
apparent often because of strategic
value there's significant inefficiencies
that shareholders of companies love to
exploit and you know whether that's
going to happen in our market or not it
is difficult to tell you just kind of
take it as it comes to you day to day
the sheer number of things coming at us
I just don't see how people have the
time frankly to spend a lot of time on a
night yeah we we actually you know got
into video search because we think it's
going to be a lot bigger than it is
today we still think that video is going
to be the sort of dominant data type or
content type on the web and in that
sense it's a big enough market for us to
be independent and not have to solve it
something else as you know you've heard
it it's one of these things that comes
up every now and again and particularly
in you do something which games are
attraction you got you know you get lots
of attention from people and so on but
it has to be right now we sat down
because we wanted to go this properly
and build it ourselves and do it
ourselves and it would have to be really
the strategically the right thing for
the company and what it's trying to
achieve for us to take you know some
kind of root other one more question
yeah I'm in hesitant a mobile strategy
on your company's once brand was next so
um our service works very well for
devices like tray or blackberry that
have some mini browser skilton and the
screen that's certainly large enough and
a little keyboard that you could
actually type in without spending a long
time trying to you know work without you
Mary keep them beside that I mean cell
phone carriers control the gateway to
the mobile devices and and therefore
it's not practical for us to spend a lot
of dollars or hours trying to support
mobile devices for five different
carriers so our strategy is to continue
to support any kind of handheld devices
that have you know brothers mini browser
and a screen large enough and has a
little keyboard that you can actually
type in something and I use my trail for
shopping for things price check one oven
fries or even plus pi just to make sure
that I'm getting the best deal and it
works very well um you know I feel like
sometimes the mobile space is one of
those things that gets talked like the
viral space does where you think I
anything should be on the mobile phone
we did a partnership with Nokia while
ago and we brought jobs to mobile phones
of experimenting in that area last I
checked I don't think thought you guys
but I don't think about browsing jobs on
my cell phone I just want to be real
that I don't see it so so you know
there's there's you can try different
things you can experiment at the end of
the day simply hire it's going to look
at applications that really solve
problems and I do feel like someday
there will be mobile devices that will
have compelling applications an area of
job search I don't think today is that
day I feel like downstream they're going
to see us do some interesting things but
I not just you know some things as you
pointed out are just instead viral other
things are just not vote for mobile
platforms as much and from a surfing
higher perspective aight i actually do
believe you know in terms of getting
real-time access to data for those
applications we develop but it's going
to take some time ya think we can
squeeze you mobile is that first of all
be aware of our video and today primary
market which is the US you know most for
those funds just don't have technical
capability or the speed of network
connection
anything exciting video so for that
reason it's again not really a problem
is is all right now even when that bears
get fit it's only being victimized via
their lights of devices out there now
what we've seen is that the issue of the
of the network basically content on
phones is quite heavily controlled and
you know generates he can given in
markets like say Europe where you have
for advanced technical capabilities that
the content is being limited to a very
small amount of constant density in the
UK right now there's a huge proportions
one of them perform networks there is
doing all the content the phones but if
you actually go down to them look at it
there's only about five or ten clips
that you can actually walk and some of
the searches are make up that important
I was in pit so so we're not going to be
here it's not something then we can see
right now we're talking to a number of
the manufacturers and sort of operating
system level people in the phone market
to make sure that you know what what we
do is to perform a google with what
they're doing but right now we're
commercially an technically that the
market isn't really dance are we ready I
think we need to wind down I should one
last question to lead to the Provost
besides your own vertical space which is
because an emerging space that you would
give better money on okay not that delay
on but that's some part of your
my phones are I'm visit shopping in job
searching the desert I think that
medical search is one area that's still
yeah he's got them better I guess I
guess I I won't give a straight answer I
will say that that the issue with
vertical search today is that it ends up
just being a starting point and I think
we need to get it to a point where you
actually go through and complete the
entire transaction where the process is
so integrated where as a gentleman
pointed out you actually can apply with
a single click or that you can go
through and purchase the product in such
an integrated way that you're not having
to waste your time getting acquainted
with many many sites so I think that
level of integration to me is going to
be the most exciting development I think
you're going to see even more
specialized verticals within these
vertical areas that you're seeing today
which i think is equally exciting and
from a job board perspective the big
development in in in our space besides
vertical searches actually niche job
boards if you've seen for example all
the latest blogs that are sprouting up
you know on various different
association sites not the least of which
is this one where there's a job board
coming up at the end of this week it's
the super specific niche boards and so I
think that level of specialization being
able to complete the transaction is what
I'm much more excited about I guess
that's also keeping in terms of the bus
or a long tail yeah that's really what
it's ending up to be yeah forgive me for
being slightly facetious but the the
search engine that virtual certainty
that I'm really looking forward to is
you know things or object search soon
pretty soon most things we own will have
RFID tags inside them and you know
finally be able to Google your car keys
which to me
