all for coming week
a number of folks from the sales force
team here from salesforce developer
relations team adam gross is a vp
developer marketing all right Adam it's
my left we've been working with Adam
with his team for the several months now
we would participated in their developer
conference back in May they've got
another conference which I'm sure Adam
will get into coming up that's a much
broader scope conference we want to kind
of continue to increase our
participation there as I mentioned on
email out to a number of you or the past
day or so Salesforce's does a lot of
things well a lot of things that that we
would like to learn from that we really
need to learn from them they are they're
great partners of ours in the enterprise
side we're a customer of theirs and
their their customer of ours and there's
a lot of synergies on both the developer
side in the product side in the
community side and so what I want to do
is have you know how the Salesforce team
come and talk to us a little bit more
about the developer platform about apex
about AppExchange and whatever you guys
have questions with because it's kind of
thing where a few of us had actually
been involved in working with them and
I've learned quite a bit but we really
need to broaden that that coupling
between between Google and Salesforce so
i will let Adam take it away great
thanks thank you Jeff for putting this
together and thank you everybody for
taking the time to come here what we're
up to it's certainly a privilege and an
honor to be able to come down here and
talk to people are working on such
interesting problems about some of the
stuff that we're working on so I
probably you know I'm thinking about
getting ready to give a presentation at
Google and you know what's the right way
to do that so and you know obviously an
audience that's going to be much more
sophisticated than average audience we
deal so I brought about three hours of
material that I've got now about 15
minutes to get through which is another
way of saying there are a lot of things
we can cover and happy to keep this as
interactive and informal as possible and
just make sure everyone gets their
questions answered thought I'd kind of
talk about a little a couple different
things the purse is just how many people
are familiar with salesforce com in
general kind of what we're up to how
many of you are used our application
okay great so what I thought I'd talk
about is a little bit you know
what's the company about where do we
come from what are the problems we're
trying to solve how are we trying to
solve those problems from kind of a
technical point of view and by that I
mean more the developer facing view our
developer community facing view of how
you build applications how you interact
with our platform technically what our
API is what's our app dev model look
like as opposed to the actual internal
physical implementation behind the
scenes of salesforce com which is a
whole separate interesting conversation
and then just finally you know what are
some of the areas in which we're going
to market which we're going we're using
to reach developers and that we've been
successful in engaging with the
community so really at the core of
salesforce com if you ever seen our logo
which especially developers sometimes
find interesting is a big no software
logo and it's funny if you think about a
lot of where salesforce i think in
google are trying to solve common
problems it's around this idea of course
that the internet is increasingly more
capable of supporting more and more
kinds of applications and ultimately
more kinds of ways in which we interact
salesforce was started back in 99 with
the idea that enterprise applications or
things that traditionally existed in big
complex enterprise applications could
increasingly move onto the internet and
if you think back to 99 that's a
somewhat radical idea you think to 2007
it's quite amazing how much of that
again with with the help of companies
like yours is coming true where so the
parts that we've been well known for in
that mission have been around really
business customer facing business
processes crm customer relationship
management and that really was the entry
point and we've been very successful in
that space and have done a lot of
interesting things there and continue to
do a lot of interesting things there the
part of our business that you might not
be as familiar with that I really wanted
to focus on today is our platform
business and that's really where myself
and the team here it spends most of our
time which is that original no software
logo you know our mission wasn't no crm
software was no software so really what
we've been spending a lot of our time
doing and I've been focused almost
exclusively for about the past five
years or so on is the idea of taking
what we've learned from the CRM market
and providing generic
enterprise application platform for
building really database centric
applications but doing so entirely on
demand and that'll really be the focus
of what we kind of talked about this is
our safe harbor statement so again you
may be familiar with our crm
applications and I'll very quickly show
some of those to you just if you haven't
seen them before so this is salesforce
com set of tabs across the top in this
case we're looking at our sales
application and you can see that because
we have three different applications
installed in this particular account
I've got a set of tabs each of the tabs
corresponds to roughly a different
module here I can see all the list of
the accounts in this particular system I
can see a list of all the contacts in
this particular system and you know an
account or a contact will obviously just
be a representation of who that person
is who the company is doing business
with and there's a lot of depth there
but very straightforward the big idea of
course is that if you look architectural
e at how this application is built and
delivered it resembles your systems or
Ebay systems or amazon systems much more
than it would resemble something like a
siebel or an oracle apps under the hood
and then it's a multi-tenant
architecture each time we roll out a new
customer were not of course provisioning
a whole new separate set of
infrastructure and servers and databases
much in the same way that each time
somebody wrote signs up for your
spreadsheet service or your gmail
service you of course are not rolling
out a whole new stock of infrastructure
yeah
I sure that so the question is about
kind of the speed and the performance of
the system and it's an interesting
question so we're obviously running over
Wi-Fi network running on production here
so this is not a special test system or
anything this is the same environment
that all of our 650,000 plus subscribers
are using right now what's one of the
things that's interesting and we get
this a lot is a lot of the challenges
that Enterprise IT organizations have
with traditional CRM systems is making
them perform it and you'd think that you
know we'd have a much bigger challenge
which we do of course keeping the system
running very very quickly but it's
amazing how frequently we talk to
customers and one of the main complaints
they have with their existing software
systems is the IT organization just
can't make it fast so even that as a
value proposition has turned out to be
quite powerful for us all answer that
question as well this is something else
that we've kind of learned along the way
and again this may be highlight some of
the differences about working with a
corporate environment as opposed to
consumer environment is that we um
publish all of the information about our
system performance and any system issues
entirely to the public this is trust
salesforce com I've been logged in or
anything to get there this is an
entirely public website and one of the
things that you'll see in addition to
kind of showing the service status of
our different instances is you'll see a
transaction count and a response rate
count so this is this I love that we do
this because no better way of keeping
you honest then actually just publishing
all of the information the other thing
is just quite fascinating to look at I
was looking at a screen shot from older
presentation where we were looking at
talking about this particular site and
it was back in March and it said
something like you know a big day with
something like 60 million transactions
here we are in August we're already up
to a hundred million transactions so
obviously there's a lot of growth there
and there's a lot of work that we do in
order to keep that kind of application
running in a performant way the another
thing that's interesting stealing some
of my thunder from later a little bit
here so we launched our original web
services API up back in 2003
and I can talk a lot about it and
hopefully I'll be able to show that a
little bit but one of the really
rewarding things as somebody who whose
job it is to get out there and get
people using the API is we actually do
more web services traffic every day than
we do HTML traffic so we have more
interactions from web services clients
than we do web browser clients so if you
look at the numbers yesterday we did 98
million transactions so more than half
of those were soap as opposed to HTML so
very gratifying to see the API being
used so heavily okay so a lot of things
that are unique about the on demand
model a lot of things that are unique
about this new world of no software
where we're obviously delivering these
applications as a service and one of the
things that we're always looking for
ways in which we can take advantage of
the fact that we deliver our service on
the internet and as opposed traditional
software and just find further ways of
providing differentiation around that
much in the same way I'm sure for
example that the great thing about
sheets are in a product like that is
obviously the collaboration you can kind
of think of similar examples in the
enterprise application space one of the
more powerful manifestations of that is
something called appexchange so as I
mentioned we have a whole strategy
around letting developers and our
customers and third-party is vs build
applications on our platform and built
into that we have the idea that anything
that you build on our platform can be
immediately shareable and so that
directory of applications where anybody
in the world can go and sign up for free
and they can go post their applications
that's what we call AppExchange and
again we think about those kind of
strategies going hand in hand so this is
again another just um publicly available
website that anybody can go to
appexchange com
and hopefully more of our strategy will
become clear here where you can see that
we now have over six hundred
applications in this application
directory obviously there's a lot of CRM
kinds of applications things like email
marketing or contract management or you
know specialized CTI services for the
servant support market but we also have
you know things like recruiting or
different kinds of IT management IT
helpdesk kinds of applications and if I
go over to recruiting you know it's
pretty straightforward here's a category
of recruiting applications and you know
we're trying to make this some as
internet ish as possible and provide
feedback and rankings and reviews the
difference here is how you get an
application and in this case I can go in
drill and look at the details look at
the reviews if I want to actually test
drive the application and look at it
again this is all publicly available I'm
not logged in it anyway I can do that
and you'll see here after I fell out my
information
which I clearly should have done already
I'll use this part of the presentation
to highlight how you can get in touch
with me okay
yeah I plan that and so we can actually
now interact with this just like I get
that kind of 30 second preview of a song
in itunes I can now actually test drive
and click around on this recruiting
application and so a very different
model from how a business would
traditionally get an enterprise
application and one of the things that
you'll notice when I flip here is that I
have a recruiting application right you
didn't see that in my other account and
when I flip to that you'll see i have a
whole entirely new set of tabs and this
is what we mean by our platform this is
what we mean by our app dev model the
fact that you as a developer can go to
develop ourselves horse calm sign up for
a free developer edition account and
really create any kind of business
database centric application that you
like and so before we looked at contacts
and accounts and opportunities and
everything related to a sales business
process here I have candidates and
applicants and all those kinds of things
that obviously make sense for a
different use case and so just to
clarify nobody at salesforce com nobody
in our rd organization created this
application this is an application that
a developer in our community or at a
customer would create themselves and in
fact recruiting as an example is one
area in particular where we've seen a
lot of activity beyond CRM going beyond
our traditional base now using the
platform in the new way new ways which
of course is something that we very much
are trying to encourage and again
instead of looking at an account or a
person here I'm looking a candidate i
can track really anything that's
associated with that person i can track
which jobs they've applied for what the
status is all those kinds of things ok
I'm on slide two and I've used up 20
minutes so we'll see how I do so really
what we are about is really database
center caps and of course database
centric apps are at the center of
corporate IT app dev or have been for
some time you think about tools in the
old days like the first green screen you
know mainframes what were they doing
there kind of doing this database
centric apps or or where powerbuilder
and Oracle or vb there's all be a lot of
activity in corporate IT and in the isv
community around essentially creating
structured data how multiple collaborate
around that data and all of the things
that are in common on those applications
you need to have concepts of how you
create a user interface and forms and
edit fields and there's a whole security
and sharing model that has to be
appropriate because in the recruiting
application some people need to be able
to see the salary field whereas others
can't you need to obviously run in a
highly performant way their analytics
requirements there's old common set of
things to building database applications
again and there's been a rich history of
tools companies that have gone after
that and been very successful in doing
so in kind of the various iterations of
computing right you can think about all
the database tools and app tools
companies that were of the mainframe era
or of the client-server era and we very
immodestly are trying to provide a
similar capability of this new internet
on demand era one of the things that and
I'm just going to skip over this for now
that makes this interesting is there
really to kind of distinct benefits at
least two of using this new model and
hopefully we'll get a chance to talk
about both what is of course that it's
delivered on demand so for the first
time we can kind of separate in a
meaningful way what it means to build an
application from what it means to run an
application and I don't know what kinds
of developers we have represented in the
room but my sense is if they're a lot of
folks like me especially in corporate IT
who are plenty happy to build an
application plenty happy to build a data
model or describe what a business
process is but what comes to like tuning
and optimization and carrying a pager
and running a data center on all those
kinds of things that turns out to be
really really hard especially doing it
with the kind of variability that you
get in these different kinds of
applications I might want to build an
application that works for my team to
manage our conferences right so there
are five people on that alternatively i
might be a company like google with
however many thousands of employees that
you have where you want to manage
recruiting and so what we try to do with
this platform is just following
obviously this utility model the
Internet allows is separate out what you
have to think about in terms of building
an application from ever having to have
any runtime implications whether you're
serving one person or 15,000 people with
your application you should not have to
worry about it and that's a pretty neat
trick right this is a lot of the
elasticity or kind of utility capability
the internet that we've been working on
as an industry for some time and the key
thing is that it's absolutely possible
we have lots of folks that are doing it
today one big if you have to think about
how you write your application
differently so what it means to build
apps in this utility model right
requires new ways of thinking about app
dev and that frankly is probably one of
our bigger challenges and opportunities
on the developer relations side which is
we just approach this as a vb developer
or just a Java developer just a c
developer and aren't kind of ready to
think a little bit differently about
some of the concepts then it's going to
be a little bit of a challenge and again
frankly that's where we have spent a lot
of time educating people is around the
difference in our app dev model and to
do that we kind of split it out into
these four different areas and pillars
that we talk about our database our app
framework our API and apex code and I'll
be hopefully have an opportunity to
quickly review these so you guys get a
kind of flavor of what this new app dev
model looks like
so really at the core of salesforce com
and at the core of our intellectual
property and the core of what the really
smart people accompany been working on
for the past eight or nine years is this
idea of an on-demand database in
internet database a database in the sky
and it looks and feels and does all the
things that you would expect a database
to do it manages relational data it has
lots of different kinds of fields it has
a full security and sharing model it has
a sock allure sequel like query language
that we call sachal and of course if you
start with the premise of a database you
can then that allows you to both add
fields and not objects then of course
you can really model anything and that's
kind of the foundation to be able to
create the difference between a CRM
application and a recruiting application
the problem is is that you well know
just like you can't take exchange server
and run gmail on that you can't buy a
commercial database off the street and
run an internet multi-tenant scalable
database that has all these properties
so really what we've done internally is
build a database we use a lot of
different technologies to do that but
all the things that you think about in
the database is operations query
optimization statistics gathering all
that kind of stuff we had to essentially
recreate ourselves in order to build
that and I think you know we probably
did it slowly then quickly right
probably part of that we did because we
had you to support a CRM application and
at some point you realize you have
something that's truly malleable beyond
that and we've been investing a lot in
doing that yep
absolutely
so the question is how do we deal with
sensitive information by virtue of being
both an on-demand service and a
multi-tenant on-demand service at that
how have we been able to get small
companies like Zagat's all the way up to
large companies like Cisco or Merrill
Lynch to run their business on this
infrastructure and that really is the
core evangelism task of our company
really in the industry and so if you
were to look back in 2002 and the kinds
of companies that were engaging in this
and you know classic kind of adoption
curve and where we first got our start
with smaller high tech companies and
companies that were going to be more
accepting of the new model that that was
kind of where we started but of course I
think we're really in the mainstream now
of people accepting on demand and I hope
that work that we've done in
evangelizing a lot of customers helps
you as you enter the enterprise space as
well and I think fundamentally it just
has to do with economics it's just just
raw logic at some point becomes
overpowering with the amount of success
that we've been able to deliver to our
customers that thinkpad needs juice
let's find the guy who built that noise
yeah please
so as you can imagine and the question
again do we have policies about how we
handle that there's a reason why all
that information about a performance is
on the website and if you start even
peeling back are the only on that we
have layers and layers and layers of
policies we have certifications we have
a whole buildings full of people who
focus exclusively on that and winning
our customers trust is our folks from
our sales organization here today would
tell you is an essential part of the
sales cycle the thing that's different
now as opposed to in 2002 is we can say
that Merrill Lynch and Cisco and Dell
and you know thousands and thousands of
other companies have vetted this and
right that's part of the power of the
multi-tenant model is the more eyes you
have on it in a way that right the
better it should kind of behave
ultimately so it's a combination just
the raw power of the model and just the
raw hard work of making sure you are
doing the right things and you document
and you train your customer facing
people to talk about it in an effective
way yeah
I'm not an Oracle expert per se so might
not be the best person ask the questions
how do we compared to Oracle I you know
just best left at a high level analogy
of a multi-tenant system as you guys
well know to use a really poor analogy
right this is a different as excel in
sheets in terms of the internal
operation a single tenants right excel
is a single tenant system of the highest
order it's just sitting on somebody's
desk top sheets is a shared single
instance or a single code base right
version that has has however many
millions and millions of customers and
so architectural II again everything and
how we think and write and operate we
owe unapologetically to the consumer
internet and the lessons from there as
opposed to traditional software so it's
question the back okay
I
and so he needs to own them biophysical
taste all the data they put that
benefits the ipod
I don't want the writer of the app no
sales force to access to that data but I
still want to have to back it up delete
that the skull
so that's August a quick so buddy I can
condense the question down to one it's
this question about intellectual
property and ownership if I'm you know
built both building an application in
the intellectual property that resent
represents as well as the data that's
that application is operating on how
does that work in terms of intellectual
property and ownership if it is multi
tenant system and it's exactly the way
that you would expect that our customers
retain absolute one hundred percent
ownership no exceptions on that data
it's it's in fact I'd argue another
place where perhaps the consumer world
the enterprise world is different in
that we're not afforded any opportunity
to have that line be blurry in the
slightest nor do we look to have that
line be blurry we consider ourselves a
bank for our customers data and you know
our job is to manage it and keep make it
secure and do a better job at doing so
than if they were to keep it under their
mattress but the ownership is one
hundred percent our customers okay so we
have this database but we have something
else called our app framework which is
really interesting into itself and one
of the great things about building an
on-demand platform as opposed
traditional enterprise software platform
is we're able to introduce a new app dev
technology is into the enterprise much
much more frequently than some of the
alternatives right so I'm sure there are
lots of interesting technologies that
folks and traditional software companies
are working on in terms of
next-generation enterprise software
platforms the problem is the diffusion
of that technology right SI p will come
out with release 12 whatever it is in
2009 are making all this stuff up the
Delta between when they release that or
worse an engineer writing that code
working on that feature and when an
actual customer gets to take advantage
of that well you've got a whole release
deployment cycle and enterprise software
right that's a five to seven-year
process that's a hugely slow diffusion
time in contrast just like you guys we
add new app dev features to our platform
just like you guys add a new API
everybody gets it instantly so as a
result in a way we've been able to
leapfrog some of our competitors in
terms of the app dev technologies or
provide which is just very exciting in
general in terms the opportunity
prevents presents to developers and one
of the key things that we've really bet
heavily
on is the idea of declarative or
metadata based development and this
really represents the core pillar of our
platform and app dev model and so rather
than talk about it I will show it to you
and to do that I'll just go ahead and go
back into this application that i was
running before let me just make sure
that i'm still logged in and let's go
back to the contact screen so the most
simple kind of application development
that our customers want to do is modify
their CRM application right because
every company's customer facing business
processes are going to be different
every companies selling different kinds
of things they're engaged in different
ways so let me let me just actually log
back into this in one second opened up
that demo did something else
so you remember taking a look at the
contact screen a bunch of data really
representing an object representing just
a database concept nothing too dramatic
there and it's even faster over
hardwired internet connection but that's
okay so let's take a look at this
contact and I've got a layout I've got
information I've got a bunch of fields
all the related information our contact
interesting stuff so since I'm an
administrator in this account I have
access to the setup menu which I'm going
to go to now and I'm actually going to
do the simplest form of application
development i'm going to modify the
scheme of this application and in
particular i'm going to modify this
representation of a contact to add a new
property that this company wants to
track and so i'll go to customize
contacts fields and here you can see you
get it really a database view just like
you would a nutritional database
application of this application of
course the difference being that it's B
it's delivered on-demand so really right
looking at the schema you can see kind
of the schema details what I'm going to
do though is go ahead and create a new
field and let's say hypothetically that
the thing that this company wants to
track about its contacts is the computer
preference of its the people that does
business with so here I can see you see
how to set of data types just like you
would get in a traditional database and
there's some some of these are higher
level than you would get kind of just a
raw kind of you know Oracle sequel level
you have things like phone numbers as a
strongly typed object that emails those
kinds of things there's a concept of
formula fields that's quite useful and
I'm actually going to go ahead and
create a picklist
and when i do that i'll get an option
just to really specify some of the basic
things so i'm going to call this
computer preference and i'll do mac pc
linux and i'm just going to skip over
the rest of the stuff one of the things
that you'll see is I'm immediately
prompted next with how the security
settings that I want to associate with
that field again we use that example of
the salary information one of my
favorite examples is we have a customer
who sells musical instruments to
musicians many of whom are celebrities
so there's some percentage of the people
in the organization that need to have
access to that person's phone number but
obviously you want to restrict that that
field from a majority of people so
concept of profiles right groups of
users fairly standard stuff I'm going to
skip over this and the key thing is that
its standard stuff but it's stuff that
most developers even in IT organizations
they still have to build themselves the
amount of time that our customers tell
us they spend building that
infrastructure building the plumbing
forget the actual operation of the
application just from a nap debt point
of view is pretty interesting finally
you have a concept of a different page
layouts I'm going to skip that now and
just click Save so what we've done is
change the metadata definition of this
application right it's not technically
XML under the hood but it just as easily
could be right so we've changed this
metadata and really the way our platform
works is it then interprets that
definition of the application and
essentially rear enders it on every
request which is a pretty neat trick
what the implication of that is is
you'll notice I haven't logged out
clearly nobody's rebooted salesforce com
yet the fundamental behavior in nature
of the application has now changed and I
can go back into the contacts screen
and we'll go ahead and look at that same
contact I was looking at before
and
this is one of those companies like with
a guest Wi-Fi is like really slow and
i'm just going to i was on the real is
employee Wi-Fi woof we don't even have
Wi-Fi so we don't have guests wife up so
i'm grateful for it and we will then see
the computer preference field that i
just added I'll click Edit and we'll see
the values there now one of the
interesting thing is right because it's
not just about the database it's about
the entire application that I've now
modified is that same field is available
in reporting it's available in analytics
it's available in our offline edition
it's available in our mobile edition
it's available on our web services API
if I did wisdom to Java on our wisdom
right now I would generate and I would
emit a javabean for the contact object
that would have getters and setters for
computer preference on it all right good
this particular customer
yes so all of the customizations are
within so a customer is a concept we
have as an org so a segmentation of a
customer's inorg you could have multiple
people multiple inside of an org and you
set up your data and sharing inside of
an organ your customizations can apply
within an org if you want to share
between orgs so let's say wow this was a
really compelling data model an
application I built for helping PC
manufacturers manage their customers I
could then export that metadata as an
app exchange package and share it either
for free or commercially with anybody
else so that that sharing act is
something that's very explicit and
actually forms the basis of our is V
value proposition okay and it's really
funny because I see this is this is
probably the single hardest concept for
developers interacting with our platform
to get because if you don't understand
the metadata and how that interaction
works there's a lot more to it you tend
to get tripped up on everything else so
if you think about what's happening at
Salesforce as a traditional you know
like building a j2ee app right we're
going through like some big static
compilation process and some traditional
deployment process that right just
doesn't mesh with this idea of an
on-demand or in at based system or at
least in a multi-tenant system and many
many people kind of come through the
door with that frame that set of
expectations which is completely natural
and understandable but is a fair amount
of work to make sure that are thinking
about it in a way that's more useful I
imagine that's something that you guys
see as well and will continue have is
you again help developers think about
building applications in this new model
okay yeah
I have one question though so how
different is this from Microsoft Access
in the cloud but I mean this is a good
sense of a network scare some people
show the amazing things have access but
it has some strengths and limitations
and it's also very symmetrical yes
excellent questions question house is
different than Microsoft Access in the
cloud and what do you want to call it
access in the cloud or Oracle in the
cloud or powerbuilder in the cloud or vb
in the cloud just not to ties too much
tax that's in particular all of those
things are appropriate in that this is
very much a database application tool
right it's not a general compute utility
it's not a search service it's about
building database centric applications
and this the there it doesn't one of the
great things is though as a you're
really able to bring the full weight of
an enterprise-class platform in terms of
the advanced features and security and
sharing and all the operational and
security things we have to do is to
support a 15,000 see deployment on crm
the great thing is we can bring that to
two people building a database
application that would otherwise live in
on desktop so there's a there's a great
kind of asymmetry there that hasn't
existed before in the same way that I is
a consumer get the full benefit of all
of Google's infrastructure that of
course is designed to build all these
people question
it's not like you put it to pull over
that's a great segue so we talked about
this is the app framework and this is
the foundation of what we do yet there
are two other essential pieces of our
platform one is our web services API the
other is something called apex code so
in the remaining time I have let me
quickly try and get to those because
I've now already used up far more than I
anticipated but that's a good thing okay
we could talk about this and you can
read all about a developer cells force
calm and I encourage you to do so you
can sign up for free developer edition
account to users build apps share them
on the appexchange we love it when you
do that the second pillar then is our
API so the great thing about the
framework is it's really really quick to
build very powerful applications the
cost is it's constrained right if you
want to do something that's outside of
the framework you you have to build that
yourself the good news is we have this
web services API that we love that our
developers love that really lets you
start doing a lot of interesting things
and this is where a lot of the
interaction between us as companies are
and I'll using the very very brief time
I have make a little bit of speech about
our is via opportunity in terms of savvy
segments are developers so we think
those kinds of capabilities right our
are available to non-developers and in
fact there are a lot of people using
Salesforce and doing that kind of stuff
who wouldn't even think about themselves
as developers and that's another kind of
something that Adam has taught us about
as well is is you know you can have an
Excel power user who's doing app dev who
doesn't even think about is apt ups
that's a good good problem to have one
of the opportunities we also think about
kind of IT developers real true
corporate IT developers and we also
think about is V developers one of the
really fascinating things about the isv
community right now and I think it's a
great time to be in is V is you know for
the past 20 years we've been kind of
very much looking down as ice because we
focused on the AP is that our operating
systems present up right and that's your
value as an isv is that agree to which
you can do very interesting things with
those set of API is that exists on a
desktop platform or server platform the
brilliant thing about the market today
it's not about the desktop api's it's
about the web AP is
and how you can bring them together and
interesting in fascinating ways and
again that's where we've been working
with with Jeff and Scott and others in
our collaboration with Google since
there's so much white space in between
these api's and every day each new a new
API is appear fascinating opportunity to
create new value and so a great example
of that is a company called qidan it was
like a very small start-up potrero hill
in a garage in San Francisco and they
had the very smart idea of bringing
together sales forces CRM api's and the
google adwords api s right so they could
create an application let you manage all
of your AdWords spend but then also
track the what happens not just it kind
of click to purchase but it could be
clicked to lead to six months sales
cycle that ends on a golf course but you
still retain full visibility so I mean
and that's really a very powerful right
hugely powerful application that anybody
who's doing anything other than
ecommerce would probably want to have
really strengthens the value of both of
our offerings and creates unique value
for this third-party fantastic that
represents such a sliver of what's
possible with Salesforce and such a
sliver of what's possible with google or
then you can add eBay or Amazon or Yelp
or anybody else into the mix right so
much opportunity that's again where I
think as partners are really focused on
energizing the community helping them be
successful in doing that so I'll show
you a demo that Jeff and one of our
evangelists put together for our
developer conference in may and this is
Lee showing an example of what you can
do with the API and once you get out of
the framework
I've got to think of anecdotes I can
tell while I wait for the pages to load
I probably should have started on that
one so you know in there in reality how
the API is using our customer accounts a
lot of it is very traditional enterprise
integration as you can imagine the first
objection that every major customer has
when we try and sell them an on-demand
services say well is it secure and is a
performant right and that those are just
objections that you have to kind of
prove then they say how do i integrate
with it those it you know you'll still
read articles i love this one you see
like you know some bloggers who maybe
haven't been keeping up so much and
they'll say oh well you can't integrate
with on-demand that's a great short
coming of it well of course that's not
true in fact web services standards when
the whole movement to SOA in general
only heightens the degree to which you
can integrate with on-demand and in fact
makes integration more capable than
other platforms so what I'm going to do
is go ahead and open up a view of
accounts think I can I think I can and
what this is going to let me do and
again working with with with Jeff we put
together some of the spreadsheet ap is
with just some of our basic CRM on data
access API so we're going to do a little
mashing of course some what I really
shows a map but you know it's that's not
very interesting
trust me we've shown plenty of Google
Maps mashups before and what this very
simple demo is going to let me do and
I'm just resetting it which hopefully
will work is let me select a few
accounts giving away some of the tada
here it resets data select a bunch of
accounts send that data over to a
spreadsheet I can manipulate that data
in a spreadsheet at a cell level click
update and we'll send the changes back
right nothing in order to do that what
am i doing in this case we happen to
write it in JavaScript you could write
it in any number of ways pure code pure
web services API interactions it is
leveraging for example that the
framework if I wanted to access that
computer preference field I just created
and tie that into the spreadsheet I
absolutely could but that's very much
outside of that metadata framework we're
now down to prediction ille procedural
code and again that can be written in
anything you like so I'll go ahead and
do this and I might have to skip through
it just for expediency select a bunch of
accounts click connect to Google sending
the data to your spreadsheet api's and
actually there's a lot of cool stuff
that we've worked out together even just
implement something like this the
authentication models right I need to
have a way of this user being logged
into Salesforce we've already done the
handshake in another area where you guys
have helped us is like let's just make
sure we develop the best practice so
when the next six startups come along
and build applications that combine or
take advantage of these technologies
they're using a best practice for that
so again help understand some of the
ways in which we collaborate there and
the spreadsheet at some point in this
presentation will be magically updated
and of course this is actually this
great demo people love this demo and
because it's the great thing about how
you built your spreadsheet is that'll
actually update without me having to hit
refresh so it just goes boom and the
fact that obviously we're communicating
from Salesforce over through the
internet to Google and then just the two
browsers not even communicating but
seeing a result
fairly simple but still pretty powerful
example okay so in the interest of time
I'm not going to wait for that to update
but you can get the basic gist and you
can update the data on a cell level here
click update full web service capability
question there no okay moving on it's in
the browser yep yep and again you know
we have if somebody has if it can speak
HTTP somebody has built an integration
to Salesforce with it which is again a
very gratifying thing so in the
enterprise side you see a lot of
traditional eai tools you know your tip
codes and web methods and biz talks we
there's a lot of just kind of raw app
dev in.net and java there's a lot of
JavaScript as you as you guys I'm sure
see as well so really pretty much again
to get to that 50 million transaction
level there's a lot of stuff going on
every day can talk a lot about all the
different things you could build using
the API we're very one of the best
things decisions we made was the
original design decisions around the API
and unfortunately give a separate
three-hour talk on this actually I'm
nice to work with Nelson mine are my
previous company and I know he did a lot
of work in the original AdWords API so
we were able to trade notes way back
when I 2003-2004 when that stuff was
being developed and hopefully help each
other out in some lessons there and it's
there's a lot of debate about rest
versus soap all I'm going to say is if
you do soap well you can make some
really powerful things happen and we've
been able to by using kind of a noun
verb model very few verbs lots of nouns
but strongly typed through the power of
soap it's a pretty cool developer
experience so I encourage you to go
check it out we have tons of sample code
and doc and assisted immodestly i'll say
it's a very nice soap api ok talk a lot
about that very quickly what you're
looking at here is the the noun view
right this is all through the API you
get all of your odd
almost just there are local database
objects yet you're interacting with them
over soap okay so you people do all
kinds of things right they build these
integrations like we talked about they
build client apps like a outlook
connector or all kind of our word
connector all those kinds of things and
of course the area that I think there's
a real opportunity especially between
our companies and especially for isvs is
in this area of mash up and composite
applications a lot of activity happening
there okay last piece so we talked about
the API talk about the app framework so
this is actually it's something that's
very new to us this we just released in
production on Monday and this says okay
I've got my framework I can really
define any kind of application within
that context I've got the API I can do
mashups and integrations and have
programmatic control and database
replication all these cool things what's
left well what I want to be able to do
is express arbitrarily complex business
logic onto the server on to the service
I want to be able to say that when a new
lead is created and saved I want to
check to see if that lead exists and if
it does look up on the account and be
able to count the number of leads and
look at the if there's an opportunity
that's about to close in 70 days and if
it is go ahead and escalate the priority
of the routing of this lead and send it
to a top sales rep measured by how much
business they closed in last seven days
aren't you know you can imagine we could
take any use case any business process
and create something garbage arbitrarily
complex how do you do that on demand
well what you need is an on-demand
programming language now an on-demand
programming language though needs to
have a lot of special characteristics
because of course unlike a traditional
programming language where the runtime
in a way and really the whole computer
is subservient to the language right i
can write a piece of code easily in fact
more easily than i could write a good
piece of code that crashes my mac or my
windows box
instead you need to invert that and make
the code subservient to the runtime
among other things right because this is
still a multi-tenant on-demand
infrastructure that is apex code it's a
programming language we introduced in
October September last year now in
production and it is pretty cool and
really being able to say now again with
a combination of other tube capabilities
you can really build anything on demand
which of course is our goal I'll do this
very quickly java like syntax and people
ask us all the time why don't you just
use Java well that's just like saying
why don't you guys just use Excel it's
not that we would use Java or I
shouldn't say that's a little sounds a
little bad for job in that case but
obviously there's nothing in Java that
understands multi-tenancy just as
there's nothing in Excel that
understands the Internet so while we are
not reinventing things out of any kind
of pride or arrogance we absolutely just
like you guys need to invent new
concepts in order to accomplish some new
things the other thing that makes it
very different this is a business
process language like stored procedure
or an ejb so in that sense right java
has a much broader footprint from an API
point of view then will be useful here
in fact apex turns out to be pretty
narrowly scoped in what it tries to do
so strongly typed similar to stored
procedures its transactional it's
compiled I will give you a very simple
example well maybe not so simple this is
a trigger so just like you'd have a
trigger on a database in a stored
procedure model this is a trigger to
find an apex code that in this case you
can see that it says on lead before
insert before update so for the lead
object before any of those two events
occur execute this code which basically
is going to go through and make sure
that this new lead that's being inserted
has a unique email address that doesn't
exist anywhere in the system and if not
error so what's really cool about how we
approach this platform overall is if you
build a custom object II build a custom
field to our system it's
indistinguishable from
a standard object something that we
built ourselves the same thing is true
of logic that you express an apex code
regardless of how you interact with this
it's native to the system right if I
come in via the API and I'm doing via
webmethods a bunch of new lead inserts
right you still want this to fire as you
would if you're coming in through the
user interface so it runs at a low level
in that sense yeah it's conceptually
similar so the question is how is this
like PLC Gloria Bob conceptually it's
very similar you're going to use apex in
a lot of the ways in which you'd use
pale sequel hopefully you'll a lot of
things war you've taken care of for you
and the app framework so not rely on it
as heavily the difference is of course
whether to difference is one I think the
syntax is nicer and the second is that
it's running on demand
tommy said you're
but while we can't do all of the types
of complicated queries
in the syntax a simple life
they can't do certain things of the
yeah so questions about the sequel are
how do you query what's a syntax for
querying information under the system
and the people get confused and I think
one of the great design decisions we
made is to do something called sachal
which is a sequel esque way of querying
data there are as many ways of asking a
system for data as there are probably
api's in the world and we said hey why
don't we use the one that people know
and see if we can go from there so
people very familiar downside is people
will approach it with a set of
expectations that aren't true so it's a
query language it's not an analytics
language right sequel and the true sense
kind of does both things and so the
other thing is that its object based
really it's not relational so it's much
closer interactions with it to kind of a
know our mapping layer which actually
has a lot of benefits unless you're
trying to do arbitrary joins for
analytics purposes which is not
something that it allows you can see a
bit of the syntax in here so this is
actual real code select email from lead
where email in this set so looks very
familiar but under the hood very
different
and customers
oh ok
and also like since they already code
somehow possible
he wishes
yeah it's the questions about kind of
you can have a lot of people
participating in what was once a
statically compiled kind of protected
thing now me as a customer I'm interests
interacting with environment maybe I've
installed third-party applications and
of course on their sales force itself
and a lot of our energy frankly is in
working out these models in a way
they're almost like collaborative app
dev and execution models that haven't
existed before by nature of the model
that I think other companies will
encounter as well so to answer the
questions is V zone support of their
applications we have all sorts of
protection and permissions models around
where how you can modify things so if
Aizen is V created an application that
defined a schema I can make that
immutable right and kind of lock that
down so it can't be changed so you know
a lot of those kinds of solutions in
there and in general you know we have a
lot of conversations about well can we
do this will there be support
implications and my senses our
experience has been good that if you
have a trusted relationship with your
customer if you made them successful in
the past if you are acting in good faith
you will be given the opportunity to do
innovative things like this even if
folks know they're going to be some new
things they have to learn along the way
developer that must change the
implication good yes so questions about
versioning and how does that work from a
third-party developer maybe I've
deployed that spreadsheet integration I
now want to update it we have an upgrade
model that would allow me as the isv to
say hey there's a new version or
essentially that and would just kind of
automatically bring in that and that's
why the idea of not being able to modify
the application kind of goes hand in
hand with that but I'll say it's it's a
tricky issue and it's not something that
we've we're frankly still working out
with our partners in the best way to do
it and also frankly it adds to the app
debt burden right so we need to make
sure that packaging and distributing
applications is a commercial is V on our
platform doesn't add so much to the
weight of the overall app dev experience
that you start reducing some of the
overall benefits very quickly I could
talk about this a lot really the core
and thinking about what we've created
with Apex code is just like we created a
multi-tenant database we've now really
created a multi-tenant vm where you have
a set of governors that manage the
execution of the code that prevent it
from doing things that would otherwise
be bad so just like the governor of your
car prevents you from going 200 miles an
hour down garcia avenue this will
prevent you from doing an infinite loop
or those kinds of things so again and
there's a different set of expectations
you need to communicate to developers
about that but net hopefully they they
understand the benefit and can start
creating productive applications so um
in very rapid closing because I want to
leave some time for questions and I'm
already over my time here a little bit I
encourage you if you're interested to
check out our developer site and learn
more you can get every all the developer
editions all the tools all that kind of
stuff is free you can check out some
great tutorials and sample code that
we've written with help with Jeff and
the others around using google api is in
this context welcome any suggestions if
you represent an api you'd like to see
us do some kind of integration with
salesforce and write about it and put up
some sample code we'd love to do that
just let me know a gross at salesforce
com
and then finally your company will be
participating in our dream for Caesar
and developer conference which is
September 16 to 19 in San Francisco so
if you're really interested in kind of
meeting about twenty-five percent of the
10,000 people that will be there will be
developers so if you're interested in
really kind of interacting with people
who are doing this stuff in the
community in the isv community and
understanding customers that are using
this kind of stuff in the real world
encourage you to speak with I'll
volunteer Jeff again or myself and see
if we can get you up there because we'd
love to have you and Google be
participating as a as a partner in that
event as well thanks your time I'll take
questions as long as these guys let me
to find that car
that's all I'm not a sales gotten a lot
of talk about price I'm just kidding so
our basic model works on a per user per
month subscription basis it starts any
you know anywhere from you know $25 up
to two hundred ninety five dollars based
on what pieces of the service you want
if you want apex code you're going to be
at the high end if you just want basic
database stuff you're going to be at the
low end but I'm happy to work with you
to find a deal numbers yeah but yeah put
so we think about our business is kind
of on a per subscriber basis yeah I
didn't even show that though that's what
that's what you get for sticking around
is you get the extra special part of the
demo so we have an eclipse plugin and so
what's cool about this is a piece of
Apex code and when I actually modify it
and break it let's see um it's it's
sending the code up to Salesforce
compiling it and they're relaying stuff
like the line number error is down to
the IDE so the IDE becomes merely just a
UI for creating code as opposed to an
actual development tool and we support
this for JavaScript as well also for
doing things like query building and
query testing and we're actually just
about to release a new version of of
this as well so this whole separate
interesting space right how do you build
tools for on-demand application
development which I know you guys are
also looking at but you can also get
this in our developer site if you want
to play with it and kick the tires the
one out there now is beta so i will say
also this is bsd open source so if you
want the code to the Eclipse tough and
modified for your own purposes we
welcome that as well
so on the API side
I level you are trying to generalize
things as much as you can and things
that would be useful for a lot of people
from the other hand your customers like
Merrill Lynch will who have huge legacy
systems huge legacy ldap integration
points and come with a certain demand
you know how do you deal with that kind
of feature creep on the one hand on the
API side and the other on the other hand
also when you want to scale this thing
up you know scalability and performance
is on a large scale yeah you know you
can't think of everything up front but
but you know you run into certain
obstacles as you go along with this so
our first question how do we deal with
large customers and some specific crust
all have and this is actually a good
time to introduce another thing I
haven't demoed yet which is something we
have called idea exchange ideas
salesforce com and I say this because we
have a lot of customers a lot of
different sizes and we want to make sure
that the small ones are heard with equal
weight is our large ones because kind of
left to its own devices a company will
just listen to those that are kind of
largest so this is a website we launched
a couple months ago that lets our
customers vote on all their favorite
features anybody can create an idea kind
of this digg style interface they can
provide comments there's actually a very
rich interactions that happen not just
around our logo but with our product
manager so here people are asking for
the ability to double click on a field
and do inline editing you can see it's
been voted heavily we then an internal
R&amp;amp;D operations will do use things like
the idea exchange weightings to look at
features so we have processes you know
we get something from big customers
stuff from saw the great thing is as our
platform becomes more capable there's
less and less that customers just can't
do for themselves so that's the medical
right and we've been quite successful in
that so we've never had to build an API
just for a particular customer there are
people who say we need an API that'll do
XY and z can you build up its always
representing a generic way and in fact
one of the cool things about apex code
is any code that you write you can
automatically turn into a web service
with a simple additional declaration so
in fact now you can create your own web
services on our plan
form which again the less that we can do
on a per customer basis well we can't do
anything on a per customer bases but
plus we have to be driven that way to
better great oh sure oh sorry um yeah I
was ignoring that one yeah lots of
really insanely great insanely smart
people who solve those kinds of problems
but I'm not unfortunately one of them
but you can imagine right look at the
traffic volumes you look just like I'm
sure you guys traffic volumes go like
that and keeping up with that we have a
lot of people who work on that problem
and also think about right we add
something like apex codon to mix so we
in addition write the requests become
more expensive effectively as well so
good thing CPUs are getting cheaper okay
hope see you guys at dreamforce</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
