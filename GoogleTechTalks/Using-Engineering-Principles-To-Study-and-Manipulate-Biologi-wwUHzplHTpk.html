the search evaluation group PR goal I've
been here for about six months and
before that I was working on systems
biology in my PhD and a few people from
my team suggested giving a small talk to
describe what I was only for coming to
Google and I decided to sign up for a
tactic so hopefully you'll find it
interesting and if you have similar
interests please talk to me afterwards
to it I'm very curious to find out who
here has worked on similar stuff and
with that let's please get the recording
started so the times with the types of
systems that I have been interested in
our cellular systems that perform very
logical functions mostly using networks
very complex networks of genes and
proteins inside of cells and to give you
a few examples I have two videos here
Davidi on the left I also have to speak
here in the microphone just because of
the recording sorry but the video on the
left here shows a neutrophil in human
body and you will see chase down for any
beta a bacterial it surrounded by red
blood cells and the remarkable thing is
that it's continuously sensing its
environment and is able to follow the
bacteria very very well on delete
eventually catches it and destroys it
which is a good thing for us
and this video was taking in the 50s
which I find pretty amazing too so there
you go we got the bacteria and and then
the video on the right shows another
type of bacteria e.coli and they tend to
perform a biased random walk in space to
an average find the regions where they
have the highest concentration of
nutrients and the way they do that is
that they have a bunch of filaments that
you can see here so here's one sell
these the cell body and these are the
elements and when the filaments turn in
one direction the cells move forward and
when they turn in the other direction
the cells stumble and choose a
completely random direction to continue
moving in but the cell has a way to tune
the frequency of the tumbling with
respect to the forward motion to an
average check and find the region in
space at the best for them so here
you'll see them do that a bit the cell
here is stuck what the others are moving
and these videos make clear i hope that
sells really are dynamical systems are
continuously sensing information from
their environment their processing it in
very sensible ways and responding to it
by regulating important functions such
as south movement in these videos that
you saw but also graduate and important
physiological variables like temperature
pressure gradients and so on and the
goals of these field of systems biology
is to really understand the system
behavior based on the component that we
know exists and make up a system and to
eventually engineer desistance to
perform functions that we want them to
to do in the last few decades biology
has been accumulating a best amount of
data so for the important systems either
in humans or in other organisms we know
many of the proteins that are involved
some of the connections between them but
still there's no system way to bring all
the knowledge that we have and really be
able to predict what the system actually
does and what function it serves or how
to modify to make it do something else
these systems are very complex so the
graph here on the right shows protein
network for a given organism so each
node corresponds to one protein and
there's thousands of
and all the links correspond to known
interactions between them but the data
is noisy it's typically very limited
there's no time series or anything is
mostly steady-state data and
additionally there's many levels of
organization starting from the molecular
level cellular level the tissue level
the organ level and the organism level
and we don't have a good way to bridge
all these hierarchies at this point and
there's clearly a very tremendous impact
for being able to understand manipulated
systems not only to learn about
fundamental biological processes like
the cell cycle in which all of our cells
grow and divide in a good way for
example without copying more DNA than
they should and thanks i would and this
will hopefully lead to many
breakthroughs in human treatments either
by a gene therapy or even engineering
biosensors or generating organisms that
will help us process some resources like
cellulose into fuels and other useful
chemicals and there's people right now
working on these types of things so it's
a very hot topic at the moment this is
an example of some goats that were
engineered by genzyme to manufacture
some drug you can find them online so
again there's very few examples at this
point where we have been able to
successfully engineer biological systems
to perform very useful things and we're
still at a very early phase in this
journey and at this point the field is
extremely interdisciplinary there's
biologists obviously there's physicists
there are some engineers mathematicians
and it's really unclear at this point
which of the approaches is going to
yield insights into how these systems
work and how to manipulate them my
background is in electrical engineering
and applied mathematics and of course I
believe that some of the tools we do we
user will hopefully contribute something
to understanding these biological
systems and in this total tell you about
some of my experiences in some in an
experimental project where we study the
system in yeast and also some more
mathematical tools that we've developed
to try to work with these systems and
understand the different phenomena
batter I also conclude with some future
research directions that people are
taking at the moment so
budding yeast is important to study
because in many cases where it's very
easy to handle yet it is remarkably
similar to human cells in many ways so
the system that I studied for example
has one protein the main protein in the
system which is very similar to protein
p53 in humans which is known to be
involved in cancer and the cell cycle so
the hope is that by stalling simpler
systems we can actually learn about
ourselves and come up with insights for
healthcare and a bunch of other things
so these cells are about five to ten
microns in diameter and they divide
almost every 90 minutes which is nice
they're also very friendly to us we use
them to make beer wine and want to
follow things so the system that I
studied and regulates the pressure
gradient across the cell membrane it
turns out that the cell membrane of a
yeast cell is semipermeable meaning that
small molecules can go through passively
through diffusion but larger molecules
called Osmos cannot degenerate
concentration of also osmoles inside of
the cell and there's another
concentration outside of the cell which
results in a pressure gradient across a
membrane which normally drives water
flow into the cell because internal
concentration is typically higher so
this causes the cell membrane to stretch
that's why the cells around and bulky
and failure to regulate this gradient
pretty much completely disrupts the cell
cycle and the cells cannot grow under
this pressure gradient is intact
unfortunately 4g cells in comparison to
the other cells that I show you the
beginning they can't move yet they're
subjected to external changes in
osmolarity therefore they must have a
system to regulate the internal
osmolarity and it turns out they do this
by what's called a hog one signaling
pathway I'll show you a diagram in a
little while and eventually so the input
signal is the external molarity and
eventually the system results in
adjustments in the glycerol production
which is a molecule that the cells used
to regulate internal osmolarity so the
initial goals of this project was to
first understand the system behavior and
then to try to understand what parts of
the system architecture are responsible
for its main function and hopefully that
will become clear so
this is a diagram of the system it's a
simplified diagram already so and this
is typical of many biological systems of
interest they have again many proteins
that are involved the input signal is
here osmotic stress external
concentration of Ozma late and this
leads to a sequence of chemical
reactions involving many proteins
eventually leading to this protein
called hog one going from the cytoplasm
into the nucleus of the cell in the cell
nucleus this protein how one interact
with many other proteins which
eventually lead to the new production of
enzymes that regulated literal
production and standard approaches in
the field gather all the knowledge about
the system and they write down
differential equations nonlinear
differential equations for the
concentrations of each of the components
so even for this tiny module here the
authors of this paper a pretty good
paper ended up with all these many
equations now the problem with this is
that the data is very noisy and is very
limited so estimating the vast number of
parameters based on the data is very
tricky and also when you put all the
equations together it's also very hard
to see what the function of the system
is sorry go ahead do you see how you get
better for that it's very tricky
normally measurements tend to be steady
state and averages across the whole
population what we've done is develop
some technique to actually get
single-cell time series by monitoring
the localization of this protein pretty
much what you'll see that so yeah
instead of doing this approach which is
again typical in the field we decide to
take more of an electrical engineering
approach you know where you have a
complicated circuit you grab an
oscilloscope you feed a bunch of
different time-varying inputs you
measure the time bring out put some
based on that you get some rough idea of
what the system is going so in this case
we chose the input it's clear we chose a
few signals that we thought were
meaningful output so the amount of
glycerol the localization of this
protein hug one and the volume of the
cell which is a proxy for the pressure
gradient across the membrane and this is
a more detailed biological diagram well
an abstract and abstract a diagram
compared to the previous one I showed
you and this is already you need to know
for this talk so essentially you have an
external pressure that's
linear function of the concentration of
Ozma's outside of the cell you have an
internal pressure and there's a protein
in the cell membrane that senses changes
in this pressure gradient and in
response to that starts a sequence of
chemical reactions known as
phosphorylation events and the last
protein in the Indies cascade of
information flow gets two phosphate
groups added and when that happens it
goes from the cytoplasm into the nucleus
where it regulates an increased
production of glycerol and additionally
there are hog when independent factors
like channels in the cell membrane that
open and close in response to changes of
the pressure gradient that eventually
also lead to the accumulation of
internal glycerol so drawing an
abstracted engineering diagram of the
same process looks as follows you have
the system input U of T and then you
have a protein in the memory that
measures the difference that gets fed
into the cell signaling box which
corresponds to the cascade here and
resulting in phosphorylated hug and then
hog and the hog independent mechanisms
both serve as inputs to please read
production and this is what closes a
feedback loop so you can see here that
there is at least two very basic
negative feedback loops one that goes
through hog one and the other one that
is independent of hog one measuring the
system is very tricky what we did here
is came up with a fluidic device where
that has a chamber with fluid from one
of two types and going over cells stock
onto the slide be as some chemical so we
have a bunch of cells are stuck here and
then we have a computer that controls
evolved which regulates which of the two
inputs we're sensing and we can use it
to construct different time-varying
inputs such as square waves or just step
in boots in order to measure the cell
dynamics we there are a bunch of very
neat biological tricks you can do that
take forever to make work but they do
work eventually and so we tag we modify
the DNA sequence of this protein hug one
by adding a segment that gets converted
into a protein yfp the jello thing here
that emits a signal only when excited at
a certain frequency so without
disrupting the protein function so when
use a microscope and you shine light
that these frequency in the microscope
you get a sense for how this protein is
local
is within the cell additionally to know
where the nucleus was we added another
Tiger to a protein that's found on in
the nuclear membrane and this is the
type of data that we get it's not as
exciting as the first two because you
saw because I explained that G cells can
move very well so and we had them stuck
in the experiment but this shows the
response to a step input of salt that
was the Osmo we used for it for the
experiments and the one on the left is
just phase contrast microscopy each
little circle essl and what you will
hopefully see that the volume decreases
very quickly open edition of salt and
then over the course of the experiment
the cells resume growth again so there
the volume decrease the notes growing
slowly back again and the video on the
right shows the localization of this
protein how one so that's how it looks
at the start of the experiment with when
the cells are happy and it's pretty much
found in the whole cell and you will see
that shortly after salt comes into the
system hog one concentrates in a little
part of the cell that's actually the
nucleus which we can see with another
image that I'm not showing now and then
eventually the localization of hog
relaxes to something similar to what we
had at the beginning of the experiment
before the input was put and so I wrote
some scripts to extract quantitative
signals from each of the cells in the
experiments we defined first the raw
signal which is the pixel average of the
intensity in the nucleus over the pixel
average in the intensity of the whole
cell and there's a phenomenon in this
when you uses microscopy whereby the
intensity of the images decreases
exponentially the number of images that
you take because the protein tags that
you put get degraded every time you
excite them so in order to correct for
this effect at least a first order we
then actually track relative changes
from that so by taking the ratio we get
rid of these effects to first order and
so the plots that you will see are
actually percentage changes from the
baseline nuclear enrichment of this
protein and the first experiment we did
was to subject the system to square
waves of different freak
and if any of you are familiar with the
standard engineering tools from Systems
Theory linear Systems Theory then you'll
recognize this is the bode plot of the
system and also if you have a basic
background in this and you by just
looking at this plot you can already see
many things you can tell for example
that if the system is linear and time
invariant which it's not but just as a
as a thought exercise a very useful one
you would know that the Laplace
transform of its impulse response will
have two poles at the frequency with the
slope changes here and you would also
know that the system has a single 0 at 0
why is that interesting it's interesting
for various reasons but I think the most
interesting one is that you can then
apply another very useful result the
final value theorem which tells you what
the steady state level will be for an
input response of a given magnitude and
that's obtained by simply evaluating
this dysfunction at s equal 0 at the
frequencies here to get the DC offset x
the gain of the input by the the
magnitude of the input so because it is
proportional to us then that tells you
that the steady state is 0 regardless of
the inputs so it doesn't matter what
type of step input you'll have this
would predict that the steady state will
always be the same as the initial value
and that's actually a very hard function
to get to if you want to construct it so
then we went and measured the actual
step response of the system and here's
what we got so yes this is a start level
this is a steady state level in response
to a step and they are the same like the
linear analysis predicted it had no
reason of holding because they seem is
nonlinear but it still does the solid
line here corresponds to the average
over all cells in an experiment the
shaded region corresponds to the mean
plus 1 standard deviation and so it
corresponds to the cell-to-cell
variability within an experiment and the
jagged traces correspond to three cell
responses single cell responses you can
we can also measure the relative changes
in the volume and essentially as soon as
you add salt the volume decreases very
quickly within seconds and then over the
course of the experiment it recovers and
it actually crosses the initial level
which means that at this point
the cells are have a healthy enough
pressure gradient across a membrane that
they can grow and divide like they were
at the beginning of the experiment so
this is another plot that tries to
summarize the main system behavior so we
start here addressed at the zero level
of volume that's a baseline level and
the serial level of cog localization and
within seconds in response to a step the
volume drops within 20 seconds while hug
stays the same then for the next four
minutes or so haga localization goes
increases ha gets into the nucleus but
the volume stays the same and then
there's a slow transient werehog and
volume recover slowly and then the cells
get to a point where the pressure
gradient is good enough that the COG
level is here again and they actually
starts growing so we went and repeated
this for many concentrations and these
are the behaviors that we obtained for
various all concentrations and as you
can see the system is very nonlinear it
has a saturation effect here so as we
double the input from point 22.4 we
certainly done double the output and
when you go from point to 2.6 you
certainly can triple the signal but
again the most interesting feature for
me was that the steady state is the same
regardless of the input and that is very
important in biology because you have
many variables that you want them to
respond to external inputs but to have a
constant steady state like temperature
you know you want to have a way to send
the temperature in your environment but
you also need to have a way to regulate
the temperature so that it stays in a
healthy arranged where your proteins can
actually function properly and it's the
same for every basic physiological
variable so this the process by which
this happens is called homeostasis in
biology and it's also referred to as
perfect adaptation and it turns out that
control theory in engineering also has a
very good way to understand how this can
come about oh so the volume also looks
good volume all with drops and then it
recovers and by the end of the
experiment the cells are growing as
quickly as they would be short note
the an annoyed there's no filtering it's
raw data and yet there's no ringing so
even if you look at the single-cell
traces there's a lot of jaggedness here
but this is mostly measurement noise
it's we don't even really think it's
true noise from the system but an
important question is how stochastic the
systems are and I one really knows at
this point they are stochastic if you
measure small enough volumes but it's
unclear how relevant that is when you
get to more microscopic or even cellular
behaviors so anyway trying to understand
this perfect adaptation can go back to
another basic result from control theory
that tells you that if you have a system
denoted here by the black box that
responds to a set of inputs you and for
all the signals in that set of inputs
your steady state is independent of the
magnitude of the input or the signal
that you chose in the input set then you
necessarily must be able to partition
the system into two subsystems with the
following connections here essentially
you have a subsystem that sends the
signal and response to the signal and
generate your measurable output but you
need to have another subsystem that's
called the internal model system
connected in a feedback loop with the
other one that responds only to the
output and importantly this subsystem
has to be able to generate all the
signals in the input set so what that
means for the set of signals that
include all the step inputs is that the
system of status of system that can
generate all step inputs which is an
integrator put in a feedback loop here
so this tells you that the only way to
get perfect adaptation in a mathematical
system in a mathematical system of
ordinary differential equations it even
works for a large class of nonlinear
systems if to have an integral feedback
loop having just a negative feedback
loop is not enough it has to be integral
feedback and this is something that
control engineers have understood for a
long time and they use in many
electronic devices or even in the way to
regulate temperature in the house the
classical view of control is to have a
a controller that implements
proportional integral and differential
control and the regular different
aspects of it but we've known for many
years that to control the steady-state
we actually need the integrator part so
this is just a more general resultant
that because it applies to a bunch of
signal sets so the result also tells you
that it doesn't matter how much you
insult the system here as long as you
maintain this topology of the network
and the D system is still able to
generate all the signals in your input
set you will still get the perfect
adaptation behavior so we decided to
start testing that and we do that by
insulting the cells in many different
ways the first way we tried was to
significantly reduce the concentration
of this gene called PBS to which
activates hug one so if we completely
knock out this gym PBS to then hug one
never gets activated the whole feedback
loop is broken and we can measure
anything but what we can do is modify
the DNA to so that the number of
proteins gets significantly reduced and
by doing that we see that the system
still perfectly adapt now the response
the amplitude is smaller compared to the
wild type behavior and the response
takes longer to settle to the
steady-state but the steady-state
behavior is still the same then we tried
insulting the system in much much
harsher ways to find out exactly where
this integral feedback what's happening
and so by the way I didn't say what how
you can achieve an integrator in the
cell so in mathematical terms an
integrator is very easy you have sought
system of differential equations and you
need to have one variable whose rate of
change is dependent only on the other
variables but not itself so the
time-dependent form of that variable is
simply the time integral of its
derivative and you don't need to do
anything special because it's a reality
doesn't depend on itself and there's
several biological mechanisms that can
achieve that it's unclear which one we
are observing at this point but going
back to trying to break the perfect
adaptation the next thing with it is
adding a chemical that prevents any new
proteins from being formed in the cell
after you add it is called cycloheximide
and it turns out that even after all
protein production is completely blocked
the system still perfectly adapts
and this was a new finding for the
system because people believe that most
of the recovery was used to new protein
production and by doing this we proved
that it's actually due to increased
enzymatic activity of the already
existing and enzymes you don't need to
make any new enzymes and then a
biologist with whom I was working came
up with a very neat trick that allowed
us to break the feedback loop here in
the system you essentially modify the
DNA of the protein again but in a very
different way such that in the absence
of some chemical called PP 1 the protein
behaves normally but then when you add
this other protein within seconds it
binds to the protein and it prevents the
protein hug one from interacting with
anything else so it's a very clean
modification otherwise you can resort to
knockouts but when you do a knock out
the cells are plenty of time to readjust
all the other gene levels so you have no
idea what the resulting topology even of
the network is have to the cells have
time to readjust the levels whereas
doing this within seconds we can
completely cleanly break this feedback
loop and it turns out when you do that
the system doesn't perfectly adapt
finally so that means that by breaking
this feedback loop we were able to
bypass the integrator implying that the
integrator so the remaining feedback
loop here doesn't include the integrator
and by some other analysis you can also
show that the integrator is actually
downstream of hog one but upstream of
the glycerol production box so this
already limits the set of molecules that
biologists need to look at to figure out
where the integration operation is
coming from then the other thing we did
was try to figure out how many
integrators the system has and we can
again use the internal model principle
for this so suppose that now instead of
considering the set of signals
consisting of step inputs we consider
the set of signals consisting of step
ramps you can again apply the internal
model principle and that tells you that
the system will only perfectly adapt to
those set of signals if it has two
integrators similarly if the system had
three integrators it would adapt to the
set of all parabolas but in any case we
were able to experimentally create some
linear looking
that saturates at some level and this is
more like a parabola because it was very
hard to get it linear and and what you
seen these experiments is that the hog
one level and the volume they don't
perfectly adapt they only do so after
you reach the plateau then they quickly
perfectly adapt so this shows that the
system has effectively just one
integrator so not two or three because I
would also the trick it has exactly one
and that's pretty much what we found for
4d system and you have any questions up
to this point the things sorted make
sense early okay but there's very few
engineers in this field and we were the
first ones to actually be able to apply
any type of control and engineering
principles to an experimental study of a
biological system and make a
contribution so I hope that this will
also spark more work in other random
systems using similar tools from systems
and hopefully we'll get more engineers
to participate in this at this point
it's mostly physicists and biologists
and so now I'll tell you a bit about how
to model these systems that's also very
tricky question so it's coming from the
other end suppose that you know all the
molecules involved and all the
parameters what types of equations are
you write down to understand the
dynamics of the systems and it turns out
that there's two very important
parameters that determine the type of
model that you need there's a mixing
rate mostly diffusion if you have a
system where the fusion is very slow
then you will have spatial gradients in
the concentrations of rice so you will
need to account for those gradients as a
function of space similarly the system
is small then you need to account for
stochastic effects because reactions
only occur when two molecules diffusing
at random collide with a high enough
energy to actually react and at this
point it's unlikely how small a system
needs to be for stochastic effects to be
important and it's also unclear how
slowly fusion has to be in order to
include spatial gradients and it's very
tricky to measure any of these things so
it's very tricky to also just measure it
first and then see what you need to do
so most people work at this point in the
regime that here the simplest one
where you have fast mixing so no spatial
gradients and the systems are large
enough that they'll deterministic but we
don't really know that the systems are
large enough for it to be deterministic
is just that this is the simplest
modeling framework that we have and
people pretty much just know how to work
with this framework because even this
framework is already kind of complicated
you have a set of coupled nonlinear
differential equations and a bunch of
parameters so you can use these simple
approach to even start to understand how
signal processing can occur within cells
so there's many motifs that are present
in many different biological systems and
this is one of them you have a protein
that can be inactive or active and it
switches between the two states as a
function of the concentrations of two
enzymes typically one of which is
changing as a function of time e 1 so
this is the input and there's many
general tools for this framework a very
useful one is a technique based on
singular perturbation theory for
separation of time scales so normally to
model the concentrations of the system
you would need three differential
equations nonlinear but after separation
of time scales you can obtain a reduced
model that looks like this for a single
variable and then you can actually
analytically understand the behavior of
the single equation because there's many
techniques to do that and then people
have found they have studied this for
decades too and they had found already
that that steady state for example the
system can behave in very different ways
in one case the system output first
doesn't increase at all as a function of
the input until you cross a threshold at
which point it completely saturates so
in a sense these digitizes the signal
and they have also found this other
regime that's more hyperbolic and they
were hypothesizing that for analog
transmission of signals the cells
probably wanted the system to be in this
other regime it turns out that by
looking more carefully at the separation
of time skills and at the different
possible behaviors we see that the
parameter space there's four constants
k1 small k 1 by k 1 and similarly for k2
are pretty evenly divided into four
regimes so there's two new ones and in
particular the server gene that's linear
not only
steady state but also in the dynamics on
the saturation is reached and of course
you know as engineers do we know that if
we want to transmit analog signals
faithfully we want to be in a linear
regime so cells may actually be using
this regime to transmit analog signals
not the one here but again we don't
understand when to include stochastic
effects and the main reason for that is
complexity that the model becomes
significantly more complex so other
research directions involve grabbing the
complicated stochastic model here and
developing some model reduction tools to
make it as useful indestructible as a
simpler one that's based on mass action
kinetics which ignores situations and I
did a few projects in this area so the
standard simple model looks like this
you have a state vector of
concentrations so we have n species in
your system you have n entries in this
vector mu and the derivatives of these
concentrations are a function of a
matrix as the stoichiometry matrix which
tells you how much each species changes
with each type of reaction that can
occur in the system and then you have a
rate of reaction rate whose entries are
nonlinear functions of the state
variables so that's the simple model
when people work with the probabilistic
model that includes stochastic effects
then you end up with a discrete state
continuous time Markov chain model with
the following Kolmogorov equation so you
have an equation that tells you have the
joint probability distribution of
molecule numbers X so this vector
molecule numbers changes as a function
of time and you have L different
reactions of the system reaction l
little L changing the state by SL so
this is standard Markov chain equation
but the problem is i mention ality here
you have easily tens of variables each
of which can have from zero to thousands
of molecules so the number of states
quickly explodes and I don't know that
even here at Google will be able to
solve it confidentially so people tend
to do monte carlo it's very computer
intensive but instead of doing that
because you can really do any analytical
work with monte carlo you just sort of
like integrate it and see what you get
we came up with a moment truncation
approach so we derived the
exact equations for the evolution of the
means and the matrix the matrix of
variances and covariances in the system
and it turns out that because the
probability transition rates in these
functions a are nonlinear functions of
the exes the evolution of a moment of
degree n of the distribution always
depends on higher order moments so you
end up getting an infinite system you
approximate it by truncating it in
different ways so here we did the
probably the dumbest way of simply
assuming that central moments higher
than 2 are 0 which will be true for
example if the underlying distribution
would be a multivariate normal but
there's many other approaches that
people have tried and you end up with
these very tractable equations for the
revolution this is almost a Lyapunov
equation and people in control Z are
very familiar with these equations and
know how to work with and very well it's
very easy for computation to and from
the medical integration and then this is
the equation for the mean that we get
where it looks pretty much like the
other equation for the simple framework
but it has an additional term which
incorporates the effects of the
variances and covariances of
fluctuations in the behavior of the mean
and it turns out that this can make a
very significant impact also having the
equations in this form helps you very
neatly see the connection between the
more complicated framework and the
simpler one so Omega is the system
volume suppose that we take the limit as
we make the system larger so this going
to infinity while keeping the
concentrations constant this is standard
a limit to take in statistical mechanics
when you do that this term goes to 0 and
the only terms that remain for the
variance equation are the ones here
where m is actually the Jacobian of the
deterministic system it is very often
the case the DJ cobian has all its
eigenvalues with real parts that are
negative and therefore when you
integrate this equation over time this
converges to 0 so the fluctuations all
go to 0 in the limit in the macroscopic
limit and this term is such I don't show
the formula here that it also goes to 0
when the matrix of vengeance and
communities is here therefore in the
large volume limit you can see
neatly have this system converges to
this the equations that everyone use
that are macroscopic and then when you
simulate it in a variety of systems you
can see that the behavior you obtained
from these approximate equations is much
much closer to the Monte Carlo behavior
so in this case the black line
corresponds to the solution of the
simple system and the blue dotted line
corresponds to the mean of the ensamble
obtained from Montecarlo with the red
lines denoting the plus minus one
standard deviation the jagged trace
corresponds to a single realization of
the stochastic process governed by this
Markov chain and the solid lines
correspond to the approximations from
these equations so you can see that it's
already much better than the mass action
kinetics model and this is a case in
which the behavior differs
quantitatively but not qualitatively
there's other cases where the behavior
even changes qualitatively for example
if you treat the system
deterministically the system doesn't
oscillate it settles to a steady-state
and that's it but when you incorporate
stochastic effects you can see that the
system oscillates perpetually you end up
getting an oscillator which are also
very useful and very common in biology
so this can make a very big difference
and then we also developed some
technique for separation of time scales
in the stochastic case and so again for
nonlinear deterministic systems it is
pretty standard at this point to using
either perturbation theory for
separation of time skills but it's only
recently in the last three or four years
I guess Oh three well six years but
people started thinking about how to do
this for the stochastic model and they
didn't have a good way to identify which
variables should be slow on which would
be fast so we came up with model that
does that I probably want to get into
details but if you're curious you can
send me an email or you can just look at
this paper we have here and then once
you identify slow and fast variables due
to a change of coordinates into those
variables and that results in very neat
form for the stoichiometry matrix
whereabouts of entries are 0 and some of
the blocks have full rank full row rank
and what that does for you is that you
can then go partition your state space
into slow and fast variables your
partition your stoichiometry into slow
and fast parts and you end up with an
approximate equation for the Joint
Distribution of only the slow variables
now again when you don't
I'd love a Markov chain you need to
typically simulate every change of state
right so the amount of computation is
proportional to the number of changes in
state over a given course of time the
problem with not doing seeing a
separation of time scales is that you
end up generating random numbers for
every reaction that occurs in the system
and most of them are fast and the larger
the separation of time scales is the
larger the percentage of the reactions
that you will be generating our fast and
you don't typically care about those so
by getting this approximate model then
you end up only simulating slow
reactions so it's a huge gain in
computational cost additionally you can
use this equation to obtain approximate
equations for the mean concentrations
and variances and covariances and then
also do some nice analytical studies on
on that too and then you can also obtain
an approximate equation for the fast
variables condition on the slow
variables and by the way this technique
not only use it here for a pagerank I'm
guessing not but it could certainly be
applied to page under the idea is just
to cluster the states in the Markov
chain in such a way that it's almost in
block diagonal form but there's very
small probabilities to transition
between clusters and then you can pretty
much apply the same type of method and
get an approximate result that will be a
lot cheaper to compute here's an example
of how this looks like so you have an
enzyme and substrate forming a complex
resulting in a product and an enzyme so
this is very common in chemistry and
biology and and singular perturbation
for the macroscopic model resulted in
the very famous equation called the
michaelis-menten rate law that used
throughout chemistry and biology and
when you consider the system
stochastically you end up getting this
type of distribution so this shows the
joint distribution of the complex and
proteins on total substrate defined as
the free software plaza complex and the
probability of that the joint
probability of that as a function of
time the two plots are the same the one
on the right just shows the distribution
from above and this one just shows us
from an angle
so there's a fast transient that you saw
there followed by a slow transient and
essentially what the separation
timescales method allows you to do is to
assume that the first variables are all
are always at quasi steady steady state
from a statistical standpoint and you
end up getting an equation for only the
slow dynamics which are a lot easier to
handle and deal with and then you end up
with a generalization of the
michaelis-menten rate law which normally
only incorporates this term for the
evolution of the mean concentration of
the substrate and then you have you end
up with the with a correction that
depends on the variance so this is a
stochastic correction and again you can
combine this slow and fast decomposition
and moment drunk asian to obtain two
different models but the two operations
are not commutative and it's still
unclear what's the best order to take
when using both of them so in terms of
future directions there's many things
that remain to be done a very cool one
would be to generate synthetic
biological circuits by inserting genes
of our choice connected in a negative
feedback that implements internal
feedback and therefore achieves
homeostasis another cool project would
be to start playing around with also
synthetic systems that generate certain
types of spatial patterns at Alan Turing
very famous in computer science was one
of the first people if not the first to
show how a set of coupled nonlinear
differential equations with diffusion
can give rise to pattern formation at
steady state and that's been used to
explain for example the pattern
formation in zebra skins and in a bunch
of processes is very important in
development as well biological
development of an organism and it will
be very cool to actually generate
artificial systems that does that do
this and to control the parameters that
determine the type of shapes that you
get and there's many theoretical studies
but it'd be cool to actually do it
experimentally and it'd be also very
cool to understand much better how
signals get propagated and get processed
within the cell
additionally you'd be also very useful
to develop model reduction tools not
only for the stochastic system but the
stochastic system with special
situations so this is something I'm
interested in the persona friday
probably and that's all these are my
collaborators for the projects i told
you about bail is a biologist with whom
I worked on the gist project Alexander
is the head of the lab in which i worked
with dale George his professor in EE he
was my thesis advisor along with Leone
the professor in physics and these are
two collaborators in some of the other
projects that I spoke about actually Jay
work with me on the under this project
and Remy on the separation of time
skills so they were that I'll be happy
to take any questions if you have any
how you think about isolating it seems
like almost every reaction self
the whole change of reactions is what
sorry I said almost every reaction the
cell changes malaria
yeah so every every reaction in the cell
that generates more molecules than it
consumes and molecules that are large
enough that they won't go through the
cell membrane will change the internal
osmolarity and we don't I should
probably repeat the question for the
video the question is how to better
account for changing journals molarity
given that any reaction inside of the
cell changes internals molarity correct
yep so yeah I don't have a good answer
to that question but it has been
measured that in response to changes in
externals molarity glycerol accounts for
about ninety percent of the increase in
internal osmolarity so I don't know how
the cell chose to use it as a main
molecule for regulation it may be that
it has vast amount of reserves of
whatever makes glycerol that it can
quickly break up into more molecules and
therefore quickly increase internal
molarity but yes you're right that all
the reactions are also contributing to
that as well but having an integral
feedback mechanism like the one the cell
has would also take care of of the
steady-state so in a sense it is robust
to those types of things to sure can you
describe a woman closely how you get in
oh yes I forgot to do that sorry thanks
for the reminder so one way to do it is
precisely with this type of motif so I
don't know all the ways in which you can
do it actually only no one and no one
has been able to find actually molecular
lee how this happens and it's a very
interesting problem to have that's why I
think it'd be a great idea to generate
one synthetically and show that you know
there's one way at least where you can
do it but and the way that I know
mathematically can give give rise to
that is again if you have a motive like
that where you have a protein that
responding to some input one and that
can be in one of two states so you end
up getting these equations for its rate
of change and you can already see here
that if you are in a certain regime so
if you tune the parameters so that the
amount of total soft straight- active
protein so this here dominates the
denominator here then essentially the
first term here will only be equal to k1
times e1 right and then additionally if
the amount of enzyme plus this rate
constant is a lot smaller than the
active protein then the a dominate the
denominator here and it cancels a 1 in
the numerator so you end up with only k2
times e 2 in the numerator so overall in
that regime that's one of the four
regimes here you end up with an equation
that looks like da dt equals k 1 e 1
minus k2 e 2 which is already an
integrator so the key there is to have
essentially a substrate protein that's a
lot more abundant than any of the two
enzymes that modified and to also have
rate constants Demichelis constants k1
and k2 that are very small to
sufficiently small so you could
potentially do that by toning the levels
of the genes but again I don't know if
the cell actually bosses in some system
my guess is yes but I have no idea right
that is also controlled so by some
channels in the membrane at least maybe
there's other mechanisms as well so
there are some proteins that form
channels across the membrane that open
holes in the memory that are big enough
to passively let bigger molecules
through and sometimes they can be very
selective so there's channels that
facilitate the flocks of glyceryl out of
the cell and it turns out that these
channels close when the pressure
gradients change so that's another way
to regulate the export of glitter to
tell very tightly regulated and also
there's many time scales involved like
in this experiment we only show the the
first hours of the response it turns out
we also measured changes in gene levels
resulting from addition of salt and
within an hour or two you see many genes
whose concentrations increase a lot and
it seems that the cell has different
mechanisms to respond to this shock the
first one is using its reserves to
produce enough glyceryl to restore the
gradient but once it does that it seems
like it also produces more molecules
that are involved in the production of
diesel so that if it gets further shocks
it will be able to respond to them even
better
and having a resistor to what sir yeah
yeah
we have no idea I think that we are I
mean at the very least decreasing the
overall gain of the feedback loop with
an integrator and that's part of it but
other than that way we don't know but I
do believe that just people who have a
lot of experience in signals and systems
and in circuits would be able to
contribute to decipher the complexity of
the systems the trouble is that the
energy barrier is pretty large do need
to learn biology very well and you need
to invest a lot of time doing it even
getting these data took like a couple of
years you need to start by genetically
engineering yourselves by learning
microscopy creating the fluidic device
of demising concentrations everything
doing the software to extract the
signals the software is easiest part by
the way most most of the problem is
getting relatively noiseless data from
the system so even though this
conceptually seems very simple actually
you know the reason why people didn't
know in the system this system has been
studied for decades too and they didn't
know that you know it perfectly adapted
the reason is that they weren't able to
measure it to the this degree of
accuracy before it just complicated and
takes a long time it'd be nice if we
could actually just plug it into an
oscilloscope and then just measure
whatever
