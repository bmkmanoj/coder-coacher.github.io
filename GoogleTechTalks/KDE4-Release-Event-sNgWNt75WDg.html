back from lunch I hope you all had a
good good tummy feeling after lunch is
always the hardest slot to speak for
you've got to be enthralling to keep
everybody from falling asleep that's why
we have have art from trolltech today as
you know KDE is built on a giant
community of wonderful contributors and
Aaron showed you that block diagram that
includes cute cutie how much gold cukes
it's called cute well thank you for in
for me so our next speaker have art
north of trolltech give them a good man
thank thank you very much so yeah my
name is hovarda nordhoff I'd in in the
Whitsun so I'm the one of the two
founders of Joel tech i'm the CEO
trolltech i'll be living in palo alto
for eight years now so I'm I working at
this office so this is a very nice and
short drive for me first of all I want
to congratulate Katie on the release for
we've been waiting for that for a very
very long time like the rest of you and
what I want to talk about today is the
special relationship between KDE and an
trolltech a real relationship that has
resulted in in many great things to
illustrate that relationship I I chose a
picture of a fish I don't know if you
know what kind of fish that is yeah
that's that's a coefficient and the
cloned fish has a special relationship
with the sea an ammonia the sea an
ammonia is normally poisonous for all
other fish but the the clownfish is
adapted to swing among the sea ala moana
and both of them they they nurture and
protect each other and this is in a way
hope the relationship between KDE and
and Toltec works so I'm going to try to
use this remote
okay okay let's forget about the remote
so um back in the heyday of of linux
linux on the desktop this this was in a
pioneering times of linux people really
didn't i use the web they use are the
you they read usenet I read news in it
every day and I could see announcements
coming like like an announcement that
that came up on fourteenth of October in
96 this was approximately i think around
the same time that that google was found
so so it gives you some some perspective
and and every day they were about 10
projects announced and lots of people
who had great ideas about what they
wanted to do and they wanted programmers
to to sign up so there was one such
announcement that I I read so ah the
announcement was about creating a better
desktop when you look back at the
typical linux desktop in 1996 it looked
something like like this actually this
is not entirely correct because more
typically you would have Emacs running
in another external window or most
people they wouldn't actually use a
calculator they would use bc so this was
a state of the linux desktop back back
then and no wonder that you didn't have
any fancy user interfaces because look
at the development tools you had these
these are athena widgets and and at the
time this was a state of the ark in in
user interface widgets and also if you
wanted to create some custom widgets
that was really really difficult myself
i'm an old c and c++ developer and i
never embarked on the tree
of even trying to learn how to create
those with those widgets I thought that
was way too difficult for for me so no
wonder that the desktop was very
primitive so much yes he wanted
programmers for his his vision about the
KDE at the time he called it cool
desktop environment and this was his
vision he wanted our graphical user
interface for for end-users he didn't
want like an a row x 11 UI or a
multi-view I he wanted a system that was
easy to use to browse the web to send
emails read emails play games and and so
on it all started with Mattias trying to
install Linux and a linux desktop for
his girlfriend and even he had huge
problems with that so ah the biggest
challenge that that Matthias all was
that to write a very simple application
just something like this a Hello type
HelloWorld type of application it took
about two hundred lines of code or or
even more and if you wanted to create a
real complex application using these
these frameworks it was much much harder
so in order to create a desktop
alternative to what these guys had come
up with called windows he decided are to
use a development tool from these guys
so so believe me we had much more fun
than Microsoft guys and though we didn't
always drink beer when when we program
but sometimes it helps so shortly about
roll tech to give you a background how
many of you are familiar with the
company oh yeah quite quite a quite a
few so 20 keys are our software the
software company built by software
engineers we're really really technical
the one guy there is this is Eric Shawn
bang and it's me and we were sitting on
a park bench one day and we needed to
create an advanced application run it on
windows linux and mac in torsion and we
looked at all the development frameworks
out there and we thought they are not
sufficient so we decided we have to
create / almond and we had the vision
that okay we're going to create the best
software development tool on the planet
so this is what we with what we started
on back in 1994 and many years officers
today we are a public company we're
about 250 people are working for the
company more than 5,000 customers and
hundreds of thousands of open source
developers throughout the world and we
have a bunch of offices around the world
so that's that's very briefly about the
company and the products we make our it
is a cute framework this is this is our
main business that's eighty percent of
our business on top of the cute
framework we created something called
utopia platform and using this
technology it's it's possible to create
applications that can run across any
operating system and any device so that
is really what what trolltech is is
doing most of our customers they they
actually pay us to create applications
for microsoft windows and and not linux
what's its troll take apart from other
companies is that we have a unique
licensing model it's similar to the
mysql licensing model it's it's called
dual licensing so we are we have the
product the same product that we license
only two different licenses it's a GPL
license you can use it for free it
doesn't cost anything are the only thing
we ask in return is that you share
whatever you produce with with the
community so whatever you create with
the GPL license it
comes GPL and then there's a commercial
license that does not have this
limitation and and many companies they
don't want to write and publish GPL code
so they choose to pay us for the
commercial license so it's very very
simple often we we use this this this
figure to show how how it works so we we
are a bunch of Engineers we develop a
product we release beta versions
actually we release snapshots every
night then the community downloads it
tries it out the doctor and gives us
tons of feedback so that gives us a
faster stabilization of the source code
then for other typical commercial
frameworks which we then sell to our
customers or customers payers that funds
the development and so on and so forth
so we are funded by come by commercial
companies like Skype is one example you
also probably know that Google Earth is
built using cute so that allows Google
Earth to random on Windows Mac and the
Linux desktop adobe is also one customer
and that allows us to create this
commercial framework and give it to
people creating free software and KD is
there the biggest user so so know about
the symbiosis between our KDE and
trolltech KDE is extremely important for
trolltech ah without KDE trolltech would
be tiny tech or something we would be a
very small company compared to what we
are today I can give you some examples a
lot of our customers are in early days
92 to ninety-five percent of our
customers they they heard about us
through KD
for the first six years running the
business we didn't have any sales people
we had a fax machine that that received
orders we didn't have any marketing
people at all of course Katie's adoption
of cute it gives us a lots of
credibility in the industry we are a de
facto linux standard we get tons of bug
reports or feedback so my DS our
suggestions contributions and and so on
from the community that helps make the
project a much better one and it also
goes the other way that we also help
Katie Katie benefits from from what from
what troll techies is doing so so we
deliver a commercial quality tool we
have a staff of a little over 100
engineers cranking out cold also a lot
of support people and sometimes when
building frameworks are you have to do
the real boring stuff and not only the
fun stuff and what you often finding in
free software projects people tend to
gravitate toward what's fun and
challenging nobody really wants to do
the boring boring work we have to do
that we sponsor KDE our developers we
also have programmers on staff working
on KDE Katie developers they have a
hotline to trolltech if there is
something that that backs them if there
is some something they want to get into
cute are they call up our developer
actually the email and we often are put
features in that that KDE need and they
influence the cute releases a lot we
also cooperate on on several projects
phone on the multimedia framework is is
is one of them well as you may imagine
and not everybody likes an alliance
where you have a free free software
project teaming up with a company
because to some people companies are
inherently evil and you know we be
seeing hair things like like like that
and and people ask us to our okay the
only way I can use your framework is if
you give it away for free sorry but
that's a business model that's not
working for us it's really good that the
that the framework is a profit Center ah
because then we have a financial
incentive to work on it and fix it this
has been working for our 14 years now
and I think it's going to continue to
work for 14 more years but there there
is a danger here there's a danger that
companies could turn evil that I reckon
I could be run over by a bus that
Microsoft could buy trolltech and and
pull the GPL there's a lot of stuff bad
stuff that that can happen so in order
for for for for us to work together with
with with KDE we have to build mutual
trust on this de started by US open
sourcing acute using the qpl licensing
in 98 before that we had a kind of quasi
free free license but but a lot of
people were still concerned that we
could just terminate that license or or
or fork so we would have a like our
battery commercial version so we
designed a poison pill this poison pill
is for ourselves or if it it's for Andy
will take over of all trolltech that's
is if you stop development of cute if
you try to sort of polo license change
the license this foundation will make
sure that cute gets completely free
under a bsd license and that seemed to
settle things well not completely
because there were still some some
problems with our the qpl versus the GPL
and and license some licensing
compatibilities so we are GPL license
cute in in two thousand and we'll have a
reinforced commitment in 2008 actually
in about 15 minutes ten minutes you're
going to hear about that okay ah it's
about kde4 and cute for I told a lot
about the pasta and license conflicts
and and so on so so what does that imply
are so I've been waiting to see kde4 for
a very very long time we worked many
years on cute for and cute for is a
major upgrade of cute three and we were
very proud to come out with cute four
and we were then starting the count on
when it is Katie going to adopt all of
these great features these are some of
the things that are that kde4 can and
does benefit from us acute for compared
to q3 is it's a major major upgrade of
the framework a lot of a lot of the
framework was was completely redesigned
and re-implemented we have a bunch of
improvements in many areas for too many
to to mention here one thing I would
like to mention though is there the
focus on performance because frankly
cute three sucked in terms of
performance not on a desktop but on low
power devices like phones and mobile
devices and if you remember the
the slides i showed earlier on the
roadmap and how all the products are
related to each other it's important for
us to create one framework that lets
developers create applications that can
run on any operating system any device
right so cute for must be fast enough to
run on on phones so we've been focusing
a lot on performance and increasing the
performance and we still have lots of
work ahead of us to increase the
performance and katie is definitely
going to benefit from from this we have
a graphics engine that it doesn't even
resemble the graphics engine Ian in q3
it's it's a graphics engine on on
stereos everything that you ever dreamt
about is is there are it's a much
improved our user interface and theming
are things like you skating style sheets
it will make it and it does make it much
easier to customize the the desktop one
area that are we have been working on
for more than a year is we are
integrating AK HTML it's no called
WebKit its web big WebKit project that I
think Google is supporting apple nokia
motorola and a bunch of companies are
supporting this so we are a merging
WebKit into inter cute and we are seeing
a future where applications are not only
going to be native c++ applications but
we're seeing that they're going to be a
mashup of web to dot all like a jack
style of programming and native
components we think that the combination
of native and web mashup will create the
most powerful applications so this is
this is where where we're headed then
it's a phone on multimedia framework is
becoming part of cute in then in the
next release of of cute
finally I'd like to mention some of the
the opportunities that that I I
personally see for for Katie and many of
these things are are worked on and this
many of these things are what what katie
is no doing so I some of the things
there are there's an industry trend
moving really away from just a plain
user interface talking about user
experience it's about how are how people
interact with applications and
information I seen some of the new our
user interfaces in katy and and and this
is this is very very exciting it's not
only about you I and glitzy buttons any
longer but it's all the users interact
with with the user interface so that's
an area where a lot of innovation can be
made I also hope to see and I heard
there were where demos of bringing the
KDE experience to to any desktop but
also to any any sort of device one of
the things we are working on it we're
bringing q2 windows mobile so that
potentially a KD kid could be brought
over to to windows mobile devices and um
a third thing would be to expand the
developer community I I don't actually
know exactly how many of the KD
developers are doing C++ but I suspected
still the majority is it so when you
look at the rest of the world out there
there's a bunch of web to that all
developers are Java developers the tools
are there the technology is there to
bring this over to to KDE I think Katie
could have greater visibility as a
development platform for these types of
developers that could expand the
developer community a lot okay um so
we're going to give you guys a
pre-announcement we are coming out with
the press release on monday and you see
it here first so we have decided with
immediate effect to release cute under
GPL please thank you thank you okay so i
think it's actually the snapshots
tonight I will release cute under GPL
version 3 and we want to react very
quickly to to license changed so this
was about the fastest way we could do
but I think this will be very good for
for KD it will also be very good for
other open source projects of course we
will keep cute licensed under GPL
version 2 as well and some people are
happy to hear that richard stallman he
says this is a guy for free software
foundation i'm sure you know him he's
very happy to hear that that kid is
available under GPL version 3 and he
thinks this is great for for for KD so
that is really all i had to say today
thank you very much and enjoy the party
all right thank you thank you thanks
would you like to take some questions
hard Oh
are these were actually his quotes are
not called set our marketing people made
up actually they made up Scott but this
came back hi at first let me
congratulate with your company I am
following your company from somebody's
years and my question is very simple it
is about the latest gadget you have is
about the phone my question is the phone
they found the phone yeah where I can
take the form you do do you develop all
your talking are you were asking about
the green phone oh yeah the green phone
we are retired already we made the
thousand green phones and we sold them
out to two companies do companies doing
our phone development and some operators
we also gave a gave away a number of
homes to two free software projects it's
a where a software company we're not
doing phones being in the hardware
business is really difficult but we have
we have Q tokyo's available for the neo
phone so you can get a new phone and you
can download all the source code of
course utopia is also GPL Neil yeah
that's that's the open mocha phone and
that's available for sale speaking about
platforms we will or is already queued
for window see under GPL so we have we
have a technical preview of cute for
windows see I don't believe that is
under under GPL I think we may have a
special license therefore the previously
not sure of course that is going to be
under GPL as well another thing would be
a like a PR suicide other questions
other questions no okay thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
