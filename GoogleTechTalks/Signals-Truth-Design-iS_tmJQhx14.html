business development and i have the
pleasure of introducing professor judith
death who is here from MIT today Jews
work is it's fabulous every time I get
to go to the media lab and see something
new that she's done you know I have yet
another vantage point into into how
social media or meteor communications
media work today she's going to talk as
you see about signals truth and design
and everybody got the email so I'm not
going to go into detail there she runs
the social media research group and they
work a lot on the social side of
computing graphic design urban studies
cognitive science all these things
pulled together into a lot of interface
work that they do for online communities
and virtual identities she's known for
tremendous social visualization and
interface design I see some UI folks
here so I'm very happy you guys are here
to see some amazing work that she's done
and you guys have a copy of her bio so i
won't i won't read from it but she's i'm
just so happy she's she was in town and
I asked her to come and talk to us and I
think there's a lot of a lot we can gain
at Google always by looking at you know
serve what how things are really working
and taking another point of view and
she's done a tremendous job throughout
her research and doing that Thank You
Megan so just as a start not to
contradict that I do a tremendous amount
at Megan set of visualization work
interface design this talk is very kind
of light on the design work though i
guess you can all vote and you can say
stop this will just talk about design
instead but i wanted to talk about today
with some more underlying theory about
thinking about social interaction online
and how people communicate and some of
the ways of thinking that inform the
sort of work that we do i'll put in a
little bit of some are interface design
work maybe at the end but this is more
of a talk about new ways of thinking
about how people communicate and why
particular designs are interesting and
but I'd like to start with is
introducing this notion of signaling
signaling is a theory that comes
the world of biology the first person to
really look at this was a Israeli
biologist named among zahavy and he was
interested in some of the natural
phenomena such as you look at there's a
moose have these tremendous horns and
like these big antlers and these antlers
are very metabolically costly or you
look at some bizarre behaviors in nature
it turns out that some kinds of gazelles
when they see an enemy instead of
running away as fast as they can which
would seem like the sensible thing to do
if you're one of the fastest creatures
on earth instead what they do is they
jump up and down in place which seems
kind of a peculiar thing to do and he
was interested in coming up with an
understanding of why would these
phenomena happen and he came up with
this idea of handicap signaling which
says that sometimes of what you are
doing is trying to advertise some kind
of resource that you have in great
quantity the best way to advertise it is
to waste it so if the Gazelle has a
great deal of speed one things that
jumping up and down is doing is wasting
speed it's a way of saying you know I am
so fast I can just sit here and jump up
and down use it my energy use up this
time and you can go and chase someone
else and it turns out that predators do
not chase the gazelles that do this
because they know that the all-out rate
that once they start to take off after
them it will be a fast all out energy
losing race that they are likely to lose
and so many of these things have turned
out to be honest signals that by wasting
particular resources is a way of
honestly displaying them now when we
look at a lot of ways of self
presentation on the net today honesty is
not really the first thing that comes to
mind it's always been a big issue for
instance in in dating sites where it's
just as easy for me to say I am Who I am
I could say I'm the cream at the Queen
of England I could say that I am a
thirty-five-year-old male bodybuilder
there's really none of that those types
of costs that keep things honest now
there's various other things as we start
so you know most of what we see that
people self presentation is not
necessarily a flat-out lie for instance
in a in dating sites many people figure
that at some point they're going to
actually meet someone and some of the
truth of what they're saying needs to
come out but then there's others who are
doing this as a game there's the whole
sort of bored fraternity brother theory
of dating site you know how many people
can I get to answer this ad so they may
be completely imaginary so what we're
interested in doing in my group now is
looking at signaling theory to get some
kind of understanding of how we can
design sites not so that everything has
to be honest but so that as designers we
start being able to understand the way
that if you're a restaurant designer you
can play with different types of
lighting you can say I want to make a
nice family friendly place where
everything is clean and people are fast
and i'm going to use those bright
halogen light so you could say i want
this slow romantic dinner so
everything's going to be dark and yes if
this was a fast food restaurant would be
so dark you would not be able to see the
cockroaches go by but considering it's a
very expensive fancy restaurant we're
not worried about lighting to see the
dirt under the table so in such a way
but we're interested in is on helping
people understand how they can go about
using sort of the whole range of design
strategies for making social interaction
more honest and reliable so I'm going to
give it a quick background on signaling
theory and then show how it applies to
some kinds of on lines is um design the
first thing is a vocabulary piece we can
think about any of the things that
people use to get information about
others are cues some cues are
intentional that these are the ones who
are interested in terms of signaling and
there's a what I'm going to call
evidence or unintentional cues which is
also a great deal of what we read from
each other but the notion is that the
signals are things that are intended for
communication and it's this
intentionality in the communication that
gives rise to the types of dynamics one
of the music fur coat is an example
because a lot of things can be a mix of
intentional and unintentional
signals so for instance someone can wear
a fur coat to say oh look at me i am so
stylish not only am I stylish I am rich
I am wearing a coat that while I could
stay warm for one hundred and fifty
dollars from you know lands and end of
season sale I've instead chosen to spend
fifteen thousand on it so it's a fairly
reliable signal of wealth it's a signal
of stylishness depending on the cut
however someone looking at them may read
these signals but they also may say that
the cue that they see is oh this person
is cruel to animals heartless and
thoughtless so that is not an
intentional signal that would still
something that is being picked up on by
the person looking at them so here's
these example of the assessment signals
I was telling you about at the beginning
these are costly signals for those who
are interested i can give you URLs at
the end of more extensive papers about
this but these are signals where because
there's some way of wasting and resource
this resource can be time the one of the
earliest sort of proto signaling staring
writers was a early sociologist named
Thorstein Veblen who you may have heard
of he's famous for coining the phrase
conspicuous consumption he was a social
critic at the turn of the 19th century
and one of the things he wrote a book
called a theory of the leisure class he
was interested in you know if leisure is
such a sign of status it's how do you
how do you know that someone has a lot
of leisure time I don't really want to
spend a whole year watching you do
nothing to know that yep you really
didn't have to work for that year but so
what he talked about was effectively
assessment signals for wasting time and
his examples were knowing dead languages
raising pedigree dogs things like that
where there are all kinds of things that
take enormous amounts of time but don't
provide any income in heat you know
spectively these are assessment signals
of time so it's it's many kinds of
resources you can look at it this way
obviously you know people buy luxury
goods as an assessment signal of wealth
and again one of the things to keep in
mind is we talk in a minute about
conventional signals which are things
where there is no
costs associated with them so most
things are signals of many many things
again you know something like a very
expensive car maybe a signal of wealth
and the ability to waste to waste money
in order to show a high level of income
but someone buying it might say well I'm
really buying this so that I look really
know so that it can seem very very sexy
and attractive but that's that quality
does not necessarily is not required by
being the owner of the car so we have
learned by convention to associate it
with that but it's not necessarily a
reliable indicator of attractiveness
even though it may be meant to be won by
association you can be waste you can
something can be a signal of you can
something can be costly in terms of
missed opportunities so what you can say
is something like being you know multi
having multiple facial piercings is a
way of saying in a reliable sense that
you are affiliated with a alternative
lifestyle because what you have done is
put yourself in a position to pay the
cost of being unemployable in a whole
range or being unpresentable in a whole
range of other situations so costs can
be in time they can be in resources they
can be in opportunities in the season I
will talk in a minute of what you'll
keep this tiger in mind in indices are
another type of signal that's very
reliable because it's impossible to fake
it requires some kind of natural ability
or native ability that you simply have
to have that ability in order to show
the signal the tiger is used there's a
book called animal signals by British
biologist named john maynard smith and
he used the tiger as his example of
index signals because it turns out that
that's it's a way of signaling sighs it
turns out like if you're a really big
tiger and you scratch you scratch really
high up on the tree you're a little tiny
tiger your scratches are just not that
high so the height of the scratches on a
tree is a reliable
territory marker of height among Tigers
and the reason it's interesting well
we'll get into that in a minute just
keeps a tiger in mind obviously some
things like you know being you're having
big muscles is a index of strength it's
not necessarily something that way
strength but it is especially if you are
showing it off in a particular way so
there's signals that are amplifiers or
particular indices if you're very strong
and you walk around in a bikini that's a
amplification of that index of strength
conventional signals are signals where
they are don't you know one of the
things with these assessment signals
they're costly for the person or animal
giving the signal they may be costly to
assess conventional signals are things
that don't have these associated costs
they are less reliable but they're also
less costly and there but they're very
very common less common in the animal
kingdom that they're not completely
absent but they're very very common a
huge amount of human communication and
particularly our communication online is
in the form of conventional signals and
conventional signals are far less
reliable but what we have especially
among humans is there's other ways of
keeping them reliable in particular
society can add costs such as punishment
costs so for instance I can be I might
decide you know there's a lot of traffic
here it would be very very convenient
for me to put a siren on top of my car
so that I could pretend to be a
policeman a siren is effectively a
conventional signal being a policeman I
checked it's really easy to buy them
online you know you could just order
them and I could sit there and say ha
I'm a policeman excuse me out of my way
but there's such a high punishment cost
to doing that and turns out that the
punishment of impersonating a policeman
is really really not worth it to get
home 15 minutes faster and so society
manages to rebalance these types of
costs the understanding that type of
denied dynamics is particularly
important because in the animal world
there's very little a bill
to fake the more assessment or index
type signals but humans can fake almost
anything and one of the reasons i like
that tiger example is because Maynard
Smith in his explanation of tigers he's
not a very humorous book in general at
the end of his description he said now
this would not be a reliable signal if
Tigers could figure out how to stand on
boxes but they haven't but humans
actually very good at doing things like
figuring out how to stand on boxes so we
always find some way of faking some kind
of signal oh look there's very very
little that you can think of that's a
reliable signal that there's not some
way if the benefits of faking it are
high enough that it's not faith so the
deception a curve when it's beneficial
to the signal or so the cost of doing
the fake signal is beneficial to them
but these but deception is very very
costly to the receivers usually I mean
some some kinds of deception aren't we
live in a world in which there is almost
constant levels of deception I have two
little kids for any of you who have
children one of the things you start to
realize a lot of what you do in
civilizing children is teaching them to
lie you know you do not tell people you
think they're ugly you do not tell your
grandmother what you think of the
present she gave you yeah there's it's
an awful lot of things you just you
don't want to tell the truth about
children are not very deceptive we spend
a great deal of time teaching them how
to lie when to lie what are the right
kinds of lies how to ignore other
people's obvious lies and things like
that so but in the cases where it's very
wet for the receiver when they have
deemed it to be in some way costly there
needs to be some way of changing that
and also deception is very costly to
honest signalers because what it does is
it makes the reliability of their signal
as a whole decrease so when the cost of
the receivers is too high they'll cease
listening to the signal if you know you
know for instance when people first got
online most people assume that when
someone's
you know i'm a 26 year old buxom woman
who is just looking to spend an evening
of love with you that this was amazing
but it was great and they were really
psyched it didn't take that long for the
receivers of messages such as that start
to realize that actually it probably
wasn't true and you know that the result
there was simply to ignore many many
messages like that another possible
Iran's we said what another possible
thing is if society as a whole decides
that this is costly to increase the cost
by adding societal punishments if the
cost of the honest signalers is too high
and you'll see how once we get in some
specific example of these dynamics one
thing they may have to do is just find a
more reliable signal one of the things I
could be talking about so the examples
will go into greater depth here is a
notion of fashion and have fashion in
many domains is effectively a constant a
way of constantly changing the forms of
signals as imitators come up to
constantly try and maintain a new but
honest signal the other possibility is
that everybody starts to become
deceptive yeah I think one of the things
that's really interesting in our society
is you know as an example is all the
things that in previous generations such
as you know having crow's feet though
age marks as honest as cues of age are
now have now turned into signals that as
the technology has changed and things
like plastic surgery and all kinds of
youth enhancing formulas become much
more ubiquitous many things that we that
had previously only been cues start to
become the signals of how much time
energy and pain are you willing to
dedicate to looking youthful so anyway
so one of the things that we can do with
signaling is start to explain seemingly
irrational behaviors
I think an example that's very
interesting you know going back to sort
of the beauty version is sun tanning
with sun tanning as I extremely common I
once ubiquitous human behavior yet
historically it's had a very very
different meaning when you do a question
huh it look like there was some
confusion it's a beach scene but one of
the things that's very interesting about
sun tanning is that tanning is a signal
of social position very much related to
leisure and you know it's one of these
sort of basic stories of how cultural
mores change is that at a time when if
you were wealthy you were able to stay
out of the Sun when many of the people
who were poor and labored in the fields
were out getting tan and brown having a
tan was not considered any kind of
status signal as increasing amounts of
low status labor started to move into
factories slowly the cultural perception
of the meaning of tan skin changed and
most of the social histories of the say
that it was Coco Chanel who made it very
explicit sometimes I think in the 1940s
that tanning was so a much more was now
the high status symbol because many
people who that in order to have a tan a
particularly tan in the winter meant
that you had to have the leisure to go
to a sunny location and so the whole
social meaning of it changed but it's
it's also very interesting phenomenon as
so it's time went on like so you know
this is a poster from the 60s it became
something was very very popular people
spend a lot of time lying in the Sun
trying to get a tan you're saying ok
I've like four more hours on this side
if they turn on this side spin few more
hours this way and then you'd have this
mark that said I've had the leisure to
do this I have the time I you know if
it's winter especially I've had the
opportunity to go someplace sunny
and then round between 1980s 1990s some
very interesting things came up so first
of all what we see is that you know
we're human so we figured out that way
of standing on a box it turns out
there's boxes to stand on in order to
get a tan and cosmetics industry spent
untold amounts of money both figuring
out how to make fake tans that you could
slather on the development of a huge
industry in sun tanning equipment so
that you could spend your entire week
slaving away in the office and then go
home spend an hour a day at the tanning
booth down the street and come out at
least looking though it had not actually
been any kind of reality like you two
had you know this wonderful leisurely
life but what's also very interesting
about it as a you know i said was there
a rational behavior that's interesting
is that when people think about talk
about tanning when people interviewed
what you like about it is that it makes
you look healthy it makes you look like
you've been outdoors and at the same
time that it's become increasingly
associated with notions of health many
medical reports have come out saying
this is extremely unhealthy thing to do
this is going to kill you you know you
go if you go to an you're going to get
sun cancer also its associated a lot
with like people feeling like they look
young that they feel healthy it's going
to make your skin or wrinkled so what
you know one of the questions that you
can look at to signaling this way and
it's only things there's a lot of
academic papers looking at how can we
get people to stop tanning there's all
kinds of warning ads and I think if you
look at it as a signal you can look at
it from a very different perspective
that's very interesting because if you
look at if you say well actually maybe
as a signal there's something about
wanting to signal now being young and
youthful and healthy that the idea that
this is so on unhealthy is actually
beneficial for the signal not not for
the person necessarily because it's now
becomes in addition to everything else
it becomes a way of saying I am so
confident of my youthfulness
and my imperviousness to melanoma and
all kinds of diseases that happen to
other people that I can go out and defy
all of these odds and lying the sands in
the sand and the Sun or the tanning bed
and come out and look great and it's in
some ways because there are increased
numbers of learning that it then
strengthens this behavior as a way of
showing that you have this enormous
excess of the resource of health and so
as a way of looking at things this is I
mean it's a very very interesting way of
trying to analyze this because if
instance if you look at all kinds of
prevention programs whether it's trying
to get people from sun tanning to have
been working somewhat with someone who's
been trying to do a lot of safer sex
work among teenagers that realizing that
there are often the desire to do
something dangerous because of its
riskiness not of it not in spite of it
and looking at how that functions as a
communicative what the communicative
function of doing that is really really
important in trying to understand how to
devise better campaigns for influencing
behavior the other example i'd like to
go into a little more depth here because
i think it's a particular interest in
the context of google is this notion of
fashion and by fashion I don't mean just
clothing but there's fashion and all
kinds of things not only you know our
particular blogging sites but blogs
themselves really function as fashion so
let's just back up for a second and so
what do I mean by fashion one way in
terms of signaling the way of thinking
about fashion is that it's something
where the form of the signal itself
changes over time though the thing
that's being indicated remains the same
and in particular fashions or signals of
social status and affiliation we'll talk
about this in
and of information access in a very very
information based society so you can
look at a lot of blogs and say you know
there's a huge fashion component to
blogging where any one piece of news
that's there isn't the key it's this
notion of saying on a daily basis now we
have to link to the right thing if I
want my blog to be at a certain level of
up-to-date pneus where other people will
link to it because it has interesting
things I have to be able to go out and
navigate through this complex world of
information and find the thing that is
the right thing to be linking to today
and you can you know there's there's
been an honest I'm sure you've done a
bunch of these here of these
measurements and sort of how waves of
Link's move through the blogging world
well you have you know a small number of
early adopters and then you have you
know the early set of the people who
find the first ones and there's the ones
who go out and link to something at the
very beginning then there's like this
big mainstream wave is like lots and
lots of other people those blogs are not
read to find the forefront but just who
in order to say yes my blog is actually
a display of my being up to date in the
world of information within like three
to five days have the same link and then
it kind of tails off and then you know
couple weeks go by and nobody's linking
to it again if we look at it in terms of
risk there's a risk is much higher as
with any kind of fashion for the people
at the very forefront because whether
it's clothing fashion and saying well
did you just invest in something that is
going to be laughable that is never
going to catch on but you were at the
forefront but you made a mistake about
this but in the blogging world the
people who are really anxious to be at
that forefront the ones who are putting
in four or five six hours a day writing
a blog have to pick through all the
information they come across and know
that they have to pick something that is
going to become popular if you pick
something that no one is going to find
interesting you will start to lose
readership but it can't have already
become popular so there's the high cost
of finding that
nation and the risk in either writing
about something that's going to turn out
not to be true there was like an example
there was a very there was a brief
flurry a couple of months ago when I was
writing about this of news stories about
how the mcdonalds interactive games
division does anyone know this story so
it eventually it was one of these things
that kind of tailed off quickly McDonald
apparently McDonald's have this
interactive games division that was
supposed to be doing simulations with in
McDonald's of like their future
development where they should be opening
up new branches etc and at this game
developers conference on serious games
and simulation they came in and they
said yeah we've seceded from McDonald's
because they're not listening to our
recommendations because it turns out
what everything we found when we started
adding in all these models included
environmental impact that McDonald's and
the amount of meat that we are using on
the cows that we are supporting is such
a huge impact on global warming that we
are going to go out of business just
because everyone's going to die and I
via the way they actually did was a
little bit less fake sounding than this
and there were a whole bunch of blogs
that picked up on this story that this
is really how people need to behave that
this is how people have to be
responsible if you try and you know yeah
that they'd quit and they put their jobs
on the line the reputations it was a
great deal of excitement about this very
very briefly until eventually turn out
to have been a hoax so it's an example
of the risk that you can make by being
at the forefront of a story in that it
was also very very embarrassing for a
number of fairly high-profile writers
who had you know taking this you know
hook line and sinker so that's just one
example but there's you know but there's
also fashions in there's obviously
fashions and music you know
interestingly enough it's it's also one
of these things that's moving
increasingly into that space between
public presentations of self but what
your taste in music is really puts you
in a particular affiliation and it also
something where you
is being able to keep up with what is
the right thing to listen to it so
certainly functions of the fashion
there's but there's also fashions and
management is prone to fashion in a
tremendous way you know if you were you
know 20 years ago if you were a
fashionable consultant you could talk
about quality circles you know today you
talk about social networking but there's
you know enormous amount of fashion in
this information based world I mean some
of some of it may have to do with the
actual value of thin maybe maybe
particular ways of doing management are
better than others but a tremendous
amount of it can also be notions of
fashion of saying I am up to date with
in this world this is fashion in modern
art this is a painter John Curran who
started painting in this time you know
he's now one of the you know he's the
top contemporary artists with some of
the highest sales he's had one man shows
that all the big mediums in New York
when he was paint started painting in
the 1980s there was very very literal
figurative painting at all and but he
changed and his peers changed the style
of painting but it's certainly a very
the hold contemporary arts world is very
very fashion based so these are just
some examples of the different
dimensions not just clothing that
fashion exists in but what's interesting
here to think about in terms of
signaling and how you can think of this
in terms of design is that if you think
of it as a form of information prowess
some of the things that need to be
balanced again here is this notion of
the cost of the signal versus the
benefits that come from it so here just
again just sewing some exhibit
ubiquitous examples of the types of
fashion so let's look at something like
an iPhone or you know or little ear
little bluetooth earpieces for phones
they certainly are functioning as
fashion you know almost any kind of
technological innovation has a big
fashion side to it it's saying yeah 1
i'm going to you know it may be
programming languages
you know there's a you know
ruby-on-rails can be thought of as a
fashion you know this particular you
know and you when you adopt whether it's
a new technology and new programming
language when you come in at the very
early end you take that risk that you're
going to do something that's going to
kind of fall off the world you know you
made to start to learn a new programming
language that it turns out after you
spend six months studying it learning it
becoming an expert in it kind of folds
nobody ever uses it it becomes
unsupported all your effort was in vain
on the other hand if you learn a new
programming language and you're the
first one to do and have these new
capabilities and then you get to tell
all your other colleagues about this
great language you knew and then they
start to realize that everyone's using
it but you are the one that they heard
about this from first it gives you that
status of being shown to be much more
knowledgeable to be at the forefront so
when you look at something like this in
terms of the economics of signaling
there's the fashion signaling that says
where is where am I in this adoption
curve there's and then you start to
weigh it between the benefits and the
costs because if you look at things as
innovation there's a certain level of
benefit that you get anyway and then as
we see from signals that benefit fights
against it as a signal because the
benefit could be if something is
obviously just better it doesn't
function as well in some ways as a
fashion signal because it can be adopted
by many people without being
particularly risky or showing their
commitment to that particular hierarchy
whereas if it has either some great
difficulty associated with it if it has
you know and that difficulty whether
it's a difficulty of learning or it's a
style of painting that to the
contemporary i looks really ugly it has
that risk to it that says I'm willing to
pay the cost of this risk in order to
adopt it and then what's interesting I
think what's also particularly useful
about thinking about it today is under
these the dynamics within fashion both
as the signal and how the benefits and
costs that are associated with
innovation adoption playoff in terms of
a signal because I mean a very
interesting thing that we're seeing now
is it's important in two things one is
that it's accelerating at a fantastic
rate most accounts of fashion as a
cultural phenomenon put it at around the
15th century 15th and 16th century is
really the beginning of fashion you know
certainly in clothing but many other
things so remember we look talk back and
like when someone is copying a signal if
you look at costume for instance in
medieval Europe for one people's
clothing did not change from generation
to generation the things your parents
were wearing around the time you were
born we're probably the things you would
wear throughout your life there were
there were differences in costume based
on class but for various reasons between
simply very very limited notions of
social mobility plus some chew area laws
that forbade copying things people did
not say oh I'm going to achieve social
mobility by imitating the appearance and
actions of those in a social position I
would like to have it was completely
unheard of as our society became more
mobile you know this is not given big
general history of Western civilization
course but one way of understanding the
role of fashion is that a society became
more mobile and the possibility of
trying to change social class through a
number of reasons some of which changes
of wealth but also through imitations of
particular kinds of behavior was really
the birth of fashion but at the you know
in the 16th century there's reports of
princesses in Poland writing to their
advisors that they really wanted to see
dolls from Paris they would I mean a lot
of the fashion news would be distributed
to these little dolls but it would take
a year for the doll to just to get from
Paris to you know a
Country Manor in the outskirts of Poland
and so the rate of change of fashion was
very slow mean society was more static
but also simply information moved very
slowly we're now living in an era where
information moves across the globe
instantly and one of the things that's
very interesting is whether you're
looking at it in terms of clothing of
music of how of what is what kinds of
information whether it's from blogs or
news feeds that you need to be able to
keep up with on a daily basis in order
to maintain a level of sort of general
knowledge that's considered it's
expected has rapidly accelerated and so
understanding how how people are using
these different ways of both accessing
information but how information itself
is becoming a way of self presentation
and of identity i think is very very
important i think that's one of the
pieces that's particularly relevant to
the type of work that a lot of you I
think are doing here is understanding
different ways of understand what it is
that people want to do with all this
information they're getting we're
developing huge numbers of technology
that say here's a news feed here's the
visualization here's a whole new way of
getting at this stuff but this is about
looking at why are people trying to you
know why you look at things like MySpace
pages that have news feeds and blog
feeds and everything and how are people
using information as a way of
positioning themselves an increasingly
both mobile and information based world
and talk about one example of a piece
that we developed in response to this
and I'm going to open this for questions
this is a piece called I'm going to talk
about two things about piece called
urban armÃ©es and what we were
interested in here was finding ways to
take the fast fashion of the
online world into physical spaces and so
what this is is it's a it's a messenger
bag because we were seeing you know we
could foresee this as being something
that was clothing or anything else but
right now considering the amount of
technology we had went back of it
sticking into a messenger bag was fairly
useful but it's a display that would
have a picture on it that you could that
you could change but it's it works on
Bluetooth and so it could also sense
when people were in your vicinity that
we're using the same system and you
could see anyone could see what they
were displaying but depending on the
types of communication channels you
chose to open up with others people who
you had certain things in common with
could copy what you had on your bag and
vice versa and so what's interesting
here was what we were never get into the
details here was a running a little
short on time but what you could do here
was you could both be able to c to copy
things instantly but not have it be done
without your actual actions and decision
to do that much as you know you don't
suddenly you know choose don't teleport
onto you but also you'd be able to see
the provenance of things so an image
that you picked up from somebody else
because you were happen to be in the
same club with them you could also stood
track it as it had moved throughout
society but it was all based on
face-to-face encounters in tracking how
these things moved so it's a really
about taking the speed of the internet
fashion and bringing it into physical
spaces and i can send you some anyone
whose interests i can show papers on
that then I want to just leave with one
so completely different thought on the
notion of signaling is the question are
you human and this is I think finally
one of the most interesting questions
that people are going to be dealing with
on a daily basis and again it because
it's but it's very interesting as a
signaling question I have a student
who's been doing a lot of research
lately in my space doing development
machine learning algorithms for
trying to understand what are the
different human-like components of
particular spate pages which are pages
that are created by people to talk with
other people which are much more
corporate ones that are put together by
whether it's bands or increasingly
companies advertising something and
which are you know which messages are
being sent out by agents pretending to
be humans when they're not is there some
kind of pattern for ones that claim to
be human but yo in actuality are not
human and this is becomes a question
that I think has tremendous implications
in the next you know next few years that
not only is this something that people
are going to be trying to understand
whether it's in social networking sites
where there's increasing numbers of
pages that are in actuality corporate
entities or jokes or something else but
are saying that they are human to chat
chat spaces all kinds of discussions
where there may be participants that are
not in fact human but also on things
where we have to ask underneath some of
the interesting questions about actually
when is it that we care there's you know
there's in Japan especially increasing
numbers of robotics projects saying here
we can build a robotic animal that will
be a companion for the elderly and the
lonely and so what that it doesn't
really have any feelings it can act so
well that it has feelings it can make
you feel better and so the signaling
questions that we've been talking about
here when put into trying to question
what does it mean to be able to signal
your human start to address some of
these issues anyway thank you and I'd
like to welcome any questions
you try to change your signal because
you care to manifest your signals by
very specific quality but when you
project something your screen some some
some of your interest and you have
people coming by looking at your side
with similar interest you project a
different personalities actually give me
a shy person is you're holding but then
it can you know display your interest a
little screen on your back and you know
make other people to contact you based
on that super kind of you change the
signal this way right it really is much
more in the sort of tradition of the
fashion because part of it is you can
see if someone had start like we're in a
whole trajectory were they so once you
say I'm interested in something you
adopt it from someone what you're able
to see is were they the first or the
second are you at the very beginning of
this or are you the five hundredth
person to take it so it tends to be more
function within this realm of and then
you also get to see how far off it
spreads so it's much more signal of
position within a hierarchy of adoption
then about so part of it is you know
when we look at anything that's adopt
that's any kind of fashion resources
always encoded in something else whether
it's clothing or management style etc so
the content of it has a nut has that
information it says you know if it's you
know a picture of Hello Kitty do you
judge that this is something you want to
be adopting because of your general
aesthetics and knowledge and other
things so it's using that content to
give you a cue about where you will end
up there
perishing the surface but then it caused
people to be hot indicate more in the
real life because they really used to
assume different personalities in the
online world right but they kind of tend
to be very shy around other people but
now you can project kind of your
interest on the other extreme and have
more communication it's great any of
your simulations yeah I didn't get into
that particular issue here but a
tremendous number of the projects that
we do that are you know in our work as a
whole are about trying to find ways to
break down a lot of the barriers between
people's communication in face-to-face
spaces that there's obviously that it's
very very open when you're at a distance
from others but how can we use these
kind of hybrid spaces to break down the
barriers yes
has a high cost to one area so it takes
time learning
product costing monetary terms is low
instead of apple induce about
introducing iphone and $500 signaling
Natalie that is costly to learn a new
system but also costly monetary terms
but they introduced at two hundred out
what how does that affect adoption rates
yeah I mean there's a there's a lot of
research in that area there's a book
called the diffusion of innovations by
Everett Rogers who did a lot of work on
innovation research and what I've done
with the signaling theory is there's
there's a long history of theories about
fashion that are based on George Simmons
work on imitation and differentiation it
basically says those who are of some
summer lower on some hierarchy are
trying to imitate those who are above
them and those above them differentiate
the innovation research looks at what
turned out to be similar phenomenon but
comes up with a very different model
which is that people want to be in
different places in some kind of
adoption and he looks at his this notion
of their early adopters and later ones
and people want to be in these
particular spaces and one of the
contributions of looking at is a signal
is it's a way that you can take both of
these models into and unite them to show
that the costs and benefits of the
innovation can function as the costs
that ensure the reliability of the
signal in terms of social signaling
because the adoption the innovation work
tends to really ignore how much people
do things for social status it's one
little foot now saying oops I should
talk about this because we really don't
but in our interviews people always deny
that they're doing things for status
very very few people no matter how
trendy the thing they have just gone out
and done or said or bought says yes I
was doing that to look like I'm even
more high status than I am it will
always come up with
some reason why it was practical or
useful or a tremendous sale but you know
they will almost never admit it so if
your research is all on looking at why
people do that but the the price point
things is fairly common in marketing and
research and here it's more about trying
to get in trying to find a unified way
of bringing in these the social
signaling aspect that I believe is a
tremendous driving force that is much
often ignored in most of the marketing
world so yes come in a bit on the
disruptiveness of computers in this
environment because a lot of your
example sort of come from evolutionary
biology you know where you have help
getting of the Peacocks tail or the
butterfly that mimics something it
tastes bad and
that's a very slow moving process kind
of like fashion in the 15th century but
now you know instead of going out on the
on the quad saying hey can I borrow a
quarter from everybody I meet I can
harvest a million emails and send them
out and the orders of magnitude of
change is really dramatic and I must
think that that has an effect yeah well
I think it has a tremendous
effectiveness into my sort of the point
of what I'm saying is that we are living
in an era where the rate of change of
meaning is so rapid that it becomes a
tremendous cost in itself that the
ability that time and attention the
ability to process information has
become a enormous resource that people
need to be displaying their that that's
that notion of information prowess so if
you let you know forget about
evolutionary time which is extremely
slow but if you lived seven or eight
hundred years ago there certainly was a
lot of information you might need to
deal with in your daily life but it
changed very very slowly so that ability
to harvest new information wasn't
something that was you know a tremendous
cut off in terms of resources but for
contemporary people the ability to both
show your ability to find the right
information in a vast overload of
information how you display that prowess
of doing it I didn't get into some of
the more complexities of the models that
I've been developing here because one of
the things that's very interesting about
thinking about how people display their
ability their prowess with information
is that unlike other resources where you
can waste them and then they're gone
information spreads it's not something
that's transferred from one to another
you cannot throw it away the fact that I
have told you something doesn't mean
that I don't know it anymore as opposed
to if I give it to somebody and so under
so I think a lot of this is in the work
of trying to understand what are the
dynamics of information
the resource as it moves faster and
faster any other questions yes wondering
about your slide where you talked about
the accelerate acceleration in fashion
and I was just wondering um what you
actually meant by acceleration because
so I can understand that you know in
15th century when fashions need to
travel from let's say Paris to England
you know sure it's going to take like a
month or something like that for that to
happen but I guess I mean that's just
one way of looking at it right it's one
metric of saying well this is how long
it literally takes information to
propagate but whether or not that mean
will actually catch on if the English
Court at that time happens to be
particularly hostile towards the French
throne then well doesn't matter how long
those memes take to catch on I mean
doesn't matter how long those website to
propagate they're not going to catch on
so similarly now the spread of
information you have information count
is diffusing much faster but you know
also you're going to have much smaller
groups I mean the number of where it's
you know assuming in the 15th century
16th century over for more people in
England who are willing to dress the way
the court is right now that number is
going to be much smaller IV of much
smaller groups and it's going to be
resistance to information influencing
different groups as it travels so
let me just because you're there's a
couple of really interesting points
you've raised so let me just try and
answer you while I can still keep track
of them so the last thing you're talked
about is really about the fragmentation
of society and you know when we talk
about status and affiliation mean that's
a lot of that's the affiliative aspect
of it is to say that the traditional
notions of fashion for instance when
Semel first talked about imitation
differentiation is model was of a single
very stratified society I think you can
look here in any number of multiple
subcategories and people exist within a
whole variety of these so there are
fashions and music but you know people
can participate in different subcultures
there there are different many many
different possible groups you know you
can think of a nation's as different
ones there's subcultures with in
academics not only within particular
departments but people will move
according to different hierarchy we
could say there's a nearly infinite
number of hierarchies this phenomenon
happens both within them and between
them your first question about what did
I mean by the rate of acceleration i
just i simply meant that the amount of
time that a particular form last as a
signal of something being at a
particular point in some hierarchy has
gotten much faster the rate of change
and you can you know if you're looking
for specific examples there's a lot of
work in for instance in clothing fashion
just in how much less time you know even
in the last 20 years particular things
have stayed in fashion there's quotes
from Diana Vreeland win at or talking
about you know how the season in which
they measure what is a particular style
has become much faster there's an
interesting I don't have it with me but
there's an interesting graphic of how
long song stay as hip music from the
1950s to the present and so you know I
think it starts out as something
generally staying as a top hit for four
weeks you know now it's often down to a
period of days
so it's simply that that that rate is
changing and I think a lot of the cause
is that information just moves much more
quickly and so you know it's no longer a
matter of having to wait if you want to
listen to some you know to music of
having to wait until your local record
store you know somewhere in South Dakota
gets around to getting some music
shipped out to them before you can have
that record if everyone can download it
instantly it's going to affect that rate
of change so i don't know if i missed
some other main point yes
to be information because that way I
could say the lime in this group and if
this information you know doesn't apply
to me I don't have to take in all this
giant flow you know if you're not
wearing black and i'm going to i'm a guy
and I don't have to worry about you you
know or if it's that hip hop I don't
have to listen to it and so I can ignore
that yeah I think that death spout is
probably it's one of the reasons for
that type of fragmentation you know
there's many other theories about why we
live in a more fragments and society I
think some of it it's very hard to look
at these things without the historical
perspective because things that look
vastly different to us when we're living
in the midst of them may all just look
like one big blur of early 21st century
things two hundred years from now so I
think some of it is also that the closer
you are to a particular error the more
nuances you see within the culture I
think it's also very easy to look at
history and see it as a you know a
single unified culture but I think some
of it is also has to do with how
stratified a particular society is and
how much of a single common culture
there is so I one more question I think
it's time okay
you
