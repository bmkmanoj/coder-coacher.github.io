team Joe is a friend of my husband's but
I got to know him over the years I'm
really excited that he's here to share
with us what he's been doing in Osaka
and grace has is a co-host of this talk
she's been helping out with the posters
or the Flyers and her husband Chris was
also a Googler I think know is helping
to record so I think Joe will provide a
little background on himself but we are
going to save some time for Q&amp;amp;A cuz your
nays are more interesting and there's
also lunch the tables reserved at
Charlie's so after the talk we can have
lunch together which oh right okay thank
you thank you Christine thanks everyone
for coming today
today I wanted to do just a couple
things one is talk about our new work in
Japan where a startup college I'm going
to be launching hopefully in 2015 and
talk about just Japan education and
innovation and just things that are
going on in Japan maybe do a little
compare and contrast with China and
Korea as well so before I get started
let me show you just two quick videos
this is the first one and this details
just Osaka so you could get a chance to
check it out
okay the first one in the second video
just want to show you just maybe a
minute of this video a Japanese person
get person put together just this video
on what junior high students in Japan
are kind of facing and I just want to
show you just a little bit of it as well
this is a students that refuse to go to
school that's a little bit of data on
junior high age students in Japan ages
12 to 15 so this is all Sokka station
and Osaka is probably the 15th largest
city in the world roughly seventeen and
a half billion people in the metro area
and one thing interesting about Osaka is
is that Tokyo the largest metro area in
the world has 36 million people and so
these two cities are in the same country
and if you combine the Osaka area the
Tokyo Metro area and the Navi mention
area that's roughly 40 some percent of
Japan's 127 million people so if you go
by just the square footage in Japan
Japan is not the most densely populated
nation in the world but if you go by
cities by far Japan is the most densely
populated nation in the world I'm the
video you saw of Osaka earlier that's
not rush hour I don't want to take
footage in rush hour because it'd just
be too crazy so that's just what it
looks like normally so you actually
haven't seen crowded til you've been to
Tokyo or until you've been to Osaka it's
just just that this the sea of people is
just amazing there so we're a college
and we actually - we're not a college
yet I am the president of a non-existent
college with no professors yet and no
students and you might be wondering what
the heck is going on a year ago my
organization mission to the world we are
a Christian organization wanted to
launch a college in Japan
and so they asked me to lead this
endeavor and we said yes so last March
my wife and I were the only two people
on this team we had nothing except a
vision in a dream that this would happen
and so I want to talk about just one
thing today primarily is about reaching
the Forgotten youth of Japan and how we
plan on reaching them through our unique
platform so before we do that just a
quick guess can you guess the top ten
largest universities in America let's
take a look
just think and just think about
approximate numbers and then think how
many of these schools are online and
then how many of these schools are
four-year universities versus two-year
colleges so the most recent government
data only goes back to 2010 so just to
show you most of these schools the ones
that are in red have and blue have gone
up in number the blue schools are
schools that are majority online so this
is from 2010 actually on the way over
here to San Francisco I just read a
magazine that had Liberty University's
student enrollment there are over a
hundred thousand now and Kaplan is also
over a hundred thousand and the
University of Phoenix is PI around 350
thousand um have you heard of any of
these schools do you think you've anyone
have heard of more than five of these
schools is very unlikely right these are
the largest schools in America over in
Asia where I live a laureate education
is a for-profit educational group just
in Asia alone over 80 percent of this
number is in Asia 70 to 80 percent and
so they run for-profit business schools
primarily a Raffles a company based out
of Singapore just in their for-profit
education division has over 24,000
students their own hotels and
restaurants and other things as well so
education is actually changing
throughout the world in particular in
Asia and so one of the things as we look
here is kind of traditional education is
it going to continue is it going to
change and you see platforms like Khan's
academy or audacity who deme all these
new kind of platforms that are coming up
providing education in ways that just
did not exist even three years ago
I mean Liberty University has anyone
ever heard of Liberty University so
they're a small Christian school in
Virginia and I think their college
enrollment is like 3,000 or 4,000 maybe
and their online enrollment is ninety
seven thousand ninety eight thousand
just amazing and they're educating
people in Asia and Africa and South
America and so so this is kind of the
changing face of education know one
thing just before you know to understand
Japan you kind of have to understand
space so Japan is 127 million people
roughly the square footage of Japan is
similar to Montana so imagine if
everyone in these blue states decided to
move to Montana that'd be pretty crowded
right but actually if you take out the
arable land the farming land and you
take off the rocks the trees the
volcanoes the water the marsh areas the
actual livable space in Japan is only
about the size of Massachusetts now
imagine everybody in the blue states
here the entire East Coast decides we're
gonna move to Massachusetts wait there's
more and imagine if roughly 40 some
percent of those people in Massachusetts
decided to live in just three cities in
Massachusetts that's Japan so the
population density is just absurd it's
just absurd and Japanese have come up
with social kind of norms to get over
this for example Japanese do not walk
with their heads up why well they're
very awkward if someone's face is right
here so they walk even before cellphones
they would walk with their heads down
like this and so on a train like it's
very common for you to be right next to
somebody it's kind of awkward you're
like looking deeply into their eyes you
know so just people walk like this and
it's very easy I'm Asian Americans so
for the most part maybe except for my
weight in size I can fit in Japan but
the easiest way to spot somebody that's
not Japanese if they're Asian is they
walk they look up when they walk and so
again to understand Japan is to
understand space and a lot of what's
come from Japan culturally is because of
this population density
some things you may not know Japan is
the third largest economy after the US
and China Japan has a whole host of
social problems one of the most
important ones to people like me is in
house divorce so this is a case where a
husband and wife are married on paper
but for all intents and purposes are
divorced the husband might have a
girlfriend the wife might fantasize
about some Korean movie star and they've
been sleeping in separate rooms since
they've had their first child and
they're okay with that and this is it's
such a big number that this term was
coined by a Japanese sociologist in
house divorce divorce is still a little
bit of a stigma so people just stay
together and just lead completely
separate lives so a few days ago March
11th was a two-year anniversary of the
great earthquake and tsunami in Japan
25,000 people died in that earthquake
and tsunami but people don't know that
that year 38,000 Japanese people
committed suicide so last year the
number finally dipped to like 29
thousand seven hundred but before that
fourteen years straight more than 30,000
Japanese committed suicide so in Japan
we have a tsunami of deaths every year
every year that's greater than the
earthquake and tsunami that happened two
years ago every year so Japan has some
significant social problems what's
interesting for a lot of us who work in
Japan is he Kiko Mori
and he kike Mori as a social disease
that exists only in Japan it does not
exist in China or Korea and it's
basically internal suicide it's where
over 1 million mostly men between the
ages of 18 and 28 said I'm just going to
quit though some of them went to really
top universities they just quit they'd
quit talking they Chronicle
young men who just haven't spoken to
anyone in two years and generally two or
three generations live at home so they
just kind of hang out at home and play
games and it's because the depression
and the pressure you know just as
someone who's Asian I'm familiar with
some of these issues but I have never
seen and I travel quite a bit I've just
never seen a country where young people
face so much pressure just judged for
the way you look how you act which is
why in Japan
there's really no middle ground people
if F if you've actually been to Japan
you know what I'm talking about it's 99%
conformist and 1% like outer space
you know so in Japan it's normal to see
like a sea of people in dark suits and
to see the one well man with like a
miniskirt hairy legs purple hair tattoos
up and down and so and that's normal
that's Japan there's really not much
middle ground and part of it is because
of this pressure that they face Japan's
economy so this is a kind of new fact
for me you know in 2005 Japan heads
Japan's economy was twice the size of
China's for 40 years Japan was the
second largest economy in the world 40
years after America but now China's
economy is not only larger you can just
see the growth rate of China versus
Japan Japan Japanese economists referred
to the 90s as the Lost Decade
economically the 2000s were also
considered a lost decade and now they're
going into their third loss decade but
because Japanese parts in Japanese
manufacturing and just operational
skills are so so top-notch and high-tech
Japan will still be a wealthy country
for many many years to come but pretty
much the the decline and you could see
it and the government's trying to fix
this and the biggest problem is is lack
of children because of the pressure and
sort of the challenges that people face
Japanese are not getting married and
they're not having children birthrate is
under one so that's just crazy because
the replenishing rate is two there 127
million Japanese now and within 40 years
the Japanese population at this rate
will go to about 80 million
another challenge Japan has some of the
strictest immigration laws in the whole
world there are South Koreans who were
basically brought over as slaves between
90 wasn't South Korea's just Koreans
they were just one country then between
1910 to 1945 and only like 20-some years
ago were they allowed citizenship so you
have people foreigners who were there
for generations who are not allowed
citizenship not even get green cards
they have kind of a special visa of
sorts so Japan has some great challenges
now as we head into kind of why a school
like ours I believe is important from
2003 to roughly 2010 this is the
percentage of Japanese recruits who want
to work for their own company were
for their current company or who want to
start their own companies you can just
see the downward trend as the economy
gets worse as the pressures mount you
just want to stay with what's what's
stable you know I joke around if Mark
Zuckerberg found their Facebook of his
parents were Japanese there would be no
Facebook you're gonna drop out of
Harvard what are you crazy
you know and so the pressure and such
would be that even all these talented
entrepreneurs they'll just not take the
plunge because there's just so much
social pressure so the pot the top is
just a typical Japanese stoplight I mean
it's very very common it's a sea of
salaryman we don't really use that term
in the US but corporate workers high
sign is what they would say and then on
the bottom this was actually a Japanese
blogger came up with this the Japanese
now have a term called Shah joke okay
Dante and Shah means grass shoku is to
eat and dance a is man grass eating man
herbivores and basically it's a women
say that of Japanese men who are wimps
and wusses and totally the opposite of
this
the samurai archetype you know now it's
more this and and there's actually been
a lot of complaints by Japanese women by
blockers famous people that there's no
manly men left in Japan and that's why
they're not getting married
interesting those are not my words those
are words by actual Japanese women and
just informal eyes speak quite a lot in
Japan to church groups and universities
and I just say what do you think and I
would say about 80 to 90 percent of
Japanese women have said the majority of
guys I know are shows okay they're
herbivores the grass eaters they need to
eat some meat I'm Japanese do eat meat
but it's figurative right lead a lot of
fish too as you know so this is just
very interesting some of the cultural
shifts going on now one thing about
Japan that you may not know is just the
rigors of entering and university the
most difficult college entrance exams in
the world now before you even get to
that now this is changing because of the
population dearth around 14 and junior
high the government separates you into
two groups you have the academic track
the people that will go to college and
you have the technical track the people
that will make cars and computers and
those kinds of things and so you go to a
Technical High School versus a academic
high school and you can pretty much
break it down 99.9% by economic status
how much money your parents have because
you can't get into a good high school
without having gone to juku and JUCO is
like an after-school training center in
Korean they would call these hug ones
and so we don't have these in the u.s.
they're basically just a way to get
ahead in math and in English and the
only way to get into a good high school
is to go to JUCO you can't go to too
cool unless you have a lot of money and
so on and so forth and so this separated
the group now that's no problem because
when the economy was doing well there
were lots of jobs there was tenure
lifetime employment but Japan's been
reeling economically so now those jobs
are far and few between also there are
less and less children which means that
the government's finally they can't just
stick everyone in technical track so
they're slowly starting to bring people
more over into the academic track so
suppose I'm a Japanese student and I
want to go to college and I go to the
academic track when I graduate high
school there are two tests I have to
take there's a test first test is called
the Santa can a little Ramin center test
the center test is am I qualified to go
to college so I take that roughly a
hundred ten thousand Japanese students
take this test every year now after I
take this test which is the most
difficult college entrance exam in the
world then I have to take another test
called neat eh Ken which means basically
second test and this second test is I
pick a school and a major so Tokyo
University best school in Japan that
would be the most difficult test in a
second best Kyoto University third a
second most difficult and so on and so
far there's 118 accredited colleges in
Japan so 1 through 18 they have test
scores and they're ranked by these test
scores now look at these numbers 110,000
took the santosh ken and 440 2002 the
nitish Ken so what does that mean it
means there are these they call them
Ronan's a ronin is a samurai who's
basically left his master and has
nowhere to go well the students in
between the santosh can and the nija she
can are called Ronan's because they have
no school
and so the parents are financially
bearing the burden of these young people
so a lot of them don't go to college
they're 20 or 21 because they have their
sights set on Tokyo University or kilt
the University or what's a tower K or he
talks about she like the best schools in
Japan and so just think about this just
look at this discrepancy it's just crazy
and then some of them actually quit and
drop out and a significant number of
these become iki Komori because of the
pressure of not being able to get into
the school of your choice in Japan you
only have 4 years of easy life and
that's your years of college high school
is extremely difficult and pressure
filled and once you go to a company
you're yours you're set your life is
basically given to this company so they
have these 4 years to experience some
freedom and so Japanese students don't
study you know and they kind of bypass
this by just making it very very hard to
get in so only the bright kids get in
which means that once they graduate and
they get a job then they'll do very very
well and that's kind of the system that
they have now here's where it starts
getting interesting anyone know who this
is
his name is Miki Thani Hiroshi and he's
the founder CEO of Rakuten Rakuten
anyone ever heard of recommend they just
brought out by comm so Balaton is an
interesting company they're kind of like
Amazon and said instead of being
something that sells to consumer a B to
C there are B to B to C that's their
focus so they set up like mom Pasha
let's say you run a fishing store up in
Hokkaido and you want to have an online
presence well you use Rakuten system and
they're kind of like middlemen that way
mika tanya is now the i think it's the
third richest man in japan with like
seven or eight billion dollars and he
left his company went to Harvard
Business School now that's all normal
there's lots of Japanese they've done
that but here's what's interesting in
March 2010 he came on TV and he said
were Japan is lagging behind because of
one thing and that's English and he
explained that you cannot be globalized
in this world without English and he
cited the Japanese as having the second
lowest TOEIC which is the test of
english as a conversation test is very
similar to TOEFL but just in English the
second lowest scores in all of Asia only
Mongolia school
lower than Japan recently Japan had the
absolute lowest English language test
scores out of all first world nations in
the world and so if you've ever anyone
ever been in Japan if you've ever been
outside of Tokyo you cannot get around
with just English I could get around
Korea I can get around Taiwan obviously
Singapore I've been to rural China and I
could get around with English there are
places you just can't get around when I
first moved to Nagoya Japan where we
currently live yeah because I'm Asia and
like people don't think I'm American so
I go over there
that's excuse me how do I do this and
the people just start yelling at me
because like they think I can't
understand what they're saying and I
would sometimes have to talk to twenty
or so people to find somebody that spoke
English am I speak Japanese now but back
then I didn't I thought this is crazy
and so this guy came on TV and said look
if you can't learn English and you're
one of my 7000 employees you can't learn
English in two years we're gonna go all
English you're gonna be fired and I just
think about that this is a company of
7,000 plus people and he said if you
can't do emails in English if you can't
conduct meetings in English and he was
so convinced that English is the key to
globalization and Japan's weaknesses
globalization and he dubbed that term
English ization it's not a real word
that's that's his word so you might be
wondering hey Dan wait a minute the the
richest man in Japan is a guy named a
young I and he's the founder of Uniqlo
anyone ever heard of Uniqlo so Uniqlo is
gonna just kick butt in America soon and
he said he too said like in September of
that year he said forget it
we need to go global so he says that all
our stores every single one of us
whatever fifty thousand employees
because they're the leading retailer in
Asia they must be able to do business in
English everybody so you can just feel
the pressure that three or four the you
know two of the richest men in Japan and
they're very very influential companies
they said we're gonna go all English are
you gonna be fired
so just crazy the CEO of Honda when he
first heard this that that was stupid
you know I mean Japanese don't say that
but actually in the media he said that
was stupid that's a stupid policy but
doc Wooten is kicking butt now and
actually I know a young
a Stanford grad who worked for Rakatan
and he says yeah that's pretty crazy you
know I realize just panicking like how
do I read this email you know and if you
know anything about Japanese Japanese is
one of the six most difficult languages
for native English speaker to learn
along with Mandarin Cantonese Korean
Japanese Hungarian and Arabic the State
Department said these are the six most
difficult languages for an American to
get to fluency you know what that means
it means that English is the most
difficult language with people native
speakers of these six languages and so
it's just a great great challenge great
great challenge so what the heck are we
doing well who are we we are a Christian
group and obviously we have two goals we
have goal 1a and goal 1b goal 1a is
obviously our Christian faith Japan is a
nation with a very very few Christians
so we want to see Christianity grow in
Japan it is the second largest unreached
Christian group in the world and so
that's why we're there that's 1a and so
we want to see churches grow we want to
see just we just want to see more
churches more Christian leaders produced
but we have a goal that's 1b and that's
what I'm gonna talk about for the rest
of my talk is we want to serve the poor
now you might be thinking Japanese has
poor people if you've ever been in Japan
have you seen homeless people not a lot
and everyone seems like that are really
hard working what kind of poor people do
they have so so that's I want to talk
about that today
this is Mayumi sato and she is what's
considered a working-class poor 15
million Japanese are working-class poor
Japan is interesting for such a rich
nation the people are not very wealthy
there's a term that both Japanese
Koreans and Chinese use of Japan two
terms one is called rich Japan poor
Japanese have you heard of this term
powerful Japan weak Japanese so the
first term rich Japan poor Japanese
means the country is a wealthy country
but there's actually a lot of people who
are quite quite poor if you make less
than
that I think the average middle income
the median income is about 35,000 US a
year if you've been in Japan it's very
hard to live up to 35,000 a year but
people who make half of that so imagine
a family making 17th our year in the
most expensive nation in the world
that's the working-class poor and
there's 15 point 7 million of these
people so I tell people it's like this
imagine take all the people in America
that are on welfare on taking the 99.9%
of the homeless people all the people
without much visible skill and then
imagine if they have a work ethic that's
incredible what are you gonna have
you're gonna have people like Miami who
makes minimum wage and works two jobs
30-some hours each it's not a full-time
employee at each place she delivers
newspapers and she works for a
restaurant chain that makes bentos which
are like the Japanese lunch boxes she
works 6070 hours a week or so she has a
17 year old daughter and she cannot
afford to send her daughter to college
that's her dream to send her daughter my
yoo-hoo they did not show in the article
they wants to send her to college but
they can't afford the $10,000 in tuition
so this group basically gets completely
neglected because of the educational
system because of the cost of living and
also because of the shame in Asian
culture there's a lot of shame so she
basically lies to her family about her
standing and she talks about vacations
that she can't afford she talks about
doing things for her daughter that she
can't afford and they just live in like
a closet basically a rented closet and
live on that and so this is the group
that our college primarily aims to reach
so how did how did this vision come
about to start a college for this group
on the top left is one of my students
I'll call him a Azon and Ehsan and I are
very close when I first met him he was
only 23 highly highly intelligent young
man graduated from a technical school
and I said look you're such a bright guy
you never thought of going to college he
said I wasn't it much interested in
education when I was young and my family
just didn't have the money so in his
early 20s he met some American
missionaries and he became a Christian
and he decided I want to be a pastor so
I need to go to school
the promise is he never went to college
doesn't really have any kind of an
academic background and so the school
that I had worked for at that time a
Christian school we admitted him and
he's actually even the world graduate
school and as especially meaning he was
one of the best students that we ever
had what he lacked kind of in sort of
big picture details he made up for it an
effort and through his intelligence this
is a class that I taught called
organizational strategy for nonprofit
leaders we had the chief marketing
officer of McDonald's Japan come as a
guest speaker and for someone like him
to meet someone like him is just unreal
and he's like strategy I've never heard
of that word you know and he said what's
leadership I thought you were just born
a leader and just all these concepts
that some of us take for granted he had
never heard he's like a sponge in this
class and so I really identified him as
someone with great potential and so I
actually took him with me that's
actually in South Korea I did some
lectures over there and I just took him
with me and then he finally got to see
things that he had never seen and so he
is one of the main reasons why we want
to launch a college like this because a
guy like him is going to fall through
the cracks and he's going to be working
a manual labor job which is okay if
that's all you can do but he has so much
great potential to be anything that he
wants I mean he could be a professor if
he wanted he could be a tech worker
obviously he wants to lead a church but
he has really great abilities and yet
because of the Japanese school system he
has no opportunity at all
so how you gonna start a college in
Japan isn't that really expensive yes
well here's how we're gonna start a
college we have 15 and another eight
people are wanting to come over we're
gonna start a college because we're not
gonna pay any of our professors you're
like what you know so over a million
dollars in salary we're not going to
give one penny because we can't and
that's how we can start a college now
all every every person here is a
Christian and it's because of their
Christian commitment that they've
decided to raise their own salary
through their churches and friends to
come teach this is why Harvard Yale
Stanford all the good schools pulled out
of Japan the cost of operating is too
high actually they're all in China now
um it's just too expensive
what if we could launch a school where
there were people who were just
passionate who really really wanted to
build the school and who are willing to
sacrifice and who were willing to raise
their own salary
what kind of school would you get well I
think that we will get the most
passionate and committed teachers in all
of Japan because everyone here is there
not because of money not because of
opportunity because they really believe
in the vision of what we're doing and so
this is our team and we're hoping that
they will be able to get there in the
next 2-3 years and so since people are
raising their own salaries they're
working and they're gonna be slowly
plotting along and moving there this is
an area of Osaka called dotombori and
it's like just I don't even know how to
describe it it's like a strip in Vegas
Times Square everything this is 11 p.m.
unlike a Thursday night I think it's
like 10,000 young people there and
there's everything here I mean there's
everything from businessmen high school
students prostitutes
steak shops sushi places weird wacky
people it's just just you name it it's
here there's religious cults there's
just like you name it it's here somebody
if you ever visit me or no sock I'll
show you so I'm just walking around this
place and in Japan there's a culture
where they send young girls in
particular out to grab men now you don't
know if they work for a restaurant or if
they work for a massage parlor not a
legitimate man but one of those massage
parlors and you just don't know because
they kind of all look the same and they
use the same tactics to bring you and
they especially go after men who look my
age 40 or older because we have money I
don't really have money but people like
me I tend to have money so they so they
come grab you and then you know one time
this girl just kept on following me and
she just would not take no for an answer
so finally I said okay I'm gonna talk
this girl I asked her how old she was
she's 18 and I say you know so what's
your day like and she says that and she
called me horny Chun which is like the
word for older brother yeah girl I just
met obviously and what are you doing
she's she dropped out of high school and
just started talking engaging with her
and she says her her brother and her mom
all work two or three part-time jobs
each to survive turns out it was a steak
joint and
she says I said well how do you get paid
she says well if you buy a steak dinner
a tiny steak about fifty dollars then
she'll get a cut of that and every
person that comes in she gets a cut of
that so she's just busting her butt
working and I gained her and she was
intelligent she was bright and and I
have to go I almost wanted to like just
go eat at this place just so that I can
continue talking with her my friend and
deny and and that's our target group
that's our target group you know we want
to reach this group and provide
opportunities that they would not have
how can they afford to pay for our
college they can't so we're gonna offer
part-time courses as a school we're
gonna offer courses basically morning
afternoon and night I'm not a single
Japanese College can do this again
because we're small we can do things
that a big school cannot but we're gonna
have a flexible loan program Japanese
schools do not have loan programs so
we're gonna allow someone to go to our
school and pay it back based on a
percentage of your salary with very
little interest and again our goal is to
see young people rise up and the third
focus of our school is females so I
don't know if you knew this but Japan
has one of the lowest female workforces
in terms of management or above I think
it is the lowest in the world and I
think South Korea is the second lowest
but I see women who go to the University
of Tokyo roughly equivalent to the
Harvard of Japan or the Stanford of
Japan depending on where you went
you got to Yale people yell of Japan
okay so you went to a top school and
I'll be in a meeting and this lady will
be making coffee and that's fine to make
coffee but such a waste of her talents
and in some set it just kind of upsets
me because you have all this potential
in Japan it's a guarantee the more
female workers you have your company's
gonna succeed as it's not a guarantee
but it's a very high rate like 80 to 90
percent they just did a poll the higher
number of female workers the chance of
your start a big succeeding goes up and
up because women work for much lower pay
they're much much they're very very
motivated intelligent and bright so our
school basically is gonna be targeted
primarily probably 70 80 percent of our
school will be like that young lady I
met here who works for the steak park so
how can you get involved well one of the
things is we have a program called the
Genesis 100 and I just a few months ago
I was just thinking oh
gonna start the school you know I can't
pay anybody we don't have any rich
backers and and I knew that I can't ask
people to donate unless I'm willing to
donate myself so it's not a large amount
so I just came up with this idea if I
just lower my standard of living I'll
take a salary cut by $200 a month or so
in a year that's a little over $2,000 in
five years that's $10,000 and if 99
other people just match me that's a
million dollars which gives us kind of
the startup funds that we need and as a
small school again we have we have some
significant advantages we're going to
rent facilities all over Osaka so we're
not tied to one location we're gonna be
very convenient using a hybrid
technology both online and in-person
courses and so I've asked others I speak
often at schools and churches and places
if if people would just match my own
donation and so far 30 people have said
yeah so we have about 350,000 raised
now some people pledge $40 a month
others will do like 10 grand a year for
the next five years and so one way for
you to get involved is you work for
Google Google matches to nonprofit if
you wanted to donate 200 bucks a month
that's only a hundred dollars a month
for you so here's my pitch so so please
if you work for Google really I put that
to use and we want to make a special
plaque for the genesis 100 and put it at
our front door and you can have an
opportunity to help launch in college
amazing isn't it and not a single dollar
that you give will go towards salaries
not a single one I mean except for
Japanese salaries but not foreigner
salaries we just need rental facilities
and we just need an opportunity to get
started a second way you can get
involved is we're actually looking for
teachers and we're looking for
specialists so if you have a special if
you have some kind of specialty we're
gonna do we're gonna probably actually
we're gonna be the first college in
Japan with no books in our library we're
gonna go completely online and we get to
do things as a small school that a big
school cannot because we don't have the
infrastructure we don't really know what
we're doing so please help us come and
help us set up a system for us do an
audit for us and for those of you with
graduate degrees you can actually teach
a course for us part-time and I'm gonna
try to build a faculty residence so
you'll pay your own way you'll vacation
in Japan but at least we can house you
for free and then you teach for us for
free and volunteer
and really engage and connect we are a
Christian college so the professor's the
full-time professors the regular
professors do need to subscribe to our
Christian commitment but you do not need
to have be a Christian to be an adjunct
or part-time teacher for our school so
anyone can get involved and if you're
specialists we would love to hear your
story share a story of how you've
overcome adversity or how your family
has really helped you and we want our
students really to have hope and a new
opportunity and a new life so this is
our website go check it out I'll have
some business cards up front for those
of you who are interested and thank you
thanks for coming today we'll have a Q&amp;amp;A
session and now please join us for lunch
I'm really excited about this lunch
first time at Google you know sure yeah
any questions or on anything yes so I
believe the average Japanese student
gets about six years of English
education through you know primary
school up through high school and there
have been public calls for everyone to
teach or to learn English in this
country before most recently I think it
peaked around 2001 or 2002 do you see
things that about this most recent wave
of demand for English skills do you see
things that's different in this current
wave and not yet except for the pressure
they feel so one thing is the Japanese
excel at rote memorization Excel and so
the idea is if I outwork you I'll be
better than you at something but as you
know with certain things a hard work
isn't the best way to get it so if you
know much about linguistics think of the
least intelligent friend that you have
just think that person is completely
fluent in English amazing whereas there
are PhDs from some top schools in the
world who I
professors like that who know why well
because language is a right brain
activity not a left brain one but the
way Japanese emphasize learning is left
brain tests rather than social
structures and the like and the two
cultures are like opposite cultures so
in Japan for example in the language
when I want to talk to you I don't use
the subject to use the subject is to
emphasize myself whereas if I say I
think this I'm actually weakening the
statement in English right I think it
you don't have to think in in Japan it's
the opposite when I say I they're like
watchos really self-absorbed
he thinks this you know so it just makes
it you know so my backgrounds you know
as a former philosophy professor and I
think that the secret to edge to
learning English is not English grammar
but Western thought kind of like I make
an assertion someone challenges my
assertion and without that principle
it's just hard and Japanese schools
don't teach that so Korea and China
you know I think that the reason their
English is better and it's not because
the school system is very similar but
because they've been a lot quicker to
adapt Western thought which is dialogue
engagement and being able to disagree
with a superior or being able to
disagree with your teacher and not see
it as a disagreement but just seeing it
as another viewpoint in Japan it's not
like that to disagree means you're
challenging that person so I never get
any student to ever disagree with me in
my classes because that means they're
challenging me you know so I sometimes
even say just write a denominator
anonymously and even then it just
doesn't come out and it's their way of
honoring me it's the samurai model the
apprentice master model so it still
hasn't really happened I'm gonna ask
that young friend who works at aqua
tenant he said no everyone's still
pretty bad at English you know but the
so what happens is is like when you have
certain strengths you end up emphasizing
those strengths right which is learning
more words more grammar because how many
of you ever taken the TOEFL test or
looked at in nobody talks like that you
know no native English speaker talks
like that and yet if you learned that
system and the best Japanese learners in
Japan foreigners are mostly people from
like Nigeria or these places and that's
because they have no money for language
school they just go hang
now with Japanese and so they get good
whereas I know American and British
corporate folks who actually go to a
really top level school and their
Japanese is terrible so some of that
same things is going on so we're hoping
to bring some change some disruption but
again not easy yes okay okay so the
question is can you talk a little bit
more about how God put this idea into
your heart and as a Christian my goal is
obviously to increase the the name of
Christ I mean that's my goal in life and
so one of the things my own this is my
own personal conviction is looking at
the New Testament in the Bible Jesus
consistently talks about serving the
poor and so you know when my wife and I
moved to Japan because of this
opportunity we had to leader helped me
to school there this is like five years
ago well there's no poor people in Japan
or so I thought you know because
everyone seems hard-working and they are
and everyone but as I lived there and I
saw just lots of people who were
working-class poor poor but live
paycheck to paycheck and with great
potential so that's the group we wanted
to reach and that's where this vision
came about but originally it was just
because there was just so few Christians
in Japan so I was recruited to help lead
a theological seminary I was a vice
president of a seminary there we work
with young people just like ASA and the
person that you saw and just helping
them become church leader or some of
them run and they work for nonprofits
like food for the hungry just mostly
Christian religious faith-based
nonprofit organization of leaders the
worst school that trains those people
and as I went there we thought you know
but the number of people we could reach
is so small we wanted to scale it up and
that's where the vision for this yes
okay yeah yes yeah yes so the question
is is what are some of the the
difference is because the educational
system and some of the culture things
are similar between China Japan and
Korea so this is let me explain the
powerful and weaken and talk about the
too much so and there's a saying rich
Japan poor Japanese what does that mean
the nation is rich but if you've ever
been to Japan the average Japanese
person seems very poor versus here
people just don't live well a couple
reasons one is it's expensive so people
get this kind of saving mentality second
Japanese are prodigious savers the
average Japanese family has like seventy
thousand US dollars in savings it's
crazy you know that's like basically two
years salary for the average family do
you have to your salary saved in the
bank you know we're so leveraged here in
America and in Western culture so part
of it is just keeping that conservative
tie
whereas Chinese and Koreans overall our
bigger spenders and one reason they're
bigger spenders is I think it's because
Western culture has creeped and much
much more
much more influenced by Western ideas if
you've got a soul or you go to Shanghai
it'll be rare for you to see anybody
dressed in traditional Chinese or Korean
wear well you know China's not a good
example because of communism but let's
say Korea like in Seoul like the
traditional clothing is humble you'll
you'll never see it unless it's a
special occasion
but in Japan seeing women wear kimonos
or men where you talk as you got this I
mean that's it's normal you know so
they're just much more in touch with
their past which means there's such a
stronger culture so again strong Japan
weak Japanese a Korean professor told me
this he says you know what the real
difference between Korea and Japan is he
says if you get 10 Koreans and 10
Chinese and 10 Japanese in a room he
says one-on-one the Chinese and Japanese
will beat up the average that the
Chinese and Korean will beat up the
average Japanese guy you get 10 of them
together the Chinese and the Koreans
will all fight over who's going to
become the leader
and so nothing will get done but you get
ten Japanese it'll be clear one person
is the leader in the nine will follow
him that's a Korean guy said that's a
Korean professor and that I think
captures well the idea the groupthink
mentality which is why when Japanese
leave Japan they really ceased to become
Japanese in a lot of ways and so those
are some of the main differences with
English education same thing because the
Japanese did not really need English
like the Koreans and Chinese did again
think for 40 years they were the second
biggest economy in the world until just
a few years ago forty years number two
after the US and so it's one of those
things like I don't know if you've I had
a teacher named Clayton Christensen and
he talks about disruption and one of the
things is like if you're doing really
well rather than thinking of new
opportunities like Google does sometimes
you just do what you're good at because
it's so important for you you don't
develop anything new then eventually
like Kodak you die you die because
you're just doing the same thing over
and over well as these young upstarts
you know obviously they can't compete
with you in the beginning but eventually
as it develops it gets but and this you
know you can look at this with like
Japanese it's cars and Korean cars
so now Korean cars are kind of a top
know I mean right now the car in China
is not very good but who knows what's
gonna happen later on so that's kind of
what's happening in Japan the majority
of the country is just doing what
they're good at and English is very very
difficult because of those cultural
reasons yes how do we share so we are an
open school and so most people are not I
would say about 90% of our students will
not be Christian but we have church
leaders nonprofit groups who are going
to ask to use our campus so they will
use our campus will have a coffee shop
and so on and so forth a church in Japan
is so tiny like 15 or 20 people that
they can't do anything have no power
have you know majority of their people
are under 30 sorry over 60 that they
want to reach the under 30 group and so
our college will be that so we're just
gonna ask them ask them to comment to
participate and offer a platform and
again because we are a Christian
organization our professors must
prescribe to our Christian commitment
to be a regular professor we do not we
are a two-year college a Christian
college not a Bible School what's the
difference the Bible School emphasizes
training for those who are committed to
that religion in a Bible School or
whatever but as a Christian school we
are a school that believes in Christian
education and a Christian worldview but
no one's required to subscribe to our
belief system though we are just a
college taught by mostly Christian
professors are teaching from a Christian
worldview using a Christian platform and
then we have us Christian colleges that
are our partners or going to offer us
their curriculum so then our students
once they graduate they could transfer
into these schools in America or now
here's the amazing thing someone like
that Ehsan the guy that I mentioned has
zero chance of going to a Japanese
college not one not two percent zero
percent at his age he's 26 now but if he
graduates from our school because there
are no junior colleges in Japan they're
all technical schools he could actually
go to the English language division of a
Japanese university and graduate with a
four-year degree from a Japanese
university in English and so English
gives the advantage in a way that in
that particular system and that's what
we want to offer the working class for
its back
yeah well there's lots of reasons we
could you know actually I gave a talk
over an hour long just on this very
topic but but to sum it up I think the
reason has to do with just Japanese
social structure so in Japan there's a
big emphasis on the sotol which is the
outside and the naka which is the inside
and that plays into everything
Christianity Islam any non Japanese
thing is just not Japanese I can't do
that so it's not just Christianity
that's been challenged in Japan
I mean Islam is going very very fast in
Korea and actually in parts of China as
well but not in Japan Japan also has a
very weird deviant cult there's over
8,000 registered Japanese cults 8,000 so
these are groups that don't categorize
under Judaism Christianity Shinto all
the major religions of the world and so
they just stick them in this group new
religious groups and some of them are
very aggressive
including the ones that I blew up the
Tokyo subway not that long ago so but
yeah but that's the biggest challenge
because of the inside-outside culture
and not maintaining your either Japanese
or you're not so if you know the
Japanese alphabet there's another there
is a hiragana which is native Japanese
there's kanji which is Chinese
characters but have another alphabet
called katakana and katakana is for
foreign things or emphasis so if I want
to say go for my favourite team I'll
write that in the katakana alphabet but
foreigners when you write your name
unless you're Chinese or Korean then
you'd have a kanji name but if you're
not Chinese or Korean like my name is
written in katakana which signifies
right off the bat when you look at
anything that has to do with my name
foreigner so that identity I mean for
those of you that are not Asian
obviously you look like foreigners but
you know I don't look like a foreigner
there and so even that so it's the
inside-outside culture you're just not
Japanese and so it's not just
Christianity just new ideas period you
know here's another thing you know you
familiar that that song condom style the
Korean song was number one and basically
every country in the world except for
Japan most Japanese have no idea what
that song is about
I know what's what's wrong you might be
thinking you know question
yes they're much more successful in
Korean but not in Chinese though Chinese
is just as difficult for a Japanese
person as English is in a lot of ways
apart from the writing system and that's
what gives them the advantage so
Japanese is relatively a non tonal
language they have tones but it's very
low so when Japanese speak Chinese the
Chinese person goes what what they can't
understand them when Chinese speak
Japanese it sounds like nails on a
blackboard like like it hurts their ears
it literally hurts their ears and I
didn't know what they were talking about
till I started learning Japanese it
hurts my ears because of just the
harshness of pronunciation so that's
that that's one challenge but Japanese
are generally linguistically challenged
except for Asian languages for East
Asian languages because they share
similar writing it's just the writing
system gives you that leg up so I don't
know if you're familiar with Chinese
characters you know you can see the
character let's say it's a symbol for
dog like the Koreans would say care the
Japanese would say you know I don't know
if the Chinese say but you know there's
three word three like words for the same
symbol so because of that they can do it
but overall it's really tough for
Japanese and because they've been the
second richest country in the world why
do they need English you know now that
their economy slumping they need it oh
and by the way lest we think that native
English is what we're after as a native
English speaker some of us struggle in
China or Singapore what what are you
saying you know a lot of people who
learn English as a second language
actually are better at speaking English
to somebody in India somebody in China
someone in Thailand I mean I took some
students to Thailand on this trip and I
didn't know what the speaker was saying
I mean he'll speak in English but I had
a hard time but all my Japanese students
understood what he was saying and I'm
like yeah so much for being a native
speaker you know so the goal is not to
turn our students into Americans it's to
use English as a mode of communication
and once you get English as a Japanese
person your mind just opens up to this
new ideas English is an amazing language
I think I think it's amazing because
there's no honorific oh really
you know in East Asia I'm always like
you know and Korean and Japanese have
different honorific so you know I travel
to Korea la am I using the right form
I just rude to this guy is this ending
career
in English we don't really have that
know so it's really helpful for making
friends actually because it's a direct
language and there's no hierarchy in the
language but in Japanese our Korean you
use the wrong form boy you're really
insulting
well we haven't recruited any students
yet but we're gonna have contests in the
beginning we're gonna have like speech
contests how to make a better Japan and
well in the beginning we're just gonna
offer them a free chance at our school
so we're gonna just do again we can do
this because our professors aren't
getting paid we can take kind of
aggressive you know sort of financial
hits in one sense and so we're gonna
have contests like this and then just
have students come in English we're
gonna promote English education because
if you know anything about Japan Tokyo
is twice the population of Osaka but if
I has ten times the amount of schools
incorporation though Osaka is such a
mega city but it's so neglected because
Oki is only like a seven hour drive up
north and so that's one way contests
offering free things using social media
I mean we have a tight budget so one
thing we're gonna do is there are some
American churches Anglo churches that
want to help us and so one way is I
might bring 50 of them over and just
part them in Osaka station
can you imagine 50 Anglos and also I'm
you saw the video right and they just
totally stick out you know so we have
churches that want to help us so short
term people will come and maybe you know
some of you who are Christian or even if
you're non-christians we want to come
out can help us with that marketing but
yeah we're hoping people with some
serious marketing skills can come help
us fund me I'm a philosopher sighs what
is marketing
why marketing yes yes very new yeah
okay well that so the question is what
challenges do I face knowing that Japan
is such a difficult field and just
totally new and we actually don't know
in a lot of ways cuz we're obviously
we're a start-up but we do kind of have
a first mover's advantage we are the
very first as far as I know the only all
English language college in Osaka the
very first one of its kind with
seventeen and a half million in the
metro area so we'll be kind of learning
so that's that's one thing a second
thing is because of English again there
are young people there who are
interested in it so we're going to offer
something new kind of a sort of a right
brained approach to education and anyway
yeah so one of the challenges I think
that we're gonna really face is just I
think the biggest challenge for us will
be how we can balance reaching students
that need us from having to run like a
school I mean obviously we need people
to pay tuition so so so that that's
gonna be I think our single greatest
challenge how because the students we
want to reach can't pay at least not yet
so we do need a mix of middle class and
lower middle class to kind of balance
out the and the way we're gonna do it I
think is just by using lots of online
technology a Japanese do not believe in
online schools one reason they can't do
that is the language itself does not
lend to online education like English
does and they can't go to the University
of Phoenix online because of their
English so the challenges of that of
building this infrastructure
so what we're planning on doing is we're
gonna have all of our school online and
then we're going to lecture in person
have them listen to it in person and
then listen to it online and then
interact online so I think we're out of
time those of you can come to lunch
please join us for lunch
I would love to engage with you more
before you leave please feel free to
take one of my cards I'll leave it right
here and then let's connect on Facebook
Twitter all that good stuff and yes I do
only use Google as my search browsers so
