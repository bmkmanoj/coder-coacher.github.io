taking time out of your busy day to come
listen to jason kudisch Jason was most
recently the director of user experience
in product at Obama for America he's an
advocate for elegant simple solutions to
get to know the problems wherever people
meet technology private campaign he
found founded a design firm named fuzzy
math in Chicago he's worked a lot of
private organizations and also had
professional students at the school of
the Art Institute of Chicago and DePaul
University everyone it's good howdy
thank you all thank you for coming
thanks Bill and thanks google for for
setting this up it's a real privilege to
be here and talk with you today so today
I'd like to share a little bit about
what happened with user experience on
the campaign in 2012 and I'd like to sit
a little bit on this slide and just sort
of describe where this unique title came
from so when I was first considering
joining the campaign I talked to a few
friends who'd worked in politics before
and one of them gave me a piece of
advice which was you know people from
the campaigner going to be from all over
the country and they're all going to
have different motivations and different
things that are you know prompted them
to be there and so early on you need to
decide whether people are you know where
they're coming from and the term that
she used was were they true believers
politico's or kool-aid drinkers and so I
took out the true believers because it
didn't make a lot of sense to me but
basically what 2012 was about was
politico's geeks and kool-aid drinkers
we all you know geeks were a new aspect
this time around like in 2008 made a new
media team but we didn't have an actual
technology team in-house working within
the campaign structure itself and so
this was sort of an experiment you know
for the campaign and a fairly large risk
so I want to tell you a little bit about
how that worked out for us today as far
as politico's go politico's are
typically people who their careers
within politics right there their
purpose in being there is to get the
candidate elected but they're also
somebody who's going to continue on in
some form of public service maybe
they're going to go serve in a House
seat or maybe they're going to go
serve within government itself but you
know there's sort of a line more on the
traditional power structure of
Washington and you laid drinkers is
always a term used for the people who
really like believe in the cannon did
and you know for some campaigns in the
past you know maybe there were
candidates that didn't inspire everybody
the same way and so there was a little
bit of difference as to whether
everybody on the campaign believed in
the candidate or not in our case we were
all kool-aid drinkers so it made her
jobs a lot easier in some ways like no
matter how much conflict you had in
terms of background or motivation we all
were there for the same purpose and a
lot of times reminding each other that
was why we were there was a you know was
a way to get through some of the
disagreements in the meantime so we'll
talk a little bit about the campaign
it's an 18-month effort for us as an
incumbent you have a pretty rare
position and that you don't have to run
in the primaries so we took that year
before the general election season
started and built out a team in Chicago
we knew we'd have a budget of roughly 1
billion dollars we knew we'd have 18
months to work within and we have one
success metric which is you know the
election and there's actually no
directly measurable way for you to know
how you're doing you've got to sort of
infer your progress based on all the
other metrics around it because you
can't really know until it's too late to
actually affect change whether you're
actually doing the right things to win
so this is the office when I joined
there was about 30 people on the
campaign we would grow this almost at 10
to 15 people sometimes 20 people a week
until we had over 800 people in an
office in Chicago in the middle of
summer that was rated four maybe five
hundred people it was about 80 degrees
when he showed up in the morning it was
a little bit of culture clash for a lot
of us we had some Googlers who came out
on sabbatical and helped out they
weren't used to the fact that this was
actually the kitchen at least until
building services shut down the hot
plate this is our daycare so those are
my daughters on Saturday they'd come to
the campaign with me hang out and make
posters this beer pong table this is
actually a
room at least until it got confiscated
by interns and then they SAT there this
too is a conference room believe it or
not this is wini lam from google she was
on sabbatical it's Lee are Abraham from
facebook so we're sitting here thinking
I can't believe we're facing a wall with
you know a projector and people from the
campaign side field staff and politico's
are like are you kidding me you guys
have a projector why are they coddling
you you know so there was a little bit
of culture clash this is you know
basically us managing a whole bunch of
our projects online it's not quite
online if you'll notice it's actually a
bunch of stickies on a wall but it was a
way for us all to communicate because we
were used to using tools that I think
would be pretty familiar to you you know
github you know base camp you know
things that don't seem like the kind of
second nature to use in our field but
they were all new to the people on the
other side of the campaign that we were
serving so we're part of this technology
team there's people who are doing field
organizing there's people who are
running policy fund raising all sorts of
other aspects of the campaign and none
of them have used the tool sets that
we're familiar with so this kind of
culture clash led to us coming up with
solutions to actually hack you know our
internal relationships to make sure that
what we were doing actually made sense
to people who really hadn't developed
software before or weren't familiar with
things like iteration or improvements to
you know two processes and products this
is called document security so whenever
press would come in we put up these huge
sheets of paper and cover a wall not I'm
still not sure why we did this but this
is part of what we had to do this is a
product demo so it's a little a little
unnerving
there you go so let's talk a little bit
about the campaign in general and sort
of what what it is what we're trying to
accomplish you know campaign you're
trying to get 270 electoral votes and
there's really no written way to do that
one like master plan our plan was based
on our values so 50 states we'd run a
50-state campaign we'd find as many
pathways to victories we could yes it
comes down to like three counties in
Ohio most of the time but the notion was
that the more that you actually created
a playing field that was across the
nation the more that you made your
opponent do that but more to the point
the more that you're actually organizing
people in those communities and
empowering them to make change beyond
just the election also for us one of our
core tenants was that we were there to
expand the electorate in other words
were there to help people get registered
ideally Democrats but if we happen to
elect Republic or you know registered
Republicans as well that was okay right
it was kind of the cost of doing
business in terms of making sure that
we're actually getting people engaged
period now you know if you're the other
side and I'm not you know entirely
familiar with what Romney's camp was
thinking but overall Republican strategy
seemed to be excuse me you basically
suppress votes in places like Ohio
Florida and Pennsylvania and you use you
know really huge ad buys on media to
make sure that your message is not you
know either cleanly getting out there or
that you're kind of going negative on
your opponent you know it's another way
of running things this was our idea that
you know we could use this to be a
little more successful overall in
campaigns you're here to do five things
so the first thing is register people so
we want you to be registered we want
your friends to be registered some of
the ways we did this were really
traditional you know there's a football
game in town you send some volunteers
out and you ask them to register voters
there I bring in some forms do stuff
like that we also offered online means
for people to register you have to print
out a PDF we'd at least get you started
in the process and create some email
reminders and kickers you do more in
Nevada you can online register we also
did things like we asked you to connect
your facebook social graph and once you
did that we asked you to ask your
friends to also register which turned
out to be really successful next thing
we do is persuade so just basically
convince you that our guy is the right
guy for office and convince you to do
the same thing with your friends and so
a lot of what we did on line was tuned
to do this right in terms of producing
infographics or producing other pieces
of shareable content that we could get
to people so that they can get that to
their friends and again start those
conversations and build that community
finally turn out so when it actually is
time to vote that people are getting to
the polls you that they know where their
polling places are google did a great
job of making sure that there's polling
place to look up across the country it's
amazing you know but also early vote
early vote is key the more that you get
people early voting the more that you
can get them engaged because once you
voted you don't have anything to do an
election day supposedly so you can come
and do some volunteer shifts and help
make sure your neighbors and friends
also have access to the polls and then
finally you might have received an email
or two during the campaign we asked you
to donate yeah so I didn't know about
that yeah we sent quite a few emails I'm
sorry that we had to and then also
volunteering so actually getting people
to come out and contribute directly so i
thought i'd show you a little bit of how
that actually plays out for the most
part what we do is county by county
state by state across the country we
divide the entire country into turf
right and from there we open up some
field offices now this is a really
lovely field office this is one in los
angeles in montana the field office is
an organizers car right and they just
drive the state and that's it so one of
the unique things that we had to deal
with in producing software to help the
field organization is that every one of
the states is completely different in
terms of what they're trying to
accomplish and how they do it and so
like in california you are awesome you
call most of the country and you have
this incredible volunteer presence in
Montana or in Louisiana it's a fairly
lonely job being a field organizer in a
deeply red state and so you're probably
either
you know calling in to a different state
or you're trying to just simply build
community but that's that's where all
the action is in general what's
happening there is they're getting
people to come to events and do stuff
like this so there's a big piece of
paper on the wall give us your name
email address and phone number somebody
will get in touch with you one of the
problems with this is it's a really
lossy way of doing things and it's a
really intense bunch of data entry that
has to happen after these kinds of
events so a lot of the software we tried
to develop and the program's we've put
in place where things to try to make
this easier for people how can you get
this information without having this
thing on a wall honestly we were
somewhat successful but not entirely
because again we were sort of the
experiment were the new kids so you know
a lot of what we did hopefully hinted
towards where things could go in the
future once you get involved we have
what's called a ladder of engagement
model and this is fairly common in
non-profit and civil society organizing
which is the notion that once you get
involved you get some awareness of
what's going on and what the issues are
you'll actually show up and we'll have
what's called a one-on-one with you so
in this case this is New Mexico so
Deborah is a first American and she's
talking to a fellow first American and
they're basically having a conversation
where they're sharing their story and
learning a little bit about each other
and figuring out how we can get her to
be active in her community now some of
the challenges we faced were then you
know our demographics were basically 51%
of the nation that we were trying to
address in terms of population and we
knew a lot of things about them in
general it's sort of a u-shaped
demographic so on the lower end you had
folks who were 18 to 25 there maybe just
out of high school or in college or
taking a break from college and they had
mobile devices maybe they had a tablet
they might have never owned a desktop
computer at a very different set of
assumptions about sort of social media
and how the internet could work for them
on the other side of things you had
folks who are 55 and up predominantly
female mostly using desktop computers
probably not that comfortable with them
maybe they got on Facebook and oh wait
because of the president the prior time
around but they weren't really
comfortable with social media or really
that familiar with it and then you just
head outliers
she doesn't have a cell phone she
doesn't have a landline she doesn't have
a computer so how can we help Deborah
who has all those things make sure that
she can be empowered in her community to
still know what she needs to know and
get the materials she needs to help
activate people around her so once you
get involved up excuse me we're going to
put more stickies with post-its on the
walls and we're going to ask you to do a
whole bunch of stuff around canvassing
we're going to describe to you how
voting works we're in training we're
going to send you out we're probably
going to do that with a big piece of
paper right so this is sort of
traditional you know how organizing
happens and then you know this poor
gentleman here is going to get this
giant set of clipboards and he's going
to spend all night pounding that
information in so that he knows if that
door was knocked on and who needs to
register and all that sort of stuff this
is all stuff that we were here to stop
having happen in this way right so one
of the things we did is we built an app
that took this type of a map and you can
see it on your smartphone Android or
iPhone and then instead of having to
have him pounding the data as you're
going door-to-door and updating the
information it immediately syncbak that
stuff seems really like drop-dead simple
for us but in this place it was new and
crazy and things that had never been
attempted before so a lot of what we had
to deal with was cultural when somebody
gets activated what happens is basically
you've got a team leader and this is
called the snowflake model so when we
organize in neighborhood teams this is
sort of a new thing for the Obama
campaign with in presidential politics
this is what drove us to win in 08 and
in 12 the notion that you don't just
organize a bunch of people and have them
kind of go out in mass and just do
things what you do is you empower people
to take on specific roles so here is
Sonia or Sonja she's a team leader in
New Hampshire so she's sort of at the
center of the snowflake she's a
volunteer who's volunteering 20 to 40
hours a week around her our canvas
captain a phone bank captain a data
captain and a volunteer coordinator what
that means is help people knock on doors
help people
phone calls you know help enter all that
data and just help wrangle everybody and
then because it is a neighborhood and
community based organization you can
have roles like super volunteer mic or
phone banker extraordinaire one of the
rules of any good field operation any
good field office is anything that
people want to contribute is a value and
so I can't tell you how many field
organizations have been a part of where
you walk in the door and there's
somebody who's the comfort captain and
what that means is that it's a little
lady who comes and brings brownies and
coffee every morning and hangs out and
talks about what she thinks about the
president and it's awesome right that's
what she contributes so from that place
there's tons of those in every city and
every place around the country we had
about a thousand of them overall so this
is Albuquerque and you can see they've
got you know three neighborhood teams
that they're tracking again in paper on
a wall not in any way actionable or
data-driven or online so these are the
types of things that we were here to
change and you know people knew they
needed to change within the campaign
itself so organizers if nothing else
they're not you know they're super
resourceful so they started using stuff
bless you like Facebook and other beans
you know google groups yahoo groups to
start to organize their groups you know
online the unfortunate part was that
they weren't actually connected back to
the campaign in any meaningful way so
they weren't able to actually share
information or understand what's going
on they were more just like a little you
know Splinter Cell kind of running off
on their own so a lot of what we came
here to do was revised the technology
stack that existed this was from May
twenty-third of 11s when I first showed
up this crazy diagram is the thing that
we went through is we realized how all
the vendors existed and worked with the
campaign and with the DNC and what the
sort of relationships were back and
forth it was this crazy pile of stuff
and there was no clean way to see how we
could actually build an outreach effort
on top of that so our goal was to make
it a lot simpler so that's basically
what we were
about Yeah right make it clean so one of
the big challenges in terms of user
experience was that our users weren't
actually there alright so in campaigns
in general about eighty percent of the
work happens over the last two months so
when you're you know 15 16 months out
there's really nobody to test on because
there's nobody who's actually involved
there's not a lot of presence on the
ground there's not a lot of purpose and
having it yet it's expensive to keep
going so what we did instead was we
tried to build trust among our own team
members because everybody who'd worked
on the political side of the campaign
for the most part had been there for
quite a while right some of these folks
have been there five years someone had
been with the president since his state
Senate runs so they've been there almost
a decade so they're convinced that you
know the new kids on the block who are
showing up from industry are a little
bit suspect right they're like these
people you're here to make a start-up
out of all this you know what what is
their goal right and you know in reality
we're showing up and we're basically the
true believers were like oh we're here
because we believe in the president this
is great and they're like yeah okay
whatever like we don't we don't trust
you you know we've seen technology
people before who knows so some of the
stuff we did with early on was just like
this it's a participatory design session
we don't have actual users so we put in
stakeholders in the place of users we
had generated some personas user
personas by interviewing people who had
been field organizers for years ago we
asked them to reflect on what they knew
about you know organizing what the
issues were who the people were
described people in the field offices
describe how it all work together and
once you've done that we had them sort
of play act as the different people so
like here you can see there's a couple
user personas for each table there's
also beer very key at design sessions of
the campaign and then we'd ask people
from technology field and policy to get
together and describe what the software
would look like for these people we'd
have them draw it out and we'd take
those drawings when use those as the
basis for you know ongoing work but it
was definitely something that was unique
to this environment in a
that me personally I was not prepared
for you know I've been doing user
experience work for a long time and I
remember the days of having to explain
this is a wireframe this is a persona
this is why iteration is valuable I
wasn't prepared to do that here I
thought oh everybody it's 2011 I mean
who doesn't know that you do this stuff
it turns out a lot of people don't know
that you do these things and so you know
our approach was really viewed as being
really risky right in the past the
campaign would use vendors and those
vendors operated with the traditional
here's a big RFP you send it to the
vendor the vendor you're probably
friends with them they probably got
their start and organizing as well so
there's kind of some kind of prior
relationship they're going to disappoint
you by delivering maybe half of what
you're actually looking for not because
like they're trying to like screw you
but basically because they're really
tapped right political campaigns are not
giant money-making endeavors for
software developers they're they're
pretty much because they really believe
in what they're doing and so it gets
this kind of unhealthy dynamic so we
came in to change that dynamic and it
you know was a little a little tough
sledding early on so one of the things
that helped us out was we had this in
turn you may know when he's on the right
side of the screen there he was an
intern for us because in FEC law if he
actually stepped foot in the plane he
already couldn't actually do anything
because it was his you know FEC log
would determine like his past five
thousand dollars in value so mr. Schmidt
was an intern and so he would show up
and basically he did two things one he
kept us on target so he would do product
reviews this is a product review we're
doing for some of this stuff we've been
working on in the prior session and he
also just provided us with air cover
right you've got a team that you know we
were building things in the
slow-but-steady way that you do when
you're developing a giant infrastructure
project so a lot of what we were working
on wouldn't launch for almost a year so
in the meantime there's a campaign
that's running around you that is
focused on the now the moment the weekly
goal the monthly goal and there's these
you know slovenly looking people with
beards and you know like
interval t shirts in the corner and like
they're not doing anything right they're
not producing anything yet they look
kind of like a cost Center so one of the
things that that Eric was able to do is
tell the campaign like yes I've talked
to those people and they look funny but
they actually are sane and they're doing
good things and it will actually work
out for you and it provided us with some
pretty valuable cover for a while
because we had a lot of stuff to do so
we're on the campaign about five hundred
forty days it's a 50-state campaign
about a thousand field offices we had
10,000 of those neighborhood volunteer
leaders we had over two million
volunteer shifts so that means four
hours of phone banking four hours of
canvassing people did that over two
million times we registered over two
million people and in 25 battleground
states that we were most concerned about
we registered more people than the
margin of victory so this investment in
technology and field paid off 150
million phone calls total were made a
ton of them out of California so thank
you again if you were one of the people
doing that and we launched believe it or
not 200 apps during that five hundred
forty days so that's a metric ton of a
pitch and so you know we had a lot of
pressure on us we've communicated with
cake a lot during the campaign it made a
lot more sense at the time this was the
DevOps lead Scott vanden plas you know
brought this cake in right before the
election I think Eric Schmidt was the
only one who was brave enough to cut
into it was we were all convinced that
it was somehow a talisman at the end it
made sense I'm very little sleep but
seriously speaking we all felt a ton of
pressure you know at the end of the day
we knew that a lot more was riding on
this than just you know getting a good
job out at the end of the campaign or
whatnot it was a chance to impact the
direction of the country and contribute
to that it was also something that we
all felt very seriously as people
representing our craft that was the
first UX person on a presidential
campaign I felt a really huge sense of
duty that if things didn't measure up or
we underperformed and we lost that this
would be an experiment that wouldn't be
tried again because would be pointed at
it's a thing that failed right the
new thing is always going to be either
the thing that you know gets all the
credit so like we've gotten a lot of
credit out of this race because you're
oh look at technology that was a
differentiator and you know some of that
is true but in reality it's a ton of
really small pieces so you just work on
every little thing that you can and do
the most you can and every single little
thing and you hope that that total of
stuff that you've done adds up so I
guess the point being like you know
we're being praised as being the
Savior's but you know if we had lost
we'd also be being pilloried as the
people who totally screwed things up so
I'm going to take a moment to tell you a
little bit about how I came to be here
this is my hometown it's my backyard a
little town called Marinette it's it's
way way way up north so I'm from way
north in Wisconsin basically it's all
forest that's my fam I'm a little bright
looking chap there I'm old enough to
remember when Jimmy Carter gave his
speech about you know basically how
self-indulgence and consumption were not
the path to happiness and that it was
not going to actually engage her body
politic in a way that was meaningful our
country rejected that right we elected a
TV spokesperson instead but I was cool I
had an apple two things were good until
nineteen eighty six when that demand
Eugene hasenfus who happened to be my
next door neighbor got shot out of a
plane in Nicaragua because he'd been
hired by air America to drop weapons for
the Contras against the Sandinistas he
started the iran-contra scandal which
you know remembering what Jimmy had said
about you know trust transparency and
working together it seemed to be pretty
much the exact opposite that what our
government was doing it encouraged me to
do a lot of activism mostly volunteering
moved to Chicago join the band left the
band got married joined orbits helped
co-found group on and then you know kind
of was on my way had a daughter things
are great you know in 08 I was running a
professional services firm and user
experience in Chicago so I was actually
on a plane flying out here to work with
a client
we've been donors and I volunteered to
get out the vote in Wisconsin for the
president and for you know candidate
Carrie but that was sort of it that was
the end of my activism and you know
things change for me when my daughter
Vivian was born she was born three
months premature and so we were really
nervous about whether she would live and
for a while my wife's health she got
better and Vivian was still in the
hospital in one day at about four-thirty
on a friday i got a call at home saying
hey you guys miss filed this form in the
ER and it looks like what you need to do
is fax us this form of the doctor's
signature by five o'clock today or
you'll owe the entirety of the bill
which at that time was almost a half a
million dollars and so you know here we
are we're doing everything right right
we've got jobs we've got insurance we've
got all this stuff and on TV at the same
time we're hearing about death panels
and how awful you know the American Care
Act would be for people and so that
disconnect was really striking in my
head she's fine that's her there but you
know at the same time that she came out
the hospital citizens united was passed
and so it made me really wonder about
sort of transparency and where we were
headed so it was time to eat some
pierogies and hear a wonderful polish
dish my family makes him this is my gram
and my mom and my sister with my cousin
patty so we come together sort of a
generational thing my mom really held
her family together in about seven
months at this picture was taken she had
a brain aneurysm and we had to take her
off life support so we went and we
celebrated her life and I had my 40th
birthday and there I am after jumping in
the river because it was clear to me
that what I was doing in life you know I
suddenly have this reflection point
right I had this huge loss my mom when
she had a memorial almost a tenth of the
town showed up it showed me like how
valuable it was to be part of that
community right to have had that impact
on people and I realized you know I'm
doing good work we had a lot of good
clients things are kind of running
themselves this firm is doing good but
in reality I'm feeling a little bit
empty right it needs to be something
else to be connected with so obviously
it's a man in blazer with elbow patches
no this is this is actually a Michael
slavey he's the the chief innovation and
integration officer for the campaign so
one day I went to a local startup
thinking I was going to give them a sort
of a design 101 talk and in fact it was
slay be pitching Harper read Dylan
Richard Aaron salmon Scott Van der plas
and myself on you know joining the
campaign and talking about sort of where
the president was positioned and you
know thinking back to sort of what had
happened previously you know I knew that
you know if we didn't actually get him
reelected he would end up being another
Jimmy Carter right he'd be the person
that they point out and say oh yeah he'd
all these good ideas but Congress was
against him he's a nice guy but he just
couldn't get it done let's move on and
so I took a gigantic pay cut and went to
join a campaign for a candidate who was
considered unelectable given where
unemployment was that and we knew he'd
be outspent I have a very forgiving life
so and it worked right we won things are
good so what I just did right there is
called the story of self right and this
is a traditional organizing technique
and what I'm telling you what the story
of self is a challenge you know my
choice and the outcome right so my
challenge was finding meaning in my work
and meaning in my life my choice was to
join the campaign to find that it's a
really weird place to reinvent yourself
but it worked out and that's the outcome
it worked out here i am so story of self
is something that we use within
organizing to communicate and find the
story of us when you have that
one-on-one like we saw with the two
first Americans the notion there is that
you're communicating something about
yourself then you're hearing back about
the other person and you're finding
whatever it is within you that makes
your community right whether that's a
common cause or anything else you find
that touch point and you find what
affects your community and then you
figure out what the story of now is it
whoop and so the story now is
you know basically what you need to do
to move your community forward what are
the issues facing your community and how
do you move that in a direction that's
positive for both of you so that's
actually a format that's been taken up
by Marshall Ganz so he's the sort of the
the thought behind a lot of community
organizing stuff he's actually one of
the folks at Harvard who influenced 08
and influence 12 so this was not like
this in the snowflake model these ways
of organizing were things that were
never tried before in a political
campaign and so our job as user
experience people were to take those
types of values and move those into
software so that everything that we did
aligned with that sort of value set so I
realized pretty early on that a lot of
my job was not actually user experience
deliverables it was actually diplomacy
and consensus having it a nationwide
campaign with people with a lot of
different viewpoints and a lot of
different values and opinions that were
all super strongly held because they
believed that you know if you're not an
agreement you're jeopardizing you know
the president's reelection chances
diplomacy and consensus became a big
part of what i did and you know as a new
technology team it was necessary to
build those bridges and build that trust
so that people actually would allow us
to do some of the things that were more
innovative as we went on so one of the
first things I did was I organized our
own UX community so I went out I started
finding people to get involved this is
Dave castleton he interned for us for
nine months for free because he's crazy
and values driven this is him holding up
yet another printout from yet another
state from yet another field office who
does things slightly differently than
all the other ones that type of modeling
and that type of task flow we would
repeat over and over again across the
country to figure out sort of how we
could actually standardized things in a
way that made sense was easy to use both
for you know basically young folks on
mobile devices and older folks on
desktop computers this is a scout Addis
there's another one of our volunteers we
worked a lot as a triage center
you can imagine with 200 apps for the
most part it's really difficult to
actually stick with them and have a
meaningful design process from end to
end but you have a giant team because
there was you know close to 50 designers
on the team overall so what you're doing
is you're basically having folks like
Scout or me or some other folks that we
were recruited come in and quickly lead
a session quickly help things out and we
started early on doing full-on UX
deliverables and by the end we were
working almost solely with white boards
because of the speed of change this is a
mark trammell he came in from Twitter
and helped us out a whole bunch with our
social media we already had a great
social media team but he helped make it
one of the best in the world in addition
these are all the other volunteers that
helped out we organized a cross-country
user experience group and so we had
people in almost every battleground
state and a bunch of other states going
into field offices and running studies
on a regular basis that we knew how the
software was actually working we didn't
have a budget because nobody who'd run a
campaign before had ever thought that
you know he's your experience people
would travel they didn't really know
exactly what we did so the way that you
get around that is by recruiting
volunteers all over the country and
having them dedicate their nights and
weekends to helping out this is our
customer support team we didn't have a
support team budgeted because nobody
ever thought that launching software
would require support as one of the
challenges we had and we tried to make
sure we didn't need much support but
when we did need it that team of
volunteers actually came in organized by
Brady Chris and who's right up front
holding a little dashboard logo and we
got got people serviced relatively
quickly so we did some real traditional
sort of user experience stuff this is
sort of that ladder of engagement we
translated that to online and tried to
figure out what services and activities
were appropriate for people at which
stage in the process they were in you
know were they showing up to get engaged
was a showing up to learn more you know
trying to figure out from people's
motivations what they were doing and
sort of map out you know how we could
serve them we looked at a lot of other
sites for bed
practices because we you don't have a
lot of time to actually develop your own
best practices because you're moving
everything so quickly so the thing that
we did and you saw Romney do this as
well we stoled from wall of industry so
we just print out good examples of
whatever you know somebody using a task
flow to register somebody using a task
flow to navigate with a map somebody
doing you know whatever the task was we
would quickly go out and try to you know
as part of our process just see what
else people were doing make Romney
mostly copied us which made sense they
were behind us so you kind of go you
know after the folks in front bless you
so early on the campaign had balsamic oh
yeah tell you a little kind of funny
story about this so one day Edward Tufte
shows up and so like I didn't pick
balsamic i'm more of a paper and pen guy
and so they're like oh well we have
these balsamic licenses why don't you
use it I'm like okay I'll he already
bought it i'll try it out and i have my
team try it so we're building stuff in
this and it's not really well formed I
mean all this stuff is just basically
junk it's a concept it's nothing more
because our whole functional spec for
all the stuff that went on line was a
page long right it was there is no spec
so you just kind of go so we're going
and Tufte shows up and they're like hey
I have an idea as I'm walking in the
room like why don't you show your wire
frames to Tufte like oh well i can i can
tell you why but let's go let's see so
he was really nice and and things were
good and then we showed him this wire
frame he got extremely upset why would
you design for children like no we're
not busy it's not just a what why is
that typeface it's for children it's for
school children like okay yes the it's
balsamic it's a wire frame and it's so
why would you make it intentionally ugly
like a yes sir yes and then he's like
why what is up with this graph I'm like
well it's I'm not going to tell you it's
just a placeholder we're just going to
change the subject entirely you know so
is if anything worked out with that my
team was convinced I could take a
beating which is extremely useful in the
months to come this is our first
usability test
was actually a Linux developer he'd
never developed anything with the UI was
a mind-altering experience for him
apparently one of the things we did to
help people get engaged consistently was
we would test with skype into field
offices and we'd also do weekly
conference calls where we just have
basically open forums for people to give
us any feedback about ending the tools
we've released just again it's sort of
new in politics because for the most
part you communicate it up and down
through a hierarchy and we basically
gave people a direct line into
headquarters so that they could talk
about like anything and they did this is
Iowa as you can see this band is is
thrilled about the software the game has
been working on as he is these are two
folks actually using the buddy system so
this is was really common for us we
would have people who really weren't
that great with computers and people who
were and you never knew which was which
based on any of your common assumptions
you know you name it whatever whatever
stereotype you would think of you know
people divide them consistently one of
our best call tool users which is a tool
you could use online to call people and
communicate with them was a 91 year old
world war two bed so it's not the
traditional you know model that you're
thinking of but we made a user in Iowa
cry which is why I included this slide I
was probably one of the worst
experiences of my life it definitely
changed the team we're a little upset
they told her the only way she get
involved was via online like no that's
totally wrong it's a we're developing a
hybrid model where you can do you know
online or offline organizing so we
straighten things out but it was
definitely a low point and we basically
went out into the field quite a bit and
here we are doing research again in New
Mexico just talking with people but
eventually we got to sort of a
tile-based approach these are some early
sketches we did and then this is sort of
the final site at least for dashboard
which is our sort of online organizing
platform and towards the end you know we
basically were doing stuff like this we
print stuff up there's a bunch of
metrics sort of running down the side
here of where people are falling out of
the process and so we're doing this
because you couldn't just sit there and
do design work and then present
out to people this is Manning is pretty
common in industry but it was pretty new
for us again like you know there's more
of a vendor based approach previously
where people would kind of do stuff and
then come back and show it and so here
we would do this real time and we do
this with the people who actually were
our stakeholders so if you were part of
the field operation or part of digital
organizing or any one of the other
groups you could come and participate
directly and we just design it on the
fly and it started to have impact we
actually started to see you know a lot
of field offices actually pick up and
use dashboard and that was kind of a big
win for us we started to marry this
online and offline you know technology
effort and towards the end that we you
know felt comfortable enough with this
that we actually were able to get the
President to give an address to
volunteers on the platform we also had
Jim Messina Jeremy Byrd Marlon Marshall
all other people actually running the
campaign communicating directly to
volunteers so we morphed it towards the
end of the campaign basically into an
internal private TV channel where we
were able to communicate what we're
doing with the campaign and why people's
efforts were important during it so this
is from ARS technica this was sort of
the narwhal versus Orca debate you know
narwhal was our datastore Orca was an
app that the Republicans created for the
Romney campaign to do get out the vote
they were convinced that you know biga
stork has eaten our walls in reality we
did use your research that nationwide
network of volunteers we went out and
did three weeks of piloting to make sure
people could actually use the software
and we did a whole bunch of stress
testing to make sure it wouldn't fall
over they didn't do that so they were
shipping 80-page pdfs to senior citizens
the night before the election asking me
to print about at home it was a huge
fail they were convinced that we had
sabotage them we didn't have to which
was good I mean all schadenfreude aside
this type of thing could have very well
cost Romney the election in some ways
because it definitely blunted his turn
out effort he wasn't able to turn out as
many voters in the key battleground
states as he would have liked to so go
Orca so overall like what what made the
stuff that we do
work you know some of the big things go
back to community so just finding good
people doing good things and working
with them actually that that story of
self organizing stuff like noble it
works right if you start to understand
where people are coming from what their
motivations are and you take the time to
realize that and you realize your shared
values it's you know it takes time to do
but it's incredibly empowering and it
works really well you know like for us
you show up on day one nobody knows who
you are and you're trying to build trust
while you're trying to build an
incredible amount of software taking a
half hour out of your day well it's
really tricky to do because you're
working in insane amount of hours it
really helped because once you started
to build that trust you started to build
trusting each other and everything you
did moved faster and you're able to get
things done quicker early on it took us
forever to get everything done and
through and to get things worked on
because you weren't able to easily you
know you didn't have that trust but once
you've built it it was it worked wonders
something else to celebrate little
victories this is JP he's a DevOps guy
nobody else been campaign knew his name
except for the engineers because he just
sat in the corner and made everything
work flawlessly but here he is ringing
the bell so every time we made a million
bucks we get in donations somebody got
to ring the bell so even though nobody
knew JPS name we made sure he rang the
bell because you need him to get that
recognition you need him to share on
that little victory with everybody else
right you need to share it across your
team because we're a team that
communicates via cake we did it a lot
here we're going to production yes we
cake speaks for itself in addition you
know you really need to focus this is
one of the things that leadership taught
us early on if you're running in a
values-based organization and you know
what your mission is you can ignore all
the crazy stuff so you know you ignore
it when we're doing awesome like there
was a time in early summer reverends
like this election is over just give it
to the president and you ignore it when
like after the first debate people are
already to like just stick a fork in it
and also call it over you don't worry
about that you worry about what's
happening that day so you know if a
marching band shows up in your office
you just chill out and do
what you need to do to get things
working that day you also need to have
fun we worked seven days a week
especially towards the end of the
election this fellas named abby Noda he
fell asleep at his desk there were a lot
of like really evil things we could do
or like you could her ankle and say
you're not getting your work done
instead we just photoshopped him into
this picture of Justin Bieber and
distributed it around the office because
he can you know you have two responses
positive or negative so choose the
positive one you know press showed up
all the time and made these really
intrusive you know moments occur so
again you can complain about that or Ian
these who's an ex-googler you know just
turned around and took a photo of it
because you might as well just celebrate
that this stuff is happening and keep on
moving instead of getting all bent out
of shape that you can't control your
environment because you really can't do
it anyway one of the last things I
learned is that that value of community
is immeasurable so we were a campaign
that measured everything we ain't be
tested like crazy we measured everything
to the nth degree but at the end of the
day you know there's all these small
little pieces loosely join that actually
makes up a victory and one of the things
that brought you through at the end was
again having community building that
internal sense that your team is all
working together and that you understand
the motivations of each other and you
understand where you're coming from that
was enormously valuable because it sped
up everything we did and it was probably
one of the greatest things that led to
our success so a quick pitch here you
know if you do want to do something
about the way things are going in this
country stop complaining do something
you don't have to do it on a political
campaign organizing for action is
forming up if there's one thing I can
tell you about my experience they
definitely need designers they
definitely need user experience people
if you don't want to work for somebody
like that there's a ton of nonprofits
that are horribly underserved by
technology and technologists in general
they would love your time and attention
so if there's anything in your community
that you feel you know I wonder if I
should do that yes you should let me
totally reassure you you should and
that's about it thank you very much
as we have a few minutes for questions
if you have question raise your hand
I'll come around with the mic so you can
pick you up on on all your audio feeds
and i will stop i'm sure you have time
later on too if we end up running a bit
over totally open it and that's me there
on the on the gmail and the twitter and
all that so if you need don't get your
question answered here you're in the
remote site i'm more than happy to chat
about any of this thanks there was a
great oh thank you um so it seems like a
big work on hacking the existing
assistant very effectively mm-hmm I mean
that obviously um was there any kind of
a post-mortem on how broken the system
is and why it was necessary to do what
you did and why what you would like to
see better it seems more of a go away
about certain who's that is called for
granted and trying to junior yes
definitely so I was part of the
transition team so after the election
some of the staff are held back so we
participated in some cases three or four
months to kind of keep things running to
organizing for action which is sort of
the new entity that's been set up but
yeah we do a full 360 so every
department writes our own post-mortem
and then overall the campaign writes a
post-mortem one of the things I did as
well was I went through every app that
we built that I could find it was still
running in some fashion and I gave a
walkthrough on it because one of the
things that was really tough going from
12 was that we'd get like a zip file
from 08 it's like all these two guys who
are at Google they made this in a
weekend on their free time you know and
here it is and you get this zip file and
it had like dot svn you know like
directory structure and stuff but you're
like okay it's this was clearly in
version control somewhere and there was
an author at some point but now there's
none of that so yeah we definitely made
an effort to do that and like a lot of
what happened culturally as well I think
we'll actually shift things and make it
better next time around people just
weren't really sure how you'd actually
integrate technology in a campaign and
people weren't really sure that it would
work
and so we were approached much more as a
service bureau than as a sort of a place
where strategy and innovation could
happen we got there by the end but it's
definitely something we want to see the
campaign and just you know the
organization's build on over time I
guess I was thinking figure than that
which is how the election system itself
be broken and we'd like to have seen
that change you got it yeah yeah oh
definitely I mean I think this is us
came up in the am a from the President
on Reddit and he even addressed it in
the state of the union last night right
that like it took you if you were in
Florida it took you 20 two times longer
to vote than if you lived in Vermont and
that is not fair it's not equitable
there's a lot in terms of legislatively
where things fall there but it's
definitely one of the priorities for the
president in his second term in office
to try to straighten that out so one of
the issues is that you know polling
places are funded at the county level
right they're not funded their county
and state it's not a federal funding
mechanism but he announced last night in
the state of the union that he's
assembling a panel of bob barr from our
campaign and romney's lawyer as well to
try to come up with basically a set of
Election Day changes that would be
better for the country because yeah it
needs to change and you know in reality
you know 12 was sort of the last chance
for this type of Republican strategy to
work in other words if you combine
disenfranchisement with lots of money
you can kind of squeeze through the door
by holding on to sort of the old white
guy vote that that's the last election
that's going to work in I mean the
country is changing and demographics are
changing people are moving online so
there's a lot of things that are moving
against that being a viable strategy
I think during the campaign i was
getting anywhere from four to six or
eight emails every single day and I the
entire time I was wondering are they
aware that each individual is getting
six emails a day any coordination what
did you see a return on the investment
because from my perspective I felt like
it was oh it was this constant of almost
crying of wolf we need money we need
money we still need money we need even
more money we know you gave money but
can we have more money and but you know
I I decided you know my family we
realized how much we could give to the
campaign and we gave it at that time it
wasn't like we were holding out for like
the next better offer that you might you
might be able to give us so I'm just I
definitely would have hoped that instead
it would have been a more nuanced effect
of hey you know we're only going to come
to you when there's something new for
you to defer for us to engage you in so
I was just really curious how that was
decided and measured so one of the big
conflicts that we had within the
campaign itself was that we had two
different teams we had a digital team
which was responsible for everything
from signage at events to inspirational
videos and infographics to fundraising
right because they they were responsible
for content so I could advise into them
but I couldn't actually like have any
control over what they did on the other
hand they had a metric that they were
held accountable to which was dollars
raised and so you know without having
any direct ability to affect change i
would run these usability tests and I
think you know some of the volunteers
that we had would run would use at neo
online and we do these live intercepts
and we would say things like look you
are turning away a vast majority of the
electorate by asking for email or money
right up front like get them in to see
if you can persuade them and see how
things would change or hey maybe these
emails are killing people you know
it's just I mean I'm getting fatigued
and I work here right like maybe there's
other ways for us to ask people to get
involved and so we we definitely had a
lot of tension there and I think one of
the things that we came up with from the
post-mortem was this hope that people
would do more of this and like campaigns
don't have a unified there's not a
unified metric and we tried to drive
towards this because otherwise you don't
really know what you're designing
against but if you don't know if a vote
registered is more valuable than a
volunteer shift is more valuable than a
dollar raised like you can't really
figure out and adjust for it so yeah I'm
with you to say that yourself did it
seem like the message it's yes it's
changing a lot I mean I think you know
again like we weren't we were looked at
as like a service provider but towards
the end people start to realize like
when we did the Facebook deal where you
can sort of reach out and register
friends they started to realize oh
there's like there's other things you
can do online then just make money but
you know go so hopefully it'll keep
moving that way is that it is a great
article is this week it explains why
they sent so many camping emails and it
says that it just because it worked like
you were saying they had to raise that
much money did the majority of the 690
million dollars Obama raised online came
from fundraising emails yep so yeah it's
like he was just the best option they
kept doing it yeah I mean it it worked
it made the same thing you know it's a
it's a really tricky deal it's one of
the things we're like one of the
components of a one on one is called the
hard ask so at the end you have this
great moment of like that we've shared
our stories and then I sit there and go
hey can you phone bank on Wednesday no
Thursday no friday so like you even the
design of like our quick donate stuff
yeah you set up your account and you
donate 10 bucks and we respond with hey
did you mean to do that you can hit undo
or you can donate again right so it's
like it's we have to be a little
shameless which is a little embarrassing
but there you go yes he's not gonna
laugh about your rating like if I'm
whiteboards
crap how sustainable do you think that
is for a start-up or another business or
company do you think that your unique oh
that other companies could operate in
this fashion successfully um I think
we're a little unique in that way you
know I think we did a lot with kind of
best practices and identifying stuff but
you know everything you're doing is kind
of disposable so we would do things like
we'd run weekly a/b tests and you know
it was you like optimized for against
the current state and you sort of had
some institutional memory that oh yeah
we tried this thing a year ago and it
didn't work but those are the types of
things that in an organization that was
ongoing you'd want to capture is like as
past knowledge and we didn't do that may
I have you know hundreds of versions of
different flows that we discarded and
like some of those flows might have
actually worked better but we just
didn't we didn't keep them and so I
think there's definitely a time like
we're a start-up kind of gets to a point
where it's operationalizing it's kind of
growing in scale and you have to be able
to communicate and share that knowledge
and keep it and we we never approached
that sort of breakout point because
you're just basically you're kind of
triaging stuff and you're doing it with
like okay this is where it is today this
is where it needs to get to let's take
an hour and go I don't I don't think
it's sustainable or frankly all that
healthy the way we worked you just have
to do it you know you can't move any of
the dates without an act of Congress yes
why it seems to me like all these
campaign work that you guys did is just
connected to Obama 2012 it seems to me
like a much better organizing principle
for collecting the result of all this
work would be to accumulate it in
something more long-lived than like one
shot one election especially when you
consider like there
elections that are going on and a lot of
these things would probably be you know
shareable across a wide range so it's
like you know one of the things about so
much money in politics is you know Obama
needed to raise a billion dollars
because every single election needs to
do its own thing independently doesn't
that seem kind of crazy it is entirely
crazy yes we did open source one thing
which was the voter registration piece
because we believe that open sourcing
that had no perceived advantage for the
other side because if worse came to
worst they registered more people which
is you know fine we're going to expand
the electorate regardless a lot of the
other stuff you know we built in a very
purpose driven way and so from like a
campaign leadership point of view they
don't they don't care about that because
their job is only to re-elect the
president so it's an enormously
short-sighted goal in that way when you
look at all the infrastructure built up
one of the hopes for transitioning all
the work that we did to organizing for
action is that they're going to you need
some help in figuring out sort of if
they can bring some of the stuff back
out in some way that would be you know
meaningful and usable by others other
people other campaigns see me though
that that you're making sort of by
saying like well we can open source this
one piece just because there's no we're
not giving up any competitive advantage
it seems to me like you could make that
argument across the entire open source
community and the entire open source
community kind of disproves it of the
onion wouldn't buy modeller everything
open source make just make a lot more
sense for everybody i I wouldn't
disagree but um I think we're probably
birds of a feather I think when you look
at people who are for the most part not
technologists not really aware of what
open source means or how open source
communities contribute and evolve you
know it's it looks like a tremendous
risk and your job is to minimize risk
and so it's it's easier for them just to
say hey look our job was to really like
the president we did that and now we
have these assets that have a strategic
value or they have you know whatever
else is in there calculus so we're going
to we're going to
do the things that we believe are right
for us to do with it that ain't part of
transition part of what we did from a
technology standpoint was make the case
to open-source lots of things they'll
make the right decision you know for for
the organization and hopefully they'll
take a longer-term view it will take a
long time to see how that comes out
because it may very well be that you
know like the President himself will
make that decision and so it's not
probably you know top the to-do list
about that um the money that's given to
a campaign like that are those basically
to publish comes I mean it seems like it
seems to me like maybe it's kind of like
when the national geographic information
surveyed collects data that's public
data right is it the same sort of deal
with campaign contributions or not no
it's different it's a different type of
nonprofit entity so based on the top
type of nonprofit like 501 C 3 versus C
4 versus c6 the purpose of the
organization bless you is different and
so that's why I like you can't write off
contributions to a political campaign
but you but you can with stuff like
National Geographic and the the the
purpose of the entity determines the
taxable status and also determines what
happens with the assets it creates yes
first of all I really want to thank you
as a volunteered for making these tools
so amazing you and easy
use a second I was wondering if you are
contemplating putting together some kind
of book of presentation of paper about
how user experience effects elections so
from the butterfly ballot which was
really a super poor user experience
through to your work and orca how how
that impacts that's a really good idea
thanks for the question yeah I mean Dana
chiz Nell is doing a lot of really good
work on some of the the ballot and sort
of voting experience yeah it's a really
it's quite a compliment and thank you
for volunteering so I think we have time
for maybe just one more question if
there is one and if not Jason's going to
hang out for a little bit and we'll
probably go out to lunch tousif anyone
want to join us for lunch feel free
thanks it thanks again for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
