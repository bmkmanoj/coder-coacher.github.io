Dave ski I'm a software engineer here at
Google Zurich come on in we haven't
started yet and I have no idea what the
fire marshals say about this room so
just go come on in bring a chair you run
yeah we're right by the fire exit what
could be the problem famous last words
so I am very happy to introduce dr. Fred
singer he happened to be in Zurich and I
happen to find out about it in time to
invite him here and I'm not going to go
over Fred's bio I sent you all the
Wikipedia link and there's plenty more
you can find out but fred has had a long
and distinguished career in a number of
areas in science and he can tell you
more about that than I can so dr. singer
I know there will be plenty of time for
questions I'll take some from the floor
and some from the Dory and we're
scheduled to end at five but if anybody
wants to say longer I have no place to
go and dr. singer is graciously agreed
to stay for dinner here at Google so
this is thursday I think I'm in
Switzerland right great see all of it
alone I will speak in my international
English using short sentences if anyone
has trouble hearing me raise your hand
I'm delighted to be here as I kind of a
pickup appearance I was invited to a
conference in Eritrea Sicily which took
place last week we're just actually just
left yesterday and spoke there and a
thought as long as I'm in Europe I
should visit other places I have invited
to speak at the University of Hamburg
and in Holland that in Brussels and in
London at imperial college and then in
France I mean Zurich because I had an
interview this morning but I'm delighted
by your turn out here they hope to get
some very good challenging questions I'm
ready to proceed in any way you like I
will turn to my friend Adam and ask him
out to put questions to me if you have
them or if not i will just give my brief
introduction and then let you ask any
questions you like i'd say let's go for
five or ten mini production and then we
have we have enough questions to keep us
busy I i showed you one question in
advance he said you could take an hour
answering just that one yeah well we'll
try and do just a couple minutes for
questions I will spend about five
minutes or so as an introduction I've am
a physicist I'm a professor at the
University of Virginia I don't teach
anymore I run a project called the
science and Environmental Policy Project
which tries to apply scientific
principles and knowledge to important
environmental issues we've looked at
different issues that appealed to me
personally as an atmospheric physicist
so we've looked at the acid rain we've
looked at stratospheric ozone got
sidetracked into looking at
gone asbestos or I don't claim to know
much about health effects but ended up
spending most of our time on the issue
of climate change which happens to be
close to my general specialty of
atmospheric physics climate change is a
challenging and interesting problem and
is challenging because it has not only
scientific ramifications but policy
ramifications economic ramifications it
has involved the nations of the world
and by close estimate some hundreds of
billions of dollars have been spent on
this issue in my estimation uselessly
wasted this money should have been
better spent on helping the poor in the
world achieve a better living standard
better environmental quality for
drinking water for food and so on
instead has been wasted in a variety of
issues that I hope we can touch on in
the question period I thought I would
confine my introductory remark purely to
the science and leave the policy and
economic issues to questions the basic
issue in the science is very simple we
know that climate changes all the time
it's been changing for millions of years
I will be billions of years we have some
knowledge of past climate change we have
more detailed knowledge of climate
change in the last hundred years thanks
to thermometers and in the last 30 years
thanks to satellites carrying radiation
instruments so we're looking at a very
small slice of the history of a climate
history of a planet earth we try to
figure out this fundamental question
which is how much of this climate change
is natural and how much of this
is man-made the word is anthropogenic so
long word anthropogenic both effects are
plausible in other words we know the
climate change has always taken place on
a natural basis there's no reason to
think that these natural causes whatever
they are have suddenly stopped just
because we are producing carbon dioxide
through the burning fossil fuels so
natural change is certainly plausible
but on the other hand we know that human
activities burning of coal oil and gas
has increased the carbon dioxide content
of the atmosphere at least most people
think so there are some dissenters
obviously OST setters so and we know the
carbon dioxide is what's called a
greenhouse gas it means it absorbs
infrared radiation based on laboratory
measurements no question about that so
one would expect that the increase in
carbon dioxide would have noticeable
climate effects it's plausible how can
you decide if you look at a thermometer
and you see the temperature going up
let's say over a period of 20 or 30
years how can you tell whether the cause
is natural or man-made how would you
tell supposing I hand you a record of
temperature change and say okay here's
how the temperature has changed in the
world in the last 30 years tell me is it
natural or is it man-made it's a very
difficult issue one has to look at some
detailed evidence in the discussions
that have taken place it has been
generally agreed
there's only one methodology that works
that is to compare so-called climate
models that use an increase in carbon
dioxide as a driver use the predictions
of these models and check them against
observations obviously the models
predict the future we don't know what
the observations of the future will be
so what one does is to look at pretend
that the climate model starts let's say
in 1980 30 years ago and compare the
results of these model calculations with
the observations of the last 30 years
taking account that the observations are
never perfect those uncertainties and
their surface in the models well it
turns out that this has been done and
guess what the results are the models do
not agree with the observations now it's
interesting and this is an interesting
political point both the models and the
observations that i will show you come
from the same source the so-called IPCC
french geee see it's anyway it's the
science panel Clemont rot mr. shall
throw Evans call of the United Nations
so using their models and their
observations we can do a comparison so
I'll quickly show you what that looks
like
does this have a point on it Oh a
pointer a laser pointer or something
like that I don't think we have a laser
pointer anybody know otherwise choose
the most mystery yeah I give write it
right they can see your mouse pointer on
the screen that work well or anything
you see here the audience sees ok oops
this moves very fast I could yeah I
could slow it down for you you want let
me know yeah probably well yes hold on
check brake system preferences was it
mouse or keyboard and mouse there it is
mouse tracking speed from weight fast
all right scrolling speed also slower ok
ok I know how I know have a slow mouse
first of all I will try to pick out the
results of the models yeah it works as
you see it comes from an official report
I've added nothing to this I need to
orient you here is the equator here's
the North Pole here's the South Pole
this is altitude the colors indicate the
temperature trend over the last
conceived 50 years ok it shows that the
temperature trend has a maximum in the
upper troposphere that's about a 10
kilometers altitude over the tropical
region this is a result of every climate
model the IPCC has kindly collected
these data and presents them in this
graph
so now this is what we have to compare
with observations how do you observe
temperature trends in the app in the
troposphere the answer is with radio
songs carried in balloons at weather
stations there's some 100 or so of
stations in the world that have radio
songs regularly measure temperature as a
function of altitude and they've been
measured now since nineteen fifty eight
which is the reason why this starts in
58 so we have the measurements there may
be some problems with them but those are
small technical problems so let's look
at the measurements oh let's see here we
are no hot spot in fact you get a cool
spot in other words the observations
disagree completely with the results of
the models now the funny thing is in
this report they admit this but in the
summary of the report they say well must
be something wrong with the observations
of course we don't believe that so what
we've done is to publish a paper shown
here which lays it all out this is our
paper published in 2007 we probably
should send but this is it it shows that
the model the trend here's trend trend
is measured in degrees per decade and
here's the altitude measures pressure or
as altitude and kilometers kilometres
might be easier for you you see that the
morals shown increasing trend which
peaks at around ten kilometers yeah
well these they show the era bands for
the models some dispute about that also
lots of disputes and here are some of
the observations analyzed by different
groups group in the United States by
NOAA and a group in England that the
heavy center and a group in Germany and
so they all show a decreasing trend so
the mobs for an increasing trend
observation show decreasing trend end of
story not quite obviously this result
has created a lot of consternation among
the alarmist with global warming
alarmist in the United Nations and they
have been feverishly trying to do
something about the fact that this
disagreement has now been published in
the open literature if you read the
Climategate email have your hard work
Climategate you eat the emails you will
see the constellation and saying how
could this paper have been published in
a recognized journal we should have
stopped it well they've stopped other
papers they've managed not to stop this
one however they've tried to respond to
it in some way it's interesting how they
responded they manufactured a new data
set that shows first of all in increase
with altitude and then they expanded the
error bars to cover all of the data
obviously if you have error bars wide
enough you can explain anything so now
we are they responding to this and
showing it they made errors statistical
errors other errors and will try to try
to get it published we've it's been
turned down already by two journals
that's one of the problems which I hope
we can discuss later that it's becoming
increasingly difficult to publish
scientific work that contradicts the
accepted wisdom
of the United Nations panel all right
that's this point number one in point
number one I have simply used the IPCC's
bottles and observations now I will show
your point number two where I examine
closely the IPCC models and this is my
exhibit number two what are all these
squiggles mean let me explain marvelous
when they run a model if they're careful
they will run it more than once they'll
run in a second time without changing
the model in any way they simply run it
again why do they do that because they
get a different result so they average
the two and publish the average normally
the models will not tell you the results
of each run normally one exception the
Japanese bless them the Japanese climate
model uses five runs and they published
in the open literature the result of
each of the runs number one two three
four and five and if you look closely
you will see that each run gets a
different trend this first run gets a
trend of 0.042 degrees per decade the
second run gets a trend which is almost
ten times as large and anything in
between so not only are the trends
different but they are different by a
large factor
this has now been published so my
question to you is sorry did you say it
has now the publisher is not it has been
published I've simply reproduced in here
my question is which of these trends
then should one compared with the
observed rate 1 2 3 4 5 or none of the
above the right answer is none of the
above because if you run another bar
another run you'll get a different
result again this is a consequence of
the chaotic character of nonlinear
partial differential equations the
climate models use nonlinear partial
differential equations through a
dynamics and other things are involved
in this and one of the properties of
these nonlinear partial differential
equations is that they are chaotic which
means that the result depends on the
initial conditions and you never get the
same initial conditions if you do or a
second run always slight differences so
we have done a study which we hope to
publish it's been sent in so far it has
not been turned down it's been sent to a
journal in Germany which is the other
guys may not have heard of yeah haha it
the it's a matter of finding an editor
who's as an open mind and is willing to
send it out for for review so our result
shows it is that you have to run a model
let's look at the blue one at least 10
times before the asymptotic value is
reached in other words if you take a
cumulative average of these trends you
have to round at least ten 10 of these
before the
the cumulative average settles down to
lessen Tata value that's what we find
for that he jumps around a lot this is
440 around for 20 year runs that the
shorter runs you even have to do 20 runs
before you reach an asymptotic value
okay why is this important well it's
important because none of the IPCC
models has more than five runs most of
them have only one or two that's what
they publish the result of one run which
is meaningless just meaning us and then
they average all the runs together
giving equal way to the single run
models and the multi-run models which
makes no sense either obviously the
multi role models must be more reliable
than the single role models that's all I
want to say about IPCC models now let me
talk about IPCC data that's the last
item okay yeah how long does it take to
do one of these runs quite a long time
and that's why they don't do many ones
expensive it takes time and expense and
marvelous would rather play with new
ideas in modeling then do the same run
over and over again but they must do
that if they want to produce a reliable
result now I'm sorry have questions bad
one question you see these a long time
how long you can't hear how long you
said it takes a long time to round them
all depends on the bottle and depends on
the speed of the computer I don't know
these I don't know these hats these
mounts for what are we talking I don't
know these answers but we can discuss
that later we who ran the models
I'm trying to oh I hope that's all I
think I think I have it okay yeah can
you all see the top curve a trans global
temperature over the last hundred years
just look at the red curve this is the
standard view of how global temperature
has changed in the last hundred years
which I will now critique you will see
two large increases one between 1910 and
1940 this increase is genuine a genuine
i mean it is reliable it is seen in
other kinds of data you'll see another
reported increase between 1979 and 2000
this increase is fake it does not exist
in my view it is only seen in the
surface data taken from weather stations
now we've had doubts about that for some
years but you know you cannot really
make these statements people will say
you're crazy but since Climategate since
we know that these people have been
manipulating the results from weather
stations in some way it has become less
hazardous to attack such results so what
I've done
which people are nipping I cared here
which people are manipulating data and
River stations we have no evidence that
they actually manipulate the data but i
will show you some possibilities of how
one can easily do this remind me to come
back to that so you're saying they did
not that nobody's amazing night I woke a
world because I thought you see people
were definitely minute 90 days in river
station well I'll come to this right now
one way in which you can show a warming
without it really taking place is by
going see now lost my way well anyway
I'm at the slide sorter I go back to the
slide sorter here ok I think I'd be able
to find it now
we have found six different pieces of
evidence against this warming I will
quickly list them all this some of them
some are very technical which I will not
go into but some are fairly obvious easy
to understand first of all the
atmospheric data don't show any warming
as during the same period while the
surface is said to be warming the
atmosphere is not warming that makes no
sense from the point of view atmospheric
theory in fact the atmosphere has to
warm more rapidly than the surface you
remember the early slide it showed that
the maximum trend is reached at 10
kilometers the atmosphere has to warm
more rapidly than the surface by about a
factor of 2 why we don't see it why you
want that why is it that the atmosphere
has to rise the app why does the
atmospheric temperature have to rise
more rapidly than the surface
temperature why what to do this I have
to explain a lot about the atmosphere
alright let's come back to that later
it's in the textbooks how is that for
that answer it's in the textbooks on
atmospheric atmospheric physics it has
to do with what is called moist
adiabatic adjustment of the lapse rate
the lapse rate measures the rate at
which temperature changes with altitude
and in the tropics this is done by
moisture which in the form of clouds is
carried over to high altitudes when the
clouds liquefy and release the heat and
rain out the heat remains in the
atmosphere and that's a simple way of
looking at it moist adiabatic adjustment
idiomatic enters of the lapse rate all
right we'll google that later
ok so the balloon data don't show any
rice the satellite data don't show any
rise either now we're looking at the
time between 1979 in 1997 this segment
here this statement okay let's just look
at the satellite data because they are
the most reliable these are the
published satellite data since the
beginning of a satellite record in 1979
and you see between 1979 1997 is hardly
any warming if you analyze it in detail
and I've done this the warming is
essentially zero the trend is
essentially zero degrees per decade this
large speak happens to be the El Nino of
1998 which was a super El Nino came
along lastly for one year then it
dropped back down again to the normal
value and there was a dozen sudden jump
in temperature and then in the last 10
years this has been essentially no no
upward trend so no one poor trend in the
satellite data I've seen this very few
bought the last couple of months we are
up again 2009 you but said we are
actually up to a max recording
temperature here to definitely if you
call that so that goes through may we go
through what August I mean yes that
really be important for discussion yes
yes actually there is no downward there
is it there is a brief drop but we
actually back at the level that they
have their linear but we don't have
clean you now so that's kind of if you
drop if you throw the El Nino has
nothing to do with human he looks very
with human activities it is a
fluctuation in oscillation in within the
atmosphere ocean system and that is why
normally we would stop the record before
they are linea always make some
allowance for the El Nino some people
prefer to simply eliminate that one year
and then you'd have a record which looks
roughly like this let me jump to the
last set of you don't want to go earlier
later later okay just down a little to
the next arrow yeah up down sorry down a
little more up here let me that arrow oh
I don't think dr. singers used to
Macintosh before so I blame steve jobs
for this okay thank you we've gone too
far so we'll go back up again well going
off you were good at yeah there you okay
sorry yeah you're going up yeah okay i'm
going to show what i called proxy data
proxy data are a non thermometer data
that show temperature this is a business
really other geologists that's how
prehistoric temperatures are measured by
geologists it was really measure the
oxygen 18 isotope or something like that
or they measure the width of three rings
or they measure the oxygen 18
stalagmites or they measure deep-sea
sediments various various devices that
geologists have developed to us to
measure prehistoric temperatures
obviously can also be met used to
measure more recent temperatures so i
will quickly
show you some of the you again go to
slide sorter and more familiar with this
yeah we also looked at the sea surface
temperature we looked at the ocean heat
content none of these show let me stop
at this point and look at this someone
asked about data manipulation to do this
we need to discuss first of all the
so-called urban heat island effect we're
all familiar with the fact that urban
areas are warmer than the countryside
it's an established fact that it has an
easy explanation because a lot of energy
is generated in urban centers and
therefore urban areas are warmer than
the surrounding countryside you can see
it by the fact that snow melts in the
city but will remain in the suburbs ok
this is a result from California I think
you just barely see it it shows the
results of 107 weather stations 29 of
those are in areas over more than a
million people it shows a strong
temperature trend of the law over the
last century you see how temperature
increases over the last century you see
here the rise between 1910 and 1940 very
very distinct decrease after that and
nothing much more but this last one here
is from counties that have less than a
hundred thousand people so sparsely
settled counties mostly countryside of
farming areas 27 stations shows
perfectly no temperature trend
and also a lower temperature that makes
sense and it's generally accepted well
now comes a question what are these
people do that produce the global
temperature record we have 6,000 weather
stations in the world how do they select
those that form the basis of the global
record answer they choose the best
stations what is best that's a personal
matter that's men's on their judgment
let me show you the judgment of one of
these yeah
this is the same 107 station from
California and this shows the stations
that were selected six of them all
showing a large global warming trend
they did not select any that showed a
cooling trend or any that shoulder trend
that was near zero now why would they
select stations with a warming trend so
the other great 18 they thought these
were the best stations who is the with
the organization doing the selected this
was guess NASA yes hansen's Jim Henson
and his people yes and they selected
these seeks the next Doctor this is
published yeah and this is the only
thing station they ever look at this
happens to be the ones they selected for
California I don't have any data all
other selections but I can discuss this
as an example so let me discuss this as
an example they selected the stations
they thought were the best I don't think
that they had any other intentions
they're not doing they're not committing
fraud they were using their judgment as
to what were the best stations now guess
where are the best stations in airports
where the best stations in Africa they
have very few stations there in airports
because nobody else needs weather
stations any other place airports are
warming so that this proves that
airports are warming I'm wearing to
accept that it doesn't mean that there's
global warming it has nothing to do with
carbon dioxide has to do with the fact
that air traffic is increasing I'll come
to the minute air traffic is increasing
airports are being becoming urban
centers my airport in Washington is
dulles if you know dollars if you knew
dollars 20 years ago was in the Bulldogs
with way way out in the country now it's
become a city
office buildings around it traffic going
back and forth more runways added
obviously it has been warming so our
suggestion is that much of the reported
warming trend in the last 30 years is
simply in urban heat island effect due
to a selection of stations we don't know
the answer to that and I'm not qualified
to do this but somebody obviously will
go over this work it's painful work you
know we have to look at 6,000 stations I
don't want to do that and then discover
what what happened how the selection was
done yes sir and how does this look like
if you completed all 6,000 stations I
mean it's Global War II out of this
curve look back you consider all
stations I have only basic statistics on
that let me show you what I have whoops
this shows the number of weather
stations in the world it started with
very little in the year nineteen hundred
it increased rapidly after World War two
he reached the peak United 70 and then
he shut down half the stations many of
the station shut down we're in Siberia
they were shut down after the soviet
union dissolved what happened is without
making any judgments but the sampling
population has changed during the last
hundred years obviously this the way in
which the growth was sampled has changed
as the number of stations has changed
well if the sampling population changes
you can change the result for example if
you eliminate all of the mountain
stations the remaining stations will
show a warming if you eliminate all of
the Arctic stations Siberian stations
the remaining stations will show a
warming
because so that has to be looked into
are you saing sai clean your ears so if
you what you're saying is if we
eliminate stations and kind of places Oh
need somebody who can translate for me
okay I didn't understand the statement
but if you eliminate yeah yeah why it is
interior is it if you eliminate budget
reason and you can budget the budget
then we'll spend so much money so we
think Siberia is getting told that okay
what will you say eliminate Siberia are
you comparing the new data without
Siberia to the old data with Siberia
those are you okay that's so that that's
why you change the separate populations
you will change the resort in points
from the old data when they do the
comparison yep to be fair you must keep
the same distribution of samples
throughout otherwise the trends become
artificial yeah I may be a better stay
here well yeah so I've tried I I had to
stop because I had a day job and I tried
to actually look at some of the data
points they're actually real temperature
series available on the internet going
back almost 400 years to some of the
earliest direct thermostat records i
mean the oldest one is in England but
there's some that are almost as old and
I'll try and get more time and publish
links to that but you know the problem
is when you look at the oldest records
and you just follow those those tend to
be in cities that are getting bigger /
times you're trying to look for old
records and for records that are stayed
rural and it's it's a tricky business
but anyway we've gone over I think I
think we're ready for some questions
from the Dory and the audience that
sound good the questions that we did
just lettin cancel should we do them
first look mom needs a question in each
case i will definitely repeat the
question we should do that for the for
the event for the video anyway so uh
bubble did you have a question that was
on the table
as we mentioned that the model stick a
long time to run I'm asking for the
magnitude of this long yeah it is long
time to run a day a week a month or a
year if the model takes a long time to
run how long is a long time Oh several
weeks several weeks all right models are
very complex it depends on the length of
them of the rod of course so uh okay so
here okay here's a question from the
dory can you imagine circumstances or
evidence that would cause you to change
your mind yes evidence don't we show me
some evidence in other words um show me
real warming of a real warming trend in
the atmosphere that matches the
calculated warming trend on the models
then i will say but this doesn't prove
that the models are correct but at least
it makes it plausible in other words
it's very difficult to prove the
positive it's easier to show the
negative it's easier to disprove
hypothesis but that's well known it only
takes one fact to disprove a hypothesis
so just um regards evidence and there
was a report in 2009 from the world
meteorological organization that did
suggest that the decade of the 2000s is
in fact the warmest decade in modern
record i'm talking about data
manipulation i did actually notice that
most of the grass he showed us pretty
much just stopped at the year 2000 and
some of the ones you were showing
results of the models for the japanese
runs you can a highlight to the point 0
to change but all the other five
preceding ones under its suggested an
increase in plus point 3 more or less on
average they all suggested an increase
if you average them together and not an
insignificant one and there is this i
mean there's a few if we almost be nice
to get
again but I would take issue with some
of I mean your watch the questions that
we're moving up there oh I I guess the
question is did you cherry-pick the data
and show only the well I heard the first
part of okay so let me answer that how
old is ever a ball says that this decade
is the warmest decade in the last
whatever 100-200 years or so that's
correct modern record yeah that's what
does it made it but it's absent from
most of your graphs that seem to stop on
the UT thousands of course it is the
warmest it's been warming for the last
150 years ever since the end of the
Little Ice Age we know that the climate
has natural cycles I've written a book
on this called unstoppable global
warming every fifteen hundred years is a
1500 year cycle and there was a medieval
warming and then when green it was warm
in the Vikings settled greenland and
formed the southern tip of Greenland and
then the little ice age came along and
Europe got very cold and we have
historic records of failed harvests
people starving and miserable time and I
could warm again starting around 1850 so
since eighteen fifty the earth has been
warming naturally why there's no
question about that okay did the one I
showed between 1910 in 1940 is real ok
not produced by human active okay I i
I've worked with Henrik for a while so i
think i can raise is that if if if if
the warming is not caused by mankind and
our carbon dioxide what is causing the
warming that's a very very good question
this is a question which is hotly
debated among this in the scientific
community it depends
on the time scale if you're asking about
what is causing climate change over
millions of years now I'm asking about
morality then it is the motion of
countenance and the building of mountain
chains if you ask what is causing
climate change over tens of thousands of
years 100,000 years then it is changes
in the orbit of the earth with respect
to the Sun the eccentricity the earth
orbit is changing the inclination is
changing and the earth axis is wobbling
if you ask what is causing climate
change on the time scale of decades and
that is the interesting one because that
affects humans we don't really care
about millions of years we're not going
to be around that long so what we ask
what is changing climate on the order of
decades the answer is or seems to be I
have to be careful you want me to uh I
think that I wake it up again I have as
well what is causing the Fred singer
cycle 15 on it here so what's called
knows about the climate changes over
between 1910 in 1940 the answer there
seems to be solar activity changes in
the output of particle streams and
magnetic fields from the Sun we actually
have some data suggesting this is so if
I can find it it's a very striking
result I'd like to show it because it is
ya hear this okay I have to explain it
this is a record from a stalagmite in a
cave in Oman and the time scale here is
between 6,000 and 9,000 years ago this
analysis was done by a group in
Heidelberg Germany published by an F and
his colleagues in nature in 2001 what
they plot here is the record of oxygen
18 in the stalagmite you know a static
might you know has a layer every year
it's like a tree ring you can read off
the date pretty well from the solid
might record and here shows oxygen 18
and you see oxygen 18 is a proxy for
temperature that's what geologists use
and over here is the carbon-14 record
during the same period in carbon-14 is a
proxy for solar activity I'll be glad to
explain why this is so but we don't need
to know just take my word for it this
record shows a remarkable correlation
between carbon 14 and oxygen 18 over a
period of three thousand years here's a
central portion of the record blown up
you can see it more easily here here's
carbon 14 years oxygen-18 look at the
correlation between the two this is a
400-year period the correlation is
almost year by year this cannot be an
accident there has to be a real causal
connection that's be a causal connection
between carbon 14 which is solar
activity and terrestrial temperature
and we know which way the correction has
to go it has to go from a Sun to the
earth because the terrestrial
temperature cannot affect the Sun so it
has to be solar activity causing a
change in temperature and that's what
this demonstrates this to me is one of
the strongest arguments for saying that
solar activity changes are the basic
cause of climate fluctuations on a
decade or scale so would you would you
agree that learning we stopped to
athlete that effect agree that burning
burning resources on the earth is
escalating the effect ok so the question
is is burning carbon on the earth
escalating this effect then of course is
a central question which I've tried to
address and the answer is we don't see
any evidence for this if you can show
some evidence for this I would be happy
to consider it all right now that brings
up the this Dory question but I just
have a quick follow-up we go ahead some
of the dories or yours anyway regarding
the spot that the sound effects
temperature I think everyone agrees
thought how do you explain that the
three ladies decades have deemed each
should be breaking the heat record while
the Sun activity has been going down the
Sun is very complicated no it's not that
complicated I think it's gone far let's
wait for the answer I think it's
complicated and I cannot explain every
detail so you're saying thank you you
you don't know oh I don't know no so you
don't know why the sound is a way for
someone publishes it you don't have an
explanation for why I don't work of this
field so why are we giving this talk
yeah well I which bill do you not work
in I would have as great physicist I
don't I don't we have not get into
holster what they say are we then it was
ruchi oh we're not getting hotter is we
were getting ordered earlier since 2000
well well we were getting written the
Sun has been extremely quiet during the
last years ok props don't show a drop in
temperature why is that I think is
probably the answer i have read that the
Sun has been extremely quiet during the
last few years we don't know why that is
even solar physicists don't really know
for sure why the Sun behaves the way
does some type of Sun is quiet sometimes
it is not that's irrelevant yes why the
divergence between the earth getting
warmer and the Sun getting cooler
because that directly contradicts the
evidence you're trying to present to us
from the year 2001 here Oh their
long-term changes and short-term changes
yep but there's a discrepancy between
your cosmic ray theory and the data on
global warming that we've seen for the
last decade no I don't think so i think
when you say why is the earth getting
warmer i pointed to the fact that there
was an increase in temperature between
1910 in 1940 it's like a jump then there
was another jump in between 1975 and
1980 then there was another jump between
around 2001 so there have been jumps
upward and apparently this is how the
temperature curve of the earth behaves
we don't understand all the details yes
but you told us it was related to cosmic
rays which is wedges we're not getting
as many cosmic rays of the last decade
well I'm only showing it here in this
record it is clear that solar activity
is controlling the temperature again
you've taken that you've cherry-picked a
very small period of data that kind of
directly contradicts something we've
seen over the last decade so I think
you're a little guilty of this
manipulation that you're accusing the
United Nations scientists
engaging wha all right the question is
are you cherry picking and if you are
cherry picking is that the same kind of
data manipulation that you think nASA
has been doing I'm not sure you picking
and we reporting what has been published
ok so I would how would those two nines
I've developed between 2011 well do we
have data for this correlation from last
year's yeah that's a fair point dude do
we have data for the last hundred years
for temperature we have for cosmic rays
here's some uh yeah I also have what
this is not in the salad wine no I'm
specifically asked for this carbon-14 is
produced by cosmic rays so carbon-14 is
a perfect proxy for cosmic ray intensity
the only source for carbon-14 is cosmic
rays whatever cosmic rays increase so
does the concentration or the production
rate production rate of carbon 14 oh
sorry hit the wrong thing that's all
right okay so uh other any other
questions so all right I think this is a
question from from Rupert anyway uh what
do you make of the strategy champion by
Thomas Friedman proposing that the
building of clean power economy confers
huge economic benefits haha thomas
reddmann though well as well as
competitive and environmental ones while
adhering to the precautionary principle
oh my god what's the next question all
right I've written an article that
addresses the precautionary principle
i'll send you a link but yeah we'll go
to the next question but larger
principle is basically should you take
out insurance against something you have
to assume that warming is bad why should
women be bad
there's nope no obvious reason had the
time we all agree that a colder climate
is bad if we also think that a warmer
climate is bad then logically this must
be the best climate it ever has so if
mankind is responsible for an increase
in carbon dioxide atmosphere which is
responsible for warming go ahead and
burn as much as we like because we don't
care too much about habitat loss or
extinction I'm not removing that we have
the moral right to do that if you really
put me toward economists have published
a book that which demonstrates other
warmer climate is economically preferred
I'd rather not live in the world but
that's not my field so I should not get
involved in it a non economist are all
right let's make our tell you that they
larger concentration of co2 is good for
agriculture everywhere agrees all that
no that's and if you want more food
production we should have more carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere my other
guests don't we all right I still want
to get to get to the top Dory question
although you know for better or worse
we're moving into ad hominem territory
now no I'm not saying that yeah yeah but
I'm used to let go ahead okay you were a
strong supporter of other controversies
like acid rain CFC and ETS lung cancer
which I just learned as environmental
tobacco smoke or secondhand smoke you
suggested the science behind them was
uncertain only to later be proven
otherwise how is the co2 issue different
than the others I have to be very brief
on acid rain is anybody here from
Germany yes do you remember the bunch
Devon it was a hoax this has now been
pointed out there were no dead trees in
the Black Forest the breakfast was not
dying it was all hype acid rain is a
modest environmental issue it is an
environmental issue it has been settled
mainly by remove
moving the sulfur dioxide from the
exhaust gases of fossil fuel burning me
Nicole but it is not a great calamity it
has been taken care of what was the next
one CFCs ah CFCs yes CFCs CFCs will
certainly destroy ozone in the
stratosphere no question about that the
issue that I was concerned with is we
have natural chlorine in the atmosphere
it's been measured has there been a real
increase because of human activities the
David didn't show it until after the
Montreal Protocol beside a year after
was signed the first paper was published
that showed an increase in chlorine
which must be due to human activities to
CMC's so there's no question about that
anymore next item that's a great example
of the efficacy of a precautionary
principle with world came together took
action on something that affected us all
and actually change things for the
better can the same apply to reducing
our carbon what was it okay I was was
the CFC and the Montreal Protocol a
wonderful example of the precautionary
principle in action it was a an example
of you might say so yes it costs a lot
of money but some people think it's
worth it is the ozone hole any smaller
now no no the whole depletion of ozone
over the the last 30 years it's been
about four percent as published by the
wmo which is a very minor very minor
effect a four percent decrease in ozone
would also result in an increase in
should result in increase in solar
ultraviolet on the surface of the earth
which is what we're concerned about that
increase has not been demonstrated
that increase would occur if you moved
apart 100 kilometers to the south
towards the equator so it's not a
terribly important issue all right next
one is second-hand smoke secondhand
smoke is easier I'm not a smoker I don't
like tobacco smoke bothers me and I'm
glad to if there were no secondhand
smoke however the EPA our environmental
agency has published that secondhand
smoke causes 3000 lung cancer deaths a
year I've wrote that the statistical
record I know something about statistics
it has been doctored they changed the
confidence interval and they used
unreliable results I'm not the only one
who thinks so every epidemiologist and
I've talked to who know more about such
things than I do tells me that the EPA
study is not good that's all but it
doesn't mean that each environment
tobacco smoke doesn't cause lanka he
could it just means that their study is
not based on sound statistical
principles that's all okay so it's it's
after five o'clock you're all welcome to
stay but you know anybody who wants to
head out we won't be offended
and thanks for coming
I'm here yes all right so okay uh let's
let the people trickle out and we'll get
back to the questions but first we have
a special door prize for the German
readers among you we have dr. singers
book in German doesn't do me any good
although I have an English copy if
anybody wants to read but I can't even
they go toward it says he expects
reactivity distintos flavor Oh nature
not here with activity rules those above
all right my German is improving by
leaps and bounds so uh yeah pick pick
that up here if you like I'll take one
yo you'll take one oh yeah you're
welcome to it yes treat it as if it were
your own though okay let's let's take a
live question before we go back to the
story I'd like to ask a different kind
of question not a looper kind of
question so you presented very
convincing arguments here some might
argue that they are not arguments of all
know dr our arguments but if speaker
from the other side we're here today
they would also present very convincing
yes i would ever sell ok not a friendly
blue no no so okay yeah you you want it
and you can listen here you want to
answer from the microphone so we get on
the on the record we'll also repeat the
question so I'll do my best anyway what
so the question of course is we had
people from the other side here they
would present arguments that might also
be convincing and my answer is yes I
wish they were here why aren't they here
we would love to debate them because we
think the facts on ours
I've tried to show the facts as they are
published my first point actually use
the actual IPCC results of models and
data and show the disagreement if they
don't agree with me then they have to
show why the IPCC is wrong okay and also
just you know in an aside I'll say I've
you know one of the problems I've had
with the global warming debate is that
you know the two camps seem mostly to
talk among themselves if you see this on
the website is on the web as well
they're our warmest sites and they're
skeptic sites yeah and there are very
few sites that actually try and address
both sides of the arguments and have you
know either layman on either side or
scientists on either side talking to one
another in theory this happens in the
journals an article is published
responses are published but the time
scale on that is very long and you know
as we know some of the journals don't
seem completely fair about the
submissions later maybe 02 journal can I
add something now we have strived of
course to it yeah yeah yeah you can
become introduce yourself no okay good
my name is Roger parolee I am the
president of one Association which is
called unique sweets and
non-governmental international panel
climate change but we have thin
Switzerland we have let's call a second
section and of course we have tried to
have a debate between seeing ever and
between let's say let's call it Joseph
Swiss scientists which are the name I
give you its stock cruelty that's all
but of course they design every direct
debate they say oh they are on vacation
or they're outside of Switzerland but of
course it was not possible to organize
it and direct debate between the two and
this is also true when when Teresa's and
still when we try to bring some
information on newspaper it also some
newspapers that you can assume that
there are let's say more or less
neutralize the enter dead they will not
accept our let's say our opinion this is
it's a very difficult message that that
that we we try to give slow through to
the public and it is very very difficult
to give its own okay sir and now one can
choose to believe that global warming is
taking place across my man but even if
one does so the whole debates used to
Center on how we should reduce your
to-do lists whereas that of course takes
resources we are spending billions
hundreds of whatever currency on that
one good as for example your number to
see justice also just adapt to the
change it's arguably cheaper for a
country like Poland where I'm from to
just you know make the dikes a bit
higher centers of billions of dollars on
I'm trying to reduce you to the reasons
now then debate whether we should
actually do something does not take
place what do you think that is well
okay let me up if if if we discovered
that human co2 was making the
temperature rise we would have two basic
choices we could we could try and stop
it or we could try and adapt to it and
the current debate seems all about
stopping it and nothing about adapting
why do you think that is that's a very
good question I don't think there's any
chance of stopping it practically it's a
global problem and as long as the nature
emitter in the world which is China
continues to burn coal and other fossil
fuels
co2 is going to rise no matter what the
rest of the world does so it may if we
do if we know know know it'sit's suppose
it is there there's no way to stop
increases in co2 the question of whether
increases in co2 affect climate is still
open i think that without a lot of data
because the pressure will co2 affects
climate is a different issue and as I
prepare to show it does in principle but
we don't see any evidence for it so
assume therefore that the effect of the
increase in co2 is insignificant very
very small too small to be detectable
alright we have a new questioner from
the background if your hamsters and fine
would you rather adapt to the increase
in temperature would you throw a bucket
of water on this level all right let's
go to our internet view our next
question is a problem under stress are
all right all right this time yeah it's
basically just to sort of add for the
comments and an interesting observation
I don't have any data but I think it's
very important to separate that doing
the moral thing is about pollution not
so much the warming we can adapt or not
i mean like deputation was put forward
but i do think that the moral side like
being eco-friendly this is this is the
thing about pollution and keeping you
environment good so i think that should
be separated when you argue about
keeping the air clean keeping it warm
co2 is not good for the advice to
breathe a little like we've saved but it
doesn't necessarily increase the
temperature at a rapid rate you know we
don't have like you stuck here one side
and argument the things not doing
anything the other side is saying it is
doing something the argument to change i
think is obvious we should change should
change what we're doing with constantly
changing exercises in order to have a
better eat vs I mean so should separate
those two from pollution and from
warming that makes it okay I'm not sure
let me let me try and rephrase it um are
are you saying that okay first of all
let me
on record myself as favoring morality
I'm sure dr. singer would as well I
failed world sure widow but ok but but
but BB you're saying that that pollution
is a priori a bad thing and if carbon
dioxide is a pollutant shouldn't we try
and minimize it regardless of whether
it's making the earth warmer or not
that's an unfair question oh no that's
good why is it unfair because carbon
dioxide is not a poodle okay you go it
is a natural constituent of the
atmosphere there's no evidence that it
has any adverse effects so why should we
call the pollutant and all right ah one
more and then we'll go to the dory yeah
you seem to have hinted during the
presentation oh sorry so you seem to
have mention of your time representation
I'll repeat louder sorry is it better no
I don't want to use simultaneous
translation but go ahead and I'll do my
best afterwards so you see that
mentioned a few times that there's a lot
of let's say political motivations
behind some scientific discussion zones
or some technical process you mentioned
like the way or things like this and
what I wanted to ask you is what's your
view regarding this I mean at the same
time you have a politics influencing
science ability which the thing you are
complaining about but you also have the
other side right we just science
influence politics no matter how good or
bad the actual science is so my question
is if you have this notion between
science not good enough sometimes cross
that there's politics but politics is
influenced by science what's your
criteria to the side was good science or
bed signs ok so a show so you said that
science is sometimes unduly influenced
by politics we know also that sometimes
politics is influenced by science I
guess you wouldn't say that's a bad
thing
would i but but but but how do you
decide what is good signs how do you
tell the good science from the bad
science is that is that fair well that's
easy I spent an hour here I think what
I've tried to present here obviously I'm
joking it's a difficult problem you can
only tell good sign for bad science in
the long run in the longer run sometimes
scientific controversies are real it
cannot be resolved in a matter of days
or months or even years I suspect that
this particular controversy will be
resolved within this decade I really do
I think of the evidence against man-made
effects on climate is becoming stronger
all the time and that the evidence
should I should have put this way the
evidence that manic human activities are
affecting the climate is absent and will
remain absent I doubt whether any
evidence will be put forth that will
change our mind on this but you know if
it is we should look at it you know
those we must be open to the idea that
oh we are mistaken sure yeah alright
prompt from the background so you know
the Pooh could have stayed to fear from
michael christian michael crichton your
cracker here Michael Crichton wrote a
book called state of fear yeah the
theories that climate change was
introduced for politics to control the
people okay so some state of fear is it
was a work of fiction but it has a lot
of factual references and also
references and tries to prove that it's
all made up by politics to control
people we can paint right I guess okay
let me phrase the question my own way if
if there is some kind of conspiracy
among scientists to promote the theory
of anthropogenic global warming
what is their motivation or what do you
suspect their motivation is I don't
really know what motivates people I
suppose they're different motivations
for different kind of people politicians
are generally motivated by the idea of
having more influence more power or
control becoming elected others are
influenced by the idea of more money you
have to realize that there's a great
deal of money involved in the global
warming issue now the such things as
alternative energies like wind and solar
there's question of whether a sometimes
called clean energy which i think is a
misnomer because no energy is really
clean in any sense it always creates
some pollution but energy is essential
so you have to live with it the amount
of money's involved are huge they are
measured in the hundreds of billions of
dollars hundreds of billions and
billions of the be billions will be else
I'm not sure that you are trillion yet
but they soon will be the trading system
alone that's been contemplated and being
practiced in Europe is wasting i would
say probably tens of billions of oil
rose maybe it sounded billion by though
I come for comparison how big is the oil
industry I think it's largely I think
it's two orders of magnitude larger or
so well that's my it is actually
producing energy and all but this is all
right this is all
if you're saying there is a conspiracy
financed by companies that has you have
to take off they there is already no
significant solar array this is all
based on three points I mean you are you
have yourself being paid by X on the
first point that the carbon dioxide is
causing global warming the second that
warming is bad it's a factor there's no
evidence for that and third that we can
do something about it I that controls of
carbon dioxide can really affect the
course of climate I think probably a
pretty large population of the world
would disagree with the fact that global
warming was not bad I know we talked
about being able to adapt to it which is
fine if we live in Switzerland which has
a you know a high GDP per hit or gene p
but a lot of that world doesn't live in
these kind of conditions and doesn't
have this much money to throw around so
hell would for example Bangladesh adapt
itself to I know an increase in
temperature or an increase in sea level
okay so for us rich countries we can
adapt how would a poor country like
Bangladesh adapt increases in
temperature or increases in sea level
other than by moving here other than by
moving to some place like Switzerland
and maybe we don't have room for them
all to sea level is a very difficult
issue I have not discussed it here I
have to specialize in this area but I
find that the data are unreliable and
conflicting so I've not published very
much on this it is well known that sea
level has risen by 120 meters on top of
global sea level since the last ice age
120 meters and how long ago was the last
ice age the Pico eighteen thousand years
eighteen thousand one hundred and twenty
meters and eighteen thousand years at
different rates okay in the last shoe
thousand years as best as we can tell
from coral data signal has been rising
at the rate of 18 centimeters per
century during the 20th century sea
level rose at the rate of 18 centimeters
per century I think and this is
debatable of course that can eat that no
matter what we do sea level will
continue to rise at 18 centimeters per
century until the next ice age and then
sea level will drop right so no matter
what we do you know were continued to us
because of the slow melting of ice in
the Antarctic it cannot be stopped by
anything away to come across countries
can adapt to warming okay so right so
how will the Bangladeshis adapt to
warming we you know we can turn on our
air conditioners ah yes okay and all
exercise moderator is privileged what I
would say is it you know you're not
asking the Bangladesh ease first at
first of all you know it's it's it's you
know that's assuming that we're causing
the warming but even if you did no no no
okay okay I'm just saying that your
comment was I think okay letlet yeah let
me just just do one if we Irvin a hot
country yeah clearly bad but but but but
but it's not it's you know it's not it's
not zero cost on one side if we if we
restrict carbon use this is going to
make energy much more expensive in a
forum or family way to poor family
spends a much higher percentage of their
income on energy than we do so if we
make energy more expensive it'll be more
expensive worldwide it'll be more
expensive in Bangladesh so we're talking
about making their lives substantially
worse and killing a good number of them
because a lot of them live at the margin
possibly for no benefit whatsoever so
it's yeah my answer was going to be much
shorter it's a lot easier to adapt to
warmer temperatures and
about to poverty you basically the gross
priority is clean I'm sorry I'm sorry
we're talking we're talking at each
other's I first he's the speaker then
then our leaders the highest priority is
clean water you're dying of arsenic in
groundwater is dying wash Nick poisoning
they have other problems they have
cholera there are many problems because
they don't have clean water it takes
energy to produce clean water and that
is the highest priority I don't think
they care about the temperature besides
according to the climate models of the
IPCC the distribution of temperature is
such the IPC talks about average
temperature when you talk about average
temperature you have to keep in mind
that the temperature increase in the
tropics is very very small most of this
average increase takes place at high
latitudes so the temperatures will
increase in Siberia in Canada and other
places that's where the increase will
take place when ice will melt you know a
word average always hides a lot of
information but if you look at the
detailed predictions of the climate
models no matter what you may think
about the climate models the latitude
distribution of warming is such that the
warming in the tropics is negligible
compared to a warming elsewhere but the
problem of Bangladesh is not the
temperature itself is actually sea level
rise right because there's 200 million
people leaving right on the coast and
basically a major of sea level rise
would flood the whole country that's the
actual problem ok so so the probably the
potential problem in Bangladesh's is sea
level III think you already answered
that big wave okay wait wait wait wait
let's take a break our recording is
going to stop in two minutes so I think
this is a good time to take a break I
don't mind and I think dr. singer
doesn't mind as staying for a few more
minutes but we'll we'll call a halt now
to the official presentation I hope
you'll see it internally and externally
in a few days and thanks everyone for
