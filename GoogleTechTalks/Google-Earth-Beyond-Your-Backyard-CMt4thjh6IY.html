my name is Jessica fund I work for the
Google Earth team in Mountain View
working on data production mostly with
the vector stuffs of the data that's not
imagery we'll get into that a little bit
and basically because I've been working
with with this data with Google Earth
data for about a year now um I've had a
lot of time to just play around with
with Google Earth which is fantastic I
can't believe you guys pay me to do this
um and so I've noticed that there are a
lot of really really fascinating things
that you can do with Google Earth that
most people don't realize from you know
just opening it up I've had people that
say all I love Google Earth and then I
ask them what they've done with it and
they say I saw my house is the coolest
thing ever I don't like have you tried
anything else and they say oh no but you
know my house is really cool and and and
it is their houses it's very cool in
Google Earth but there is their only
scratching the surface of what this
program can do so we're going to talk
about how Google Earth is fun but also
about how Google Earth can be use as a
tool and maybe some of more advanced
uses of Google Earth so there's there's
a lot to talk about i mean been kind of
exploring this program for a year so i
can go into way too much detail or maybe
i'm going way too fast for you so if
anything is you know if it's to advance
or too slow just you know raise your
hand ask questions you know feel free to
interrupt me so let's start with just
some of the basics basically Google
Earth is and you know slightly different
than google maps maybe I can through
google maps up here google maps is a 2d
flat map of the world and Google Earth
is a three-dimensional view of the world
so it's not just flat it actually has
terrain you can see mountains and things
and so
maybe we can just zoom you in to one of
my favorite places to go the show
terrine which is the Grand Canyon I've
been there before and it's almost more
fun on google or because you get this
bird I bird's-eye view of the earth and
so you can see that there's actually
down here in the layers and we'll talk a
bit more about the layers the layers is
actually what I do specifically with
data production and all too often gets
overlooked there's actually a terrain
button here you can turn it off so you
get the flat world you know loads a
little faster or you can actually have
the terrain you can zoom around here a
little bit more you actually see what's
neat is you have so much more control
with Google Earth than you do with maps
google maps google maps so is north
facing you can't turn on and off any of
the layers which is really great because
you just want a simple view some driving
directions you're set but with google
earth's you can change the way that you
notice actually now that we're not
looking north so this is the navigation
panel over here so you guys should see
that North is over sort of diagonally to
the upper right hand corner and we can
actually take this and move it around
and so you get sort of 360 degree view
of the world you can sort of move either
by clicking these holding them down you
can move with left and right buttons on
the keyboard you can move with the mouse
click and drag then you can also zoom in
yes you can do this by double clicking
as well assumes you in actually double
right clicking zooms you out I was so
excited when I first found this made
things a lot faster and actually if you
double click on the zoom button here it
zooms you all the way in it's kind of
really fun to zoom yourself all the way
out I should stop so you just click
it'll it'll stop to me so let's zoom out
and click and then in addition with the
train you can go completely flat right
which is like this this is this this
panel over here the top one or you can
go completely bird's-eye view completely
up so so that's just sort of the
navigation panel here soon ourselves out
a little bit more and I like hitting it
n gets you back north kind of free
centers you I use that one a lot so then
there are also these panels over to the
left and this toolbar you notice up here
and so the first panel is just the the
fly too it's sort of we see Google Earth
is sort of a Geo browser you know just
like firefox or internet explorer we see
this as the way you search your world so
you know for instance we can write Paris
and it'll fly us to Paris for some of
the smaller towns you know if it's if
it's a Springfield you know Kansas you
have to write Springfield comic Kansas
because otherwise it won't know which
one it is but typically it's pretty good
so you can see there's Paris there if
you want to do you can also do in search
you can look for businesses so for
instance if I wanted to go to Paris that
could write hotels and actually find
some hotels for me wanted to zoom out
show all Paris but and this is actually
some of those businesses we also show in
the layers so you should see over here
then here we actually have hotels
lodging so you can turn on lodging you
can see everything here and actually if
you zoom out the names will go away so
they're not quite as bad it should be i
mean the nice thing is that with with
local search you can kind of you can
search you know anything you know we
don't have maybe ice cream stores as a
layer in the
but you can search for that in
businesses would just sort of but it's
kind of nice to see all of the the
hotels all at once rather than you know
the local search tries to give you a
small subset so it doesn't bombard you
with all of this yeah it should be the
same ones and it's pretty neat you can
click on them and it gives you the phone
number the address it'll click you over
to this internal browser I like to make
it small because sometimes gets in the
way yeah oops maybe they'll try this one
yeah so this actually finds this place
on on google maps and you can actually
you can you can bring this out and pop
this out see here so you can see this is
actually we we pop you over to google
maps and then so it has it has you know
exactly so it just links you over there
a little faster yeah so because we see
google earth as a Geo browser we like to
hop you in and out of the internet as
much as possible you'll actually see
that in our populated places down here
if you click on a populated place a lot
of people don't notice that initiative
to you know directions to here which
happens with a lot of the pop ups we put
in search web images and news and so we
could search images of Paris right on
google images and so you'll get the
Eiffel Tower and the Louvre and all
these arc de triomphe and all these
things it's pretty neat when you go to
some some place a little bit yeah a
little bit more foreign that you you
don't necessarily know news is kind of
neat too so we like to hop you in and
out and one more thing that you can do
with the search is you can do directions
just like with Google Maps looks looks
the same
um let's see so one thing I really like
to know as well about these panels is
you can make him disappear just break so
if you want some more real estate you
can close them like this so you can see
everything and sometimes it gets a
little you know things get a little lost
and you can get rid of it completely by
going hide sidebar so it's just sort of
it gives you this beautiful screen this
is something new that we've been doing
with the Google Earth for this is still
the the beta version so so actually I
should talk about places and layers and
so the layers are streamed from the
google databases you need internet to
see them or if you've gone on the
internet seen some of them it'll load it
in your cash so you can work a little
bit without without internet but it
doesn't load too much on your cash so
you you do does help to have have
internet connection um so yeah yeah it
is a very narrow amount they don't let
you download too much cash too much
because we don't want people scraping
our our data right we don't want you
know our imagery providers to be
complaining that people are trying to
feel their imagery right and so we we
let you cash a bit of it but not not a
very large amount but for instance just
like you know your if you sometimes I do
this i'll actually i'm driving somewhere
I'll turn on the roads and and just let
them cash I'll do this with google maps
to sometimes but Google Earth is great
because well we'll actually get into a
few things you can kind of add what you
want so you can print since you can cash
this and and then you can go drive and
then you have it on your laptop and then
I just sort of you know tell my
boyfriend Oh take a right of the next
you know like the next light so we get
to where we're going we did this to for
when we tried to find a new place to
live and will show actually I should go
into
one of the really great things about
Google Earth one one thing that's
besides the terrain that makes it a
little bit different than google maps
and other maps programs out there is
that you can actually make your own maps
so so the differences between the layers
and the section of places so that the
layers is something that comes with
every you know Google Earth it gets
streamed so you don't have to download a
new version of google earth we just
change our data on our end and you see
something else and we're constantly
updating you know our imagery and our
data or vector data are layers so you
should always you know always go on
you'll find something new but in places
you can actually make your own maps and
people ask me oh but can anybody see
this you know it says no it's just you
can kind of think of it as you know
you're writing a word document in Word
nobody can see it but you can share it
with other people so we should make a
map let me close what I have here so
what's really neat is so you can
right-click and you get all these
options or you can just go up to this
panel so just clicking this little
little push pin actually lets you make a
placemark so you can click here you can
push it and write Paris you can change
the icon you can actually make your own
icons they just have to be I think 32 by
32 pixels or maybe it even just I think
now they just it just resizes it for you
so for instance I can put a little
camera let's say if this is where I went
on vacation and I want to show my family
or you know friends this is what I did
all right okay and what's really neat is
that this Papa Bell hear this you can
actually write a description so that
when you click on it just like how we
clicked on Paris to add this pop up
bubble with some information this
actually takes HTML so I can do an image
source and actually linked it to to a
photo so let's see let's go to
you image by putting in my brakes hello
Paris and so you can click on this and
it actually comes up we don't do video
embedded video but you can link to it
and a lot of people do that and you can
in there just I mean there's all sorts
of things that you can do with KML I
could do a whole nother Tech Talk just
on KML if you want to learn some more
stuff about KML should go to earth
google com / KML has KML tutorials and
new things you can do with KML I will go
into some cool layers and things that I
see but this is really neat because all
of a sudden you're not just you don't
just have what we r you know what Google
is sending you but you can start to make
your own stories you can you know people
use this as I said like people put all
their vacation photos into like say you
know say this is where i went and this
was the eiffel tower and then all of a
sudden you can also you know you can can
make Hulk am l's to start you know as an
educational program teachers are getting
into this we actually have google for
educators is see google for educators
has a whole thing on google earth and
things that teachers can do with it so
it's sort of all of a sudden it puts it
puts the power of google earth into your
hands and you can start doing whatever
you want with it let's see all right
yeah and actually a lot of i mean people
are using this for all sorts of things
so let's see maybe i'll go more into the
layers because the late what's neat
about the layers and they're kind of
near and dear to my heart this is what I
work on so y'all excuse me but I feel
like they really just it i dont no
imagery is fantastic but if you don't
have the layers to tell you what you're
looking at it loses a lot of the meaning
and so what's great about the layers is
it tells you what you're looking at and
you can
appreciate the imagery much more so in a
dish and we sort of I sort of see the
layers as a base map for you to sort of
sort of puts a base layers there and
then you can add you know everything
else on top two things in here that I
don't see quite as as much as base
layers as you think you know restaurants
and populated places borders streets we
do do some special things that most
people wouldn't know or wouldn't think
of right away and that's the this google
earth community layer and the featured
content and the Google Earth community
is as actually a website that hosts your
km else for you and that's bbs keyhole
com keyhole is the old name for google
earth so this is you know the BBS has
been around for a very long time and
it's gotten some really great content so
what happens is people create content
and then you can actually when you
create something you can right click and
you can say share or post and it'll
actually open up I'll just pop this out
it'll open up this this posting wizard
and you can say continue it asks you to
make sure that somebody hasn't already
posted this you say yes you know
assuming you actually made sure that
this wasn't posted already i'm sure
10,000 people have tried to post the
eiffel tower so maybe that's not a good
idea but and then you can put it into a
forum and it actually get uploaded to
the to the to the BBS so let me just
take you to the actual VPS what's
fantastic about this is that we actually
then go and we scrape this and we put
this data into Google Earth we actually
host this data so you don't have to
worry about you know having a lot of
bandwidth to host these larger kmls on
you can just put them here under for
instance environment or conservation or
just earth browsing and we'll put them
back in here let me turn off the roads
so you can see this is probably going to
explode because there's a
lot of things in Paris so for instance
you can click on this and you can see
something about these posts and it's
really neat because you get content in
places you just wouldn't have come in
Paris we have roads and restaurants and
things for but for instance in Baghdad
you know we don't have any of this data
yet um but people have already you know
people are from Baghdad people know this
area people have already started
annotating all sorts of places I mean
Siberia is annotated I think that some
one of the railroads is and what's
really neat about this is you actually
start getting right you start getting
the local languages in these areas and I
just I find this completely fascinating
and actually this this post I really
like because I think the this person is
uh is saying that she was just so
excited that you know that she can see
her she can see Baghdad on Google Earth
and she's just annotating it's like
crazy so we get all sorts of constant
that you know you look at something you
know some image that looks a little bit
funny I guarantee you somebody has has
put a little post-its is what's this or
you know or you know some somebody has
said oh this is a military you know base
and this is its extended history it's
really fascinating what people have
found and want to share with others so
that's that's definitely something that
is worth exploring so you can see
actually if so this is actually a lot of
people also don't know that you can open
up the layers that we actually have
folders in them they do work we try to
make them work so that you can just turn
them on and off on the top level but you
can actually open them up and for
instance yeah well so through the Google
Earth layer we have all the different
forms in here so if you put your your
information may be in travel information
it would go into this one specific
folder and then you can look at just
this one which isn't in this very very
narrow scope of it here's one alright
and so you have you have a more specific
search in a way
um so one other thing that so that
that's a Google Earth community layer
you spend hours on it can find some
really cool things another thing that I
really love is the featured content
layer and this is something that's
relatively new I think we launched it a
few months ago but this is sort of
because people are actually making some
really ambitious camels and some really
fantastic organizations are you know
especially a lot of nonprofits right
because Google Earth is free which is
which is kind of unusual in the GI it so
in the mapping world nothing is free i
mean a lot of other programs you pay
thousands of dollars to get access for
and so for nonprofits the fact that this
is free you already know you have this
great tool that you can start putting
content in you just need people to maybe
take gps units and I mean we're getting
all sorts of people in all parts of the
world are doing this I think I just read
an article about natives in the Amazon
are being are being given GPS units and
they're mapping out where they're you
know tribal heritage locations are so
you know where where they go what you
know an archaeologist sir archaeologists
and anthropologists and all sorts of
scientists and and and explorers of all
sorts are getting really excited about
this and actually in that case it's
really nice because you're empowering
people that you know just just knowledge
is empowering and so the fact that it's
googled all about right the
democratization of information and so
that to me is particularly exciting so
these are some really great fantastic I
mean I would I could spend hours on on
just one of these may be a few that I'd
really like oh yeah do you know any
malicious use one can put you know
something really offensive with comments
yeah and che
and now we through google us give it to
everybody and people forget it is
somebody else also but I posted things
and kind of you know attributed to
Google do we have any kind of filtering
supervising yeah so the featured content
is hand selected by the data team so
this has been gone through and it's it's
you know kind of special in a way but
first is a google earth later right i
mean anybody could post anything right
and that's you know something we take
very seriously we have a great group of
moderators for the BBS and they spend a
lot of time you know going through the
content taking things away their obscene
you know it sort of sort of works like
Wikipedia in a way right where the
moderators really care the community
really cares about this this content and
then it sort of they they go through it
and they try to filter out what's bad I
don't I don't actually know but I've met
some of them and they're fantastic i can
put you in touch with a few of you yeah
yeah yeah I mean people people care very
much about this and some some people
have been doing this for for many many
many years so people of all ages to you
know little kids and the older retired
you know folks and and it's just it's
really exciting um I think you have to
be a member membership or posting I
think anybody can become yeah well yeah
yeah hello this is Chris dog oh hey
crystal could you um repeat the
questions here so we can hear the memo
oh yeah sorry so the the question was um
was you know if anybody can post to the
BBS um I know what is googling going to
get in trouble for for posting this
content for allowing this content to get
through and the other question was if
anybody if you
had to become a member to post anything
and if this was moderated and so we do I
think anybody can become a member I'm
sure if you use that I'm sure the
moderators have means I don't know too
too much about it but I we I know that
we have moderators that that really do
go through all of our content as quickly
as possible because this is a it is a
pretty big website we have a lot of
users that does that answer your
question okay yeah so the featured
content is some even more ambitious T
I'm Google Earth content you can put you
know I think maybe to place marks one
place mark and upload this and and and
it gets put on there I think these are a
lot more comprehensive there many
placemarks with sort of sort of our
favorite not favorites um some of the
most ambitious more ambitious it just
has more it's more refined than then
just you know me at home that put on one
or two place marks so one thing I'd like
to show see um well so you actually see
that we we have put in some new content
and we've put this little label of new
on there so that you know it's new we
didn't put it on top of featured content
because it should always be updating so
you just see updated and you know
wouldn't wouldn't really see anything
new but let's see I've once well let me
see go with so because let's see so it's
really neat to because these are these
are from authoritative organizations
it's it's good data that we know it's
not just you know with it with anybody
being able to put any sort of
information on you don't know the
accuracy of it or the you know how
truthful it is and one one layer that I
was really excited about seeing was we
actually got the national park service
to to work with us and they created
place marks for all of the national
parks if we actually zoom and maybe see
where is Yellowstone here's Yellowstone
oops so you can see it opens up it has
photo it has links to the park websites
you can search web images news for
google and it gives copywriting for me
or they don't think a copyright but uh
it just gives attribution if we zoom in
see so you can actually see the park
boundaries and they have all the visitor
center is located i think if you zoom in
even further their campsites and all the
facilities and these red things here
actually that the trails so they have
all the trails all the national park
trails in Google Earth which is pretty
fantastic so this so this is data from
the national parks yeah that is that
kind of information available in non-us
so is that information available in
non-us do you mean in in in other
languages or do you mean another so the
US national parks is is right now we
have this information only in the US but
for instance um the Nash let me smell
the unep is actually a really good
example of this is the UN environmental
program and these are these are
fantastic because they have before and
after photos a satellite imagery for
plate all places all over the world so
you can see for instance here this is on
the clear-cutting in the Amazon so you
can see this is in think in 1960 and
well actually I can click on it and
this will load in my place is over here
and they'll zoom in and they're actually
this is another type of so there are
several types of KML maps KML is just
it's what what we call the google earth
map kml stands for keyhole markup
language so there are many types of this
type of mapping one I showed you before
was just a placemark you can also do a
path right align so you can draw a line
and you can change you can change the
color and the width so there there are
plenty of little things that you can do
to stylize it you can create polygons
right ha you can and then the other
thing you can do is create image
overlays like this one so this is you
can take any image I actually saw a
fantastic KML where somebody took an
image of an ant and had it attacking
Georgia which is just really cute you
know so this is an image where they
actually they took a satellite photo of
this area and put it on the earth and
you can actually see that if we take
this one this one this one away you can
see what it's become so this one here
think down here it says it's from June
of 1975 and this one is of September
2001 and it's it's sort of me because
there some other features that sort of
hidden but you can actually slide this
over and watch it disappear right so
we're going to bring it back so then
they have these for all over the world I
think they have the snows of kilimanjaro
disappearing here we are in jail are
there parts in Brazil that you can lay
your own we don't currently show parks
if the question is if we have parks in
Brazil we don't currently show parks in
Brazil in our food
contact but that doesn't mean that
they're there isn't you know the brazil
national park service they could totally
make a KML like this and they could host
it from their website they could have
google you know google google BBS host
it they can definitely and our lot of
data per a lot of organizations are
choosing to do that so that they can get
their information out so so yeah and I'm
just going to delete these you see the
the place mark is here so um so there's
well um I should probably get more into
there's some really neat things that you
can do with KML that are even more
advanced than what I've just showed you
some of the main things is that you can
we just released the future that'll let
you see time it'll show time another
thing well let me show an example of
that actually so there were actually let
me turn this off there were a group of
German science students that were I
think studying in Singapore that decided
to put a GPS unit on a track to track a
whale shark in the Indian Ocean and I
think they did this summer of two
thousand five and recently when we came
out with the time feature they put the
time stamps on in they rework their KML
they rework their map so that you can
actually use this time feature so you'll
notice that if you're on a if so if I
click on a a KML that can use time this
little time bar will show up up here and
i can if i click on the little watch
it'll give me property so for instance i
can i can make the animation with
faster or slower and I can do some other
things maybe I should just show you what
it looks like if I leave it as is so if
i can i can actually play it you can see
the little whale shark going big whale
shark making his way across the Indian
Ocean and so this is I think a line that
they drew of his path each of these dots
is a GPS unit that they took during a
day and then they then they have the
time and day with each of the GP a--
each of these dots and so with that
information they can show an animation
of of this whale shark making his way
across the Indian Ocean right the map
doesn't change this is just the KML
information on top and actually I can
remove I can remove the KML and it's the
map is still the same underneath and the
question is whether or not you can see a
place changing over time you can if if
you trick I mean it's we like Google
will still host the same data but you
can put whatever you want on top of it
so you can put an image of how an area
looked 30 years ago how dare you look
twenty years ago had an heir you look
ten years ago and you can you can change
it like that they are not the right so
they would not be available through the
streaming version here they'd only be
available so if you create a map a lot
of people ask you know if I make a play
smart can everybody see it and nobody
can see it but you and the people that
you send it to yeah okay that all right
so in addition to time you also have and
all these things all of the special
things you can do with KML you can all
find those in the KML tutorials or
google.com / KML so I won't spend too
much time going
into it i will say that if you save
these so if you go right click you save
as you'll save it as a camel or kmz the
KMZ is a zipped kml you and it'll just
save it you know wherever you want to
save it you send that one file to a
friend they double click it they open it
they can see it in their in their Google
Earth if they have google earth
downloaded if it's a kml and not a KMZ
you can read that kml and a text editor
so you actually see it almost looks like
I mean like an HTML or xml code so you
can you can change things either in
google earth or you can change things in
the in a text editor as well if you'd
prefer that so so what's really neat is
you can download km else from the BBS
see what other people have done and then
you can you know crawl around in the in
the code and then you can you can you
know copy that and do the same thing so
one other thing that people have done is
um is real-time networked KML so let me
go over back to New York there's this
group called FBO web.com they do
tracking of of airfare flights and they
actually made a network KML real-time
network KML of all the incoming and
outgoing flights for I think LAX and JFK
and all these and so I'll turn this on
and so you can actually see these are
all the flights currently in the air
coming in and out of JFK and I can click
on any one of these and it says this is
a an SFO to JFK that says San Francisco
to JFK flight it's flying at you know
31,000 I guess this is feet at the speed
what's really neat too is that they have
put this into they actually have the the
altitude right so they you can see how
high above the ground they are see if I
can zoom in come a little little closer
using the features contest this this is
just something that anybody can download
this is in you see this is in the places
folder so if you if you download this
file and if you open it with me as you
can see this little this little folder
and it's green now but if it's thinking
it'll go yellow and then I'll go green
because it's actually streaming the data
from from a database somewhere on the
internet and it's giving you this and
you can actually see it just just moved
right so every you can set it so maybe
every five seconds this looks and sees
you know is there any new data you know
yes okay well this one is moved there
Google is not hosting google google will
host the kml file but if you have data
that's changing on the back end you have
to host it somewhere we don't have a
google solution for that yet yes um I
don't know where this company the
question is where they're getting the
data from I don't know where this
company is getting this data from I
think the US Air Force I don't right
sorry okay so the answer is the FAA
website so in this this company just put
it into a KML file there another
question yeah all right so this is this
is an example of a real-time networked
KML um which is really pretty major
travel websites that will actually use
this interface but let you track your
flight or your wife slide or your
brother's flight or whatever so you can
yeah and you can do all the stuff you
said you can get the whole 3dm agency
I'm coming down right so you can
actually also get a particular flight if
you want to see just one flight if the
data is created dynamically by the KML
or on the back end in the database why
don't I guess it would depend how you do
it if they're sorry for this case they
do generate any way so um all right and
then after the
two other things i want to touch on with
with km else as well one is I don't know
how many of you have heard of Sketchup
this fantastic 3d modeling program it's
really easy to use I think my mom was
using it to redo her kitchen you know
dream dream kitchen which is fantastic i
love the fact that my mom can use this
easily yeah exactly although my mom's a
bit more tech-savvy i guess but um it
yeah so so 3d 3d buildings 3d you know
you can you can do some really great
things and sketchup but then you can
also now that you know we've the sketch
of google integration you can actually
whatever model you create in google
sketchup you can then put on to the
earth in google earth and not only can
you put it on the Earth's in google
earth and then make a kml out of that
you can share that model on the 3d
warehouse which is sketchup website
where people upload their their models
they can upload a model they they just
made in sketchup or they can upload a
model they put on the earth and then you
can open it either in sketchup oren in
google or so i'll just show a few
examples of that let's see so we'll go
to the 3d whereas this is the 3d
warehouse is just sketchup google com
which is where you go to download the
sketchup it's free and then sketchup
google.com / 3d warehouse and so if
we'll do a we're in New York now so we
can do a search for new york city and
you can see that the the New World Trade
Center it's one that I happen to see I
thought that was sort of neat and so
this is it actually shows the the photo
of the model and it because this model
is not only in google sketchup but it's
also been placed in google earth it
shows you a map google map mashup of
where it is on honor so you you know hey
this isn't you know the model in ohio or
something it says this is the one in new
york city
and it'll it'll be rated and you can it
usually there's a description people
will tag a model so that that's how we
search for it right so I think right
World Trade Center New York City is
probably in here as well so in a
description of what it is and it'll say
how complex the model is what's really
neat about this you'll see it says
download to google sketchup so you can
maybe you can alter the model and add a
whole bunch of things re-upload it or
you know people put chairs you know
chair and you put a chair into your
model or your people in your models and
that's sort of neat you can view it in
google earth and if it says you can view
it in google earth for I mean you can
you view anything in Google or four but
specifically in Google or for you gular
for the beta version has an ability to
see texturized Sketchup models so a
regular model this this would just be
you know it'll be gray like our 3d mult
it'll be blue you can make it a color
but it's not going to have textures and
one of my bed textures is that you can
take a photo of the side of this
building and put that texture onto it
and that's what you see here is that's
why it looks so photo realistic is this
really photo realistic it's very simple
polygons but it looks really complex
because you put an image on top and you
need google or for to see that so you
can say open in google or four and I've
already done that and pre-loaded it's a
little faster and so you can actually
see us zooming in here so and that's
what it looks like in the 3d modeling
earth and you can actually see this is
right that's financial centers over here
and it's all in 3d so
pretty neat I think it's kind of cool
you see the shadows of the other
buildings in here you can zoom up pretty
close you can't really get quite as
close as you could if you were in Google
Sketchup but but you can get it pretty
close and go inside yeah so that's
that's sort of me let's see okay so the
last thing I want to talk about with the
with the special cases of KML is
something we most are most recent I
think release of KML which is a region
ated KML basically if you have an image
that you put on top of Google Earth if
it's very simple it's it you know it
works fine but if you get a huge huge
very high-rez you know satellite image
that you want to put on top of Google
Earth well then it gets a little bit
more complicated it slows it'll down a
little bit more it's not really the
right you know solution if you have a
very big file but so what we've done is
we've region ated so region ated the
file so it actually it zooms in a little
bit more it loads it a little bit more
like like our we load our own imagery so
what I want to show here is one of our
latest featured we we actually have
taken a KML like this and put this into
our featured content which is our
historical maps here so rum Z's
historical maps are believe they're the
largest private collection of historical
maps they're just absolutely beautiful
and tasty rumsey historical maps so we
can open these up and you can see we
just have an indicator
so these are all the different mounts
here we have a little map finder so you
can find where they are so for instance
we have one of New York City in 1836 we
have one of the world in 1790 actually
go to the New York City one because you
know like to do that so you have to find
it in here she says New York 1836 and
you can just double click it and it will
zoom you in this doesn't work for all
all k ml's or all of the folders in the
stream players you it's only if you set
it so for some of these that they're set
if we zoom in you actually see think up
here is Central Park right all right so
it'll it'll load that yeah it's just
it's pretty neat so you can actually see
what a lot of these cities or I think we
have you know lower Western hat or
eastern half is Australia and I think
there's there's a at least one map for
every continent except Antarctica but
this is just I mean they're they're
really beautiful maps and you can spend
hours with them and so you can see this
is just sort of neat so this is this is
an example where it's sort of more fuzzy
when you zoom in as you zoom sorry more
fuzzy when you zoom out when you zoom in
it kind of comes into it loads it a
little you know more piecemeal in it it
handles it much better so you can
actually host a much much bigger or send
a much much bigger KML than you would
otherwise so okay alright so I think
that's most of what I wanted to cover it
will also mention that
googlers is also available in in French
Italian German Spanish and Japanese
you'd actually change that by going to
you can there are a lot of things you
can do actually if you go to tools and
options they're all sorts of things
people don't even if you don't care you
can just leave it right but you can for
instance make the terrain much much more
steep you know if it's if you can't
quite see the hill you had to walk
uphill both ways in the snow as a kid
you can put it on three and it looks
actually much much deeper I like maybe
1.5 one is just the average you can
always you know reset to default you can
clear your cache you can you know have
it store more cash you can change the
touring and the navigation speed so in
general you can the language settings
you can actually change it to any one of
these languages and I think you have to
close out of the program and reopen it
to to get it to to load in that language
which is which is pretty me getting to
see everything in Japanese sort of fun
yes I'm wondering about like GI a style
analysis things like you know the area
of a region and whether those are
supported in the other like more
professional you know or you know so the
question is more advanced GIS analysis
uses of Google Earth is that correct so
people are definitely using google earth
for 4G is use so one other thing that if
you get the Google Plus version a lot of
people don't know what the difference
between plus and regular you see all the
same data in Google Earth regular Google
with plus google with pro the difference
of Google with pluses you get to import
GPS points a little bit better printing
google earth pro is much better printing
which for the screenshots you there's
also a moviemaking module which is I
know a lot of real estate agents are
really excited about that because they
can send a little video of the you know
make a 3d Sketchup model of the building
you want to sell and you make a little a
little loom around
send that off there's also a GIS
importer take soon you know shapefiles
csv files just just really fantastic it
doesn't take huge I mean I kind of push
it everyone saw it doesn't take huge
files but you can take you can take you
know moderate sized files so you can
import GIS data it doesn't do you know
as nearly as advanced analysis as for
instance I don't know if you're familiar
with like ESRI tools or sure you know
all these things are mapinfo really
great programs and they're they're more
of the real hard analysis you know if
you want to get into very specific
scientific but people are using google
or is for you know all sorts just even
just visual context but we definitely
have scientists using google earth oh
yeah so am i should i actually
specifically found one of my favorite
photos we this is in Africa we have
think over a few hundred very very very
high res photos in Africa taken by
airplane by michael fay and so this is
this is one of my favorites it's of
seals um I which is very high right so I
love going into CLT with the kids right
and seeing how long the seals are right
the measure this is actually this ruler
is a measuring tool and so you can see
probably miles is not the right up you
know maybe we'll go two meters you can
see how long one of the seals are right
so this seal is about two meters or
let's let's go two feet for our it's
about 66 so little over six feet it's
kind of a kind of a big feel it's bigger
than me right so that's so that's that's
what the tool is for I don't know how
how absolutely precisely accurate is
right and a lot of the imagery has has
imperfections you need to kind of skew
it to get the right projection so
there's I mean it's if you're doing very
very very specific high level science
it's it's not quite as precise as a lot
of scientists would like but it's
definitely usable and people definitely
it's just GIS or spatial understanding
the data spatially you know you start to
notice things you don't notice at all
you didn't notice before so actually for
instance with with the whale shark whose
name by the way Schroeder they named the
whale shark Schroeder which i think is
fantastic you'll actually notice that
that Schroeder kind of you know he's
going this way he's going this and all
of a sudden here it's just like a
180-degree turn he starts going this way
and somebody took this and he they put a
can't really quite see it here they
looked at the ocean currents and then I
noticed that the ocean currents were
going this way down down in the southern
hemisphere in the northern hemisphere is
actually going more this way so they
speculated that perhaps what happened
was that all the the plankton or a
little little fish that the whale shark
might be eating was probably getting
funneled into this path right here and
so that that the whale shark was
probably just following his move is food
because here the currents are going this
way and just here they actually start
turning and so that that's something
that they wouldn't have noticed before
from just looking at a bunch of numbers
or maybe a graph that you really needed
some more spatial context to understand
so definitely people are definitely
using this for scientific research and
understanding a little less so for hard
hard analysis but the people are finding
ways so you know yes question so plans
to improve the resolution i would say
googles mission is to collect the
world's information and make it
universally accessible right so
definitely I mean we are always looking
for data if you have any let us know we
vectored I mean just of the layers data
and the imagery data we're constantly
pushing out data we're constantly
processing data we're getting data from
all all places I mean it's pretty
fantastic I think we have a third of the
world's population covered with with
high res you no imagery so a third of
the people in the world can say hey
that's my house
if you find if you find better
resolution imagery you can email me or I
can put you in contact with a few of our
acquisition data acquisition people yeah
so think that's oh the one other thing I
wanted to say is that Google Earth is
available in mac pc linux i think oh and
the fact one of just talking about what
people use google earth for because
people definitely are using google earth
to find their house and to you know show
their kids were you know where the
pacific ocean is because people still
have you know geography is still slow in
coming but so i I've heard of people
using this for urban and town planning
you know especially with the Sketchup
models people are you know planning out
where their town is trying to do smart
planning people are doing this for
education people are using this for
disaster response and awareness so for
instance with Hurricane Katrina we is
another thing I have loaded we forget
who we think we worked with the NOAA the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Association to get their day their
imagery out there was we just hosted a
whole bunch of data this is one example
where they did an assessment of the
damage they also had Red Cross stations
and a whole bunch of other things see if
I have that website up no okay one
people are using this for environmental
activism this is the Sierra Club they've
they made a KML of the Anwar Alaska
drilling so just to show to just a
visually so you can understand what what
what was going on people are using this
for just local activism as well you know
a friend of mine had
and in Arizona there is a union pacific
railroad wanted to build a switch yard
on top of his father's farm which
actually also happens to be extremely
close to an Arizona Mountain and and
state park and so he used that he
created a Google Earth model show that
at the Town Committee planning meeting
and they ended up voting 53 in his favor
so very very close and he really I think
he told me afterwards he felt that
without the Google Earth model nobody
would have understood what what they
were talking about because the Union
Pacific guys had come with these maps
that nobody really understood I actually
I think they didn't even bring the maps
for the meeting they had brought maps to
other meetings and so nobody really
understood what they were talking about
and he he put in the Google Earth
overlay showed showed where where the
switch for yard was going to be how big
it was going to be using the measuring
tool how close it was going to be to
thee to the park where the trails were
with the park and how you could see the
whole switchyard if you were standing on
top of the mountain and it really made
people understand what was happening in
a way that wouldn't have otherwise so
these are just some examples of what
people are using before people are using
it for you know just plan showing their
vacation photos to friends too so
they're all sorts of things that that
you can do with it you can share these
you know on the BBS and things are
happening so maybe I'll take a few
questions from here in the mountain view
I know the mountain view office hasn't
really had a chance to weigh in so um
question you go the other direction uh
you know I should talk about the mat to
the nice people I not so not from the
maps like not from maps.google.com I
know that the camels that you make in
Google Earth if you have them hosted
online you can put the URL into the
address in in your where where you would
put you know Paris you would just put
the the URL to look and you can actually
see the KML in Google Maps I think
all camels like Sketchup models I don't
think work but but a lot of them right
now I don't think that they have any
plugins back into google earth but I'm
sure that's something we we should look
into we do have a lot of like this
website has a link back into Google
Earth and maybe so they have I think
here you see the whole thing this is
this is their Google Earth file that
they're posting so you can hope and
Google Earth with this I know Wikipedia
if you have yeah oh definitely um and
when it's happening she's not in google
maps yet so um how do we talk to the
mountain view people all right Mountain
View people do you guys want to say
anything ask any questions yes hi um i
don't i don't think we have any
questions here okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
