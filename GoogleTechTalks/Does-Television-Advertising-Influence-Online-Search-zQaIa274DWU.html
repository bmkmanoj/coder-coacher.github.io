professor right now in a Duke school of
a business I think he does a lot of
research in interaction between
advertising technology and media so I'm
hoping this talk would be really
irrelevant to us since we have a Google
TV we have a TV appetizing team and also
we have you know the search so hopefully
you guys you know will be benefit for
this talk thanks Ching um it's it's
always an honor to be invited anywhere
but to be invited back is a real treat
so exciting place were you know
everybody's working across disciplinary
boundaries by my backgrounds in
econometrics I work in marketing I have
papers with cs folks and a few other
fields also so it's always a treat to
come over here and talk to you guys
early in my career I started teaching
advertising and I learned about this
technology that was invented in the
1970s it imperceptibly sped up radio
advertisements and so when this
technology came out there were questions
about whether this was good for the
effectiveness of those advertisements
and they found that the faster they
played the speech the more people liked
it and the better they retained the
information so my approach has ever
since i read that my approach to talk
civ has always been to speak quickly and
i trust that you will inform me if I
flip my words or if you have any
questions so I'm going to spend about
probably about 45 minutes on the main
paper here and reserve the last 15
minutes for something which is a little
bit less developed but I think might
lead to some very interesting
conversations and maybe give you a
different perspective this one I think
is going to I wouldn't have written the
paper if the answer to that question
wasn't something that looks like yes but
but the second one I think is perhaps a
little bit more counterintuitive so the
the rate at which people are
multitasking has sort of risen toward
the heavens in the last 10 years so a
study done by Nielsen for Yahoo last
year's
about thirty eight percent of americans
are multitasking with TV and internet
every single day some academic evidence
based on self-reported media usage from
a diary sample from 0120 for multi
self-reported multitasking rose
seventy-two percent in the span of three
years which is kind of jaw-dropping so
this is important for marketing but
there hasn't been a lot of work and
marketing on why that is you guys
probably have better data than this but
this is something that motive motivated
us to study this topic we know in
marketing from I so the question was
whether this has continued to go up a
lot I'm going to take for granted that
it has I don't have you probably have
much better data on that than I do I'm
just going to use that fact as
motivation for studying this topic we
know from decades of research marketing
and advertising influences consumer
search so just cherry picking a couple
of examples from people who work with me
at duke newman and stalin found that if
i've seen an ad then the brand for which
the brand that was advertised i can
recall it much more easily so if i'm
choosing a keyword to search in a search
engine i might choose the brand rather
than a category related keyword if i
have a little bit of prior information
than I tend to search more than if I
have no prior information or a lot of
prior information and so if TV
advertising provides some information
that might influence how much I search
at a search engine and advertising also
influences how satisfied I am with the
results of my search and with the
product consumption choices that I make
and so that you you could make an
argument that could map on to the
likelihood i click a result which might
be an indicator of how satisfied i am
the search that I performed so we're
going to estimate a descriptive economic
model trying to answer the question of
whether television advertising is
correlated with tendency to search
choice of branded vs generic keywords
and probability of click I'm going to
try to be very careful in my statements
and make it clear that this is purely
crypt of work we're measuring
correlations and associations i'm going
to show you what assumption you would
need to make to interpret these results
as causal i think a reasonable person
could make that interpretation but we're
going to stay away from that ourselves
why these matters for practice it's
really important in ways that you guys
might not like so if you think that
everything on the search engine comes
from the search engine and from consumer
actions taken at the search engine then
you might miss attribute some of the
effects that are going on so if
television advertising influences
consumer search behavior then if you
don't take that into account when you
plan your TV and search campaigns as
marketers typically do not my best
guesses and most categories that's going
to lead you to spend too much on search
and too little on television because you
will over attribute your sales to search
and under attribute your sales to
television but then again it's only a
matter of time before you are selling
all the television ads too so and it
matters for a whole host of other
reasons and practice what keywords you
buy what copy you put in the ads when
you are airing your TV ads how you
target your audience what effective
frequency curve you're using to select
programs on TV just a whole host of
reasons this is important to the best of
my knowledge it hasn't been studied in a
serious way by academics there is some
practitioner literature most of that is
either based on self-reports or its
regressing quantity of branded searches
on timing of TV advertisements which
doesn't allow you to disentangle the
incidents of search in the product
category versus the choice of the
keyword which is what we're going to try
to try to tease apart here for academic
research which is what I'm paid to
publish this is really important because
the literature on search advertising has
absolutely exploded in the last five
years and as far as I'm aware with one
exception every single study assumes
that the outcomes at the search engine
are determined by elements either that
are in Finn's active consumer or
determined within the search engine
market and we're suggesting there's
another way for advertisers to compete
which is through through other media I
want to be really clear upfront that the
results i'm going to show you i do not
think they are likely to hold in every
product category and they very well
might not hold for different populations
of users this talk is going to be
focused a little more around methodology
so i think that we're nailing the
results in the setting that we study but
i would i would expect very different
results in other settings so we're going
to be looking at the financial services
product category we're going to be I'll
tell you more about the search data in a
minute there's a couple of reasons why
we're focusing on financial services
first of all it advertised on television
a lot it was the seventh most advertised
product category on TV and we need the
TV advertising because we can observe at
the minute and second when those ads
appeared and how much was spent on them
and that temporal disaggregation gives
us a lot of power to identify the
effects secondly the brands in this
category have relatively unique names so
Charles Schwab etrade ameritrade even
words like fidelity are not often used
in other contexts if I had studied
something like computers then I it would
be tough to separate the searches for
apple from the searches for the fruit
right so this brand name overlap with
common words and names problem is is
surprisingly frequent when you look
across product categories a third this
category needs to be something that
people actually search for so if I was
doing this on Cola chances are people
don't search that much for Cola because
it's really cheap to buy a cola try it
out and get your information about the
products that way so this is a high
involvement category where people don't
purchase very frequently suggesting that
they probably spend a lot of cognitive
resources to search for the product that
they choose fourth simultaneity is going
to be really important in this study
because I
one point I thought about doing movies
so movies fit these other criteria
pretty well the problems that TV
advertising for movies peaks around the
date of their release as does search
activity for movies and so is the TV
advertising causing the search or is the
search cosmic it would be really hard to
tease those apart in financial services
it's not quite a so suspect in terms of
is the TV advertising being caused by
the search activity I'll go into that a
little in a little more depth in a
minute finally we've got some time
varying data which will allow us to
isolate the effects of TV advertising
from other factors that might be causing
search and we're going to use the the
stock market index which is widely
reported in media as an instrument to
tease out keys up these effects so the
online search data we're not we're not
advertising the source of these data but
you can probably figure it out so what
we've got is a about 20 million queries
for a randomly selected subsample of
several hundred thousand users of a top
ten general interest search engine it's
not google yahoo or bing it covers three
months in 2006 for each query we see an
anonymous ID the term that was searched
date and time the search if ur is always
clicked then we know the position of the
result and we know the URL that was
cooked I should mention we've been very
careful to preserve the anonymity of the
user data by analyzing these data in the
aggregate in order to comply with our
institutional research policies so what
we wanted to do was identify a bunch of
branded keywords and a bunch of product
category related generic keywords and we
didn't think that we had a complete list
of those when we started the project so
we developed an algorithm to do that you
guys probably have a better one I don't
think it's been published anywhere but
if
that's incorrect I'd love to know about
it so basically just to sum it up and
the details are in the paper what we do
is we look at keywords that lead
primarily to clicks on one brands
website and we're going to call those
keywords that are related to that brand
keywords that lead to clicks on any
brands website we're going to call
generic and keywords that often really
too often lead to klicks outside the
category we're going to call unrelated
so a couple of examples things we didn't
expect to find but we did find and have
high face validity some branded keywords
include some very common misspellings of
the brand names Charles Schwab and
fidelity I no longer know how to spell
Charles Schwab because I've looked at
the misspellings so many times those are
some some brand keywords we didn't
expect to see generic keywords all you
know look pretty reasonable a couple
there I didn't expect you GMA turns out
to be a particular type of inter
generational wealth transfer it's a
trust fund it's a tax shelter basically
so things that I didn't expect to see
but after they came out made a lot of
sense and then words that were often
appearing in queries with these other
words but we're not particularly related
to financial services that we eliminated
like calculator and government and
education and so forth if there's a
particular word that led to fidelity
that led to clicks on fidelity calm and
a high percentage of queries where
clicks occurred I'm going to assign that
word to fidelity if that word led to
eight different brand websites on a high
percentage of queries where any result
was clicked I'm going to call it generic
and if that word led to financial
services brand websites at a relatively
low rate on all the result clicks for
the queries that included that word i'm
going to call it unrelated so it worked
a lot better than we expected it to we
think that this could be used
in a lot of different settings like
you're trying to identify particular
keywords within a say a Twitter database
or my favorite application if I was in a
law firm doing discovery on a giant
lawsuit or I'd been delivered 20
gigabytes of emails and had to find
which of those ten emails were the
smoking gun you could do something
similar to this so the TV advertising
data is fantastic if you've never worked
with can't are there they're great for
every brand in the product category
we're going to see the minute and second
at which they're advertising appeared an
estimated cost of the advertisement and
then we did a lot of analysis of the
advertising content and the two
variables we settled on using were
calling web emphasis and phone emphasis
what that means is that they either said
the name of the website during the
commercial or they said the phone number
during the commercial they both
correlate pretty highly with other
measures we thought of to to measure the
same thing and there were very easy to
objectively quantify we're going to
because our purpose here is descriptive
we're going to define for user segments
and all of our parameters going to vary
within each of those segments because we
don't have demographics we can only
segment based on user graphics so if you
searched more non financial services
queries than the median consumer I'm
going to call you a frequent searcher
and if you searched anything within the
past hour I'm going to call you a recent
searcher of course we only have data for
the one search engine so there is some
risk of Miss classification of users
here but but overall it I think it works
pretty well so to explain each of these
behaviors we're going to have brand
fixed effects we're going to control for
all of the temporal variation that we
can in terms of week of the sample our
within the week day an hour within the
weekend age of the brand which we which
correlates highly with total assets
under management as well as recent asset
growth under management and we'll use
the
changes the daily changes in the stock
index and hourly changes within business
hours since those are widely reported in
the media this is mid-2006 seven percent
of advertising expenditures met our
definition of web emphasis which means
they said the name of the website in the
ad and sixteen percent of those
expenditures said the telephone number
within the ad so the brands were
emphasizing telephone contact much more
than they were emphasizing web contact
and the same pattern shows up in a
variety of alternate definitions of web
emphasis and phone emphasis we're seeing
people search more on weekdays which in
this category makes sense most of these
people are probably professionals they
probably do more searching in the office
than they do at home but we're seeing
much more advertising on weekends and
I'm going to come back to these in just
a minute so if i graph the advertising
expenditures and the total category
searches by date within the three months
sample I've got the the law I'm sorry
the advertising expenditures deflated by
a factor of a thousand and the solid
line total category searches in the
dashed line it's hard to see any
correlation there in fact it's a
slightly negative correlation because
the ad expenditure spike on the weekends
and the category search is drop on the
weekend days yeah so we experiment a lot
of different definitions of
click-through rate and the one we
settled on was whether you clicked so if
you searched the brand name at least
once within an hour then we're going to
say that you search the brand and if you
clicked at least one brand related
website then we're going to call that a
click-through rate so the search engine
that provided the data did not display
many paid links when they did they were
lightly shaded and otherwise similar in
parents to the organic links they
typically display it either 0 1 or 2
paid links on the branded searches
Briana keyword searches which is what
we're focusing on those paid links were
almost always the same as the top
organic links and so we don't have
information on clicks on ads but in this
context it we're not missing a lot we
also tried to get website traffic data
Alexa will not sell that to you if the
brand has paid them to withhold it which
was the case we also tried yep wait we
tried to supplement in a few other ways
do the best we could so if we look at
the same pattern across hours within
week days and hours within weekends we
again see close to a lack of correlation
in the two variables and so these data
suggest to me that the brands were not
planning their TV spending based on the
expected search habits of consumers so
if you make that assumption which is
only an assumption then you can
interpret the rest of the results as
causal I don't have hard evidence of it
either way so I'll try to stay away from
any causality claims although I did
present this at working and there was a
guy who worked at fidelity at the time
this data were produced and I asked him
did you plan your TV expenditures based
on users search behavior and he said
absolutely not but again that's only one
data point so okay so we've got three
models we've got four segments we're
going to relate all of these behaviors
to each other using correlations in the
error structure and I'm going to go kind
of quick just tell me if you have any
questions about anything for advertising
using an exponential smoothing
assumption we're basically the the
second equation there the the
advertising stock at any in any hour of
any day in the sample is going to be
just a smooth function of recent
advertising expenditures so this is for
searching in the category what we're
controlling for here is gamma 1 is a
segment specific tendency to search any
word in this category we're going to let
beta 1 which is the coefficient on
advertising we're going to let that vary
according to a week day hour and week of
the sample we've got the stock index in
there the the xt terms allow that the
search incidents to vary with time
effects and we've got a an error shock
at the end which I usually calls I but
some people call kasai and some people
call see and I'm going to say is I which
I'll show you how that plays in later so
on the key word choice conditional on
having searched in the category what
type of word do you choose we're going
to lump all of the branded keywords
within a brand index by k into one
option because what we saw in the data
is that if you searched a key word
related to a particular brand you almost
never searched a key word related to any
other brand within the same hour and if
you search the brand related keyword you
almost never went back to a generic
keyword within the same hour so we've
got a similar modeling structure
predicting the tendency to search the
keyword again the bass lines are brand
specific in this model and then the
advertising responsiveness parameter
also depends on characteristics of the
ad such as whether emphasized web
contact phone contact and the age of the
brand finally conditional and having
searched the any brand related keyword
if you click at least one result then
we're going to model that with a binary
legit with similar predictors in terms
of the error correlations those because
because to size what Isis eyes his eyes
we're going to allow them to be
correlated across models across segments
across time and we are going to choose
parameters to maximize the simulated log
likelihood of all of the data at once
and i'll be happy to go into details
later if you want me to they're kind of
boring they're pretty straightforward
the only thing that we really learned
during from a strictly modeling point of
view that we didn't know going in was we
didn't appreciate the importance of
waiting for how do I say it so so in say
at four o'clock a thousand category
search has occurred and at five o'clock
800 category search has occurred then we
needed to wait the amount of information
in the key word choice model within each
time period according to the number of
queries that occurred at each time
period so in retrospect is pretty
obvious but going and we hadn't expected
that it's uh so this is the key word
choice so basically what we've got is a
multinomial distribution where see in
the bottom equation c is the number of
category searches that are curd c1 is
the number of category searches that
occurred and c2 is the number of
searches for brand k so i would i it's
closer to important sampling than a
normalization okay so how does the model
perform fairly well r square around
point seven we do a holdout sample and
it's even a non-random split so we
estimate the model based on march and
april we predict for May and we see how
well we do the errors in May are less
than five percent or typically about
five to six percent higher than
errors in March and April so that's a
pretty good performance what do we find
a search behavior we don't find any
significant correlation between TV
advertising and the tendency to search
in the category this is why I threw
those caveats in at the beginning of the
talk if this was a new product category
if there were a bunch of new brands in
it or if it was still evolving I would
expect to find a different pattern of
results with regard to search behavior
in this category I think it makes sense
basically what this says is that if I
see a TV advertisement I am not likely
to I am NOT more likely to search any
financial services brand that search for
financial services are is driven more by
maybe lifestyle or demographic or
employment or financial factors not by
TV advertising you might imagine that
something different in in another
setting how yes we have a very similar
result well we have some similar results
that that people are searching based on
how the market is doing recently yeah we
are finding that TV advertising
correlates with choice of a branded
keyword so if you were to take the
causal interpretation then if I see a TV
Adam less likely to start to generic
keyword and more likely a searcher
branded keyword that has tremendous
implications for the market are
regarding the breadth of competitive
information available to the consumer
and also regarding the the likely costs
of paid clicks on the search results
that the marketer has to pay those
effects are biggest for consumers who
searched often and consumers who have
not searched recently so if you take
those together it's just that the
dominant mechanism might be that if I am
a frequent searcher and I see it TV ad I
haven't searched recently but I will
start a search rather than you know I'm
already online I hear a TV ad in the
background and that influences my search
behavior so it suggested TV
vertising more likely to start me
multitasking rather than affect me while
I am multitasking the effects are
biggest during business hours and for
younger brands we measure the effects in
terms of elasticity and we're finding
that they're pretty comparable to other
studies measurements of short run
elasticity zuv TV advertising on sales
so that's for younger brands so
somewhere around point 05 point 06 point
07 not big but not smaller than other
measurements of advertising
effectiveness in terms of clicking we're
not finding a lot of action some some
consumers are more likely to click when
older brands advertise on TV and people
who searched a lot click slightly less
when brands advertise on TV that might
suggest that some of the some of the
branded queries that a TV advertising is
associated with are less likely to
convert then in the absence of TV
advertising so in terms of the duration
of the effect it's basically in hours
not days and it lasts longer for people
who search frequently I want to be
really clear the boundaries around this
study there hasn't in academic world as
far as I'm aware there's been no work on
this topic although i'm sure there's
been work here internally and i've
already heard a couple of whispers about
that this morning we're only looking at
a particular product category that
behavior in 2006 is probably very
different from the behavior today it's a
mature category i would expect different
patterns in a new or evolving category
we're relying on time series
identification and really we would
prefer single source panel data but
hopefully will spur some additional
research on this topic and hopefully
will encourage marketers to start
planning these two ends of the purchase
funnel holistically
maybe use the same agencies to you know
work on both sides maybe adjust roi
metrics to think about how expenditures
and one medium impact outcomes and
another and also for academics we I
would argue it's very important to
consider the possibility that you know
my brand A's click-through rate may be
inherently much lower than Brandis but
that doesn't mean brand a is defenseless
they can take action they can take a
variety of other actions so I mentioned
that I wanted to save about 15 minutes
for the more formative study before I
transition over to that are there any
comments or feedback on this one I was
just going to say that your your
intuition a few minutes ago is true that
we've done work in this area and do and
do see new shirt new searches from TV
advertising I think for some of the
reasons that you mentioned financial
services is not a great example although
we do even in financial services we do
see we do see an impact that's all I
wants to so let me follow that up with a
question to you so are you are you guys
are you are you thinking about
separating the category search incidents
from the key word choice or the choice
of a branded keyword uh so I don't mmm
yes I don't know that we've done that
specifically I have to think about that
but it's a good point yes but and I
think I mean something you said very
early on was definitely saying that
we've found 2 which is you know
different categories have you know
different kind of draws for people to go
online we find financial services to be
one of the better ones in part because
there's lots of information online for
that and as you said things like
consumer products are relatively poor
because it's just the likelihood of
finding something interesting on line is
low and the ease of getting information
by just going and trying it out is high
so yeah and a lot of these things are
actually delivered online and i would
expect different
aviary fight i might even expect
different behavior if i looked at a
different search engines so why did you
lose 2006 data is that just the only
data you could get I'm a poor academic
yes that's the only day I could get but
because the financial market turmoil
alike in 2009 if you redo the study and
using the data you think it's probably a
lot noisier or it's a good question i
don't have any feel for that quick
question you mentioned earlier in your
presentation that you looked at
advertisement that call fraction on the
website or on a phone number did you see
different be a different user behavior
in one case or another so one of the
more surprising results to me from the
study is that we didn't find any
significant correlations with web
emphasis within the ad itself I suspect
the reason for that is that we did not
have website traffic data and so it may
be that people just went directly to the
website when the website was said during
the ad and I I I get in trouble when I
talk off the top of my head but I think
we were finding that advertising for
older brands actually lowers
click-through rates for some consumers
and we interpret that as indicating
people may be more likely to call on the
phone rather than search online or click
through on a search so with that I'm
gonna I'm gonna keep it brief but I've
got we've got what we think is a bit of
a provocative result and I just kind of
want to throw it out there because I
think it might generate some interesting
insights in it I think it's relevant to
some of your core business so the lead
author on this paper is Lin Li Shu she's
a very talented doctoral student at
university of southern california
and what we're looking at is price
advertising in particular so I'm going
to start with three facts that I think
nobody can dispute the first is that
price is often a signal of quality so if
this was shown in market equilibrium by
a couple of very famous economists
mogura man roberts and this has been
tested in the lab dozens of times by
dozens of studies people in fur product
quality from the price that they are
quoted so I'm going to take that as fact
second fact is that marketers are often
using advertising to communicate price
saying this might be cheap or this might
be luxury or this might be high-end and
I don't have a citation other than a
three very famous co-authors d you H and
finally the the perceived source of an
advertisement is important so I used to
teach advertising the i used the leading
advertising textbook this textbook
identified three factors of an ad as
being critical determining its effect
that is the perceived source along with
the message and the medium so when I say
source it's whenever you receive a
communication who you perceive that
communication to be from it could be a
celebrity spokesman within the ad but
just as often it's from the organization
that paid for the ad so if we start from
those three facts then we're going to
come to a prediction which is going to
be the central theme of this paper that
price advertising by the manufacturer
should be less effective than price
advertising by dealers or retailers the
reason for that is the manufacturer is
responsible for the product quality and
so if I get a price ad from the
manufacturer there's a credibility
problem if your product is so good why
is it so cheap if I get the same price
ad from a retailer or a dealer there is
no such credibility problem I can
attribute the low price to inter
retailer competition or inventory
concerns but I'm not likely to make the
same quality attribution to the retail
the dealer because they didn't make the
product themselves okay so that's going
to be our prediction we modified a price
advertisement to test this prediction
experimentally and we're looking at the
automobile case because in that industry
we see a great deal of price advertising
by both retailers and manufacturers so
I'm not going to be able to show you the
actual stimulus but I can describe it
for you pretty quickly so we we took an
ad from Ford the script of the ad was
since we introduced the Ford family plan
hundreds of thousands of Americans have
joined in on the savings now we're
extending the plan until next
September's fifth get employee pricing
on f-series America's best-selling truck
blah blah blah we took that ad we
stripped out the audio we played a toby
keith's song in the background and I
read the same script that way we could
have the same voice and music and the
two ads in the other condition we did we
made three changes all of which are
consistent with industry practice first
of all we changed the subjects and the
pronouns in the script so rather than
since we introduced the Ford family plan
since Ford introduced the Ford family
plan so this time we're giving the
impression that the source is the Texas
Ford dealers association hundreds of
thousands of Texans have joined in on
the savings that's the other change we
may we changed the geographic frame of
reference from the national market to
the Texas market because that's what
local dealers associations typically
advertised and third we change the logo
in the final three seconds of the ad
from Ford to the Texas dealers
association so in some was a pretty
subtle manipulation we have over ninety
percent of the same words in the two
scripts and over ninety percent of the
same video frames in the two ads we
first did a pretest with 150 people we
showed them one of the two ads at random
we asked you paid for it was it forward
or was it the text dealers association
or do you not know or or someone else
and we found that people got it right on
average almost eighty percent of people
got it right in each of the two ads
next what we did was we created a survey
so each respondent came to the website
they saw a Ford brand ad showing how
tough the truck is and then they got one
of these two price ads at random then we
asked them a series of questions we said
indicate your agreement on a 17 scale
with each of the following questions
ford trucks are good value for trucks or
high quality for trucks are tough that's
the Brandon claim I would be likely to
test drive a Ford truck I would be
likely to purchase a Ford truck and then
we asked what types of trucks they had
owned in the past and we advertise this
survey on facebook to people who had
indicated in their profiles that they
liked pickup trucks or that they liked
particular models to pickup trucks and a
couple of bulletin boards so these are
the results this is a sample of about
350 pickup truck enthusiasts or
consumers the dark bars are those who
were exposed to the manufacturer price
add the light bars are those who saw the
dealer's price add and all of the
differences are significant than
ninety-five percent confidence level and
it's a one to ten scale so I'm asking
your agreement on a one to ten scale
with each of those statements for trucks
are high quality a good value for trucks
are tough etc so all we did was change
the perceived source of the price ad
from Ford to the Texas Ford dealers
association and on a one to ten scale we
see a bump of about three quarters of a
point in the perceived quality of the
truck it's a really big effect
surprisingly big and we took the ad that
existed in the marketplace and it was in
our altered condition the dealer's price
source that we're doing much better it's
not like we changed it to make it worse
we change it to make it much better we
also ask people who they thought paid
for the ad whether it was Ford or the
Texas for dealers association or someone
else so if this effect is occurring and
people are making this inference then it
should be that people who thought Ford
paid for it have the lower quality
perceptions now that's not random
assignment it's we're based on it's
based on
ordered attribution but we're seeing
almost exactly the same pattern of
effects so the dark bars are people who
thought forward paid for the price add
the light bars are people who thought
for the dealers association paid for the
price at almost the same size of the
effects for sports significant the
ninety-five percent level and the last
one significant have been ninety percent
level that might be my last slide it is
so this is a we do more in the paper we
uncover a similar pattern of effects
using market data for pickup trucks from
five years of advertising and sales but
this is something that you have going on
in your paid search ads all the time I
see a lot of search ads that say cheap
that's a exclusive that I see a lot of
retailers advertising on manufacturer
brands and i thought i would throw this
up and because the first one I knew what
was going to come back toward me but
this one I didn't know was going to come
back so I wonder if this is something
that you guys have thought about or if
you think it might be interesting for
your business so I'm just wondering
whether you'd controlled for the second
variable that you changed miss but um
where you changed American to Texan I
went through it really quickly so let me
try to clarify we randomly assigned them
to one of the two price ads after they
answered the five questions about
quality we asked them who do you think
paid for the price ad and so this is
based on stated attribution so if they
thought that Ford paid for it they're
going to go into the dark bar otherwise
if I thought the dealers association
paid they go into the light bar so not
everyone got it right but what we're
showing is that independent of the
random assignment of which ad they got
if they thought Ford paid for it we're
seeing the same effect now we think one
of the implications of this result is
that when the manufacturer does do price
advertising it probably should not play
up the fact that it's from the
manufacturer so you don't want to
highlight the fact that the manufacturer
is paying for you might want to in the
TV context you might
use a different announcer maybe a
different agency may be a different
campaign theme in the search ad context
maybe you don't want to direct consumers
to the URL of the manufacturer maybe you
set up a retail or under a separate
brand that's owned by the manufacturer
and direct consumers there if the
manufacturer is running price ads ok not
quite as provocative as I thought last
question yet if you think it's real
difference between manufacture in
dillards oh just because the consumers
perceive a local endorsements of the
dealer Association I mean it's not it's
something to do with a local community
however that perception is something you
can tease out that's certainly something
that we can tease out and we haven't
focused on doing that so far because
it's kind of relevant to the paid
advertising because a lot of times you
add some you know people in the creative
they want to add local location and you
know time to your city into your town
these sims maybe you know will improve
the click-through rate that is just one
of the tactics some people might use
yeah completely agree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
