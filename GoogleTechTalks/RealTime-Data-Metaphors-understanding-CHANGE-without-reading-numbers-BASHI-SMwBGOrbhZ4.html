Allah I started the presentation with
this video because and we couldn't get
high definition working on that one on
that projector so I cannot do a live
demo no definition and so this video
more or less makes you feel what it
should be looking like and now I tell
you about the philosophy of the product
it's it's all about the dynamics and an
understanding of complex data changes
what I was fascinated by was to create a
system that could translate complex data
into images so that we don't have to
read and the other thing is like I would
like to use technology so that I'm aware
of what's going on but I'd not disturbed
I cannot stand anymore you know alarms
and SMS azure any type of incoming
signals telling me or this this this
variables change this variables changed
so I don't think that's fair and that's
tweeting like humans as data slaves that
you sit in front of computers and the
machines keep bothering you bugging you
that something has changed and have to
do something maybe because sometimes
most of the time we receive even
information the desert require any
action so it's just disturbing this is
like a de cover of a magazine that came
out in July and I really liked actually
I did present at the switch topics
change the system and just after a month
this cover came out and it's very nice
because i saw that suddenly we start
having and journalists envisioning
metaphors to describe the stock market
and this cat this metaphor actually is
even better than the system that i will
show you because it really position even
the viewer inside the submarine looking
out you know getting the idea that the
ocean is stormy getting the idea that
you know it's may be dangerous but he
lost even the sensation it is not even
touching the water anymore and this is
interesting because sometimes especially
when we deal with massive amount of data
streams we have the perception
that we are in control but where so many
inputs that maybe sometimes we will lose
completed a big picture this is an
objective image of a big picture what
Bathsheba does is trying to do the same
with company data we create business
climates business climate should be
metaphors like this one that makes you
perceive what's going on in this moment
and it should be very objective so
that's why the use of the ocean the sky
the clouds because humans have developed
the skill to understand whether in an
instant without talkative effort so if
we map change to a weather scenario we
without think we sort of absorb so many
variables in an instant and we can just
feel what's going on that's the other
thing that pushed me to use metaphors or
visual metaphors is like I didn't know
but then I discovered that we really
have a short working short our
short-term memory and can manager more
or less seven to eight numbers and this
limit is something that we never think
about if you talk to a trader it says I
can I know every number that is on the
screen I know everything that's our
perception because of that if you ask
him to write down the numbers he knows
you can't you will stop after number
eight so but the perception is that we
are in control but it's not true and and
since I am partially Italian we tend to
do things that are so sort of beautiful
to look at so even if they are not
meaningful this time I try to do
something you know to combine really
this field of art and the field of
business and it's creating in shaping up
into an intelligent way of having walls
that are artistic beautiful reminding of
oil paintings and at the same time
informative the other thing that was of
interest to me was the creation of new
proportions between us humans and the
building surrounding us and a new
proportion between the big trends and
the workspace there are things that we
are not in control of there are things
that you know we can be we can focus all
our attention on data but still there
are some major trend that we cannot
really follow so the big trends the big
influencing trends that are beyond our
control should be on the walls this way
when they think about my reality as I'm
still aware of what's going on around me
how it works is somehow simple it
requires people to decide out of for
instance of Bloomberg screen which
variables are relevant to them there has
to be some priority that has to go to it
because in order to build a meaningful
language we have to define which ones
are the vital variables and which ones
are less important and allocate more
more percentage power to the relevant
ones then what we can do is to start
mapping the existing variables to a data
metaphor it is a simple example it's
like Bathsheba webservice that's the
first step into animating and metaphor
and therefore the philosophical the
philosophically approach has been simple
in the sense that we started dividing
from Aristotle with started taking the
basic elements so we have air water fire
nerd just to start in the vertical
columns and then we connect stocks or
indexes or volatility indexes to a
sensitivity range so we say the wind is
influenced by ubs and is UBS in real
time in this case or UBS compared to
yesterday's clothes and then we set a
sensitivity range that allows me to sort
of say I'm interested in minus two
percent plus two percent that's good
type of evidence in the wind that I want
to see then we can add some elements of
random we can add absolute we can add
some other elements in here to enrich
the metaphor to the customer needs and
then imagine this imagine that you know
we have a beautiful day almost no clouds
and ubs starts to fall well that could
generate a trigger and you know a vector
of change meaning wind might pick up
wind picks up and start seeing that yeah
there are few clouds but they are moving
very fast and the wind then that even
the ocean comes up and I'm saying what
is going on and there is also ocean
speed which is connected to another
variable so also the semi is falling so
I suddenly you know from a very simple
data mapping I start perceiving that
that is a moment of change and sometimes
in life you don't have to trade or work
every moment and sometimes you have to
be there at the right time being there
at the right time is very difficult to
to sense when it is a good moment but if
you would trade options or if you are if
you're really connected you you you sort
of develop a skill whereby you know that
if you know that the volatility is going
up markets are falling then you know
maybe is a good moment to do this so
this system somehow prepare an
environment whereby the guys managing an
edge phone or this could be web server
data or this could be a mix between
Google Analytics and kpi's Google share
price which today it could be a bad day
but combined in an image it gives me a
sensation of what's going on and it's
not necessarily reading this is not for
reading chart but is it for reading
change and reading change through the
periphery of our attention so without
focal awareness I don't need to focus
here I don't need to touch a cloud to
read the number because the single
variable should be read through your
work environment so if you really need
to know what how many people are
visiting your website right now that is
perfect the google analytics that is
perfect if you not play historical
values get mine there is great if you
want a sense right now a complex image
or complex variables and get an image or
business climate
this is the type of tools you rather
have to use you can't use Gapminder 212
@ m connect to the areas of brain that
you're not using because that's the
other part this goes in the direction
that I'm speaking to you but they could
have dogs licking my feet at the same
time and that would not bother me
because they could still continue that
would be still in a direction that I
will be listening to the radio I'm
talking to you and so this is the type
of software that Bathsheba does if the
type of software it is not really for
your focal awareness I'm intrigued by
using the extra capacity that we have in
our brains to absorb information without
effort so basically i'll try to talk to
other senses i try to use other skills
that people have so that they can work
less when we map the data after that we
put them in contact so if I'm I see that
the image is cut off here but if we have
new york or monday we have the moon
phases day-night cycles star position
that match the one of the location where
the data coming from so if I'm absorbing
that about India and I'm right now here
it's night we have the full moon and
then we will start the software you'll
see how it works which moon phase the
reason India for instance and if we have
New York you know it's still daylight
and the resulting image is really like
they did the objective is really to
reduce this cognitive load that the type
of working Barnes would develop the type
of working man's that most people i have
in most companies are not respectful of
the skills that the people might have
for in allah and are not empowering them
to become more autonomous imagine this
if you have a call center no windows
could be a room like this one the people
usually are there they they have to pick
up the phone under a certain time limit
up above tree rings it's bad quality but
the bad quality is not coming in real
time the bad quality signals is like
manager coming down after three weeks
and screaming say we have to do faster
or we have simple alarms on the screen
saying you know we have to do what I
like is to envision an office space when
you remove the middle management and the
phone operators have this week virtual
windows in the virtual windows there is
a climate is the climate that we share
and it's the climate of our performance
this climate of the performance is the
indicator that if we do well there will
be beauty and there will be the Sun if
you start doing mistakes or the quality
of our service goes down snow is being
generated in real time particles per
second wind storm clouds become a gray
environment so we are basically even
aesthetically punishment there is an
aesthetic punishment for not performing
well but it which is more subtle but it
allows us to react so it's these system
work well in companies that want to do
well these systems could work well
income is going to be transparent
because you need really to be an ethical
company to say i put the KPI is I put my
performance there this is my team and
this is how we are doing and if someone
comes in and there are problems they are
there the advantage of using a metaphor
that the problems are not waiting there
on the screen so maybe outside of the
company the people will not understand
how we map the data but internal to the
company fourth floor management floor we
could sense what's going on and we know
that if this color of the sky is turning
to the sepia color it's that we know
what is the sign it may be employees
down maybe we could even have a you know
the metaphor could be up to a level that
the more you go up in the hierarchy demo
you can read and the lower you go the
less you know you understand just waves
and and clouds it is a typical setup
that you know the of innocence feel
change office of the future and
environments where we can sit and think
because one of the things that is not
pleasant is when you are in a meeting
and the guy
it's always distracted or I've got
investments and I'm losing money and I
want to see my Roger screens for
Bloomberg so with my mind that would be
somewhere else if we can take the verbs
that are relevant to us we put them in
an environment them a novel to a
metaphor and the weather is not changing
the wind discounts and the clouds are
there the ocean looks like that and
during the meeting you know with the
peripheral I've noticed that there is
not a big change in means that the data
are constant there hasn't been changed
and that is a very important information
absence of change confirms that I'm not
missing anything if during the meeting I
start seeing that the wind picks up I
might you know be more alert and if they
did the sky turns gray I have to say
sorry let's do a five-minute break I go
to the other side I look my bloomin and
I come back but these systems are more
like naturally informing humans of the
moment that might require your attention
and now you may change the room or take
a short break is more elegant is more
understandable than being mentally not
present while you're having a
conversation I'll show you now this is
like the proposal made to the Swiss
stock exchange for weeks ago I presented
and and offered this is the entrance of
the Swiss top exchange they they have
like a huge screen and just representing
just this sequence of stock market data
and there is this beautiful hole just
next to it and I said you wouldn't heed
you know you're the perfect example of a
company could profit from a new
communication instrument put at data
metaphor or the date on the left on the
right this way people entering the
building get the mood but what I what is
interesting in this case that this could
be a generic meaning of the metaphor it
doesn't have to be the one that is super
sophisticated it doesn't have to be the
one that is transformative for the
company where you mix KPIs and
everything this could be for generic use
and for communication purposes meaning i
informed
people of what the Swiss topics how the
Swiss market index is doing this way
when people passing by are illuminated
by the data and get a sense even during
the day and night when the market is
closed this metaphor continues working
so with the same forces it where the
closing so at the end even if the stock
exchange is closed but people are
passing by still this information is
flowing and you have got like this
building illuminating outside which is
very interesting because it's like a
communication statement we are see stock
exchange we did with technology
deterrence from transport data and we
inform people we could even inform
people that can't read very well we
could even inform people that you know
like that are not into the stock market
and I had a professor that went to
school from Gilbert crossed it was the
professor of my professor and that guy I
didn't know but brought this sentence
and it was when I've read it I said this
is exactly the type of work i'm working
on good visualization integrates the
natural world the technical world the
use of natural intuition spatial cues
and perception this is exactly the field
I'm moving in this is the field where
you know we try to reposition as as the
man and information environment two
metaphors that helped us in absorbing
and being aware without being disturbed
this is a short video just again Aysha
this way to when you'll turn on the
system you will get an idea up there are
like the name of the office and because
there is probably recording for YouTube
they'll scale down so you you cannot see
but you have the time which is a vital
component because every office top rider
is the time of the location and meaning
winners flip and I'm go to Tokyo in
Japan you know your God moon and start
simply repositioning very fast now i'm
really going pretty fast here so this is
like singapore
shangai Milan okay me milano me tell if
we stay here Zhu Li Hong Kong this is
like the next button because I'm the
administrator so I was recording myself
okay if we stay here this is European so
it's night actually I discreet this
midnight 11 meaning the moon is up in
the sky in the Zurich every office has
latitude longitude and this gives you a
sort of okay now I move to digital air
it will be 6 10 in New York and you know
the Sun is at the market is closed but
the forces are still there it was a good
day there and now we we move to nasdaq
which was not a positive day so we start
having the snow particles please just to
show you quickly like how and when we
move from one office to the other with
this wind blowing because i have to
clean the atmosphere from the particles
of the previous office because if i
generate in your clouds and snow in any
new york and then I go to India these
particles are still there so basically I
have to blow them away so that you know
we enter a fresh atmosphere in the next
office i'll show you then some you know
just to broaden the the brainstorming
session that we could have afterward is
like what kind of variables can you map
here you can have risk indicator
performance indicator is you know this
is like portfolio language portfolio
management like valia to risk valued
cruel kpi's or you know histórico the
point is like if you imagine it is this
is a truly space and we have like the
islands that are very far we've got the
ocean that is bothering me with the wind
and the snow but already an island that
is like distant from me that island
could be a representative of historical
could be representative of the past if
the island is green maybe it has been a
good year if the island is made of rock
maybe it has been a bad year so i'm not
saying that this is limiting the purpose
to
change but that doesn't mean that in the
picture in the 3d environment you can
still have traces of historical values
reference point because especially when
you navigate is sort of a good feeling
to have some reference points in a 3d
environment could remind me if you
imagine the shape of the island or the
size that could be very easily the
market cap of the company maybe that is
UBS maybe UBS is made of rock now maybe
UBS is getting smaller so you will have
a sinking iceberg instead of a man just
using but it's just to you know trigger
the imagination that this type of
metaphors and my p-value swimming for
instance if you're managing risk if you
want to know what is your exposure if
you are an insurance usually this
company used to pay and externals to
develop like it here and you give the
annual report these are my numbers or
this is my risk exposure can you do a
metaphor and you know unusually you do a
job that is like a design of icebergs
and you have a boat when you print it as
big and you sell it and the hang it and
they say OK in the idea this was my
position last year and they're happy or
they kind of even print from a 2d
printer you know a moment in time what
by ship is trying to do is I to do this
in real time I mean that is the interest
of this work is like I would like
companies to sense what's going on and
to be connected to the bottom because if
you meet the more you go up in a company
sometimes and you have a beautiful life
at the top floor but you sort of lose
the the connection with what goal what
is going on down below in down below
usually there are customers down below
there are the people using your website
there are many layers and you paid all
the others to take care of the guides
down below if they are not doing the job
they will not tell you especially in
banks people get fat bonuses at the end
of the year or at the end of the course
they do a good job there the last one
that
will inform the boss that something went
bad they lied it because they lose their
bonus so they can pay the mortgage so in
most companies there is an incentive in
good performance and there is so the
skill of hiding problems is valuable and
this goes up to the level of the CEO the
skill of hiding and moving to an a
different job and living the dead bodies
in the closet that nobody has seen is
the skill that some people have in the
yes there are laws and then people end
up in jail in Europe a bit less but new
companies the companies that a reacting
real time especially companies like in
this field I mean you were born with
real-time data you know how many people
are on the server you know how many the
company like this and maybe the result
that these type of compounds will will
will have the cut the right culture for
saying I when I have my data there I
want to know what's going on i'm steve
jobs sitting in my office and I've got
this glass cube for me and I've got like
what's going on in sales of the new
iphone July eleventh in real time but
that is numbers as climates and I've got
the climate for the u.s. I've got the
climate for the for Europe I've got the
climate for Asia do I need more climates
well in the future yes why because if
now I'm perceiving real time I hear from
now what what they would be interested
in is to even measure like sales right
now compared to sales last year sales
right now compared to sales same day of
last week and then we start having
multiple levels then we start having the
real real time now and then maybe some
historical panoramas which are measuring
now compared to last year or now
compared to last week same day and this
way I start getting a sense of all the
data that we have we collect everyone
puts the dead in the system it's in the
Sapa whatever but the money is really
expecting to use them there are many
companies collect tons of data
they pay externus to manage the oracle
that then we'll take care and is
remotely manage from another company
make sure that everything works yes but
then the output a chart the output like
three lines three lines out of I don't
know how many terabytes of data three
lines out of normal data that we studied
in business school most of the times we
can't even imagine which that are
relevant suddenly we are not up to we
have a problem in imagining that a
climate of data that we mix the share
price the cells of the iphone in
valhalla gives me a sense of what's
going on from the top down below from
from we include the market the the dance
did the response time of the web server
some KPIs and everything and this guy
sitting in front of him midi controller
will just soon and give more importance
to the iphone sales and less and at the
end zone climate so this would be luxury
solutions you know imaginary offices of
the future where we use the data and we
play with them and we look how they look
you know we want to see if i give more
importance the iphone how does the
weather change and maybe it was a bad
shot in and then so the idea of tuning
even data feeds the idea of playing with
and the day of visualizing with true
data metaphors is very appealing but
today in still an age where we can kind
of draw the line between what is
considered reality and what is
considered projection I think these are
interesting time because this projection
sometimes are very useful because when
we look at data or numbers changing
numbers we tell ourselves a story we
interpret if I have a thousand dollars
and I invested them and suddenly the
stock market starts going down I got
eight hundred dollars and it goes eight
under 10 I kind of feel happy I can stay
for more because it's you know I feel
like it's going up then it's 797 a 91 I
can catch
this from 7 9780 one makes me happy but
I tend not to look and I tend not to cry
from 852 800 we have some we reflect
pathological beings as humans that when
things go bad we tell us our solo it
will change you know I've got higher
changes chances now that it will go up
again but this is like the same as you
know being in Las Vegas and playing you
know I lost five times well this time
I'm sure that you know I can play
everything I can I urchin and we tell
ourselves to that's why the sad aspect
in in the business environments like
reality is the numbers and the numbers
are the one that we interpret the way
writers or artists would interpret them
we tell us the stories and when we look
at the reality that is like built
objectively in a 3d environment like
Paula Sheba panorama does we tend to say
about that is you know what if the cloud
you know what's wrong and going the
wrong direction what if the wind you
know I want to check the number behind
that cloud and that is exactly what the
people I've met you know the when i
entered the cloud to make sure that the
classes the cloud in the end it's
already a good sign because a year ago
they wanted to have the graph in the
ocean so that you know and if I you know
I want to look at me I want to make sure
that you know this idea that we want to
make sure we want to the number could be
fake that's a sad aspect the number you
know it could be done and they
miscalculated that number and and we
need numbers what I say that we just
have we ever need now not to be scared
and also put the numbers on the walls
and see what's going on in real time and
when this is happening we stimulate our
intuition and we start looking in the
right direction on our screens because
the problem is to these metaphors I can
smaller less perceive where to look
might be right wrong you don't have to
read the cloud you don't have to have
the graph in the ocean but what you have
to do is actually there is something
that doesn't pay attention here there is
something that's not working properly
let me figure it out let me look at my
feelings and figure it out so the use
would be to control inform and react I
mean this is like the office of the
future should be some office not
everyone most jobs maybe don't require
this but the people are deal with real
time and dangerous situation or you know
they want to know whether they should go
through a sort of setup like this one
there is no space for lying there is no
space for adding information because
it's vital for the performance of the
success I show you the original concert
is the drawing that inspired the work
when it when it was like more or less
clear what what that would add to be
done and this is like you have data
which for me the stock market is a good
example of random data because not it's
impossible to follow and we have no idea
in the dynamics we just have price
tunnels more or less but it's not
helping because today could be a
different day and it opens at a
different value so so let's say let's
call that random and the other thing
that is bothering that is flickers at
random there is no rhythm there so I
said if we take the data from the stock
market let's find this Aristotelian
metaphor and map them to the laws of
nature in a simplified way let's give
them dynamics that we would have in
nature so if you have like physical
formulas that driver waves for instance
they can add this dynamic effect to two
variables that we're at random so
movement from the stock market was
connected to natural laws that give a
sense of where are we going at what
speed in which direction and but beyond
the graph because you know it becomes
more elastic the system and the last
thing was what red also perceived when
they sold my work and to move from nodes
to what stop thousand painted him vision
said not I have to write music and I
want to use the different floors so he
the step from here to there and I said
and I want to do the same I want to go
from there to there suddenly I wanna
give I want to use the third dimension I
want to use the depth and I want to use
I want to really do what he did with the
music so that we can have a different
high different people praying
differently estimate because there is a
meaning for that I said we have to do
this for the stock market so that we can
feel and perceive complex any complex
environment mattoon you too true new
glasses just because I've heard that
many of your engineers and I just wrote
like the how one cloud is described just
to do because most people ask but how
many variables is it like a tamagotchi
like happy good and bad weather no it's
a unfortunately that the direction has
been to build an organic environment the
direction has been from the beginning to
do something very complex that it will
look different every day because the
goal would be that this should be
permanent display of change sometimes
you buy its expenses but you leave it
there forever as a concept the concept
that we get used to sense data from
these walls we get used to this metaphor
and so every day should look different
the same way your reality looks
different every day it's always a
beautiful day but less the sunlab the
Sun is likely a more orange to listen so
we wanted to have that aspect of nature
that aspect of organic so many there are
many more variables than the ones that
probably businesses need but the beauty
here is that if one day say I would like
to to influence the shape of cumulus
clouds but with the system at least we
you know we can say okay let's connect
that variable to this aspect of the
cloud so the beginning is simple what we
have what we have shown was in a way a
simple way of mapping you know the ocean
where is the speed is what is very
visible but the beauties we can go even
subtle and you know define things that
are really good and
beautiful so this is the video it was
showing when you entered I just run it
for a few seconds and then I'll try to
to start the simulation with with a
laptop machine which is not i'm not even
which is not the same but in this case
i'm using like a logitech air miles
because i kind of like the idea that you
move in here something and you know just
to make sure that what's going on in the
rest of the planet and so this is me
trying out the system basically so it
was a bad day particle today we should
be worse so I'll turn on the system it
requires like you know the latest nvidia
cards it's the gaming machine the type
of alienware type of machines because
there are you know hi requirement for
bandwidth 3d bandwidth and so there is
no you're right that's okay
okay I'll uh I'll leave it for how much
time do I have left more or less ten
minutes more or less okay so what
they'll do is just so here you see the
wind blowing sitter but let's stop and
I'll try to run the software on a on an
nvidia card that he's in a laptop so I
mean it's not the same as a usually the
price of the gaming and video card is
the same as the price of this laptop but
it's still a recent card with 512
megabyte of RAM so here I try to connect
through the internet and through the
stock data and we'll see probably the
first offices are the office of friends
of mine that are testing the system
boom
and the frames per second it can't be
high on this type of machines so I
apologize so now let me do deserve back
test environments so what I'm doing in
your cutout and you can see the time but
so you're seeing of even a portion of
the screen free but maybe let me change
this full screen so that you can see
more
because i think the time
sort of say but I want you just to
perceive like how the system just
visually how it should be work this okay
the Switzerland it's 1143 and this is my
control thing and down below you've got
the variables I can ask to the server
what kind of mapping does disastrous
have and now in this simple mapping
which is the type of mapping that you
show when you start in and when you want
people to understand what's going on
well it's the first step so basically
everything is linked to the SMI index
compared to the previous day so SMI
minus one for me is today compared to
yesterday it's very simple and it's a
bad day Chris who is loose lost one
point ninety six francs UBS almost one
and the SMI was down 131 points
resulting image it's a you know it's a
stormy environmental and so if you look
up and I'm showing you that but you know
these snowflakes falling because what I
one of the things that are also
interesting is to have multiple
projections with multiple machines so
that you have the front and the roof
covered so you start seeing there is no
falling before it's in the screen that
is kind of touchy or emotionally touchy
yeah so now we go to another office
that's same time so for a bad day please
like Dow Jones real time this is
different i could be good and could be
bad weather i tell you why this is sam a
friend of mine this is it just like it's
a horrible day but it's not bad this
office nobody i have to tell you the
story he this person was not interested
by like the dow jones compared to
yesterday or whatever he cares about
when do we have swing points when is the
market changing so this was tuned for
him just to you know he cares about well
it's a bad day but maybe now we touch
the bottom
is coming up so he wants just to use
this to feel when it's a moment that you
know there has been a change into the
big trend so it could be good weather
even if this is a bad day but it's a
special office I'm just going through
you know some of the offices that we
play with these nazuk and nothing then
you see that waves are pretty high and
it's bumpy you know lost 80 points so
let me see there are some of some glow
special effects here so then we have
Japan which is 646 is the morning then
we go to Singapore Singapore was also so
this the Sun is in the stars usually
readjust so that's why you see you know
planets moving because they get the feel
like I have to go to the new position
now let me just them I mean this is just
to show you that this music okay they
just to show you like the how this is
the system was built that is really is
not like a Milan horrible day and then
Allah what I'll do is that I'll try to
load and since I would like also if
you're interested to have a discussion I
load some scenarios or just to show you
like and more possibilities but the
aesthetic possibilities so that we can
imagine even different scenarios that
are beyond the stock exchange so let's
say that do you say and that's for let's
go full screen without numbers here full
screen no ticker chain
okay so I show you just like how I do
you know like simple changes but as a
mole problem could result in like the
ocean looks weird so what I'm saying is
the point here is not to be the
Electronic Arts of its not that
everything is to look cool the point
here is like there is something wrong in
the data well enough it's beautiful here
but did the waves they're kind of
simplified maybe have to check maybe I
have to look and it's not so it's very
kind of like this idea that is not the
opportunity is not to impress people
with the aesthetics the opportunity here
suited to discover if oh sorry if if in
this image the horizon is trying to tell
me something and the horizon is one of
the indicators that I really like
because you know it could be very
visible sudden you know it could be I'm
getting closer to the islands the
horizon becomes very energetic what does
that mean and like just to tell you like
some some of the particularities of the
system if the Sun is so palette is going
up with lights the clouds okay are the
clouds covering the Sun becomes a primal
indicator in this system because if the
class are not blocking the sunlight or
if the closest to similar spell all this
is telling me something it looks a bit
so realistic and it's easy to tune but
I'm just saying what we saw before where
the first step the first metaphors let a
very remind of a natural environment and
so on but i think it is also fascinating
at the same time to come up with
languages that go beyond and go beyond
even inner so that once we play with
this system once we define you know we
go we could go even you know increase
an intriguer a point where more than you
know it goes beyond nature and that is
like a bit unlimited but I think in some
offices with some people this could be a
possibility
and now I think we go back into the
office space so the lid the climate will
be more natural yeah I would say that
you know I can more or less end here we
have like five to ten minutes if you
would like to discuss or I'm I welcome
you know any feedback or anything happy
a question just about picking this
metaphors um you know so i say also i'm
gonna probably over interpret everything
i see about the ocean the color the
movement and everything else yeah my
wife on the other hand hates being out
in the boat and those little waves that
you thought were friendly she would
probably feel seasick seeing them yes
and the clouds would depend on where you
are you know an overcast sky here in
California is fine and it might mean
rain back where you come from yeah so
how can you pick some kind of a
universal metaphor well and we have to
like this interesting because you know
it happened to me too that they find the
person that boat accident you know
Indians the audience ahead and of course
they see at night for that guy is a
scary image but the point is that's why
when it's like stock market it's called
it's a column technology this you know
today it looks a bit shaky because we
don't have enough frames per second but
it's fluid it's cut it you will not get
scared because it will be images like
that and it will not be alarming because
they will not move the way you think
that you know suddenly you know
everything changes here it's like a
constant display of change that it's
it's smooth so it's smooth but
perceivable so the goal here was not to
do the especially the special effects
are there if you need them because some
people ask for the special effects some
people say i want the lightning you know
or I wonder but that's not that that is
not exactly purpose the alarms is not
this this is more like an ambient thing
that should be beautiful in the sense
like a privileged
short window in high definition smooth
clean but also meaningful and the idea
of the metaphor we can discuss it
certainly and if you really don't like
in if you feel seasick because you have
these screens well you shouldn't you
know should either change the office of
shut down the screen I cannot you know
this but the point is that is totally
cross-cultural I agree that some people
might like to is no but if we all agree
in this room that snow is beautiful
let's say that when it's snowing it's a
beautiful day fine because as far as the
system is concerned is adding a minus to
the logic so a short seller today is a
happy day so a short seller is a flag
for me in the season because for every
prime mapping I can just reverse the
logic so for me you know we could define
what is a good day and a good day could
be a snowy called motional you could say
we don't want to see where seasick you
know we don't like the ocean so the
maximum ways are like this and so you
tune a system but you cannot go as far
say we don't like nature so nobody you
know we have to be at the bottom that
more or less landscape it could be same
equal videos we might evolve problems
with you know individual experiences but
we cannot go as far that the Sun is bad
or evil or the moon in know there are
some things that has humans we can't
tender too in a way cope with so we
could simplify the language up to a
level that we can easily cope with him
we don't you know like damage anybody
but let me say add because I met him he
was Japanese and he said I like the the
ocean and but I like fishes and I like
the aquarium yes but the aquarium and he
said I you know inside that you can have
coral that changes color and that tells
me a lot and I said yes but the dynamics
of the data that you can have in a
system like this one like you can have
tall waves that are going in slow motion
that they did that that that tells me
things
that you cannot have any aquarium in a
way so these systems with particles and
at you know and components attract each
other to start to you know communicate
to humans to ask today in a way that we
can do very sophisticated communication
because we can start in a playing in
with speed of movement and that is
really something that catch I can catch
your attention and you say hmm and then
you look there and then you look there
and that is what is interesting is when
you when you spot something that you
were not thinking about this is you know
becomes and the last thing that I want
to say regarding the clouds it like
10,000 years ago me and you we would be
scared of seeing a cloud who would run
away probably because maybe with a shape
if what web we done was because the
cloud is moving maybe it's following who
that we would have developed no skill of
understanding in anticipating what what
would that would happen would be scared
of the weather today we more or less the
weather is a given thing that more or
less we know how to be able in a respond
to weather condition extreme weather
conditions are not welcome no problem no
problem for me in as a matter of fact in
the luxury installation step of thing
would be defining you know that the
boundaries of the installation the goal
is not we you know it's not for gaming
at them you know it's not meant to go
and shoot is mentally to update the
bottom line is to give the ocean view to
the gadget don't have it because if we
start complaining that something
beautiful in a cookie cause problems I
think that we have worst thing to worry
especially you know I've been in offices
in boston now that are really sad places
really sad environments and now we are
discussing that you know if we have a
beautiful view on the ocean that is a
bit of deficient maybe someone will will
be seasick but this is you see that I am
I encountered many reactions and and I
understand it and but that we we should
have the pre you know in the absence of
the privilege of having a beautiful view
the idea of having a beautiful virtual
view in high definition meaning a double
resolution what we were running now
fluid well actually you know somehow it
could makes us even feel better meaning
the opposite of feeling sick or CC
it seems to me that the when we are
paying attention to the weather there's
a lot of guessing and a lot of subtle
tea so would you have to how would you
know when something changed enough to a
high enough degree to where it would be
something that you would want to
reference and would you have to memorize
the um like what elements okay that's I
get it that's the approach of yeah so
that your expectation now because like
we just did you know the demonstration
now we looked at it and you expect the
book with the images like if the sky is
like this it means this if the size of
this image the ocean you know somehow
you expect a reference and the point is
like it do if you if you would have it
the skill of developing the language
it's so fast that you cannot believe it
but I'm not saying I'm not the sales guy
so I started I'm trying to emphasize I
know it's great no but I the dfl oh I
mean I have this hedge fund company they
I installed it because I was coming from
the yes for 3-4 weeks said okay I gave
it to you so that you can play with it
and you tell me what you think well
together but I know the guy I know that
he is using already the brain in you
know is it's not just a logical thinker
you can do many you know so I was
intrigued by the person well I played
the distillation in his office he went
already beyond in eight minutes when he
wasn't sitting in front of this he
envisions the you know I was talking
about volatility said okay if i see this
i would like to have short-term
volatility mapped here medium-term their
higher turn there and if I you know I
said I would like also to have maybe
gold thunder and poor suddenly this guy
was you know kind of sadhus and it
developed immediately sort of a a sense
of what it would be interested in and
the images that he was capable of like
the way would map and use this were more
sophisticated I have submitted what I
was imagining even a good use of such a
system and its
simple it's very simple but you
understand it is simple once you have it
in a way that you you know you map your
data why have a system that we can read
Excel now for instance because not to
you know to get into troubles I say okay
why don't you map what cut you can you
come because at the beginning of the
discussion can you come up with eight
variables that are relevant to your life
that change you know constantly or that
you would like to monitor through a
metaphor because maybe you are not there
maybe you know your variables are you
know you can if you can put you know
numbers that update in Excel
automatically let's say even eight we
can start or five or one or you know if
there is a there are components in your
life that are real time and and you
would like to start influencing and sits
like this one we can start discussing
and it could be Excel the first
interface to this 3c system and if you
start seeing your numbers in here if you
start defining the sensitivity of your
numbers so since the ocean doesn't have
to move much this is the maximum if not
it's flat you know if you start when I
give you the tool in a sense that you
are in charge then your approach the
system will change because even start
smiling and you start saying ah ok and
then you get new ideas so more or less
I'm not Bloomberg so I cannot tell you
it's no problem here is a book here's my
review of the financial language here is
how it looks and there are 10
possibilities because that's what a big
company does and if I tell you how I map
the financial markets it was there but
that guy you know you would not take
even my mapping as you know solid you
take the mapping solid from a huge
company usually that has a brain and say
this is the book of the metaphor the
financial market map to this and so what
I'm saying that we shouldn't be scared
is very simple what what what is what
you see here is very simple is very
human and if you if you start using your
data it becomes meaningful fast if we
use it if you look at the data of others
could be as boring as we
like and useless so there has to be the
interest of being informed and the data
here should be relevant to you and if it
is only for you and not for the team it
should be a private installation you
know for your office in a wet in an open
spaces for the map for you know we agree
on what is relevant and we agree and the
last thing that's so that the web web
some screens at the entrance imagine the
big screen at the entrance of Google I
imagine that this is like also
monitoring the attacks to your servers
I'm just making this up and it starts
snowing and it's three o'clock in the
morning and there are the cleaning
person a linear well you can tell the
cleaning personnel if you start seeing
snow a lot of snow and if its wing and
is the ocean is wavy give me a call you
will never tell a cleaning personnel and
log into SI p and check if the variable
is like 15 because if it is above 21 you
know we got a problem so what I'm saying
is like if we start putting things on
the walls through a metaphor suddenly
maybe you can manage the black bear you
maybe you can you know manage everything
but the people working with you maybe
they have more problems than you in
keeping the big picture these things are
useful for ending the big picture these
things are usually say if the others are
green you know get more stocks if there
are different islands in the icebergs
are there maybe it's time to sell stuff
you can tell it to a junior guy but he
would feel like a better in performing
your app you know or helping in your
business because it's very visual
