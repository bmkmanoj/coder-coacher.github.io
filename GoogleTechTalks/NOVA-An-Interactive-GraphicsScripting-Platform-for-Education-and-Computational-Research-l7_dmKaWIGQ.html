Nova modeling system some very
interesting work in the simulation
modeling that was about me yeah well
thank you Peter we really appreciate
having the invitation to come down ever
been to the campus before so it's very
interesting for us and thank you Ching
for organizing all the details so as you
know we've been involved in this
modeling enterprise which we call Nova
and the team that we've got here today
basically includes myself Richard who is
the architect of the Nova platform Nick
who's been working with Nova for a long
time John Pataki who is in the software
business service industry and has had a
strong interest in nova for the last
several years and also and he is here
and he's made fantastic contributions to
our website and a lot of the video work
online so if you go to nova modular calm
and you look at the tutorials and he
produced all those tutorials so the
title of the talk is no ver an
interactive graphic scripting platform
for education and computational research
the structure of this talk is I'm going
to do the motivation and vision part
which shouldn't last too long in the
heart of the talk will be given by
Richard who talk about the architecture
and some of the innovative aspects of
Nova and how it contributes to
computational thinking and then nick has
got the exciting part which is ready to
show how we're using nova in education
and also as a research tool so I'm going
to talk first about the vision thing so
what is nova know there's a platform
that is not too specialized and by that
I that I mean it's not built for a very
specific purpose it's built for a
general purpose platform but it's not
going to be too amorphous either because
it needs enough structure to facilitate
coding by people who have very few
coding skills
I'm basically going to be building their
code through a graphical interface so in
a sense Nova is just right for the
lawless wilds of the Applied Sciences so
in the Applied Sciences today we have a
lot of people interested in using
computational tools but who aren't deep
coders and actually can't do anything
very sophisticated without having code
as working with them so Nova is really
designed for Applied scientists to move
beyond coding not to be bogged down by
this problem of how to do efficient
coding when teaching and developing what
I call canonical and those are teaching
models and also research models so no
was going to supposed to take us the
whole spectrum from teaching to research
we think Nova is a game changer and I
think and I hope you'll come to the same
conclusion after you've seen our
presentation today so in the field of
intensive computational approaches in
the Applied Sciences I always think that
this is akin to riding the tiger so Nova
computational models can be very very
dangerous if you don't know what you're
doing and I think today in a lot of
applied field certain in the field where
I am computational population biology
there's a lot going on that is very
unsatisfactory so we ride the tiger
where the law is weak and anything goes
so the a Berkeley philosopher of science
Paul firebend wrote this book against
method a critique of science and in a
sense if we have a look at what's
happening in these applied fields that I
have listed up there you have instead of
having a foundation in the laws of
physics that can guide you in your
computational thinking and your
computational models we put together ad
hoc narratives and the question is how
are we doing science and how is this
science and over is going to help us
make it science my own area is
computational population biology and one
of the things we particularly interested
in our
individuals moving over landscapes so
here we have some yellow individuals
maybe herbivores grazing on the
landscape and some red individuals that
would like to eat these in these
herbivores and if we build a model of
what's going on we have what i call the
inner world and outer world dynamics of
our agents so our agents on these two
these individuals they organisms they
grow they have a physiology in terms of
disease processes they have an emulator
chol system they also have brains
they're making decisions about where to
go and what to do and in order to make
these decisions they have to integrate
information in their outer world so the
outer world consists of these circles or
kernels that they integrate information
over the information may retain to the
resources they need to live and also
there may be a landscape of fear out
there they have to avoid other
individuals and the landscape structure
becomes very important in determining
how they should move and what they
should do so this kind of the level at
which I'm interested in applying
computational methods and trying to
understand how these systems work with
application to conservation biology
various ecological questions so what
struck me very recently was what I call
a symptomatic case study and in this
case study had a colleague who's been
building models of animal interactions
and the emergence of territoriality is
particularly interested in the behavior
of foxes in Europe but this can apply to
many different systems and what he's
looking at his individuals go around
marking territories and other
individuals come in and when they detect
these marks they alter their behavior
and if you model these individuals
moving over landscapes and analyze the
data then you get the kinds of
territorial structures that you see in
this diagram on the left interestingly
when I said to him did you include your
code which in this case happened to be
mad
AB he said are you crazy I'm not giving
away my work now this is very disturbing
from a scientific point of view because
science is a social activity we it's a
collaborative activity certainly at this
level where you have lots of data big
problems and you need expertise of
different people to really build a team
that can address these issues and we
need to build on each other's work
rather than protecting others from
getting our software I mean I can really
understand why he says that because now
it's actually a huge amount of work to
build the kinds of models that produce
the sort of information and we need to
make that process easier so Nova is our
solution to containing this tiger that
we all want to ride and part of that
solution is to promote a collaborative
community of model builders Nova's a
highly expressive visual language and we
think that this will set new standards
of information exchange it as a Richard
will explain it promotes process
thinking which we believe will lead to a
better trained generation of applied
scientists it'll also allow rapid
prototyping and accurate coding which we
believe will they lead to best modeling
practices and reproducible science and
finally efficient development of
research models which in the context of
Nova will lead to reusable libraries
pedigreed methods co-chairing those of
you who know are in its tool boxes have
seen how this has promoted statistical
were applicable to do all this if it's
the right platform we believe it is so
in promoting a collaborative
computational community of applied
scientists what we're most interested in
doing is firstly teaching Nova in
college courses and we're ready doing
this at oberlin and Berkeley
we're also trying to bring Nova because
of its ease to start our building very
easy small modern models to the high
school classroom and Nick's going to
talk about our success in this
particular area at this time we planning
local and international Nova workshops
and we're doing this by forming an
international consortium to enhance all
aspects of Nova and Richard will show
you the different components the IDE
interface the plugins and libraries and
how we put these things together so at
this time this international consortium
consists of it's very informal it isn't
a formal consortium at this point but we
have collaborators in South Africa at
ukzn where I have an appointment
colleagues in Israel in Norway we hope
to develop more partners in India we
have partners in Germany and also in
Spain so Nova is supposed to be this
easy entry platform with spectacular
power and Richards going to show us why
we go so I'm going to talk a little bit
about the structure of Nova show you a
few examples and give you a feel for the
approach that we're taking in in this
platform at the risk of being a little
bit glib I tried I like to think that
what we're trying attempting is a poke
at the architecture of computational
thinking so the challenge really is
boiled down into to two parts first of
all to create a design platform whose
components express the abstract
structure of dynamical systems so in
other words we want to create some kind
of visual metaphor that is appropriate
for the kinds of systems that we're that
we're building but at the same time we
want to provide the tools that promote
the best practices of program design and
somebody who's been involved in
programming myself for the last
many years I have a sense that that
there are there good and there are less
good ways to build programs and I'd like
I'm hoping that what we what we do here
is try to provide that same ethic in a
sense to this new miliar this this new
area so the kinds of models we're
talking about really fall into three
categories first their system dynamics
which is was invented around or
formulated around 1956 is exemplified by
these stock and flow networks the stock
and flow networks are actually visual
representations of differential
equations and simulations that use these
networks are in fact what they are doing
is numerical integration but fortunately
the designer doesn't really have to
think that way all what they the
designer thinks about is that they have
a reservoir they have a flow into or
possibly out of that reservoir that the
flow has a certain rate and effectively
they're dealing although they're doing
with derivatives they don't necessarily
have to be formulating their thoughts
that way in particular things get
interesting when there's feedback in
fact there let's say they're not
interesting at all if there isn't much
feedback but most of these systems do
have some some form of feedback and so
the these that that is expressed very
directly in terms of the diagrams now 22
in addition to the system dynamics we're
also talking about another sort of
another domain of modeling and that is
the domain of spatial and agent-based
models spatial models if you're familiar
with cellulite Amida like the game of
life then you've seen you you've seen
something of what I'm talking about
cellular automata represents some form
of topology namely that these are each
of these cells and a cellular automata
has some sort of individual state
transition rule and these cells that
rule may depend upon something that's
going on in the neighborhood so
topological considerations enter in
adding to that we have agent-based where
we talk
now about individuals that can similarly
have internal States but they also
interact with each other there are
births and deaths possibly and they may
interact with their environment okay so
nova is a single framework to capture
this eclectic set of systems okay and
i'd like to think that the expressive
power that we're going that we're seeing
as we build nova models derives from
these properties of good programming
namely modularity the ability to to
isolate and modular eyes various parts
and interchangeably slip them in pull
them out and so forth abstraction and
extensibility okay so here's the here's
a quick look at the Nova architecture we
start down here with a design platform
that a visual design platform on which
we are able to construct models using
the visual component language this
design platform supports multiple levels
and as a result the component language
is able to support various forms of
abstraction and aggregation now the
model that is created visually on this
platform is captured and turned into a
script in a language called Nova script
Nova script is a embedding of a is
embedded in JavaScript so that is a
complete JavaScript language interpreter
with additional object types that
represent the abstract elements of of
these of these models the mott the
running or the simulation actually is
equivalent to running the Nova script
program on what I would call the Nova
script runtime environment which is
similarly the JavaScript runtime
environment with these additional with
these additional elements at various
points in time there is going to be some
kind of display you're going to want to
display graphs are going to want to
display various possible visualizations
and so we then reflect back to the 2v
the student to the display element which
we call the dashboard and which includes
various different kinds of display
entities so what I want to do now is
switch to a go over to this demo this is
a an example of what a nova of very
simple Nova model looks like this is a
model of a population growth this is
kind of a hollow world of the system
dynamics modeling and so we have a
population that is encapsulated is
represented by this stock it if we're
only modeling burt's so we have births
that represents the rate of change in
which the population of the population
the births are themselves determined by
the current population times a rate
factor and this is what gives us the
exponential growth that we're familiar
with so if I construct this model this
way we have graphs on this side this is
the dashboard side and what I do is say
to run it is the capture load exec we
set up some time time constraints here
we determine a DT for the numerical
integration and an integration method
and we run the model we get we get this
graph now the actual model is contained
herein this Nova script so this is the
the model has been that has been
captured and turned into a script and is
actually running on this Nova script we
present a console here so you can
actually interactively probe the model
find out you could single-step it you
could ask for different values along the
way and so forth which I'm not going to
do now now another interesting thing you
can do with this well from a teaching
point of view is you can put it into a
mode where if you change the rate you
immediately run the model and you can
see get instant feedback on how things
change so we're we're thinking in terms
of a very good educational user
interface
specs now I'm going to eliminate some
parts here i'm going to show you a trend
make it do a transformation and by the
way what i'm showing you here is not new
stella vensim berkeley madonna they all
implement systems that are like this but
what I'm about to show you i think is
new so let me let me get rid of this i'm
going to convert this rate slight into
from a a value i'm going to convert it
into a pin i'm going to add a pin which
will call pop out i'm going to now run
an arrow from here to pop out because
what i'm going to do and pop out is just
rip is just present the population and
so these pins represent input and output
ports to this model so think about this
model now all by itself what if so so
the next step is to create a sec a new
layer which i do by clicking here and so
now we have the lower layer which
contains the original model we now have
this upper layer and i can now pull this
out and create an encapsulated version
of the original model at this higher
layer the original model is inside and
you'll notice that the pins that are
sticking out here correspond precisely
to the pins that exist that are that are
shown here so now once again i can i can
i can add a i can add a graph we'll just
call it you know pop graph and i can
connect this connect this graph and i
think in the interest of time I've kind
of already done this in a an existing
model we add this here and we have to
add something to control the
control the rate so we have that and we
connect that over here and now once
again we have we have the same model we
had before but now the model exists at a
different level now I could what's
interesting about this is that if i want
i can create two instances of that
models and that's what i've done here so
i've got two instances of the same model
at this this upper level and i can
change the different rates here and we
see that see it see it this one only
affects the second one this one affects
the first one so in other words we can
have multiple instances of the model and
that's you know not something that's
unfamiliar to programmers because in
fact we write subprograms and we do this
sort of thing all the time so so what I
showed you that we had originally the
the original model i call the capsule
this is a castle where i've added the
pins and now you can see that in this in
this situation i've embedded this
capsule into this chip and the chip
represents the the sub model at the
higher level so another way of looking
at this is that we've created a kind of
a third dimension to the design so
instead of being a flat design we now
have a three-dimensional design and just
to point out that this too can be
embedded in something higher and so we
can go as high as we want in terms of
this kind of vertical design now what do
you do with that kind of thing well
there might be a good might be a number
of interesting things you can do in
particular you could represent a spatial
grid so I could have a bunch of chips
and I can line them up in horizontal and
vertical rows and columns and I can
think of those as actually being some
sort of positional thing or I can also
think of them as a set of agents now the
people who came up with Stella thought
of this kind of themselves some time ago
in hannon
book from 2001 he proposed spatial
modeling and Stella and this is the
picture that he came up with so what we
have is a single model where he's done a
kind of cut and paste and he's cut and
paste the same model over and over again
and then he has to hook up the various
pieces it's interesting that he actually
had his grad student do this rather than
doing it himself and this is what was
proposed as a spatial model and notice
that we only are able to get nine
different nine different you know a
three-by-three grid which isn't very
much so so this is not of this is
certainly not a particularly good
solution but in fact the chip solution
is not a great for this particular case
would not be a great solution if you
wanted a half say ten by ten you'd have
to manage a grid of ten by ten chips so
in fact the better thing to do is to
think in terms of more advanced
containers and I'm going to demonstrate
that with some examples I think there's
probably only time for two of the
examples so I'll juice through the first
and the and the last to show you a
spatial model and then a spatial and
agent-based model and the by the way the
nova ships with a whole set of a model
library and all the examples i'm showing
you are in that model library so let me
load up the the first example this is
called the fire spread example and it's
kind of a it's a cellular it's kind of
like the game of life in a way but what
we're representing is a forest with
trees the trees can either be green on
fire or burned and the rule the
transition rules are fairly simple
namely that if you are a tree that's
next to a tree that's on fire then
there's a probability that you might
catch fire if you catch fire you burn
for one time unit and then you burn out
and then you can't be burned anymore now
to make it interesting we also add in a
this blue fire wall but to make the
firewall interesting we add some holes
so if i run this there we go we can ask
ourselves well how often are we going to
go through how we go there's a firewall
going to hold and how does that relate
to the probability of a bird
then we can repeat this okay we haven't
gotten through yet fire burned out if I
obviously if I up the probability we
would expect more worse things will
happen all right so what are what is
this model built out of well it's built
out of a grid of I think it's 50 by 50
so 2500 cells each cell is in fact a
model similar to the original to the to
the model that I showed you before
namely we have a state which is
represented by the tree the state can be
one of three four possibilities either
unburned burn burnin burned or a
firewall and then we have the lot and
now we're at a point where we have to do
something that departs from what system
dynamics gives us in system dynamics
there is so much semantics built into
the basic structure of the stock and
flow namely the fact that you're using
an integrator that all you have to do is
represent the stock and the flow and
kind of the system kind of takes over at
that point but but for these more
advanced models we're actually going to
have to specify what we want to have
happen we have to specify that logic and
that's where things get hard because
specifying logic means programming we
can make that a somewhat less daunting
task if we can take the pieces of
program and then represent them visually
and represent them in terms of
functionality so in here this I i have
in this element here is what is called a
program chip a program chip or a coach I
guess as a coach Chip and a code chip
contains is the represents a function or
it can represent actually you can have
field so it can it really represents an
object it also can represent a
higher-order function so you can
actually define a function that can then
be exported al you at the sort of the
way you might do it in whisper scheme
and the code chip contains the logic for
one definable part of the model namely
in this case it contains the logic for
how burning what the logic for burning
so we have input we input the current
value of the tree what its state is the
probability of burning and then
something about
neighbors now neighbors is an important
part of this namely we're only going to
burn if our neighbors are burning so
what we have to do is compute the the
neighbors and that requires another code
chip so we create a code ship which
simply says here are my coordinates who
are my neighbors I just iterate through
a nested loop and I can compute my own
neighbors so I compute my neighbors here
the neighbors are stored here and then
are ready to be consulted over here so
this model visually presents how the
logic of the system and the beauty part
of this is that if somebody else needs
to compute their neighbors your friend
you could take this part of the model
export it to them and they could just
include it in fact all of these things
are are exportable the code the code
chips those capsules and so forth we're
all exportable and an archive level so
once the functionality has been defined
it becomes a black box that you can if
it's been if it becomes trustworthy then
in fact you can use it again and again
okay so yeah look at the container that
some model is in is that fire spread
layer on top does that actually contain
instances of this thing I'm about to
talk about the containers right now see
an abstraction violation
the bottommost loudly so at neighbors
and neighbors needs to note that it's in
a container that has this kite that's
right so the neighbors if you look
closely what's happening is that their
primitive operators that are provided
those primitive operators are only going
to be valid if in fact the capsule is
part of the container so you're
basically making a call to your
container to get that information I I
mean that's a little more a little more
in the weeds that I wanted to get into
but that's if I showed you the code for
neighbors let me show you just quickly
to answer your question right yes is
that generically it seems that's pretty
much assume that okay maybe we have a
rectangular layout maybe what we had a
hexagonal grid instead of well then we
wouldn't we would abstract this
impossibly abstract this in a different
way but this is depending upon the fact
that this is going to be used inside the
container precisely it seemed that it's
very dependent on the containers height
which seems to be a bit of a strong
coupling between a model you know the
peace that's the trees sensing logic
container that that's embedded in so we
just wondering how how it's possible to
better abstract the tree and it's
sensing at what's going on around it
there's gonna be more chair well there
could very well be I mean this is this
is tailored to this particular model so
we're going to be for example our next
one of the things that we're going to be
looking at our more generic containers
where the the notion of neighbor becomes
a more abstract concept okay and it
doesn't necessarily depend on the fact
that it's a Cartesian grid okay but in
this case we we are and you know that's
that's okay but I'm glad you notice that
I mean that's that's that's really the
idea is we have a container the
container provides services to its is
constituents and the constituents will
use those services and we want to make
those services as abstract as possible
okay so that is a goal so actually here
is the container there's not much to
look at but this as a you know as you
have sort of teased out the fact is that
we've got the we've got these containers
that do provide a particular set of
services in a particular topology the
cell matrix gives you is a effectively a
two-dimensional array so the idea of a
of a pair of coordinates is a natural
thing for this the agent vector is a
one-dimensional array but it adds
additional capability involving position
and also births and deaths and then the
simulation world combines the two it
combines the cell matrix and the agent
vector so that the world that the agents
are moving in is in fact the world that
is defined by the cell matrix and the
agents can interact with their with
their ground and I'll show you an
example of that right now
well we had some questions okay so here
this is the wolf sheep predation and
what you have here the wolves are in red
the sheep are in blue we also have grass
growing the Sheep eat the grass here
we're using a sim world okay and this is
our grass where we have growth and we
have eaten and this red point represents
a communication point between an agent
that is the agent that might be
occupying that cell and the cell itself
the agent is the most complicated part
because it actually impersonates both a
wolf and a sheep at this point this
particular point in Nova development the
agent is a there's only one you can only
put one type of agent in an agent vector
but we're working on having a multiple
flavor type of representation but you
can always do it by through a mode which
is what we do here you you come up with
a type and that it's either a shaper
it's a wolf and it's different different
functionalities are going to be swapped
in Sochi energy here's whether we deal
with sheep eating grass here's where we
deal with sheep wolves eating killing
sheep here are code chips that that
compute all of that here is a mover this
is a generic mover that's used in a lot
of different models that turns polar to
rectangular coordinates so talked about
code chips and then the last thing is
plugins and plugins are a way of
extending the innova platform with
actual java extensions that talk to an
API so all of the visualization elements
that you saw there are examples of
plugins now I have one more I have one
more example that I think it illustrates
the granularity of model structure that
Nova actually sort of forces you to
think
about so here this model is a four layer
model and at the bottom layer we have
one kind of thing happening namely we
have a fission event so a rather fishing
or die so if I exact this model we
thinking of an individual that does one
of three possible things it either
persists the way it is at one or it goes
to 0 or it goes to 2 and we identify
zero as dying and two is fissioning okay
so here's this is an event-driven
event-driven MA or an event oriented
model you take this one layer up and you
you use what's called a clock chip and a
clock chip adds to a chip the ordinary
chip the ability to actually have its
own clock so that one tick at this level
then becomes an entire simulation at the
level below and now what we're going to
do is we're going to look at this
happening we're going to repeat the
experiment some numbers say ten times
and use a histogram to show what is the
you know what happens over those ten
different simulations the histogram is
an example of a plugin 11 of the one one
example of a plugin that that does the
function of a histogram at this level
now we're going to actually take those
elements and create a agent space in
which the behavior plays out so that
we're going to in fact see a population
trajectory of watching starting say with
a hundred individuals and going through
this vision and die or die a process
we're going to watch the growth and
decay of the population so it goes from
100 up to 130 and so forth now I think
we have the probability of visioning and
dying as the same here so in fact it's
going to be a fairly random process and
that the next level up we're going to do
a statistical analysis so what we're
going to do now is once again using a
clock chip is going to repeat the
experiment say a hundred times and we're
going to accumulate we're going to
going to accumulate statistics down here
namely the meet the mean and standard
deviation and we watch actually as this
is done over and over again that in fact
this gets very smooth so each of these
is a is it shows process logic of a
different type that is played on the
level below each of them is a different
kind of of process it's it's certainly
clear that one could write a Java
program or a JavaScript program to do
this it's not a complicated model but
what was really what this really shows
up here is how these different layers
actually are distinct and how they
interact with each other in other words
the actual architecture of the model is
much clearer here than you would
actually see if the if you were just
coding it up you can also take any of
these layers and possibly plug something
else in and and use them in a different
model so I'm going to complete my talk
with just a few little bit about the
future so a couple of things two very
important things we want to do is we
want to be able to interact with other
platforms we are already interacting
with the art platform and we are in a
limited way we also want to be able to
use GIS data for two to program our
spatial or spatial models and very
important is we want to be able to
create curated archives and libraries of
capsules code ships and plugins so that
we can create an entire set of tools say
for wayne's domain for for population
biology we could create another set of
tools and create communities that use
these tools enhance these tools and are
actually interacting over the sort of
ecology of Nova another very important
aspect in terms of ramping up is to be
able to use high performance computing
and Nova is really quite architectural e
appropriate because in fact we have Nova
script and then we also have the the
visualizing and design platforms and
they're separate and so for example the
Nova script could run on a server and
there could be interactions between
clients on a laptop or in a mobile or on
a mobile platform now I haven't had much
of a chance to talk about Nova script
itself but there's a paper that you can
download that actually give some details
about the scripting language there are
some people who actually just gone and
written Nova script programs without
actually using the visual domain so I'm
done so we're going to try to bridge the
gap between education and the research
right now which is a clinical trial
simulation to reduce mortality in Africa
childhood mortality in Africa and rich
touched on this as a as a nova user this
is how I think about nova in terms of
how it's useful for me it's a
domain-specific visual language and the
domain is modeling in all this different
capacities and not only that we actually
can reach down into some high-level
scripting languages and get more
expressiveness than we would have in the
visual domain and if we really need to
or if we have something that we really
like we can reach down at a lower level
language stuff and develop plugins and
tools java but the the productivity and
the the process thinking and the
accessibility happens up here at the
domain specific visual side i think
that's really where nova it shines so on
the education side there there is a new
set of national standards the National
Research Council of the Academy of
Sciences has released two documents one
is called the framework for k-12
education the others the next generation
science standards these are designed to
inform state standards and states are
going to use this stuff to figure out
what they want to do in terms of their
state school systems and what I want to
show next is a reasonably complicated
articulation of how they view the
scientific process and I'm going to
highlight where Nova fits in this
framework but the notion is that you
have the real world where you have
real-world data where you're able to
collect data and test solutions and then
you have theories and models on the
other side and you use theories and
models to help you formulate hypotheses
propose solutions and what we do in the
education setting with Nova is we
actually allow students to interact with
theories and models in a more intuitive
and integrated way
though them to explore and formulate
hypotheses using those computational
models and the exciting bit is that we
actually let them collect data test
solutions in a simulation environment
and we're Nova really shines us when we
actually introduce real-world components
and we actually have the whole
scientific process happening quickly in
a computational form for students and
that's our that's our approach to this
we want to link all these things
together so our objective here was to
develop a three-day lesson that an
instructor could implement in class that
would teach infectious disease
principles because that's my background
that's the background of the funding
agency and computational modeling
principles and then we wanted to engage
students in that intuitive rapid cycle
scientific process we wanted to focus on
global infectious disease so what we've
done so far as we did we did a pilot at
castellet on the fall and the pilot was
in to biology class rooms at castilleja
we did a second revision of that lesson
at the Bay School in San Francisco and
just three weeks ago we did a public
pilot at Aptos High down in on the other
side of the Santa Cruz Mountains in a
health class so not in a biology class
and not in an experimental biology
setting but in a health and how how can
I use a model to understand my decisions
and health book health consequences of
those decisions so we're exploring this
in a couple different realms and we're
seeing good things and we presented the
results that we have at the California
Association of Independent Schools Jhene
and I did a presentation there and there
was a lot of enthusiasm for these kinds
of tools and then we also presented them
at the UC San Francisco academy of
medical educators annual education
symposium and something very interesting
happened where people in the medical
education world said if you can
introduce computational modeling tools
and data-intensive applications to high
school students it would be great if we
could do that with our medical students
because that's what we need to train our
medical students to do in the future so
everywhere we go presenting what we do
we get enthusiastic responses and people
really see potential and I'm going to go
into a little bit of detail on what we
actually do in these classrooms because
you can't just hand students a model
have them play with it and have them
come out with discovery you actually
need to introduce students in an or
or intuitive way to what we're doing and
the way we do that is we start with a
very simple lesson called the circle
game which is an interactive intuitive
experience where students are all
sitting in a circle and one of them
starts sick and they have a local
contact neighborhood we don't describe
it that way we say look to neighbors to
your left and two neighbors to your
right count how many people are sick and
we give them a rule that they execute
with a die and they essentially execute
the algorithm of a computational models
infectious disease live in class and
none of this is is introduced as
computational modeling at the outset but
they are essentially doing a
computational simulation there they're
the nodes of the simulation and we show
them that exact same process using the
simulation software and all of a sudden
we've mapped a real world experience
that they had where they were looking at
an infectious disease to the
computational model and not only that we
can run this multiple times we can
explore it iteratively and we can see
different trajectories of infection in
this setup of the game people are
healthy they get sick they never get
better and so over time you see that
everybody ends up in that infectious
state and this is a great moment for
students to offer their alternate
interpretations of how infectious
disease works and they can say well you
know chickenpox people get better and
they get resistant they're immune you
know other diseases you get sick and
then you get better and we actually are
able to implement those other rules of
the game to see how they change the
infectious disease process and students
are providing the idea we're showing
them computationally how that plays out
so students immediately in that first
lesson we're just trying to build a
foundation for them to understand what a
computational model is and we do it with
experience and we do it intuitively we
send them home with a homework
assignment where we assign them a
disease in small groups and they parse
out some of the parameters that you
might use for these infectious diseases
and they they go and they realize that
the real world is messy that you you
can't necessarily figure out you know
all the time how many contacts
somebody's is going to have for measles
for instance or what the transmission
probability is but they go out and get
real-world data and they come back for
less than two well and this is what the
data looks like and we provide the
instructors with a background on measles
what would be appropriate parameters for
measles how are these documented so
they're in a good place for this so we
have a foundation we have real-world
data and that's where we're able to
actually do the computational modeling
we've cushioned and set students up to
succeed and they do things well they
launch it on a web page they do things
like this and what we have here is a
simulation of measles we're looking at
how the frequency and size of the
outbreak changes when vaccination rates
were changed and students are given this
model they have four parameters that
they can change the and those are set up
in sliders and rich showed what those
look like and we're actually starting
with a high-level resistance so imagine
high vaccine coverage 95% vaccine
coverage instead of being in a static
use fixed Network the agents are
actually moving around students are able
to map this and realize we're getting
closer to the real world this is how
people might actually mingle for measles
and they can change parameters and so in
this demo we change the parameter of
vaccine coverage from ninety-five
percent to seventy percent and you see
epidemics play out and we have good
visualizations of what that data looks
like students are able to work with this
stuff in a couple of different ways and
they're able to do it interactively
they're able to see the animation
they're able to see the data so it's a
powerful tool for letting students get
an easy and and powerful introduction to
what computational modeling is an
infectious disease so we scoot on and
when I was showing this to my partner
last night she said this is a death by
PowerPoint slide you have you know an
entire paragraph of text sitting up
there and the reason why I have this up
here is because this is what a student
responded to in our cast tool a lesson
we said write a concluding paragraph and
put in you know what parameters you did
and what significance it has to the real
world you know give it give it your best
shot this is our pilot lesson and you
see that the student says if resistance
goes from ninety-five percent to
eighty-five percent in a town with the
population of 100 so they're quantifying
their simulation there they have
incubation times and infectious times in
there how does that affect the number of
people who get measles and they in you
know in two lessons or in three lessons
they're able to connect their simulation
to the real world and they're able to
say something like from the answer to
this question we learn that if towns had
an eighty-five percent resistance or
instead of 95 you could have a mini
epidemic so I think our lesson is
successful for the students and this is
a great
Cator of how what we're trying to do is
actually getting through to them and
this was in our pilot lesson things have
really improved in a lot of ways since
then we did a public school pilot we
actually did some pre post analysis we
asked students to define a computational
model on the way in we had a couple
students who nailed it right on we asked
them to define one on the way out
ninety-three percent of students got it
we had a couple students who just you
know the whole lesson went by they
didn't get it and is gonna work for them
we also asked how this simulation
exercise or this simulation lesson
affects their understanding of
infectious disease and we had a lot of
students reporting that the the model
help them understand something about
staying home when you're sick or getting
treatment and antibiotics and how that
might affect infectious or vaccination
so it looks like we have a lesson that's
working really well for students really
what we need to focus on now is a lesson
that works well for teachers and our
expert instructor that we worked with in
our public pilot said anytime he's
presented with new content it's a five
minute test he needs to have he needs to
know what he's going to do and what his
students are going to do in five minutes
and if you can figure that out I'll
spend the rest of the time actually
putting the lesson together and what we
have right now we want to really work
towards executing that five minute test
so we have something that works for
students we have something that we need
to improve and make better for
instructors because instructors are the
the limiting reagent in the whole
reaction so we want to pass that five
minute test teachers want to use these
lessons in the fall and in the spring
they want to develop their own lessons
in the future and we're going to be able
to continue doing this and we're going
to put the documentation and the
assignment sheets and all the support
materials to pass that five minute test
online so I'm going to change gears well
i'm going to thank the people who we
work with this is part of something
called the model infectious disease
agents study that's the nih group who
does this infectious disease research
stuff so now i'm going to go to the
other end we're using nova to help
understand how we might reduce childhood
mortality in Africa and and I'm laying
this out to sort of show the scope of
what we're doing with this tool and what
you need to know here is that to reduce
mortality in Africa what you do is a
cluster randomized clinical trial where
you provide treatment to some
communities you provide a placebo to
other communities the randomization unit
is the commune
and you try to observe if there's a
significant effect or significant
difference between some outcome variable
in those randomized communities and that
might be malaria pneumococcus or
malnutrition so what we do with Nova is
we actually pull spatial coordinates for
where these villages are that are in the
trial and and Google Maps is a great
tool for this because you you realize
that you can actually get very high
resolution on what these communities
look like you're getting census data on
the ground for for the villages and
you're able to actually verify that
census data with a high resolution
picture able to say you know does this
look like a seven thousand person
village or a 300 person village you're
able to verify and validate your your
data and we're able to use that data in
our simulation so this is this is not
the trial area that we're working in and
and the trial that we're working in
isn't planning stages so I can't show
that stuff this is somewhere else and
we're using this as a demo and these are
communities randomized into into control
and treatment and you can imagine that
there are actually different mortality
factors say along this cluster here
which is along a waterway versus these
more sparsely located populated areas
probably in the highlands and probably
further away from water sources and if
your clinical trial is trying to figure
out how you're intervening and what your
intervention looks like in these
different environments that's that's an
important thing to think about and every
single one of these communities is
actually a child submodel aggregated at
the community level and then
reproductions of those aggregates in a
spatially relevant context and what we
get is a simulation that when we animate
it looks something like this and what
we're looking at in that yellow color is
the incidence of invasive disease so
this would be the disease state right
before mortality event happens and this
would be the place where an intervention
would reduce mortality and what we
actually are simulating here is every
six months some treatment is interjected
into the treatment groups and that
treatment doesn't exist in the control
groups and you can actually lay out and
simulate your whole clinical trial and
test out different hypotheses or
assumptions that you have about the
underlying population region and it's a
it's a great tool for exploring and
making some
simulation-based decisions about how
you're going to plan a clinical trial
that you you want to succeed and
essentially what we're doing is are just
trying to map do do these control
villages here map to reduction of
mortality here and Nova's nice because
we aren't actually doing the statistics
in JavaScript which is the the
underlying language the scripting
language we're actually using our for
that so we take all the simulation data
novus playing nice with are we we do our
statistical analysis over there we pipe
it back over and you can see this is
what we're really trying to get at with
our clinical trial simulations which is
what's the power of the study how often
would we see the effect of the treatment
if an actual effect exists and and two
to close off more or less this is what
the model actually looks like they're
script involved in here but the
components that we're using for the
simulation I'm really the same
components that rich was able to show at
the beginning and we actually have an
infectious disease state here we have
the child here which includes that
infectious disease state where
aggregating children at this level and
then we're aggregating communities here
and we actually have multiple levels of
aggregation you're aggregating an
aggregate and we're really using that
hierarchical structure of Nova to
successfully implement this simulation
and it's relatively visually
intelligible you if you organize it if
you're able to communicate it well you
can use the the flow and the visual to
express what you're doing so you know
the breadth of Nova you can do stuff in
k-12 education you can do stuff to
reduce mortality in Africa I think more
pertinent than that is actually that
we're trying to introduce tools at the
k-12 level that people can then use to
help resolve some of the most
complicated issues that were faced with
today like development and mortality in
Africa and you start in high school with
an introduction to it you're able to use
the same tool as you progress through
your higher education and you're able to
take it to innovation and research and
it's a it's a tool that works at both
ends of the spectrum and can push and
accelerate students along their path
so thanks for giving us the opportunity
and how much of a programmer were you
yeah so if I put myself on this spectrum
I was introduced to Nova at the higher
education level and in two years of
working with it three years of working
with it i was able to accelerate to that
innovation and research level where
we're doing useful things for real
people and practice it is not a CDS
