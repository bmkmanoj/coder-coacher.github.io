and my job at Google involves creating
the conditions for world peace in my
lifetime which is why I'm always excited
to find Bieber whose potential impact
can create world peace but who hasn't
yet won the Nobel Peace Prize and one
such person is our order yesterday
father Lawrence Freeman father Lawrence
is a Benedictine monk who is the
director of the world community for
Christine meditators in London father
Lawrence believes that meditation
restores the contemplative life which is
a vital dimension of Christian
spirituality and that you can also
become a natural bridge unifying all
religions and I find myself sharing
father Lawrence's beliefs and I'm
excited and inspired by him and by them
and with that please welcome our guest
by the Lawrence Freeman so thank you man
good afternoon I'm reminded actually
speaking here in the middle of a busy
thoroughfare of doing book launches in
barnes and nobles which is a real test
of one's powers of attention and
patience but as what I'm as I'm going to
be speaking about meditation as a way of
attention which also I think gives us
the virtue of patience eventually it may
be a good a good setting for us to do
this it's a great pleasure to be here at
Google and to see a concept of work in
an organization that seems to be focused
upon the well-being not only of its own
employees but concerned for the common
good and well being
the world and using a technology and
science to to implement that vision it's
very inspiring and wonderful to see and
I think it's not surprising that my
friend men should be have invited me
here to show me around and this is how I
have to earn my delicious lunch by
giving this talk but it doesn't seem to
be surprising that meditation should be
a familiar element of the of your vision
here these something that you're
familiar with and whether you practice
it or not you know about it and living
in this part of the world you're likely
to know about meditation anyway but I
think it's significant that this
technological company working at a level
of global consciousness and raising
global consciousness to new levels
should also be familiar with and
recognize the value of what is
traditionally of course associated with
the spiritual traditions so I'd like to
speak with you about that and maybe what
I'm going to say is we'll have some
resonance with you you may know a lot of
what I'm going to say but maybe it will
be coming from a slightly different part
of the human garden I was talking with I
forget your name's Alicia and Kevin just
now about their work on google maps and
it reminded me of two icons that I think
initiated the new era in in our modern
age one is the picture of Earth rise
over the lunar horizon to get what date
that was sometime in the 60s and the
first time that human beings were able
to see the world see our world
objectively from the outside
that's a turning point in human
consciousness is it's an image of course
but it's an image that has begun a long
wonderful amazing process of revolution
and speeded up the process of evolution
and I think when we look at that picture
of earth rise we can't help but feel a
certain tenderness towards this crazy
world we live in a certain tenderness
and a certain aesthetic await namely
it's beautiful it's beautiful to see
this little blue and white spinning
globe in the middle of dark space and to
know that it has life and that it's home
and when we look at the different
continents from that distance we we are
aware of the huge range of human culture
religion personality and painfully we're
aware that these differences often lead
to conflict and violence and then you
look at it and you say why why do we
fight over our differences why why why
can't we see that we are interdependent
that what's happening in the Amazonian
rainforest is going to affect the whole
of the globe and so on why do we act as
if we were isolated in individual
autonomous beings and instead of seeing
ourselves as members of the same
incredible spinning human family so that
image came to my mind as I was talking
and then the other image is for about 20
or so years later than if you saw it was
when the Pope invited religious leaders
from all over the world to come to a
meeting a spiritual meeting for world
peace at sec today in Francis's hometown
in Italy and there's this amazing
picture of all the world religious
leaders all dressed up in their
different finery and their different
hats and sticks and and robes and
and yet praying together bringing
together this richness of the diversity
of human religious experience into a
common concern for for peace so that is
the world we're living in and I think
Google is certainly a big player in the
evolution of that understanding of human
unity there is no peace without unity so
Ming's work for human player for world
peace is going to depend upon developing
unity and unity comes about not by
imposing one point of view or one system
upon another that's violence that's
conflict and it never works where we've
condemned ourselves to a cycle of
violence for as long as human history
has existed and we somehow rather never
learn the lesson that it doesn't work
but unity depends upon a harmony
existing between the widest possible
range of expression and belief and an
order a peaceful order of resonance of
harmony between people of different
beliefs and cultures and identities and
I believe that meditation is
indispensable to the achievement of that
unity what happens at the at the
personal level also happens or is it a
microcosm of what happens at the global
of the the the total level when we
meditate we are we are finding peace
within ourselves we are allowing the the
very different dimensions of our being a
human being our physical our emotional
mental intellectual a
thetic and our spiritual dimensions the
body mind and spirit were allowing all
these very different dimensions which
are different but which we cannot
separate from each other we're allowing
them to settle into a dynamic
relationship into an order into a
harmonious equilibrium so that's peace
that's why we people meditate we
meditate in order to find peace within
ourselves but as we find peace within
ourselves we become more consciously
active agents in the human family of
which we are members and therefore we
are able to recognize our
responsibilities to that family we
become less self-centered this
egocentric we begin to see that the
piece that I'm feeling sets me free to
be able to be of service to others and
that's the release of this capacity for
compassion of empathy and of recognizing
I have certain gifts that might be
useful to other people and even in using
those gifts I'm not only developing my
own potential that I am being of
practical service to others so I think
we need I think we are able more and
more consciously to see meditation as an
essential ingredient of this unfolding
adventure of human consciousness which
is speeding up in front of our eyes at
this moment in in our history it's a
critical moment we live in a time of
crisis I was taking part recently in a
conference on the environment with among
scientists who are proposing different
models and different ways of dealing
with the crisis and they pretty much
agree on the science not upon the
predictability of the models but upon
the science but of course the major
problem is is getting the the will or
the common mind among
all the interested parties on our planet
all of them pursuing their own
nationalistic objectives and economic
objectives without much reference to
each other or to the available resources
on the planet so the spiritual element
for example in the environmental issue
seems to me to be about creating this
common mind this sense this vision of
unity and it's not you know just a
theoretical idea it has to be felt as an
experience has to be something that you
identify with that you know you are part
of this whole not just by looking at it
in coming to a nice platitude a nice
idea has to be something felt in other
words it has to move from being an idea
which has a short shelf life in our
consciousness ideas pass through our
minds and very quickly they're not just
along or Najd out by the next idea ideas
also tend to create a lot of
conversation you present one idea and
somebody's going to put a question that
analyze it or confront it so ideas of
course can get things started good ideas
on the other hand are pretty cheap what
you need after the idea is in sight and
it's insight that represents a
transformative experience in
consciousness when you've come to an
insight you you know something you know
it even though you may not be able to
prove it yet and many of the great
scientific breakthroughs the modern
period have come about in that way the
sign of the research scientist while
taking a shower or having snooze comes
to an insight into
the real pattern of the work they're
doing and they can't quite understand it
yet they can't quite put it together
explain it but the insight has led them
to a new level of understanding of
knowledge so I think also at this
spiritual level if you like insight is
is required for change to happen and
meditation is about insight not about
ideas I think it's important for us to
know what the different religious
traditions think about meditation it's
important for us to know that meditation
is a universal spiritual wisdom it's as
old as the human race and the meditation
itself is seen universally as a way of
taking us from the mind as we generally
describe it to a deeper level of
consciousness universally called the
heart in most of the religious
scriptures and the heart is not as a
symbol within all the spiritual
traditions not so much of emotion as the
seat of emotion or affectivity but heart
the heart is a symbol of the wholeness
of the human being the convergence point
where all the different dimensions come
together in a simple unity and we
recognize that in our ordinary language
when we speak about speaking from the
heart or giving your heart to something
or putting your heart and sold into
something it's about a whole commitment
or a whole act of attention which which
we recognize as a high achievement and a
high level of experience in human
affairs it's also about love and I'd
like to like to speak a little bit about
meditation as a way of love that might
sound a little
soft in such a scientific community but
it seems to me that we need to
re-evaluate or reconnect to the meaning
of that word and to see that to see love
as the fruit of meditation in the in the
Bible for example the word knowledge is
often in Hebrew it can is often used in
the same sense and sometimes in place of
the word love to know is to love to know
something deeply comprehensively
personally intimately from the inside
that is love and I think our human
relationships are human expressions of
love there are many expressions of love
many forms of love all of which must be
reverenced and respected suggests that
that is a way of knowing that enhances
our human being because it satisfies
such a deep longing within the human
being to know at that level with that
degree of intimacy with that degree of
insight but also to be known because to
love and to be loved are really two
sides of the same coin so we're dealing
with the kind of knowledge that is
different it's a different form of
knowledge from the kind of knowledge
that we work with I'm sure you work with
when you're dealing with your
engineering problems and projects these
are not incompatible forms of knowledge
but we don't treat our loved ones in the
same way we don't know them in the same
way as we treat our problems or our
technical issues the different forms of
knowledge different forms of interaction
so it's this kind of knowledge that I'd
like to ask you to to think of is
connected to the work of meditation
itself it's why meditation in my own
Christian tradition which has been
recovering its its own wisdom its own
form of meditation in recent years part
of the work of our community as to this
to reawaken this contemplative dimension
of Christianity and an important way of
doing that is through dialogue with
other religions and also with the
secular world and i think it's it's
we've always spoken about meditation
throughout the Christian tradition as
the prayer of the heart and we need to
understand just how precise and how
transformative that that expression
really is that it's not a sentimental
it's not a soft kind of experience it is
a transformative transformative one but
we need to be constantly reminded I
think of the universality of this way of
meditation I was recently having dinner
with some friends who had invited me to
dinner because they wanted to start a
meditation group and he invited some of
their friends to come along and before
meditation they asked me to give a
little introduction to meditation to
their friends so I did and then we
meditated and might invite you to share
a little bit of this experience before i
finish i think it's not good to talk
about meditation without practicing it
at least for a short time so after the
meditation i said to the group okay
anybody have any questions or any
comments you'd like to share there's one
man there
who is the CFO / of a very large and
well known multinational corporation and
he said to me how long was that
meditation so I said about 20 minutes
Cisse well amazing he said it could have
been 20 seconds or 20 hours he said I
just kind of lost all sense of time and
he said but actually something else
happened he said I went I did what you
said I started to meditate in the way
you told me and he said almost
immediately I went to some other place
into some experience or he said I had no
words for it at all camera explain it I
can't even describe it he said in the
kind of words I would use words i'm
familiar with you know from church love
joy peace but he said these words seem I
know what these words mean now because
of this experience but he said even so
they don't really express what I was
what I experienced she said I I don't
know I'm just baffled and amazed and
delighted mr. Burleigh I don't know what
to say and then he added something else
he said this is all the more surprising
because i have had a really terrible day
he said i am very ashamed of something
in my life my character he said I cannot
control my anger and you can ask my
family all the people I work with and I
frequently fly off the handle and I go
into a rage and something disappoints me
and he said that happened to be the
beginning of this day and I've been like
it the whole day and at the end of the
day that I feel so ashamed of myself so
soiled that I really just wanted to go
home but I came here because of my
friend
so he said and then what happens I find
this waiting for me so we went and had
dinner and I was very interested by his
his remarks and particularly interested
in what happened next with him I mean it
certainly doesn't happen very often when
people meditate for the first time that
they go to this place but it does happen
and certainly in the early stages of
meditation when you get sort of
beginners luck you can it's like when I
was when bowling some time ago I hadn't
been bowling for 20 years and I couldn't
even remember you had to put your finger
in the hole in the ball anyway when I
threw it very in elegantly I supposed I
got a strike and then I did another one
I got another strike I thought this is
this can't go on I did a third one and
they got another strike after that every
ball went into the gully and lost it so
you get beginner's luck when you're when
you're unselfconscious about it and you
have no expectations and you you're
you're like a child you just do it
simply so this happens with meditation
to and this man had had had this
experience and nothing shows more
clearly that the deepest fruit of
meditation which he had tasted briefly
is not connected with your merits with
whether you've earned it or not I think
that from a spiritual point of view that
is a very important aspect to keep in
mind most of the religious spiritual
traditions call that grace there's
something given about him like falling
in love it just happens it's gift you
don't earn it
happens so it was wonderful interesting
to see that happen in his case but I was
interested to know what happened to him
later did he continue meditating because
it's certain that he's not going to have
that same experience every time he sits
down to meditate so what happens when he
tries again and he's just facing this
barrage of distractions and his own
wandering mind and his all his monkey
monkey mind and his Mickey Mouse mind
and what happens then quite likely like
many people they give up he would give
up but actually when I asked our friend
common friend a few months later about
him I said did you start the group he
said yes and I said what about so-and-so
he said yeah he's coming every week when
he's in town and he's meditating every
day as much as he can morning and
evenings what we recommend now I was
very pleased to hear that and i think
it's a it's a story worth sharing
because all of us need that kind of
reassurance that reaffirmation that
meditation touches opens us to the to
the deepest center the heart of our
humanity where an incredible treasure
awaits us and it's a treasure that we
don't have to earn we don't have to buy
and we don't have even to be good to to
to to find but we have to we have to we
have to do some work in order to receive
it and to stay in tune with them so the
other reason for mentioning the story is
another aspect of meditation i'd like to
put before you
and that is the difference between
technique and discipline now you can
certainly meditate as a technique and
maybe for many people in a secular world
where science is you know the final
authority on the on the value of things
this is this is how we begin and I think
maybe in a sense we all begin at this
technique level in other words you're
told do these things do these practices
and you will find certain benefits and
the benefits will be peace of mind what
benefits will be controlling your anger
lowering your blood pressure improving
your cholesterol boosting your immune
system as I was saying to the earlier
group i was with it doesn't restore your
hair unfortunately as I can prove but it
has benefits which science and neurology
and neuroscience and the psychologists
psychiatrists we have a seminar mental
health in London recently the British
government is very interested in making
meditation part of its national mental
health policy because it's cheaper to
give meditation rather than medication
and all the evidence is piling up with
all the different research projects
which we are small part of as well but I
think so at that technical level you
focus upon the the benefits of
meditation but I think as those benefits
begin to appear you begin to see more
this is where the horizon begins to
expand and we begin to move from
thinking just about the immediate
benefits from the technique we begin to
see what we might call the spiritual
fruits of meditation
and in all religious traditions and
thinking of say the letter to the
Galatians in the New Testament or the
dhammapada in Buddhism there is a
remarkable agreement on what are the
fruits of the spirit or the qualities
that come about through a transformation
of consciousness through spiritual
practice at this level and the first of
them all is love meta compassion because
we're different words but essentially
it's that fundamental human energy of
love joy peace patience kindness
goodness fidelity gentleness
self-control and as these spiritual
fruits begin to appear I think the the
map of our own consciousness becomes
greater we begin to see ourselves less
and less from an egotistical you go
centric point of view and that that
range of I don't know what you call it
with maps but the Vista of the map
begins to expand and you see yourself
without without losing yourself entirely
but your whole sense of self is
transformed as you see yourself as part
an active integrative part of something
greater and as that vision expands that
becomes insight it's an insight into
yourself self-knowledge is the most
transformative thing we can we can
experience all religious traditions
speak about self knowledge as the basis
of development in the Christian
tradition we say self-knowledge is the
basis of our knowledge of God you cannot
know God without knowing yourself and
self-knowledge I think in all traditions
has has has that same
the value in the transformative process
so of course there are levels are
self-knowledge coming into the state's
each time I come you know I have to fill
out the same forms and say where I was
born my date of birth and profession and
address and and so on if you have more
forms to fill out you fill out your
qualifications or lack of them or and so
that and there's that's a form of
self-knowledge that connects us to
society into a culture and to our job
career from progress and so on but
there's another level of self-knowledge
where we are conscious as we get older
of the patterns of our minds and
emotions as we see ourselves repeating
certain mistakes as we see ourselves
reacting in the same way sometimes a
negative way in certain situations and
we know that certain situations are
going to trigger a certain response that
we would like to control better so we
become self-aware at that important
psychological level and we cannot change
that level without coming to
consciousness about those there's blocks
and those repeated patterns central part
of the 12-step program I think that we
come to a self-awareness before the
change can take place but there's
another level the self-knowledge which
the great spiritual traditions focus on
in which my friend the CFO had had
unexpectedly dropped into immediately
and unpredictably and that is the the
knowledge of the self knowing pure
knowing and that it's not knowing
anything about yourself it's just
knowing yourself it's pure consciousness
it's not attached to any image of
yourself or
the idea or even any belief system it is
the very core of human existence of
human consciousness and it's that self
knowing better maybe calling itself
knowing rather than self knowledge that
I think we call love when we experience
that self knowing we experience an
expansion and a delight and fulfillment
of our being which we only experience in
love and through love and it's knowing
not only that we are loved or that there
is love you know flowing through us but
also knowing that we are capable of
expanding our capacity for love and
that's what happens as we put this
experience into practice so that's more
or less what I what I mean by saying
that meditation leads us to the
knowledge that is love I'd like to just
say a few words about the three of the
essential elements of meditation and
then invite you just for a few minutes
to experience it and then we'll take
some time to meditate together to
sometimes the discussion we our
community has a priority in its work at
the moment of teaching meditation to
children and it's wonderful to teach
meditation to children because they
respond to it so immediately so
naturally they like to meditate and they
can meditate and we we always notice I
always notice when meditating the
children that they teach us once you
teach a child how to meditate
immediately the child will go into it
with some variations but they
immediately go into it and and then they
are really teaching us and the first
thing they teach us is that meditation
is simple
you can have a thousand PhD you know
research projects into into meditation
into the science of it neuroscience of
it and so on all of thats interesting is
persuasive we need it but it should
never blind us to the fact that
meditation is simple what do you mean by
simple we mean that it is total in some
way that it that it is something that we
don't need to and in fact cannot analyze
or dissect and we shouldn't try to
dissect it because if we try to analyze
or dissected we are complicating it the
word simple comes from the Latin word
simplex and it was used to gorgeous love
that piece of paper though I think
thanks it was used as a term to describe
the way tailors or cloth merchants used
to fold cloth and as they folded the
cloth to make it fit into a smaller
space they would make the cloth more
complex and so to simplify simplex meant
that the cloth were simply unfolded and
you can't unfold that any more than it
is now so meditation is simplicity
itself it's just as we are as our mind
is as our whole being is absolutely open
not closed in upon itself analyzing
itself but just open to what is the
simple enjoyment of the truth as st.
Thomas Aquinas called it in the 12th
century the simple enjoyment of the
truth so the first thing you learn is
that meditation is simple
the second is that meditation is about
stillness when we meditate we try to sit
physically still because that physical
stillness will help to keep you in the
present moment and it will also help to
bring stillness to the mind the mind is
constantly moving constantly searching
constantly constantly moving between the
past and the future and very rarely
allows us to enjoy the truth and the
delight of the present moment yet the
present moment is of course the only
thing we are totally sure of and god is
the eternal now in the mystical
traditions just as God is infinitely
simple in the same mystical traditions
so we try to sit still and we try to
bring the mind to stillness and the way
we bring the mind to stillness is
through an act of attention a repetitive
act of attention or faithful we could
say act of attention that we repeat
despite the fact that we're constantly
failing and that's why it's very
important for us to give up the idea of
success or failure with regard to
meditation the best way we have of
approach neyo dies i think is like a
child to think of it as a kind of a play
and a serious play where we take sport
very seriously that's only playing well
we should take our meditation very
seriously but still remember that it's
playing so we don't have to succeed or
fail we just we just are faithful to it
choosing the method of meditation with
which you do that is of course up to you
but the great spiritual traditions give
us a number of approaches different
methods 1 i'll share with you is one
that is central to the Christian
tradition
but it also of course as many of you
will recognize it it has resonance with
other spiritual traditions as well the
advice in this tradition is to take a
single word or short phrase could be a
sacred word in your own tradition if you
have one and you repeat it continually
in the mind and heart during the time of
the neda tation simply letting go of the
stream of thought memories plans
anxieties day dreams fantasies as this
phantasm agoria of the mind just
continues to be produced you just let go
of it you don't fight it you don't try
and deal with it you just let go of it
and you let go of it by returning your
attention to the to the word so the
mantra to the sacred word to the prayer
would however you want to call it so
that's the that's the method that we
would recommend as a way of coming to
stillness and you can teach that method
to a six-year-old child or to somebody
on their deathbed in a hospice it's
something that that CFO I mentioned is
putting into practice every morning and
every evening as he takes 20 minutes to
meditate in the morning 20 minutes in
the evening and if he's keeping that up
it's because he's feeling the benefits
of him and the other aspect of
meditation I think is worth considering
is silence according to Meister Eckhart
the 12th century Christian mystic there
is nothing so much like God as silence
and silence is not the absence of noise
it is the it is the perfection of
attention silence is the fruit of
attention and when you are really paying
attention you are being silent silence
opens up for us
this this common ground that lies beyond
the all the diversity of words and
belief systems that's why meditation is
the basis of all inter-religious
dialogue so silence stillness simplicity
that's the that's what we do when we
meditate that's the those are the
muscles were exercising those are the
qualities that we are practicing and
that we see playing out and appearing in
our daily life and work and
relationships come back to that simple
method that I mentioned many of you may
have your own method of meditation happy
with that stay with that obviously but
this this is the way we we teach it and
we can take just a few minutes to
practice it now before a few minutes of
discussion try to take a moment to sit
still stood upright Leo could you just
give me my bell and sitting with the
back straight with your feet on the
ground cross-legged if you prefer but
the basic rule of posture is simply to
sit with your back straight that helps
you to stay awake thanks to stay awake
and to be alert should be relaxed and
alert at the same time take a moment
just to be aware of your breath as you
breathe in and breathe out we breathe
about 20 or 30,000 times a day but just
take a few moments to be conscious of
your breath
you
and the consciousness of your breathing
helps to calm the mind bring the mind
into the same space as the body so the
body becomes a kind of anchor for the
mind the body is part of this experience
part of this journey close your eyes
lightly relax the muscles of your face
relax your shoulders and then silently
in your mind in your heart begin to say
your word your mantra choosing the word
it's important you need to stay with the
same word the word I would recommend is
a ancient sacred word maranatha it's an
Aramaic language that Jesus spoke it
means come Lord we're not thinking about
the meaning of it as we say it though
saying it as a sound listening to it
with full attention and returning to the
word continuously as the mind wanders
bringing lay back as if to an anchor or
walking on a path through a jungle of
thought this path of silence that the
mantra leads us on the word again I
would suggest is maranatha ma rah natha
Mara natha
good so I think we have a little time
left if the one would like to share any
comments or raise any questions at all
how do you how do you choose the word
for this kind of meditation well in many
traditions of course you're you're given
the word in the Indian tradition is
whispered into your ears you know as a
young child and it's your mantra for
life and in most traditions spiritual
traditions you're advised to take a word
they the basic the basic principles of
it are that it should be a word that you
stay with the same word it's advisable I
think to take a word that has a sacred
meaning although you're not thinking
about the meaning of it as you say it
it's important not to think about it and
for that reason it's helpful if it's not
in your own language so and then also
it's helpful if the sound of the word is
calming so the open vowel sound of
maranatha is very calming and you
actually that kind of resonates with
mantras in other traditions and also
that the length of the word should be
such that it's easy to say easier to say
rhythmically some people say the mantra
with their breath so you could say the
whole word as you breathe in and breathe
out in silence or if you have the four
syllables you could say the first two
syllables ma rawr as you breathe in
natha as you breathe out I think the
important thing is to say it simply
naturally and most people find their own
rhythm and it finds its own rhythm by
itself so I would advise not not tying
it to the breath but just resting it on
the wheel of the breath but giving the
full attention to the to the word and
then eventually it finds its own rhythm
yes well I think if you're raising your
children in a in a in a tradition in a
religious tradition then you want to
enter you know you want to you know give
them the the stories and give them the
the facts and give them the familiarity
with with the tradition appropriate to
their age and then that becomes more
sophisticated as they get older so I
think that's that's the you know that's
important but I also think it's very
important to recognize their children
have this innate capacity for
contemplation they're born contemplative
we lose it later no doubt so you come
back to it when you're 35 or something
and you and you die so difficult I could
never do it you know I so complicated or
I'm just not good at this so if I think
if we can give children this gift at the
beginning and give them the method of
staying in touch with this innate
capacity we're giving them something
that will make the religious tradition
alive for them most kids today will
abandon that religious tradition as they
get older under the pressures of
whatever but I think this is the best
way I know and our experience so far has
shown this in schools so they go
together yeah the complementary if you
go to our website w CCM org you'll see
some information about what we're doing
and also some videos of a conference we
had
recently on meditation and education but
if you if you like also after as I can
give you an address and send you some
stuff on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
