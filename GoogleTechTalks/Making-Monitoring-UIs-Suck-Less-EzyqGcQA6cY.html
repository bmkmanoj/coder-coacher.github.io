thanks John thanks for having mean
everybody hear me okay I'm not used to
using a mic so thanks for all thanks all
for coming yet my name is khan aerobic
Bueller and i'm really excited to be
here this is my first visit to google
and it's a real pleasure so i should i
suppose i should start by talking about
this the sort of premise explaining this
premise a little bit that monitoring you
i suck it's not exactly that they suck
it's that I think they're incomplete and
the I'm going to try to make the case
that the they're incomplete because
monitoring you is and generally support
and general support analytical
activities and not evaluative ones and
this distinction between analysis and
evaluation I'm going to base on a
distinction between trying to draw
objective conclusions from the interface
as opposed to trying to draw subjective
conclusions based on the interface so to
do this I'm going to try to tell you
three stories about three user stories
about monitoring I'm going to tell you
about the difficulties each person had
with the the monitoring tool that they
already use and monitoring tasks that
they're trying to accomplish and I'll
discuss the situations that are
important to them and how they each
perform their different monitoring task
each story is going to be an example
that shows you that users are competing
with for their time with the monitoring
task as well as many other
responsibilities and one and these are
all going to be examples where alarms
and dashboards don't always work and to
do this I'm going to discuss the
situations that are important to them
use those stories as an example of these
monitoring problems and the approach
that will discuss is based on this idea
that people are monitoring for a
situation that they want to identify
what's worth monitored by what's worth
paying attention to that that's the way
in which they monitor as opposed to
trying to identify how what sort of
action they need to take that it's
essentially hey look at this is what a
monitoring activity is trying to result
in as opposed to hate take care of this
so the first or I'm going to tell you
about is monitoring servers
the second one is about monitoring
business performance by reading
financial reports and the last one is
going to be about a person who's trying
to monitor their users experience in a
discussion forum so our first story is
about a CTO who's working in a small
entrepreneurship the the company's
business is based on website and he's in
charge of everything technical at the
company so he's the he's the lead
developer but he also has executive
duties where he's trying to raise funds
and and do job interviews but he's the
systems admin so he's in charge of all
the equipment all the servers and one of
the things that he monitors is the
performance of his web server his mail
server and is his database application
server so he's got some powerful
dashboards but he ends up rarely using
them in part it's it's because it's a
lot of work for him just to look at them
and find out what's relevant in these
things I mean take a look at how big
these things can be I mean they require
a significant amount of mental effort to
spot and then assemble the the data
that's relevant to a particular
situation these trying to look out for
and this gets us to the sort of the
first reason why I think monitoring you
I suck which is that they don't take
into account the fact that users have
many other responsibilities besides
monitoring and then monitoring as a
result has to be done very quickly and
you know we're not all air traffic
controllers who can spend all our
attention focus on just this task of
monitoring sorry I can surround the
minute so now I've heard a lot of people
describe these displays as easy to read
and in fact even that they could be read
at a glance but I don't buy it these
sorts of dashboards really require a
significant amount of mental effort to
parse the display conveys individual
sensor conditions the user then has to
identify sort of which condition they
need to pay attention to first then
they've got to sort of peruse their
mental model of how the system works to
figure out which situation such a
condition could reflect and then decide
to look in
that situation in part this is why the
people who monitor sorry who manage
network systems admin don't end up using
that the dashboards themselves they want
to know how the servers want to know if
the servers are sort of doing all right
but they don't necessarily have the time
or the expertise that dig in there and
identify all this situation so what the
end of doings they just end up asking
their admins you know knocking on the
door and saying hey is everything all
right fact our CTO had had a similar
problem when anybody in the company
wanted to when people the marketing
group wanted to release a put out a
press release they to go check and make
sure that the the load on the surface
was okay just in case it was a whole lot
of activity that resulted from that so
um when designing these sorts of these
these sorts of monitoring interfaces the
design effort is primarily focused on on
highlighting conditions but the
highlighting is there to help us filter
so why not filter you know we could just
just pull out the the particular
conditions that are maybe relevant
instead of just trying to highlight them
now the worst thing about some of these
interfaces is how many of them use the
the red and green mapping to identify
stuff and I'm sure by now you're all
sort of tired of hearing about people
complaining about use of red and green
and interfaces because ten percent of
the population can't distinguish them
though um but this is actually one of my
favorite things about Google Analytics
is that it's it's it's default is blue
so most people can actually see that but
my very favorite aspect of Google
Analytics is actually the the custom
report so being able to create custom
dashboard views that really goes a long
way to simplifying the monitoring
activity it lets you filter the data and
show only what's relevant to a
particular situation but even that sort
of fails once the situations scale up I
mean what happens if you have to
administrate 30 different sites or even
just a couple of sites but you want to
monitor for all kinds of different
situations are you supposed to page
through each one of these on these
different reports at some point it all
sort of get too meta and you need a
filter on the reports themselves so this
sort of so at least we can find a couple
of initial design goals at this point
at least try to reduce the the mental
effort for the the person trying to
parse the UI and and you know try to use
something other than highlighting and on
being able to customize that the filter
started being able to customize and
filter the data really helps a lot in
identifying what's going to be relevant
to a particular situation now these
aren't really like lofty design goals I
mean we see this already we should maybe
see it a little more often it's a good
place to start so back to our CTO so if
he's not using the dashboards to monitor
for monitor service what's what's he
using so he works on his service
throughout the day you know updating
applications and installing patches etc
and when he happens to be logged into
one of these servers when he's logging
out or if he's got a quick moment he'll
tend to run up time and just look at the
load on the server so I sort of just
sampling it so if he happens to catch it
at a moment where there's high load and
if he's got some time he'll investigate
the situation in other words is the
server load high enough that he needs to
investigate high enough so what is high
enough that's a pretty subjective
description what might be high enough to
me isn't necessarily high enough to him
he's making a subjective evaluation from
this objective information if if what he
what he actually does to monitor so if
this is what he actually does to monitor
servers at least we should try to
support that activity if that's what
he's comfortable with and that I was
wearing we should try to maybe support
that now implicit in this question of is
it high enough for me to investigate is
another question which is is there
enough time for me to investigate this
remember he has a lot of other
responsibilities and just seeing just
the fact that the load is high doesn't
mean that he's going to cancel an
interview that he's scheduled to go do
that sometimes it's just got to stay
high and this is one of these other
problems about monitoring service he had
no idea he might not know that something
is going to come up I'll talk about that
a little bit more later so essentially
what he's asking is really is it
important enough
for me to investigate and and so this is
the the cornerstone of how I think we
can improve monitoring you is we need
another kind of monitoring you I that
that tells us that there's something
important enough for us to turn our
attention to the monitor and then begin
monitoring now doesn't that sound sort
of suspiciously a lot like an alarm
couldn't our CTO just use an alarm to
tell them that a server load was high I
mean alarms are actually another kind of
monitoring you I but alarms have their
own sets of problems the first of which
is you never know that they're coming
the next is that they force you to act
even if you can't even if he has an
interview scheduled he's got an alarm
going off and if you can't address them
if you can't address that alarm
immediately what do you do you can
cancel the alarm and then you may not
remember later that you had a problem
you can ignore the alarm but then it's
just going to continue to go off and you
can snooze the alarm but in a few
minutes you may just be in the same boat
you were already in so our CTO actually
has a whole bunch of alarms that he uses
to monitor for incidents but he mostly
ignores them he filters them into their
own mailbox and he doesn't he never
looks at them sometimes if something
stops working entirely he'll go back
into the sort of cache of alerts and use
it to try to diagnose what went wrong so
where did the problem what time to the
problems start and try to use that as a
diagnostic tool or actually as an
analytical tool he does use one other
sort of alarm pretty regularly though
sometimes someone from his customer
support team will tell him that they're
getting angry calls so you could say
that he's actually using letting his
customers sort of monitor the systems
for him and act as an alert system but
obviously that's that's not ideal so
let's look more closely at why an alarm
doesn't work for his um his particular
uptime monitoring here's a quick graph
of server load on so is the load hi so
that's what i mean by subjective to me
it's not I wouldn't think server load
was high until it got two point nine but
damn above point seven is high
so he can set an alarm but here's the
problem with the alarm if it goes off
you won't necessarily have time to drop
everything to investigate and when he
does have time the alarm doesn't tell
him anything about his server and so the
problem is that this is what the alarm
does it basically divides the the data
range into the data you should ignore
and the data that he should attend to
remember he said that he'd investigate
if the load was high enough and an alarm
just tells him that it's high and what's
more is it only tells him that well once
it's happened nothing at all before but
if but the graph the graph here would
tell us more you can see how it's
changing you can see where it is where
it's been but it's at a cost he has and
he has to interpret that graph and he's
already dismissed using that for that
same reason and furthermore it takes up
a lot more screen real estate obviously
alarm doesn't necessarily take of any
and this takes up quite a bit in part
this is why network operation centers
look like this where you just have tons
and tons of monitors the graphs enable
an operator in the the like an
Operations Center to interpret the
sensor conditions but the the screen
real estate cost is really significant
so maybe there's something in between a
graph and an alarm that we could come up
with them might help us so instead what
if we change how the data ranges divided
up so instead from this to this instead
of showing the whole graph we could just
show the region prior to the alarm
threshold then the position in the
region can identify the importance of
attending to that situation if the data
is below the ignore threshold might as
well be at that ignore threshold doesn't
matter how low it is and no matter how
high it gets we can assume it's just at
that attend threshold we still need to
go look in on the situation so the the
range in between enables us it Abel's us
to indicate that there's this degree of
importance to attending to the situation
I just refer to this range is he'd the
the closer it gets to the alarm
threshold the more important it becomes
for hit before for him to attend to the
situation and since our CTO wants to
know if the if the load is high enough
now we don't need to show the whole
graph we could just show the current
position in the range and so now we can
offer him a really simple little
dashboard that relies on the way he's
already monitoring his servers one that
doesn't give him too much detail and can
still help in beside if he should turn
his attention to monitoring those
servers and it does so continuously so
when he has time he can quickly identify
if there's time if there's something
that he should investigate and by making
this dashboard sort of easily and
persistently visible he can actually
constantly evaluate the the servers and
actually start to develop this sort of
awareness of how often his servers get
heavily loaded and for how long they
stay heavily loaded so decided to
investigate the investigative service as
a tactical decision and one he ends up
needing to make several times a day but
what about situations that take oh that
happened far less frequently so let me
tell you a little bit about a CEO that I
work with that had a very different sort
of monitoring problem she's in charge of
a medium-sized company that offers
services online right and she's launched
several programs recently to grow the
business and need to keep an eye on the
performance of that of those programs
however she doesn't need to look in on
them every day once a week is probably
enough or maybe even every other week
but she like our CTO has too many other
responsibilities and is constantly
dealing with sort of more immediately
urgent situations and problems as a
result she she often feels quite a bit
of anxiety over the performance of these
programs and she doesn't really and as a
result of an anxiety she is more likely
to put off even reading those reports
and so it can sometimes take her a long
long time to read those reports and then
end up missing a
thing happens that maybe if she'd known
about sooner she could have caught and
she so she managed by reading sort of
little reports are like this that are
generated for her and if the report
shows that there's a program that's not
performing well enough are based on her
particular expectations then she might
go investigated talk to her marketing
team fine and talked to the technical
people and find out if maybe there's
something wrong with the data but in
many ways it's a lot like our CTOs
server monitoring problem now except
that the values just don't change very
quickly they change very very slowly so
at least we can try to maybe apply a
similar solution so here we could see
how close each of her clients are to
being under performers we could just
show these four indicators but what
happens when this program grows to 20
clients are 200 clients we need some way
to sort of compact all that we can't
just give our 200 of these little
indicators so let's just assign some
values to that he'd range and make it a
scale so we can set 02 the minimum heat
and one to the maximum heat and now we
can elect the maximum value to represent
the the whole report and what that means
is that instead of saying client M is
underperforming and needs your attention
it's saying there's something in this
report that needs your attention so take
your time to find some time to pay
attention to it it says essentially that
unless the whole report or the whole
program that is is performing well that
she should take some time to investigate
well essentially that's really an or
operation on all of these and that's a
useful sort of starting point for
building complex situation monitoring
now she has a single representation that
summarizes the whole report this sort of
last little indicator and if we again
make it sort of persistently visible she
can use it to stay aware of how the
programs are performing
and if it looks like there's something
in the program that needs our attention
she can delve into the display she can
first get more detail on the evaluation
and see how all the individual are how
the individual clients are being
evaluated and then she can dig in and
see the actual data and so this is
another way we can improve monitoring
you eyes again this isn't entirely a new
idea but that we want to show a minimal
amount of detail that enables us to make
a quick evaluation but then enable the
the user to dig in and get more detail
as they need it as they are trying to go
from making an evaluation to analyzing
the situation so work with CEO had some
surprising results actually um she
thought she didn't use the interface
during testing she would apologize that
she had and she did have time she was
doing all these other things but when I
would question her she actually knew
exactly where the indicator was in the
the displaying how the program was
performing which was very surprising she
didn't think she knew she she knew
anything but she was actually developing
this awareness and the most surprising
thing was that was that she showed a
marked decrease in her anxiety about
this program and as a result she asked
if I would build her more monitoring
tools to monitor other aspects of her
business that work but those aspects she
was asking me to build the tools were
the things were causing the most stress
and so as if she was asking me to come
you know build these things to help
combat the anxiety and it's certainly a
very good goal for all of us who are
trying to build monitoring you is to try
to help increase our users confidence in
the situations and their awareness of
the situations and thereby reduce their
anxiety so some situations people
monitor that they are some of the
situation that people monitor for or
ones that they aren't familiar yet with
and they want to learn about the next
monitoring story that I want to tell you
about is about a guy who's a sole
developer of a website that's a
community forum for
a whole lot of people now his site is
co-located and so it's he's not really
he doesn't really worry about the
servers he lets the the colocation
company worry about that so but instead
what he's monitor he wants to monitor is
the experience that his users have on
the site so now he can't nessus you
didn't necessarily know how to monitor
for or you couldn't necessarily describe
the good experiences but he could at
least identify bad experiences that he
didn't want them to have so in
particular he didn't want them to have
any sort of access restriction to the
site and he didn't want them to
experience what he described as an
unbalanced forum so in terms of access
restriction he what he what he meant was
that he's the told me the story about
the his building on the site so he has
his own custom forum that he built in
Ruby and he's the sole developer of the
site but one of the things that's
happened that happens to him is he's
constantly modifying the code trying to
add new features trying to improve its
performance and along the way one time
he accidentally made a typo and what
happened was that a subset of his users
couldn't login wasn't that they all
couldn't he could still log in but it
was just a subset who could no longer
login because of this error and as a he
didn't even find out about this for a
couple of weeks the only way he found
out about it was that he had contact
with people on the forum outside of the
form he found out about we was talking
to a friend on the phone he's also a
user and say hey why haven't I been able
to access the site for a couple of weeks
and he had no idea he had to go and
discover that there was this other
problem so he too was sort of letting us
he was using his customers were
monitoring the situation for him but he
didn't want that to happen again he had
a similar problem again later where it
ended up that some subset of users could
no longer post or reply to post in the
forum so he definitely didn't want that
to happen again so what he was the
situation was describing that he was
trying to monitor for is again with
someone where users couldn't login or
when they couldn't post or reply the
thing is is that there could be a day
where there's a whole lot of posting
activity it's a there's a whole lot of
new Act to there's a new event that
really affects the community so
everyone's sort of voicing their their
opinion or it could be a day where
there's a whole lot of replies where
there's a really
topic and everyone wants to join and
talk about it but he cares about a
situation where neither is occurring to
identify that somehow something is
broken in the code that allows people to
post a reply and so that's essentially
an and operation on these two but not a
logical and where you're sort of picking
the minimum but a compensatory measure
you're essentially saying that you care
about a situation where if somebody
can't post maybe that's a that might
because people are not posting that
doesn't mean that can't post but maybe
you should still look into it and so
maybe we'll push that up and sort of
halfway but if they can't if they aren't
posting and they aren't replying then we
have a situation we need to look into
and we'll push it up he also talked
about this notion of unbalanced and what
he described of it as in what account
amounted to an unbalanced forum was a
situation where either there were too
many posts and are too many replies and
it basically felt like there was so much
activity that a new user wouldn't be
able to join in the activity if they
would feel like they were just an
outsider there was too much going on and
another thing he wanted to look out for
was a situation but there were too many
dud posts what he described as a dud
post was where somebody posted a you
know a subject started a thread but
nobody replied to it there were a whole
lot of these sort of Doug posts he said
it would feel like it was a really dead
forum and nobody would want to join in
so he was trying to monitor for this
sort of like negative user experience in
the form but the problem is is he had no
idea what cat what meant like what it
meant to have too many of these things
because he had no data he was never he
was always using his gut to make
decisions about how whether to intervene
as a forum moderator he wasn't he didn't
have any real data but since it's built
on rails it was really easy to
instrument the the site and get some
data out and see how many you know
people how much people were posting but
now we needed to learn you need to
figure out what those values were on
what what meant for it to be high so we
built them a little monitoring display
in the same sort of way as the other two
and then over time that allowed him to
make modifications
in the way that that happened was he
would see the the heat value sort of
move up and then he would go look in on
the situation if it was high and he
would say he would make it evaluation
say you know what in this situation this
it's not so bad this is fine this isn't
too many and they would be able to take
the slider and drag it down to where he
figured it belongs maybe it was just a
little bit something was going on or
like know this is totally fine and you
could just drag it all the way down and
that allowed him to basically interact
with this evaluation directly but really
all the all that he was doing is just
sort of moving those two thresholds in
that range since the data point is fixed
the thresholds defined where the value
ends up residing so if you pull the the
slider down you're just moving the
ignore boundary up it's like this that
way he was able to eventually develop
have the system reflect his his
experience but this is a this is a
another really important aspect of sort
of performing subjective evaluation the
information that we present must have
reflect that person's unique individual
knowledge and as a result it's really
important that that person's knowledge
is going to change frequently over time
they're going to learn more as they you
know become more expert there's the the
situation that they're they're trying to
monitor for is going to change because
maybe there are more users joining or
the the you know their you're loading up
new servers there's the situation is
constantly changing so you have the
monitoring you guys really need to
encourage frequent revision now since he
wanted to maintain a sort of a
comfortable forum for his users it's
really important that he would be able
to step in before the situation
deteriorated in other words he really
wanted to know if the if the situation
was sort of building and this is where
the graph would really come in handy
instead of just that little slider but
he we still just wanted to make that
evaluation we didn't necessarily need to
give him a whole lot of detail um so we
can still treat it as an evaluation but
since we don't need to give since the
the detail doesn't really matter it
doesn't to him to some it doesn't matter
if there's 33 posts or 36 posts or 112
posts it matters just that it's sort of
getting there so we can down sample the
data
which gives us a really a much more
simplified graph and goes back to this
at this point if you just want to give
people who are monitoring the necessary
detail that allows them to make that
evaluation as quickly as possible and so
the display now shows him sort of the
recent history of the situation which
tells them how the situation is changing
in other words it enables him to sort of
forecast the situation now we can show
them that forecast more explicitly using
a what's called a common filter which is
a way of sort of making of statistical
forecasts and now we can shown this
whole graph which doesn't just tell him
how it's been doing but it makes an
estimate of how it's going to change in
the future let them sort of figure out
how quickly is changing how serious it
is and how much time he has to maybe
make a decision to do other things first
so this is what the sort of final
display that he was given looks like but
that's still actually a a big thing
we're still taking up quite a bit of
real estate that was the problem with
the graph in the first place so we want
to keep everything very compact to make
it really easy to make that evaluation
as quickly as possible so this little
animation shows the relationship between
sort of graph view and that original
slider view that now lets you show it
lets you see that they're actually you
can represent just that that state that
evaluation but also still convey the how
it's changing so here's some more
examples of what the two different views
might look like and so the little slider
view sort of intended to sort of convey
motion like those little motion lines in
comics where you you know see a ball
flying through the airings tool most
users would be able actually depending
if they read let if there were more use
of reading left to right or right to
left they'd have no problem reading this
and actually guessing or identifying
that how quickly was moving up or down
or which direction was going but this
also adds another step to that delving
process it allows the user to make that
quick evaluation decide if they want to
know more and now they can go in and see
just how it's changing they can expand
that little slider see the whole graph
and get us
sense of how I was changing and then dig
in deeper so our form ended up learning
much more about his his users behavior
using this thing in fact he learned so
much that he end up instrumenting his
whole site with all sorts of other data
they was getting out of the rails
framework and then he started building
his own displays not ones that I built
for me just started making his own
modifying them to look for all sorts of
other information in his system because
this was a great way for him to to learn
about what how often people perform
different actions how many perform
different actions so looking back over
what we've learned about user activity
we can maybe describe some user goals
involved in monitoring the first the
first one is that they use a must
identify and describe a situation that's
of interest to them and in terms of
indicative conditions remember how our
users users actually use dashboards they
spot conditions and try to figure out
what each of those conditions might
indicate next they need a way to quickly
perceive that the the situation many a
quick a way to perceive the situation to
make an evaluation has the situation
occurred is it likely to occur and when
then they need a way to investigate the
situation delve into it and analyze
what's going on and finally they need a
way to refine and modify the situation
to better reflect what they now
understand now I would argue that
monitor you guys are almost entirely
designed around the delving stage as
they stand today they give the users as
much information as possible and then
expect them to sort of sort the wheat
from the chaff if we design monitoring
do is to support all these activities
and certainly can make them a whole lot
better and it's it's not that monitoring
you guys don't work at all but it's that
they're incomplete it's a dashboards and
alarms and reports are insufficient
their analytical tools and all three
situations would have benefit
from from an additional tool that would
help them support making an evaluation
evaluation is necessary because all
these people have many different
responsibilities and must constantly
decide where to direct their attention
the closer situation is to developing
more important it becomes for them to
pay attention to it tools that aid in
making those evaluations more quickly
will definitely make the monitoring
experience better so following some of
these design goals that I've had
described along the way in light of
these user goals I think we'll actually
we can actually go a long way to
improving monitoring you is and how
effective they can be and hopefully make
them suck a little bit less so thanks
maybe we have any questions
representation
anything like fighting the notion of
alerting and
so that like
it's below as professional
absolutely absolutely in fact so if you
use those or operators you can combine
them infinitely so you can describe
situations and then combine all those
situations with or operations and so
only the one that's needs your attention
is going to pop up then when you dig in
you can spot the one that's high and
then explore and dig into that there's
nothing about these displays that tell
you to use that they should replace the
way in which we the modern tools we have
now they just work in addition so we
definitely still need alarms when stuff
happens they exceed you know there are
situations where we know what we need to
respond to like fire when smoke alarms
and stuff we there's only one action to
do get out of here so once if that
action is really clear alarms are
excellent but if if it's complicated we
need to we actually end up needing to
dig into the situations it's better if
we've got something that works in
addition to the alarm something maybe
tells us that alarm might go off soon so
maybe go look into this now definitely
Nathaniel right Nathan sorry you're
Nathan you're Nathaniel got it thanks um
just research
well I'd say there's definitely at least
two important directions the first one
is expanding this to support look at all
sorts of other operations so I described
this in terms of just I'd quickly
introduce the the and and the the or
because those are sort of easy to
describe in terms of these particular
use cases but when you're actually
trying to identify the situation when a
pay attention to that's actually pretty
complicated and so in that case you need
more complex tools and the way in which
I sort of cope with this is I asked
users what they were looking at and I
also ask them what they were looking for
inevitably users could answer one of
those two questions they could tell me
that they were always looking at a you
know this indicator or that indicator
and then I could build up situations
that they were wanting to pay they
wanted to pay attention to in a bottom
of fashion missing okay so you've got
that sensor that you're paying attention
to what happens if it's reading hi what
are you know mitigating circumstances
and for mitigating circumstances you you
need another operator something what
something that's culture of a sense or
not Sen but cen that that sort of
minimizes the effect of a value and
that's I call and not essentially by
saying if this is if this is high and
not and this one is not high then don't
make it low and that's there are all
sorts of sort of logical operators we
can build on them you know the knot is
very easy for people to describe because
they can often describe what are the
things what describes a normal situation
and then I can take the knot of the
normal and so the it's basically saying
the less normal the situation is the
more important it is you pay attention
to it but there are all sorts of other
operations that are worth exploring and
then the the next area is use is
building on this to sort of use this
heat as a way of saying this is
something you should look at but now
that we've said that this is something
we should look at we can map that value
to other things so for example in
the visual scheme so sighs if you have a
phone status display and you've got all
sorts of information on your phone about
the battery life signal strength your
next appointment your upcoming to do is
there are times at which that
information is more important than other
information on that displaying so now we
can map he'd instead of to the sort of
vertical position to size and so now
your battery gets lower the battery
indicator gets bigger and you can define
how much that that matters to you if you
are a person who is a charger everywhere
not necessarily that's not necessarily
going to get big but the closer gets to
your next appointment maybe your
appointment can get larger and you can
define that in the same way but building
the sort of knowledge base underneath is
a bit of a challenge but at least what's
valuable here is that unlike a lot of
other knowledge base tools this works
even if you just at the very beginning
as soon as you have any one point of
knowledge then it works for you at least
up to that point and as you develop more
and more knowledge you can expand that
knowledge base and make it more and more
useful over time
they show you um I mean sometimes if it
dashboard is absolutely awful you still
know I can't look at this this and this
yeah so do you lose the ability to look
at as soon as an age open do you know
what to look at yeah so yeah absolutely
so location of information on any sort
of like large bit of information display
matter so much if you start moving those
things around users got totally confused
they have no trust in the display and
it's a real problem you can definitely
continue to use this in use location as
a keep things together hold on see I've
got a dashboard picture here somewhere
alright well this isn't a great
dashboard but we'll try this one this
one's a for a different use case I
didn't talk about but you can keep them
all in the same location and you can you
can display this sort of information all
in this at the same place but the
advantage one of the things you can do
here is there's a there's a there's a
unique situation we're actually moving
things around makes a difference r is
valuable and that's if the way in which
they move is entirely predictable or
really familiar to a user so for example
if you sort these if you sort them
highest to lowest it's okay that they
move around because if that's the way
the users interpreting it that their
intention of looking at this is to
identify which of these is worth paying
attention to it's okay to move them
around and sort them in fact I found
that it worked it worked really well if
I is a picture here I think I do
we work really well if I took the name
if I took the title off so the user just
saw this and sorry bye bye basically
just saying there's something that needs
your attention it meant that the user
wasn't constantly trying to jump into
that analytical stage of just evaluating
that there was something that needed
their attention and once it sort of
moved up they could be curious and say
is that something I want to pay
attention to and then when they moused
over it then they get the name which
would let which would basically already
indicate I'm already ready to do a
little bit of analysis here to find out
a little bit more and so in that case it
and that end up actually keeping them
from looking at it all the time we're
trying to make sense of it all the time
it was just saying its fine there's
nothing there that's or up something's
popping up maybe you need to try to make
some time for it done so give it how
important evaluation is that would be
like every every monitoring
it would be good to have the ability to
sort of make them adjustments that you
showed with me with the poor of like as
you kind of refine you continue to
better understand what's good and what's
bad I'm curious why didn't have those in
the first I did I just didn't I wanted
to tell the story build up to it so but
yeah that's actually I mean that's
really vital so but I haven't shown you
something else as part of this so that's
adjusting how each of the different sort
of conditions are being evaluated but
the thing is that the situation
constitutes looking at all these
different sensors and combining them and
they sort of long on these logical
statements that has to be edited to that
has to be able for the user to change so
if they discover that you know this disc
is always given me a problem but I know
about that that disc is going to get
changed or that's just that's particular
to that server I don't care about that
sort of that aspect of it I need to add
that to my sort of logical description
that I didn't show you I didn't show the
editing for that and at this point i
implemented that is just sort of XML and
it's a sort of a relatively straight
sort of a tree structure of combining
these things in a logical order but
that's a really important aspect of it
too it's not just important that the
user be able to make those fine
adjustments they also need to be able to
add to that knowledge in the sort of
logical descriptive way as well that's
really important and you know sort of in
the Google Analytics way it's you've got
your custom report over time you realize
you know what to for this particular
situation I need to start adding it I
need to keep looking at this other
aspect and so you add in that additional
part of the reports of being able to
come constantly modify all that is
really important
value eight
the secret's safe tracking statistical
simulation to change one metric relative
to
so that you make a suggestion that
better
there are really powerful tools that
perform that sort of analysis already
and they're really domain-specific and
those tools are constant being developed
and they they're an aid to developing
that knowledge and as much as I would
love to contribute to that the people
who do that are way smarter than I am
and they they understand their domains
much better than then I could not it's
it's another way of adding sort of
knowledge that you then apply to
something like this in a way this is
sort of like almost like a quick sort of
scratch pad where you write a couple of
things down that you sort of want to try
to remember this should be quick and
dirty that lets you make the sort of
valuation quickly it allows you to feel
confident in the in the situation what
you know about the situation but it's
not definitive that's is really
important distinction
this display in structure no
and what point as you approach
level you're sitting there watching your
grass root growth
effectively turning in to accept that
well and in fact in this case the I
never had it additionally actually
trigger an alert the system either
already had an alerting system as part
of it or I relied on the user to you
know use whatever learning system they
were comfortable with the point of this
was to let them know that an alert might
be coming soon so that when they didn't
know when they had time maybe to look in
and do that that monitoring they could
look and see what situations might need
their attention soon but this it doesn't
supplement replace an alert alert still
are used in our they're still very
necessary and in fact if something sort
of pegs up and reaches the top and the
user is no time to attend to it and an
alert they have to make this decision to
cancel ignore or snooze and this just
stays high just stays there but it
doesn't pull them out of whatever
they're doing but that's also sort of a
drawback because it could stay up there
for a week if for whatever reason they
don't look at it and we still we still
need alerts but this supplements them
and enables them to use their time more
wisely and essentially make better
tactical decisions does that answer your
question
question may be challenging the efficacy
of as it as it approaches that threshold
in either stays right hand or right
below threshold mm-hmm
in this case the lines are growing
darker or more solid for
I'm still going to look at that
I have to deal or it's going to get bad
or I'm going to get the word and maybe
this is something to do that's the point
that i'm in five
in the
in the solid middle ground between okey
you are really just confronting you know
that's right
Mac some of the boundaries in either
direction
even consider something but it's really
questioning whether or not it's sort of
a gradient as you get closer
those are get sit still
right no and actually that's a that's a
really good point at some point yet so
the situation does exist and you have to
still make that tactical decision about
whether or not you're going to turn to
it or not the own the that's not
unfortunately to go away and but instead
at least now you might know that it's
coming which is a win but you're right
this isn't this isn't a it certainly
doesn't eliminate the need for alarms it
doesn't eliminate the need for alerts
and you're right at some point you look
at that you see it's hi users may simply
respond that every time they respond is
if it's it was an alarm that just went
off the only thing that's unique about
what's special about this is that the
time when that occurs is a time when
they're looking when they're looking
into it which means they're there
there's there's time in their day
there's a moment for them to look into
it as opposed to they're doing something
else and it comes at them and that's the
the distinction cool
oh and sorry jesse was another area when
you'd asked about the research there's
another thing you can do with this which
I hadn't really that's very researchy I
don't know if I saw this figure in here
we can do I'd said I talked about
mapping the two different sizes but
there's more we could do with it each of
these different situations are
situations we're looking out for but
some I've talked about negative
situations looking out for something bad
happening the thing is we also want to
look out for really good things
happening an opportunity that we want to
be able to take advantage of and so if
we just add one more dimension of this
which is a bit which is just whether or
not it's a good or a bad situation it's
a valence to it we can use this sorry to
approximate what is we call a machine
effect essentially it's as if the
computer has a system that's like our
affective or emotional system basically
if there are bad situations that seem to
be on there if there are bad situations
that exist then the computer is
equivalent to being sad there's a bad
situation that seems to be coming it's
an equivalent of the computer becoming
worried if there's a good situation that
exists then it's equivalent of the
computer being happy and if there's a
good situation that's appears to be
approaching then the computer is
equivalent to being excited and it's
instead of trying to mimic human emotion
which is what all of all of you know
effective research is focused on this
allows you to essentially let the
computer have its own thing its own
equivalent something that isn't this
that isn't the same as ours isn't trying
to communicate to us in the same way
that by you know making it a happy but
allows it now to start responding as if
it had its own sort of emotional system
but that's a ways off but
that's very researching
Jacob
I guess the
a lot of information what is made when
tangential but
people look at the best ways to
incorporate this into the alerting that
alerts if it's above this threshold or
it you know looks like that's actually
yeah that's a great point actually so um
but so let me actually reframe the the
question a little bit or exactly sort of
the the approach instead of on trying to
sort of catch as its as that first
derivative is growing in a way instead
have another sensor that is not
measuring the absolute value but is
measuring the second of the first
derivative and now do the same sort of
threshold aridity and so now you can
capture that and add that to your
description of the situation so as you
just described it it's not just when
it's high but when it's getting high
then I want to be sort of want to pay
attention to it that's a or condition in
this case that either its high or if the
first derivative is high then I want to
pay attention you put those together now
you've got sort of the heat for that and
so that's a great question
cool thanks thank you guys all for
