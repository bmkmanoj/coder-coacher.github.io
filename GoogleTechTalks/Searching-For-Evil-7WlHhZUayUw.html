years we share a mutual interest in
economics right thanks how when it
transpired a couple of months ago that I
was going to be here and how suggested
that I give a tech talk I just wondered
what I should say that would be of
interest here so put together a few bits
and pieces from various research threads
and one of the things that we do is a
lot of empirical work econometric work
if you like on wickedness we're into
measuring spam were into knowing who's
doing fishing and how we're into looking
for all sorts of scams and this ties
together I think rather nicely with some
work that's been done over the last ten
years or so in traffic analysis and some
more recent work on social networking so
firstly that's a zip through traffic
analysis and back in World War two this
was really really important because all
four we all know from the history books
that occasionally German and Japanese
ciphers got deciphered it didn't always
happen but the reliable source of
information in fact on both sides was
who was calling him you could recognize
radio operators by their fists by the
way they did Morse code and the other
side could as well it's a traffic
analysis and traffic security suddenly
became very important they've been
important for intelligence and law
enforcement ever since and in fact if
you look at the data I don't know the US
data off hand but in the UK last year
with something like nine hundred and
fifty thousand requests for traffic data
that is itemized phone bill data made by
various law enforcement authorities and
only a few thousand requests for content
why well if you tap someone
fawn and he's a bad guy than usually
what you get is right Fred I'll see you
in the usual place in 20 minutes which
isn't usually all that helpful but if
you know who he's fawning and who he's
texting and who's phoning him you can
trace networks and you can do quite a
lot now we got interested in this a bit
over 10 years ago in the context of the
crypto Wars and more recently in the
last seven or eight years as people have
developed online anonymity systems tar
mix master mix minion and so on we've
done quite a lot of work in looking at
traffic analysis which becomes the big
thread and so we've developed quite a
lot of tools I'm not going to go into
much of the mathematic solid I'm sure an
audience like this is well aware of
Newman's work and things like that
because it's similar to the stuff that
you use in searching but what I'm going
to try and convince you of if you aren't
already convinced of it is that traffic
analysis is highly relevant for online
services especially as the bad guys get
into the picture the second thread the
security and economics thread that Hal
and I started about seven years ago a
rules because we realized that many of
the bad things that went wrong didn't go
wrong for technical reasons right it
wasn't because some idiot had used green
encryption instead of red encryption the
real sources of failure were more often
than not to do with incentives one of
the things that interested me was the
fact that I cited a lot of electronic
banking fraud and I found that in the UK
banks were less liable for fraud the
liability rules that then dumped
liability and customers in America your
banking industry is better regulated
because your banks are smaller and more
numerous and therefore less politically
powerful and so as banking consumers you
get a pretty good deal here so you would
expect that there'll be more fraud in
America than Britain but it turns out
it's the other way around right because
as an adverse selection effect bankers
in Britain this the guys in the middle
of the organization had developed the
system's nor that customer complaints
won't be investigated seriously or at
all so they get lazy and careless
something that Harvard interested in was
widened antivirus companies sell as much
product as they thought they should well
the answer was that from about
thousand or so getting a virus wasn't
all that bad a thing to have right
fifteen years ago if you've got a virus
at trashed your hard disk but nowadays
it just uses your machine for sending
out the occasional bursts of spam or
whatever and in fact most viruses
nowadays are pretty sociable you know
they will patch up your machine so that
no other botnets recruits you so there's
a kind of equilibrium there which
results in the antivirus companies not
making as much money as they hope to do
and then of course there's health
security one of the big drivers in
America for encryption sales is hipper
why did that come about because hospital
IT systems are bought by medical
directors rather than by patients so
they're very good at collecting billing
information and they're very good at
collecting clinical information for
research but the patient just wasn't at
the table when the purchase was
negotiated and so you end up with all
sorts of problems and then of course
there's the big problem everybody
worries about wise Microsoft software so
insecure despite its market dominance
why doesn't bill just say that right as
of next Tuesday JavaScript won't work
anymore well hey problems like these got
us to start security economics and now
we've got a field with I think the last
Weiss that asked workshop on economics
and info sank at 140 attendees so how
does this touch on concerns here well
one of the best peppers a twice last
year was by Ben Edelman on adverse
selection and online trust
certifications so what's adverse
selection well for the drivers have more
accidents and drivers of other cars and
why should this be the case well there's
two explanations the first is that
people the northern lousy drivers by
Volvo's so they'll be less likely to be
killed right that's adverse selection
and the other is that people who drive
Volvos drive faster because you go to
risk thermostat inside your brain and
you adjust the amount of risk to which
you're exposing your source to the level
with which you're comfortable now in my
case that's what happens because when i
drive the white Volvo I
about five miles an hour faster that I
Drive my own visual so depending on the
circumstance it might be adverse
selection or moral hazard but here's our
application of adverse selection what
band did was to go and get access to a
database from one of the AV companies on
which data on which websites were wicked
in the sense of the hosted malware or
did other bad things and he looked at
trustee trustee as a certificate that
you can get on your website you go to
the trustee folks you fill in a lot of
questionnaires about your privacy
policies and about how you're a good boy
and all the rest of it and then that let
me use your their logo and your website
so Ben started off by looking at that
and he came to the conclusion that
websites that displayed the trustee logo
were twice as likely to be wicked as
just random websites and why should this
be because wicked people go out of their
way to sign up and get the seal of
approval he then went and looked at
various search engines and this is the
scary thing perhaps for you that the top
Google Ad given some random commercial
search string is twice as likely as the
top editorial search result to be
malicious it's not quite as scary as it
seems because if you go to competing
search engines ass down the road it's
three or four times as likely to be
malicious and Google is in fact Google
is in fact the least evil performer in
this space but it's still potentially
scary because the rational person here
comes to the conclusion don't click on
ads and so Lily something has to be done
about that
one of the other things that was
presented a twice last year was some
work that I did with my student she
showed nagaraja on the interaction
between game theory and social
networking theory now as I'm sure
everybody's aware by now many real-world
networks can be modeled as scale-free
networks that is networks where you've
got a parallel distribution of vertex
order and it's this tail which provides
the connectivity you've got a small
number of people if you like with very
very high degree of connectivity and
this explains all sorts of things social
contacts disease spread spread of
computer viruses and the highly
connected Lords basically provide much
of the connectivity in your network but
they also provide the vulnerability in
the sense that if you attack the higher
our door nodes then the network can be
disconnected very quickly so here's an
example of a positive use of this in
Sierra Leone the hiv/aids program
started off by treating prostitutes
obviously the high vertex ardell nodes
and the disease transmission graph and
they've had a pretty good result because
only two percent of the population were
infected for us it's about forty percent
in Botswana you know where people are
very staid and respectable and unwilling
to talk about sex in public certainly
not on the TV another example if you
conquer a country you subvert or kill
the birds Rosie first William the
Conqueror in 1066 round up the sacks and
landlords right Hugh Godric are going to
marry a good French girl are we going to
cut your head off right easy way to take
over a country if you go if you've got
the landowners under your control the
peasants don't matter and then in the
case of an insurgency you've got all
these bad guys and terrorist networks
and some of them are bad or than others
because they've got fatter other factors
so the FBI goes out and arrest them and
takes them to Guantanamo Bay end of
insurgency well hey the problem here is
that you have to worry about the dynamic
case and the models that have been made
up to now Luke told me at the static
case the one off you know the invasion
of England and ten
66 the liquidation of the cool acts and
the Ukraine in the 1930s whatever but
what happens when the thing is ongoing
well we don't know how to get anything
resembling an analytic solution of the
kind of equations that you come up
against so we followed axelrod's work on
it serrated printed prisoner's dilemma
and we did a whole bunch of simulations
the methodology here evolutionary game
theory is to try and evolve one strategy
against another so you evolve a bunch of
attack strategies and you find the best
name you evolve a bunch of defense
strategies and you find the best and so
on and so forth so we set up a
scale-free Network of 400 nodes and at
each round the attacker kills 10 lords
and the attackers strategy is his
selection of the nodes then the defender
goes and recruits 10 more and he
reconfigures the network and how he does
this is his strategy and the limitation
is that while the attacker has a global
picture of the network at least in this
version of the work the defender is
supposed to use local knowledge only
which again mimics what's going on in an
insurgency and we iterate this for
defense and attack so what we found
first time around is that the basic
replenishment whether you do it random
or skill free doesn't get you very far
so you start evolving defense strategies
this black line is what we saw before
that's what happens if you simply
replace the ten lords and then locally
make things look skill free by adding
edges what you might think of doing next
is to replace the high-order nodes with
rings and this is what the first
generation of peer-to-peer systems did
you know pastry corridors and store all
these kind of systems rings have got
properties that appeal to computer
scientists you can cut them anywhere and
nothing's disconnected you have to cut
twice before you disconnect okay so you
think they'd be better and they are for
a while but not much right the network
lasts for a dozen iterations instead of
for three or four and what we then find
is that if we use a strategy whereby
higher order lords will replace with
terrorists
it's like small creeks then that turns
out to be almost completely resistant to
a vertex order attack so this gave us
the first real insight into why it is
since or since at least the Catholic
Protestant worlds of the 16th century
insurgents have been organizing
themselves into cells we've actually got
a model and we've occurred that you can
download and play with but this is just
the starting point because what we then
look at our what are the strategies that
you must use if you are up against bad
guys who organize themselves into cells
suppose you're the FBI and you're trying
to figure out some strategy whereby you
can do data mining on this vast wash of
data that AT&amp;amp;T has so considerably given
you of all the itemized phone bills in
the USA for the past 50 years how would
you go about analyzing that in such a
way as to find and to consistently keep
on finding the important people in some
conspiracy well what we found on the
back of the last lot of evolution is
that centrality attacks and in
particular attacks based on between the
centrality are your best search strategy
when your objective is nor destruction
and thus network this connection now
what between the centrality is is
basically the proportion of all the
paths across the network and which in
particular Lord lies so that's an order
n cubed thing to compute but there are
approximate local measures that you can
do fairly efficiently and what we found
is that the centrality based attacks
enable you after a dozen rounds or so to
significantly reduce the size of the
largest connected component and that's
the best result that we know of against
the the terror cell defense strategy and
of course there are several evolutions
beyond this you can make attack and
defense strategies more complex and
there's a bunch of papers and she shows
website if you want to read up all the
details but that's enough theory because
when one's doing this economics business
the idea is you get some theory some
ideas that enable you to literal stuff
and then you go and collect some data so
I have another couple of research
students or a postdoc in the research
student Richard Clayton and Tyler Moore
who put an awful lot of effort into the
econometrics of wickedness counting up
various fish and spam and things like
that so I've put together a few slides
which show some of our collection I'm
sure some of them will be familiar to
you I expect some won't be in fact if
they were all familiar to you then
there'll be no point in coming here and
giving this talk so let's start off with
the easy stuff history of fishing we've
seen an evolution over the last three
years fishing basically started in 2004
last year in Britain it was 35 million
pounds America maybe two hundred million
dollars and that's pretty impressive
growth for a small business hey even by
the standards of this path of the world
so people started off with obvious stuff
you'd have a misleading the men name or
you'll have an insecure end user this is
somebody on some big web hosting service
who's left himself exposed tons of the
fishermen go in and they install
themselves on a site that nobody's going
to blacklist you insecure machines
typically company machines that people
manage the route and then of course
there are free web hosting services so
all the usual tricks that you would
expect but there's one gang that we've
been involved in doing a lot of research
on which is different this is the
rockfish gang and we believe that at
present these guys are doing about half
of all the fishing in the UK and North
America so this is a pretty profitable
business and they've got some rather
capable technical people there they also
seem to have some people who've maybe go
to background and KGB communications
intelligence because they're pretty good
at covering their tracks and they don't
do any of the usual stupid things that
organizations like Al Qaeda are doing as
a resort that people caught for a start
one of the reasons that phishing
websites get taken down is the good old
economic reason that the
for in somebody's trademark and if
you're trying to get an ISP to take
something down and then dmca is
something that they understand an awful
lot better than fishing so if you see
I'm barclays bank and you're hosting a
Barclays with a ck take it down or
you're a wicked person often jail with
you then the ISP takes it down no
questions asked so the kind of style
that you get with rock fish which is a
giveaway is something like this they may
have demands such as los 80 and they
then have unique URLs which they can
then use to direct the fishing victim
through fast flux to one of a number of
machines exhausted on a botnet so
they've got the bank name in there
they've also got a unique nonce there's
the domain name and since about februari
they've been using this fast flux trick
whereby the dns server is serving up
maybe five or ten IP addresses at once
and then changes them two new ones after
20 minutes and so on and so forth and as
a result filtering this kind of thing an
IP address just doesn't work what the
banking industry thinks they are doing
about fishing is taking websites down so
the first thing that we did was to go
and look and see well this was true or
not and it turns out that it's not true
because we've got statistics here for a
whole lot of different phishing scams
rockfish non rockfish how long did a
particular the man named stay in
circulation and as you can see the means
and the medians are quite far apart
because there is a long till there's a
rockfish IP address in and Bolivia i
think it is it's been there for about
three months now so the backs are
basically getting these after 20 30 40
hours but this isn't actually doing
anything about the problem because most
of the response to a fisherman's spam
run comes in the few hours after it now
you may get some trailing
for there are so as people have been
aware go and check out the email but by
and large people are not anything like
as good as they say they are at taking
down these domains in time and it's kind
of not working so we've got a number of
statistics for taking down a free web
hosting sites and as you can see there's
quite a number of hours involved or an
ebay gets an awful lot of this stuff so
there is fishing here's a number of
other scams which are potentially a big
deal any of you know what's going on
here well you got a job ad for an
engineering manager for the Sydney car
center and if you go on through the
website you'll see that they're also
advertising for a regional assistant and
this is what they're actually after they
actually wants a higher regional
assistance as for why primary
responsibilities be available to receive
two to three payments on your bank
account from the customers every week
make a transaction via western unions of
the suppliers or and you get to keep ten
percent that's how you get remunerated
right so this is mule recruitment
sometimes used in money laundering it's
very very widely used in fishing to find
the people who receive the money from
the fishing victims and then send it via
western unions or somewhere like that
via where Russian organized criminals go
and collect the dollar bills and of
course what happens then is that twenty
thousand dollars arise in your account
you go and send eighteen thousand
dollars for your Western Union to Latvia
ten days later the little old lady whose
$20,000 it was notices and complains and
it gets taken out of your account back
into her account you found that you're
all drawn by eighteen thousand dollars
you go through Western Union and you say
can I have my money back and they say no
at least that's what happens to you in
Britain and in America in Germany they
put mules in jail as well but some
people think is unfair because the
majority of mules who end up being
recruited or elderly working class
people who typically grew up in East
Germany and are not really very with it
even with capitalism let alone with the
internet so there's a significant amount
of spam now is aimed at mule recruitment
and it's been climbing steadily in the
past few months this suggests to us that
mule recruitment is now a serious
bottleneck and so it's an area on which
enforcement action might well be
targeted now who's going to do the
enforcement action because the big
problem with crime on the internet is is
always somebody else's problem right you
know with a wonderful example of this
with a huge IT security conference in
London or back in the spring the
minister turns up and he says people
should do more to protect themselves on
the internet and then he goes away the
bankers come up and they say the
government should do more to protect us
on the internet and the antivirus
companies come and they say we're not
going to be liable for anything but
you'd better buy our software or you
won't be secured on the internet and it
went on like that's all morning it's
always somebody else's problem now who's
got an incentive to stop these guys here
well not Sydney Carson so because it
doesn't exist
right and more and more often you're
seeing non existing companies why hey so
that nobody is going to be bothered and
take a DMCA I together against them and
take them there so the only people who
are taking this kind of stuff down on
the vigilantes is there a rule for
google well the longer lived sites
usually end up being indexed so there's
maybe something there okay here's
another one international shipping
company anybody know what scan this is
escrow scam quite right we protect both
the buyer and the seller with a simple
5-step trust process
it's a very severe it's a very simple
5-step trust process right you go to
ebay and you buy this car in a
secondhand etype jag only 70,000 miles
on the clock twenty thousand dollars and
it's yours so right so you say to the
bar yup it's a deal I'll pay it how do
we arrange it he says well I'm in
Arizona which is a long way away from
you which is why the car still in good
condition tell you what why don't we go
to an escrow site and I'll give them the
car shipping document so you give them
the money and then swap over and there
is one business that does this as a
respectable business that's escrow calm
and there are about 198 give or take bad
people who are doing this as part of
action scams here at least there are
other guys at escrow.com who are trying
hard to take all these sites down but
hey so again they're taken down by
amateur of vigilantes and again we're
trying to track the speed of removal of
these to find out what sort of
contribution one gets from the financial
institutions effort to generally clean
this up and it's not really very
impressive in the UK those apax makes a
lot of noise about how it's taking
downfall sites but the point is we don't
really believe that any of these efforts
are effective so you know one would tend
to classify them as security theater in
fact the bank's efforts to take their
own banking phishing websites are as we
saw earlier largely in the category of
security theater
well the vigilantes basically tend to be
geeks with a sense of justice who go and
go to ISPs and say this is an evil site
take it dad basically as a recreational
hobby we have one student who does this
for example what with a couple and
there's one of our research students his
mother got a solicitation coming from
the Halifax Bank of Scotland where the
URL wasn't H boss dark coat UK so he
Julie called our pitch bosses fraud team
and said as this a spammer a fish and
they said it's a fish so ok thank you so
he forms up the ISP and says this is an
evil website please take it down it then
turned out that it was in fact an H boss
Bank marketing website but it had been
set up by another Department using a
contractor and you know if you ever
think of doing any work and security
usability just bear this in mind that
when one of the UK's top four banks
cannot tell the difference between a
spam and a fish right it can't it's the
security department can't tell its own
spam from a fish and thinks it's a fish
then what makes are trying to make my
mother liable for this kind of stuff Hey
ok next scam I'm sure you're very
familiar with this kind of thing
so how do you is this a good pharmacy or
a bad pharmacy and how do you tell
difference well that there are half a
dozen highly reputable online canadian
pharmacies and i'm sure you all wish
that they're still trading when you get
to the tender age of 65 and start being
in the market for their services but
these guys are bad guys they're flogging
bad drugs or just taking your money how
do you tell well we tracked a network of
these sites down and we found again that
once you've done a bit of homework you
can very often find search terms that
will work because it's one person makes
a whole bunch of different site so you
had a bunch of villains or copy each
other sites so here the search terms
that turned out to work were blood
pressure cholesterol and licensed by the
college of pharmacists of British
Columbia whatever that is it seems it
seems to be a sure America of wickedness
twenty three thousand seven hundred well
that's almost a botnet for goodness sake
hey and because we know who the good
ones are
and here's another thing in the same
well there's this is one of tyler's
rather than one of mine and Tyler's
American understands these things look
my mom is a pharmacist so my mum would
have ways of finding out who is a
licensed member of the pharmaceutical
society so III don't know offhand the
answer to that but if you look at
Richard and Tyler's pair for full
details on this again looking through
the network of sites which do virility
enhancements you find again that there
are large networks of sites that are
basically plagiarizing each other and
the point here is that by looking good
networks of plagiarize sites you can
very often pick up particular modus
operandi and pick it up on an industrial
scale and fairly quickly 475 of this
particular group okay here's another
scan you know this scam then you know
hotshot good so what's going on here
well if you look at the price down there
you've got the can us one vs mark two
for one thousand eight hundred and
eighty dollars which is a pretty good
price because if you go and look
elsewhere you find it costs about three
times as much so this is basically a
fake shop how do you know it's a fake
shop yep you know we wrote a report on
fishing for the Federal Reserve which
you can find in my website and we came
to the conclusion that the critical
problem in fishing as of five or six
months ago when we wrote it was
extracting the money and what the
fishermen were then doing was using
eagled because eagled does irrevocable
payments so we wrote this report send it
in to the Fed and before it was
published Eagle got raided and closed
then and that business is now going to
western union and going to mules so at
any one time it seems the some link in
the chain that people use to see to it
that payments are made that can't then
be revolt you see if you just make a
payment through a check or a credit card
and a business turns out to be a bad one
then of course the banks will just take
the money back so irrevocable payments
seem to be almost always a dead giveaway
what to do about that hey that's hard
it's basically a financial industry
regulatory problem which is why the fed
is quite properly interested in it yeah
right this is a very common
misconception I'm glad you asked that
question because many people thought
that the reason bad guys used eagled was
that eagled was based in the Caribbean
therefore it must be anonymous right
sorry the question was how would people
use why why would bad people use eagled
when Eagle wasn't anonymous right the
answer is that if you go back three
years or so eagled was anonymous it was
based in the Caribbean after all but
then they had a run-in with the
investigators of child porn and they
agreed that they were going to turn over
records on production of proper warrants
so for the last two and a half years or
so of its trading life Eagle wasn't
anonymous but the feature that it had
which appealed to these guys was the
fact that payments were revocable now
when you think about that it's a very
strange service to offer random people
in the internet think about the last
time you went and bought a car right the
car dealer said he wanted a cashier's
check so you went to your bank and it
says $20,000 car he might have the bank
might have charged you one hundred and
fifty dollars for a cashier's check
think about what's going on there if you
had paid the car dealer with an ordinary
check for twenty thousand dollars then
even if there's been plenty of money in
your account even if the check hadn't
bounced if it turned out two months
later that the money in your account was
stolen that it comes from some kiting
scam or whatever the bank would have
just reversed reversed reversed a little
and that the car dealer would have woken
up in finance or twenty thousand dollars
per 0 so when you buy a cashier's check
you were purchasing for the the car
dealer insurance that that payment is
irrevocable now you would expect that in
a properly functioning economic system
risks like that would be priced and
would be transparent so they would end
up falling on the people best able to
bear them which is what happens with
checks it's the bank was no new for the
last 20 years which can sell you a
cashier's check much more sheep than
anybody else what eagled were basically
doing was letting people by cashier's
checks for very much less
because they were relying on the
offshore jurisdiction and the fact that
nobody answered the telephone when
somebody phoned up from an asset
recovery department now they're gone
western union has taken the role and
there have been one or two other
financial channels that have been used
in the mean in the meanwhile like banks
in Finland for a while were very very
bad about helping asset recovery but
irrevocable payments are an absolute
dead giveaway now what you do about
western union in regulatory terms is
highly non-obvious eagled was a small
business venture run by a few people and
the FBI had riddim and clothes and then
western union is a respectable US
business that was that you saw on
Telegraph companies and stuff Oh
identical question was how does it how
does it do Eagle good so gets in a
revocable payment to an own identity and
the answer is that once you go outside
the highly documented parts of the world
known identity doesn't matter right so
you get a bunch of people get fished in
San Jose or Cambridge or whatever
montegut swept into account it would go
through eagled it would then go into a
bank account somewhere in Moscow or
whatever and guys would turn up with
carpet bags and would take dollar bills
and whatever passport had been produced
to open that account initially would
have been caused corruptly obtained or
whatever so you know the assumptions
that you make here about identity
working basically doing hold in much of
the world in places like Nigeria you can
go and buy a government-issued photo ID
in any name of your choice from the
local police for not much means like
wire transfers or such simply because
the infrastructure in their countries
that good enough supports these are
payments with were you do well there's a
long story here with hawala and informal
means of funds transfer and one of the
side effects of 911 is that the hawala
providers who used to have a very
efficient service for sending money to
places like Pakistan and the Philippines
got done to death with red tape
reporting requirements anti-terrorist
funds transfer requirements and so on
which from the point of view of
enforcement in ordinary commerce I had a
highly negative effect but if you go and
read the paper that I wrote on non banks
and fishing which is I think the second
or third top pepper in my website you
can get all the details on that it would
take a somewhat off-topic to go and
start discussing hawala but but yeah the
the near claws down of informal payment
of traditional payment systems like that
has led to a growth in the use of
services like western union okay so we
were talking about hotshot good which
appears to be a dodgy shop if you search
for hotshot good good they've been
around long enough that a careful person
doing a check would see that they have
turn up turned up in places artists
against 419 for example which lists bad
people so somebody doing due diligence
and hot shop good who wasn't totally
focused and buying his camera might be
warned by google so there's information
there that might perhaps be used to do
something useful but traditional ways of
using this information don't seem to
work one of the other things were
interested in his reputation systems
here's mcafee siteadvisor hotshot good
calm we tested this site and didn't find
any significant problems
even there if you had looked very
carefully Buda seed in the user reviews
one rating bad shopping experience user
claiming they were robbed okay and the
the guys who write this software you
know think that the big green tick is
consistent with the user claiming they
were wrought so there are interface
issues and tagging issues and you know
all sorts of interesting things here for
engineers to get to grips with well
indeed and there's a question here about
what sort of service a service company
might want to offer here a well-funded
well staffed service organization might
take the view but once you receive the
complaint that a user was robbed here
that somebody would take the trouble to
go through the favorite search engine
and have a look around and see what was
going on and someone who is a capable
operator who knew how this kind of
industry works could within a minute or
two satisfy himself of the wickedness
sufficient to remove the green tick and
put in something in orange or perhaps
even a nasty shade of red how much can
you automate how do you bring in the
experience of people who actually do
this kind of stuff you know what's of
synthesis for example I don't know how
it works in America but in the UK
trading standards are a responsibility
of local councils so you had all these
people working from local councils who
have been working there since all the
19th century and his traditional job was
merchants weights and measures so if you
complain that you got short measure and
petrol at Tescos they would go around
with their van with a special petrol
tank and they would buy a gallon of
petrol and take the petrol away and
weigh it and if it was short they would
then run a prosecution well and good
these guys are kind of floundering in
the digital age what can the
bedfordshire County Council weights and
measures Department do against scams
like this how do we reorganize the
universe so that the money that
governments national and local are
prepared to put into consumer protection
can be coordinated in some sensible way
with the technology that's now coming to
dominate business right because there is
going to be some need for some human
input into this you can't you can't make
everything just algorithms my thesis
advisor the delay Roger Needham had a
saying that management is that which you
cannot reduce to algorithms if you can
program at its administration what's
left is management so there's going to
be some management of if you like the
consumer protection mission who's going
to do it where is it going to be done
how is it going to be coordinated really
really big questions
the question was other vigilantes the
unrecognized county council that we can
recognize and incorporate and I suppose
my answer to that is that when Robert
was Sir Robert Peel set up the
Metropolitan Police the modern world's
first police for us he took the view
that the police another citizenry and
the citizenry is is the police police
officer is simply someone who is paid a
salary to spend all his time paying
attention to those things that are the
duty of us all in any case so what do we
have to say about dodgy shops we find a
number of structural similarities
canadian pharmacy sources and fast flux
pools you know are obviously suspicious
and where you've got a suspicious
pharmacy you can then use plagiarism
detection techniques to go and look for
other similar suspicious pharmacies then
with a relatively small amount of human
effort you can figure out what the
distinguishing characteristics were
suspicious pharmacies are this month and
Google can do some useful stuff here
already is but by no means everything so
there's work to be done there some more
scams anybody know what this is the
nation building white bank we are aspire
through one of the most admired
financial services organizations in the
world recognizes an innovative customer
focused company blah blah blah blah blah
part of me sorry I didn't hear you
nor this is actually 419 this is a bogus
bank in all these emails that you get
from the deceased the widow of a
deceased Nigerian dictator has got 350
million dollars and it can all be euros
if you will tedx than ten thousand
dollars for a bribe okay how do you go
about reassuring people that the 350
million dollars are actually in a bank
account right you set up a bank which is
easy now there's a bank's rest of Perl
scripts seriously somewhat some of them
also have got vaults with golden but
some of them done hey being digital
treasure a credit bank this guy in a
world of abundant global information
flew floors the TCB crew attempts to be
selective and eclectic in particular by
focusing its apostrophe s services in
areas for in-depth research and advice
can really add values such as smaller
capitalized companies and property
companies TCB is a truly global
institution yeah great stuff fodder for
the plagiarism detection mill the firm
is a business unit of ECB and one of
these guys on when they write this stuff
this is so many giveaways so fake banks
that's another bunch of stuff and again
nobody cares about them why because
there isn't a proper treasure credit
bank to put it in a dmca notice and
there's all sorts of stuff that you can
use to pick these up once you've
realized that there a problem and once
you have got a sample a training sample
of a few hundred of them you look at
repeated phrases you look at all links
stuff like that and as I mentioned these
tend to be part of 419 scams
next scam
pyramid scheme yes Ponzi scheme this is
the old scheme whereby people come to
your bank and you pay them typical
standard a 50-percent a week whatever
and you pay the the people who are
already invested with you out of the
money that comes from the new people but
the amazing thing that we've noticed
over the past few months is that more
and more of these pyramid schemes are
completely upfront about it people know
it's a Ponzi scheme it's like stop spam
fraud people know that this is where
could they reckon if we put in a
thousand bucks and they get out in the
first week or two they'll have turned
the thousand bucks into two thousand
bucks or three thousand bucks and it
will be the suckers who come later who
get screwed when the thing collapses
okay and never underestimate the
gullibility of the public Albania's
economy was wrecked by a huge pyramid
scheme that basically stopped up the
entire country savings and you know
anybody who didn't know that it was a
scheme it wasn't reading the peppers so
you've got these postmodern schemes as
we call them returns of quite a few
percent today double your money in seven
or eight days or a week or whatever and
these are the only bad guys we see who
can be bothered to pay for certificates
ssl certificates just to show that
you're a respectable ponzi scheme and
you've heard of reputation sites well
you can find reputation sites which
document all the various ponzi schemes
and their status this one still paying
state is paying payout statistics Total
Return 290 8.50 percent in profit rating
18.6 right now up to twenty-five percent
weekly referral ten percent
if you were to never you really don't
like so if you decide that you're going
to get involved in a Ponzi scheme there
are places where you can go and hey
gmail is widely used by these guys in
fact by gmail is very widely used by
rockfish and many of these guys so how
many of them are other plenty botnet
loads of them next cam European Human
Rights Center
anybody this is one that I actually got
because I chair a nonprofit called the
foundation for information policy
research that looks at the interface
between technology and policy and these
guys sent me an email and
innocuous-looking email saying would we
swap links and so I looked at their
sightings I was slightly suspicious
about it so I went and taught to Richard
and he dug away and found European Human
Rights Center blah blah blah contributes
the general advancement of human rights
research blog cooperation in europe
mission statement building respect for
human rights in the rule of law ok feed
that into the plagiarism detection
system you find that there's another
organization called human rights first
from which the european human rights
center filched its text right plagiarism
detection is useful stuff so this is a
respectable NGO and what's the european
human rights center doing well they've
got an awful lot of jobs and they've
your google ads and they've got a lot of
links from respectable NGOs who aren't
just quite as suspicious as we were when
they received that link exchange spam
sorry
I'll come on to that so you could fake
institutions they send out spam to get
links to the website the thing is
inherently respectable it's it's
handwritten spam you know people don't
object to receiving it many respond to
it your graphics and layout but stolen
content many many many of these point of
sight is a job adverts so basically this
is google firing and this particular set
of sites appear to be owned by this chat
knit Sephora Valentin from Romania all
sorts of adds another example of one of
his European Federation of biophysics it
says this is as respectable as you can
get right if you if you go and look at
the behavioral economics literature the
people who are most trusted by the
public are academics right the
politicians are down there then the
journalists then this academics are at
the top is nice nice in the week at
something this they certainly don't
pairs but of course what is happening is
now that our reputation is being stolen
because more and more academic
institutions are being forged as a front
for job ads cambridge journals online
right this is Cambridge University Press
was one of the people who fell for this
lot and put in a link to the European
Federation of biophysics right and
Cambridge University presses as
respectable as it gets when they point
to the European Federation of biophysics
your algorithms will be fooled for sure
hey because this nice chap munoz mr.
google pays you money to run them well
presumably they're making money from the
job ads as well
next scan Nov know what the scam is
newsletter computer security illegal
activity internet security viruses and
spam so you have got some ads by Google
and you have got some articles on home
and apartment wireless internet security
and there seems to be a certain
disconnect doesn't know the the the ads
are about busts in the sense of garden
sculpture and the content is busting
wicked criminals in the internet so that
might be your starter for 10 so you see
a site like this you know that something
a little bit fishy is going on it's just
a slight smell of salmon wafting on the
breeze so what do you do well a couple
of names their names are often useful to
search on Greg could Sara and Paula
Thornton let's see if we can find any
more instances of them on the Internet
the accidents calm car accident lawyers
lawsuit settlement automobile insurance
companies so what's going on here
privily incorporated privileged business
model is as follows they buy up recently
lapsed internet demands to which they're
all with luck be still quite a few links
extant and they then hire a whole bunch
of journalism students who need to go
and write lots of tedious nonsense to
put on the CV so they can hopefully
learn to write and perhaps get a job one
day prove allure internships are unpaid
positions and participants are
responsible for arranging their own
transportation and housing approximately
25 interns are chosen each spring summer
and fall to participate in this unique
program
and you know what these interns they
work really really hard and all they
gets up one day and they have to write a
magazine on busts and the next day they
have to write a magazine on car
insurance and you know they roll up
their sleeves and they get to it the
content is produced it's not violating a
nobody's copyright hate they're working
for free it's all respectable and of
course what's the point of athol the
point of it is of course making revenue
informal checks from your good cells is
this or is it not wicked it's an
interesting question isn't it because if
any of you got any experience of working
in the pre electronic publishing
industry whether plenty very very
tedious publications will set up to farm
trade advertising revenue so are these
guys bad guys are are they just you know
slightly CD entrepreneurs or you know
what's the view that one would take of
this does one have to take a view but
nonetheless art roll you know for
networks of websites that appear to
pledge your eyes each other starts
throwing up things like this as well how
do you go about deciding which is evil
in which isn't
okay so there's a summary that you're
asking for of the categories of
wickedness that we time to talk about
today fishing fake extra escrow dodgy
merchants fake banks fake Institute's
let's say marginal publishing companies
some involve adverts some are removed by
motivated institutions some by
vigilantes some of the vigilantes just
don't pay attention to because it'll
come across them vigilantes don't care
about fake banks back end mechanics of
419 scams are real interest to them self
similarity you can see to a large extent
you get many of them by means of looking
for plagiarism whether they're trying to
hide well the phishing sites are trying
to hide but most of the others aren't
many of the others are trying to get
traffic and trying to get searched and
indexed number of sites well this is
dynamic I suppose one thing you learn
from this is that whatever those a
viable criminal business model somebody
will do it and build it and once you
build it they will come what can be done
about it well hey there's going to be an
arms race I'm sure over the next 10 or
20 or 100 years of measures and
countermeasures and kinds of
countermeasures and if you're a company
that's involved like it or not in this
business there's a whole bunch of if you
like basic science that's relevant to
the problem security economics sure
traffic analysis sure community
detection algorithms sure no doubt many
other things as time goes on what are we
interested in well I suppose this part
of our security group is interested in
how do we fix incentives to stop fishing
being sawn so effective right we've seen
a number of ways in which bad incentives
although the fishermen's it gets away
with it the banks do security theater
and few
people worry about the problem at all
government simply hopes it would go away
government wishes that people would take
more care they want and it's not going
to happen so are there algorithmic
resources well there are algorithms that
you can use to detect reputation traders
that you can use the detect fake
communities and other covert things that
are going on and these should surely be
not too far from your core competences
another interesting question is whether
community reputation sites can make a
long-term contribution who are the
police going to be in the Internet age
are they going to be civil servants in
Bedford town council who've got a log
onto some Google engine and who would
type in bad stuff that they found will
it be networks of people who are
volunteers what's the split between the
algorithms and the people between the
administration and the management you
know between the the minds and the
mathematics it's easy to get that wrong
another question is whether advertising
is distorting the web the answer is
almost certainly if you didn't have
google ads then you wouldn't have proven
in a publishing business will something
useful come out of this in the long term
if you consider soap operas to be a form
of art and I'm sure that some media
studies professors would take that view
then clearly television advertising was
a good thing because it enabled the
creation of that art form but hey you
know what are the online equivalents of
this going to be and finally what other
cool stuff is there at the boundary of
technology and economics because many of
the really interesting problems nowadays
aren't pure of tech problems because if
they were somebody would have built
something that would have fixed them and
they're not pure economics problems
because if they were the economists
politicians would understand them and
have worked out some kind of policy or
law whatever to do stuff about them it's
where these two worlds meet and people
don't share a common language common
assumptions and common ideas about how
you go about dealing with problems that
the interesting stuff more more and more
hides and that's what we're interested
in
looking at night i think that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
