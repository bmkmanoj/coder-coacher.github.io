you know feel free to if you have
questions of clarification at the outset
feel free or and I guess I'll try to get
through about 20 slides or so and then
after that i'm happy for much more
free-flowing conversation so yeah Who am
I well that's basically what Rick was
just talking about I did work at
Microsoft for a while and both in msn
microsoft office and my croissants
search i mean i was in product groups i
wasn't in research as a matter of fact
they my manager said I wouldn't tell
people that you have a PhD because then
you know the fear was that I would be
dismissed as somebody who didn't know
what I was doing so and the what's the
project this is a project at the
University of Washington and the
information school keeping found things
found and the logic is finding is a
well-studied problem and not that we
have all the answers but it's been the
subject of a lot of research over the
past 20 30 years and keeping things
found is not so well studied but it
happens all the time it happens with
everyday objects and it certainly
happens with information and keeping
things found is an essential aspect of
personal information management or PIM
so I like to ask audiences what I call
the google questions and so I've always
wanted to be able to do that at Google
and Here I am so here are the Google
questions and we've done this in studies
we've also done it in presentations and
it goes like this why do you have
folders I don't have to answer this part
of it but most people when you say well
why do you have folders like file
folders well I to get back to stuff
again make sure that I can get back to
it again and then I we say what's your
favorite web search service well not
surprisingly almost everybody says
google and do you like it yeah I like it
a lot okay so then we say suppose and I
we start
asking this even before there was Google
on the desktop so we modified it as that
came out suppose you could access your
information in the same way so you could
do you could just with a couple of key
words you could get back to anything you
wanted quickly easily effectively safely
securely add you can stipulate
additional conditions okay and then
here's where you get the answer now can
we take away your file folders what do
you think and also your email folders
all your folders who says yes okay so
you're not that much different from an
ordinary audience for non google lobby
ups i should say i I don't know how many
people are here I counted about three
people who said yes maybe four okay if
you're the fourth so that's in general
it's about one out of every 20 people so
maybe it's slightly higher here we'll
have to get a I'm not going to try to
count the number of people here but so
and most people say no with some emotion
to it so for those who didn't say yes
why not why can't we take away your
folders yeah
you don't want
okay okay so if you had better support
for keywords you might be able to go
we're willing to go even then why not
okay so it's easier to drag and drop it
into a folder okay well hard me oh jesus
church is not perfect yeah right yeah
yeah there's a certain unpredictability
about it at least the ordering of things
that come back it may be far down on
this yeah remember
whatever there
so yes it's a reminder of things the
folders themselves and now we're getting
into something else that the folders
themselves have information value
they're not just a means to an end are
you getting back information they are
information in their own right I think
you and then you at the cab yeah a lot
of times the metadata is good pleased to
be able to break down the space like I
want to know my bills are organized by
date and write down the search
interfaces aren't you can't usually
return a good set of results for that
well so it's the searcher it's the lack
of metadata associated with the
information if the metadata were there
better okay all right and but now you I
did allow you to sort of stipulate that
I didn't say Google Desktop Search as it
exists today I said use your imagination
the a bet the set the essential action
would always stay the same it would be
type and it basically the essential
action as in searching on the web would
be type in a couple of words most people
type in about two words I guess and then
oh that's how you get personal
information yeah formation you're
searching for is extrinsic the document
it's these are these are albums I I
thought I like the liking it is
intrinsic to the document right so they
searching for something yeah is what it
being property I'm searching for it's
not good ok so there's personal stuff
that just you would never expect that
the the authors of the document or the
providers that the music would would tag
their clear of you like reading East End
go together you know our list of 10
things that go together and I sure
there's nothing other than that yeah
that links them yeah or you know this is
the song that I remember when I first
met my my spouse or my how kabooming
okay grouping that's another thing right
yeah okay right okay now hierarchies are
a lot of people hate hierarchies so it's
also sort of good to think well why is
hierarchy maybe sometimes useful because
they're you know there's a lot of if you
read the literature for example Doris
and Edwards talk about hierarchies as
something terribly constraining um you
know you can but we can come back to
that later who else did anybody else
have anything else they wanted we
probably shouldn't spend too much time
in the city on labels and tags many
videos things you jack yeah
something could have no level at hook
whereas always have a medic see out if
you want this in one folder not zero you
know where to look always there ok
there's and I'm kind of if I paraphrase
that a little bit it sounds like maybe
there that limitation which you know
again nourish and Edwards would say
that's a horrible limitation but in some
cases you're saying that that makes
things more manageable somehow or
there's more predictable you know that
it has to be there ok I just hearing
somebody else's cell phone made me
remember that I should probably mute
mine so ok so I wanted to tell you what
people said what people have said and
it's basically paraphrase of some of the
things you said folders for control that
comes back to I think your point about
you know it's a grouping and you want
that grouping now at some point we can
sort of start to stipulate tags as
hierarchically organized and at some
point the differences really go away but
along the way we learn something about
why we why we don't want to give up our
folders just yet folders as a
representation or proxy for information
so one person said we've done studies of
this as well folders helped me see my
information better now that's an
interesting one and folders helped me
see what I need to do I think we have
that over lunch that you know they're
been analyses for example by Buddha
Beltre if folders is being in
efficiently used because they don't have
any information in them but you know in
real life we use folders as a
placeholder not for things that are
there to be organized but for things
that we want to acquire is a reminder of
things and moreover there's research in
psychology cognitive psychology that
that says there's sort of this notion of
opportunistic use of information if you
have a plan articulated you're better
better able to identify information
and recognizing you know if you if
you're not thinking about the plan the
fact that you've gone through that makes
it makes it better you're more effective
at opportunistically using information
that comes your way one thing I think is
really good putting things into folders
helps me to understand and remember the
information better is that true for
anybody yeah so I was simply a few
people so I that's sort of an
interesting thing and we'll come back to
that it's like the folders are an
external ization may be of some
categorization scheme and so they
actually the end the act of putting
things in the folders makes you attend
to those properties maybe that are
represented by the folder and that are
also true of the properties i want to
show you an example this is a this is
from somebody who was having a
traditional thai wedding and she'd been
planning it over the course of six
months and here you have and we've
reformatted it and i've taken out a few
folders that were a little too personal
to leave up there but you get the idea
look at this there's a wedding a project
folder a wedding and under that are our
components of the wedding and the folder
hierarchy in a real sense stands for a
partial problem decomposition these are
the things i need to do with the wedding
and some of those even have you know
they sort of are like sub-projects of
the wedding project so you know you have
things like a cake well got to decide
what the cake is going to be where there
is wedding presentation there's also
wedding dress and then under that is is
wedding dress trials so now not
everybody has this level of detail in
their folder d cup holder
representations but that's that's
obviously now let's look at this what
does that say first of all it's a if it
were a project plan you know somebody
from say Microsoft Project would say oh
this is hopelessly confusing I mean I
can't tell what's been done and what
hasn't been done and that's right
although you know a lot of people would
say Microsoft Project is hopelessly
confusing to in the other direction is
its to it
it forces too much on you but here we
have kind of this mixture of things and
she by looking at it and she sort of
talked about how she used it she could
sort of say oh yeah the cake I've
already done that so that's done but you
know in the same look and it says she's
looking at that she's also looking down
here and saying the hotels I've got a
I've got to decide about the hotel or
I've got to decide about you know where
the ceremony is going to be or where the
reception is going to be so it's a
reminder of things to be done and a
record of things that have been done all
sort of mixed together and the there's
it and the nice thing of course is that
the information is all group there she
used it mostly for files but
occasionally she would drag in a pointer
to a web reference to I think she even
Greg drug in some email messages there's
a lot here that I won't go into a lot of
things I sort of say that in group is
sort of you could also imagine this or
their collaborative setting so in this
example she could show this to her
mother and her mother might say well
have you thought about seating
arrangement now the fact that she hasn't
or maybe hasn't is not visible when
she's talking to her mother but it's
quite visible here it's not represented
up there and and those of us who've been
at a traditional wedding know how
important it is that you get that
seating arrangement right or people
won't be speaking to you for four years
after that if they feel like they've
been slighted so anyway there's a lot
here now this was an earlier version so
in a slightly different format it shows
you what it's sort of started that was
like before and after this is the before
at the beginning of the closer to the
beginning of the six month period of
planning so you can see that that
structure didn't order to fall out of
the sky it emerged over time here's
another example of somebody doing a
house remodel so you see things like
house and then insulation plumbing short
platting now I presented this last year
in the spring just about a year ago in
eindhoven Holland and one of the people
there said well you
i'm going to use google on the desktop
and actually let me go back here how
many as Google on the desktop and I
don't really believe that you need
folders anymore and he was really quite
skeptical of all this uh you know
folders i'm going to use google in the
desktop and so I said well okay I'd like
to get in touch with you later and see
how things went and so I did I contacted
contact him by email and ask him how are
things weren't I said well are you ready
to give up your folders and he said well
yes but if I used well if I use folders
it's for task management not for filing
so much and furthermore I'm not deleting
my folders yet because I bundle the
documents together so he's basically
saying some of the things you were
saying so I didn't say I told you so but
i mighta said that so so what well once
so what in the context of this audience
i think is rules on the desktop for my
information for personal information are
different than on the web and once we
truly understand the rules for personal
information we may finally be in the
position to reinvent the desktop we've
heard that over and over again for the
last 20 years almost from the time the
the virtual desktop came out people are
saying we've got to reinvent the desktop
but it's basically I can't tell a huge
difference I don't know if any of you
can well if we understand what people
are trying to do with their information
we might be in a position to do that now
I'm sort of this is the way one of the
ways we sort of look at personal
information management on the kfdm
project and as a mapping and sort of the
effort to establish use and maintain a
mapping between information in need so
we have our finding activities they're
kind of going from need to information I
need to get somebody's phone number
because I want to call them so I go to
an address book or I look on my my cell
phone these days and find it or I need
to remind Bob of a meeting so you know I
sent an email message and then I need to
find his yeah when you reverse the
desktop right here you're not you're
referring to the meant for through which
the the
hang out a top of the desk network on a
screen not be wavy track with a desktop
computer right yeah that's a copy mean
well I'm using the term loosely yeah
it's sort of like there's my area and
might you know the desktop is kind of a
nice way of referring to that but it's
obviously you know we're not we're never
going to get to a new metaphor if we
have to keep on labeling at the desktop
but people you know when you read their
things out there it's like reinventing
the desktop you know we're reinventing
the desktop metaphor so integrate
finding goes from need information and
then there's keeping which goes in the
other direction and and I again I don't
think that's I you know one of the
things we believe is that that hasn't
been getting its fair attention and that
happens all the time I I say here's my
business card well you've got a keeping
decision and what are you going to do
with it maybe you're going to maybe
you're going to going to you know play
tlie look at it and throw it away as
soon as I leave because you don't have
any reason you can possibly imagine for
getting back in touch with me or maybe
you decide yes I want to contact them
again but I have other ways of doing it
or maybe you still use those other ways
but you still keep the card as a
reminder those are all sort of keeping
decisions Howard what are you going to
do is it is the user information useful
an email message do I answer it now or
later that's sort of a keeping decision
if I answer it later how can I be sure
getting back to it again do I put a flag
on it highlighting is kind of a keeping
activity I read an article and I
highlight parts of it because those are
really important and I want to make sure
that when I go back to it later I attend
to those parts that I've highlighted and
then there's what I call meta-level
activities and these have more to do
with the mapping itself and sometimes I
just call them m level because in
English so many of the operant
activities or labels for them start with
M so we have maintaining and organizing
managing privacy and security and the
distribution of information and that the
key thing there is that where you know
if we just wanted privacy we just bottle
up all of our information and and we'd
go off and live in Montana somewhere and
you know never talked to anybody again
but obviously there's the flipside of
protection of our information
this projection of our information and
then through that are our needs and
wants to the world and and we want
certain people to have our medical
information so it's a two-sided coin and
then measuring and evaluating how are
things working how do we know I mean how
do we know whether we're making
effective use of our email and then the
last one is when people say sense-making
but manipulating making sense of and
using the information and then I
jokingly say maÃ±ana because a lot of
these things or things that we never
have to do and they're easy to postpone
and and if you sort of go back to the
original of course meta come it has come
to mean about or above but the original
was after so you can also sort of say
these are after these are afterthoughts
and keeping and finding that they demand
your attention you have a need you have
to do something about it but there
aren't that many events in a typical day
that speak for meta level activities and
so I coat from your article brick then I
like this some of this some of the
comments that relate to that or stuff
goes into the computer doesn't come back
out it just builds up and you talk about
sort of the self auditing effect and we
have the same thing we we would ask
people to show us through their
information and if they didn't try to
tidy up before we arrived if we came
back the next time we would definitely
see evidence that they had reorganize
things and it wasn't just to please us
it was also because they said you know
when I was when we were talking last
time it did make me think about my
information and I decided enough is
enough I really going to get reorganized
about this so you wonder what what was
prompting them to do it if there weren't
an earnest researcher there in their in
their office looking at their
information what would have done it for
them maybe nothing there aren't events
to speak for these activities the way
there are events to speak for finding
activities or keeping activities does
this make sense or is this okay so so
some questions just to think about this
organization matter well maybe not
there's some I don't know if any of you
I along with Jamie kevin and ben
peterson i edited a special issue of
communication the ACM and one of the
articles in there was
search to eliminate personal information
management and then in the article they
they weren't that they said well we're
really talking about organizing
information and I think for a lot of
people organizing information sort of
it's kind of like cleaning up your room
you know remember when you were a kid
and your parents that clean up your room
you can't go out and play I think that
organizing information has about that
level of appeal to people but if you say
what if you say representation well
certainly representation matters there
are a lot of studies that say that
sometimes the differences and the
mappings aren't perfect but sometimes
the differences are 16 to 1 and
performance depending on the
representation of a problem so what's
the difference between representation
and organization so that's something to
think about another thing is this
organizing matter that's different from
organization we might say well the
computer can do that and do I have to do
any of that well you don't ask if you
have a house cleaner or made you don't
ask them to organize you probably don't
trust them to do some of that you do it
yourself but the the other thing that
there is evidence that some level of
manipulation is important we have to get
our hands on it at least figuratively
and so I'm going to give the example I
gave over over lunch there's sort of
back in the 60s they they had cake mixes
that they developed them and they could
be just add water and bacon and in a
market tests homemakers said didn't like
it because it didn't feel like there's
and so they redid it so they had they
took out the egg ingredient so they had
to crack an egg and put it in and that
somehow are there made it there is made
it something that they had done now I
don't think it's quite that trivial I
think there's more that more than just
sort of i think people have to
manipulate their information to some
degree so the question is how much
anybody recognize this it's not that
easy to see but i'm not sure if i if the
resolution we're better and it were
larger i'm not sure you would recognize
it okay no no gases
okay I actually even if you knew I
wouldn't I would say don't say anything
because you give it away what about this
what okay periodic table that's right
it's an early version it's a the first
public public a published version back
in eighteen sixty nine I think or maybe
it's 1896 I can't remember that i think
is 1869 and this was a from his
Mendeleev's field notes and of course we
know today as this now that's a very
powerful representation i think some of
us learn to hate it when we were in
chemistry class but but the interesting
thing about that today is that it's not
only a representation and it's also a
way of organizing the information so and
that's brought through quite clearly if
you go out to the internet now like
they're they're here some pointers to
it's it's it's a way it's an entry point
if you click on one of those elements
you get a whole lot of extra information
about that element in the end you get it
through this representation so the
organization is information in its own
right but it also provides access so
it's both so again we're back to this a
good representation maybe emerges over
time ok well the current focus of the k
FTF project is we're looking at personal
information collections they're
increasingly digital increasingly
important increasingly increasing and
there's also you can sort of say that
there are we define them in a way that
says there are islands a relative calm
and the midst of a sea of personal
information but so you have a lot of
things that are maybe nominally under
your control but there are certain parts
of that that you choose to make yours so
you know you get a whole lot of email
for example or there's a lot that you
don't know where these icons came came
to on your desktop but there but there's
some part that you sort of decide is
yours and you try to make it your so
what is that and and we're sort of add
why do people do that what do they try
to do and and how can we help them do it
better and then we're also focused
related as personal personal project
activity there are a lot of those either
work-related and a non-work related so
plan a summer vacation finish the work
review and these happen over time and
across
us forms of information so that makes
them a nice for the study of pem
personal information management because
it we one of the problems with crude it
a lot of traditional studies is they
tend to sort of focus on one form of
information like email or the web but
all of us when we're doing things we
have to use a lots of different forms of
information so we need units of analysis
that will wilful to fully engage these
multiple forms of information across
multiple tools I'll just give a real
brief history we had we've we've been
around since 2001 NSF funded project and
and we're we are sort of roughly three
different major studies looking at how
people keep information how people are
refined and how people organize
information so one study is kind of
summarized in this we did it's actually
a series of studies a series of
observations we looked at how people
keep web information and we have lots of
different methods over here and we were
continually surprised that the number of
methods people use we expected them to
use bookmarks for example for keeping
web information or favorites but we saw
a lot of other things that people were
doing and we originally were can observe
we were going to just have 10
observations but we ended up with 24
because we kept bouncing new patterns
with every person so email to self email
to others print out save as file paste
URL in a document personal website
search direct entry bookmarks history
some people even wrote URLs on stickies
and put them by their mother computer
and we did a little bit of a functional
analysis to look at why people have this
diversity of methods then it turned out
that each method realized a different
combination of functions that they
valued for example email to self had
high on reminding because it would show
up in your inbox whereas people
frequently complain that bookmarks they
would make them and and forget about
them and and maybe they'd run run across
it later when they were doing a spring
cleaning of their bookmarks or their
favorites and say I wish I
remember that because that would have
been perfect for a project that is no
longer active so this is just a summary
of that one thing here is that even
though we set out to just look at web
information we we ended up having to
look at other forms of information
because a lot of these methods involve a
conversion from one form of information
to another so email you know you paste
the web reference in the email and you
send it as an email message it's no
longer you know it's a URL embedded or
or printing it out it becomes sort of a
paper form of the information and then
we did a really finding studies and I am
I guess one thing we found we were
surprised that we did that basically a
delayed cued recall test and we were
surprised at how good people were
getting back to web information and I
can go into the details later I think we
won't have time but we thought well
ninety-five percent is pretty good even
for stuff that's very infrequently used
and people didn't even rate is that
important and people like to do nothing
methods / favorites and bookmarks but
then we started thinking about it well
95% maybe isn't so good because people
in real life they need to retrieve
oftentimes a set of items not just one
item and it's something for something as
simple as can I somebody invites you to
dinner next Wednesday can you go well
you're not just going to go to your
electronic calendar you're probably also
going to say well let's see when is that
performance I was thinking about going
to maybe you go to the web maybe you
look through email messages with an
agreement that isn't recorded in your
calendar maybe you look at a paper flyer
for something simple like that you are
going to multiple sources and so failure
can result from failing to retrieve just
one of those and so if you have what did
I say yeah if you have to retrieve a set
of five commitments for example a set of
five different items in order to make a
decision the likelihood of success goes
down to seventy-seven percent to
retrieve the whole thing and it could be
even worse than that there's a lot of
psychological research on output
interference and and
that that if you retrieve and partial
list of queueing that sort of says if
you read three part of a set of items it
becomes that much harder to retrieve the
rest of them because the act of
retrieving strengthens the first tube
and the other thing is that our study
did the hard part it reminded people to
look and in real life that's one of the
biggest challenges is remembering to
look in the first place well then we're
under the organization because the
organization itself a folder structure
for example does serve as some of these
it serves to group things together so
that you don't have to go in separate
places it serves as a reminder and so we
said how do people organize and can
people do it now without or what do
people do now without or in spite of
current tool support and we have sort of
a pictures tell a story so well what's
the story here the story here is that
people would really like to order these
folders and there's not much good
support for it now so leading characters
is the way they force the ordering for
how many people do that lots of people
and why do you do it what well but why
do you care about ordering it's a
directing attention would be one of them
or prioritizing so that's one thing
there's another example of that you know
people learn that certain characters are
funny and you'd also see the the other
direction instead of moving things up
people put as easy at the beginning or
something to force it to the bottom of
the list obviously with something like
this it doesn't work so well if you
discover oh actually I want to point 5
in there it doesn't work here's another
one people some people now this is not
true for everybody that some people try
to reuse folder structure is she done
here this is from from a student and he
this is basically a template it has sub
folders for things like assignments and
readings how many people do this okay
three or four people and
what we did and one study we found that
40 plus I think forty two percent of
people did it this in some form right no
they're not necessarily creating a
template like here that they could copy
and paste but they would at least go
back and look at a past folder
organization to get an idea of how they
should quit should order order for this
current project that they were doing so
and that's true of professors its crew
of us if we're planning a trip somewhere
if we're going to one conference we
might look at the folder structure we
did for another conference because a lot
of the things are similar there's you've
gotta do plane reservation hotel
reservation advance registration all of
them here's another one there's a
tension between organizing for current
use and repeated reuse so we have for
example current use this is from a
professor's snapshot of his organization
of things we have images and readings
and then also for course 541 so that
also sort of says that there's some
repetition and structure but beyond that
he also has images over here and that's
that's kind of a that's more of a flat
structure where he's are the same thing
with articles instead of readings he has
that and there the in the articles for
example they're encoded in a particular
way so that they all start with the
first author's name and then the year
and then the first part of the title so
what is he doing there we sort of trying
to organize by properties for things
that are being reused so there's sort of
this notion whether a lot of interesting
things there but one is that we kind of
would like to do both and maybe in the
in the context of the current years the
organization fits more comfortably into
a hierarchy but for for organization for
reuse where you sort of are combining it
with other things sort of like it then
maybe you're more interested in
properties so recipes for example or
articles or photographs well and then we
also learn from looking at what people
do again in your study ricky's you saw
people doing ad-hoc tidying during the
experiment or during the study and we
saw the same thing we had
in one study 14 out of 14 people said as
we asked them to take a take a son sort
of guided tours of the way they
organized their information email
messages and files and even paper they
would say oh this shouldn't be here 14
out of 14 people said oh this really
shouldn't be here and there was a
certain little bit of they also a little
bit of guilt or almost sort of the way
you would feel if you were showing
people through your messy house guess
that it's not by an unexpectedly and so
that's there's there's some information
in there too and we actually in our city
we actually had 30 for 14 actually
insist on interrupting the the interview
so that they could move something out of
the way or deleted I'll just sort of
briefly we've had this project planner
that we've been working on it's part of
a larger prototype may have for called
the universal labeler and it's a very
basic prototype and we but basically the
idea is why don't one of the reasons we
think people don't like Oregon is
organizing stuff is that it really takes
you out of what you're doing with the
information so it's like if you think
about folders or you're sort of your
you're being asked to sort of step out
of what you're doing with the
information so we thought suppose we
supported kind of an outline or rich
text view of your information it's just
an alternative to the to the the file
folder view and the idea would be that
this would just be another view but in
this view you could you could more
actively plan so you could actually
start to use your information and and
you wouldn't be necessarily thinking
about what folder it should go into
you'd be thinking about well I'm doing a
remodel so in the kitchen I need to
think about countertops I need to think
about overall layout and media room so
headings are folders they're basically
the ideal is that they're the same I can
show you a demo after the talk it's
we're not we have parts of it
implemented but not the total seamless
with a file system yet ordering you can
order the
in this view make an order and basically
what we do is we realize this by it is a
view and you're we basically realize the
ordering by putting XML fragments one
per folder distributing them through and
then reassembling them into a coherent
view dragon link so you can drag an
excerpt of a web page or an email
message or a document and either to
represent sort of summarize the
information item or to remind you of
what the information item is about in
context creation we think that's an
especially useful feature now this is
fairly crude so you can't even see that
that's an email message but it is a
quick question about budget for I can't
quite read what that is but what for
countertops I guess and so I mean
there's there are a lot of times when I
think we sent an email message to
somebody and we say do they ever get
back to us or if they did get back to us
what do they say and what we're forced
to do even if we see see it to ourselves
that doesn't necessarily help because
it's just in this fairly more or less
flat list of email or we go to the set
foot sent mail file well here we have it
in context I think say well let's see
now now I'm thinking about countertops
and I remember sending that email did
they ever get back to me now we have it
in context it's a much easier way to
locate it in formal notes and then
basically the idea is one organization
many uses and I guess another ideal here
is that the organization emerges is sort
of a byproduct of your efforts to play
on the project so and that's that's
probably the key thing there is that the
idea is that that you work with your
information and the organization's
emerges as a consequence of doing that I
think I'm going to sort of throw it open
I these are just a summary of the
features a little bit too wordy right
now so our next steps in prototyping are
more views look at more views like a
mind map review for example and we know
that there are commercial companies out
there that can do this a lot better than
we can so our purpose is just
exploratory prototyping see what works
and what doesn't and then auto auto in
place archival we're looking at that a
there's sort of a notion that maybe
items it gets back to this idea this
stuff is around on your desktop and you
never in your folder system and you
never bother to delete it because you
don't have time so maybe that can just
happen as a product of this use it's
still there it's still in place where it
is but it's sort of gradually fades away
and this is not a new idea Malone
proposed something like that a long time
ago pay structure is a way to reuse
structure downloadable alive organizers
see these are all things that we would
like to do is next steps in prototyping
on the field work side we'd like to
better understand how people manage
their personal information collections
and also we would really like to explore
some measures for effectiveness with
respect to three key activities keeping
refining and maintaining and then
understanding whether the lifecycle of
personal information how their things
flow into and out of personal
information collections I think that's
enough for now and can contact me at
this first email or you can go to the
keeping found things found website it's
out of date but it's still there and you
can find it just by searching for
keeping found things found in google any
any questions i know this is a little
bit too much for but i just i always
have this yeah i'm curious you kind of
showed people utilize some things in a
cool at all on
IRA and the other Bolton times yeah but
there was other things in that space
they seemed quite a long way away from
each other tags or hierarchy yeah
radiations between those or or you know
other things that people explore other
ways go oh yeah well I think there are
ya what oh yes repeat the question so
the question was we talked I've talked
about I think we talked about tags
versus hierarchy and are there other
ways of are there other ways of viewing
your information or organizing your
information that are also worth
exploring and and I and the answer is I
yes I think there are and and there are
also lots of different variations on
that if you have properties for example
what about a tabular view of that and I
that we do have something implemented
and a basic way called the table view
for example that basically takes two
levels of your file hierarchy and it
presents it to you as in table form and
if you create a new column it just sort
of forces nu nu sub folders in all of
those yeah
Biogen
hi Shirley
so the question was what about
collapsing what right files and folders
or files and directories so the and of
course that's kind of a variation of the
hyper hyper Dex dream right that there
is not that at every step of the way you
have something that both you can read
for its own right and it also organizes
your access to what follows and and so I
that's that's again not a new idea and
the planners does some of that I mean
there another another way of looking at
the planner is that you go back to
vannevar bush for example and he talked
about whole new trails of information
sort of emerging as a consequence just
of you're using the information well I'm
not sure that we want to just do a
recording of the trails but this is sort
of somewhere in between it says as
you're planning your in your product
your project the some structure there
can be used for other things besides
just representing the plan it can also
be used to organize associated
information yeah and then doing the view
now when I look at things like what
you're a delicious they're very
successful but I have to wonder whether
normal people like my father
really get into all that sort of meta to
be tagging stuff for others to stab
people but do you have any insider data
to show it basically how much time
normal people are going to put into that
sort of optional tagging stuff I don't I
think it's a really good question so the
question is flickr and delicious and are
popular with a certain group of people
but we know that's not representative of
the broader population and you were
mentioning your father could he would he
use that and what what data is there
that relates to that and i would ask you
okay gmail is another example of the tag
the tag approach that presumably you
guys have done your own studies on that
here how people relate to that as an
alternative to folders and so if anybody
if you have any experience on that I'm
going to but but the other thing I'll
you know but I think it's a really
important area and I we've we've never
had the time to do it but there's
there's like a 11 interesting experiment
would be just to take just to have
everything else the same and just work
with two different metaphors one is that
put that there a metaphor which is more
like the file the folder putting
something into a folder and the other is
the the labeler you know label this and
you know you could have the identical
functionality but just invoking a
different metaphor and does that make a
difference I mean people also use
labelers to label things so how do they
how do they relate to those two and what
does that engage in us i think that
would be interesting for somebody to do
maybe it's been done i think i had you
and then think over here and then you
yeah
no I thought whether did you have your
hand up if you had eat you and the head
your head up enough or platform yeah I
got that then it's all I can talk about
restructure and when you jump talk about
you know website instead they honor
please talk about things they organize
yes yeah yes yes that you're absolutely
right so and just to repeat that it
there were at least two different types
in here and one of them had to do with
the structures and the song idea that we
goes back to this organization versus
representation organization is sometimes
talked about is something we we don't
like to have to do and but
representation we would say is really
important so why why cannot bring the
two together so that's sort of one talk
in there and then how then we can talk
about how best to do that is that a
tabular view is that a network view is
that a tree view at a hierarchical view
and then the other one is I think this
was sort of implicit I didn't make that
explicit is one of the major problems
with personal information management
today is information fragmentation that
we have kind of partly maybe as an
accident of application development we
had files and then we have folders
organize the files then we had email and
folders there and so basically all of us
are maintaining multiple organizations
and maybe multiple devices so how did we
bring that information back together and
I call those different forms of
information is that what you're
yeah yeah yeah well a lot of those
well-meaning life organizers they're
meant to consolidate everything into one
place but they in effect give you yet
another organization that you have to
maintain and you still have to maintain
these others and that's a legitimate
complaint of say the project planner too
although it's meant to be more seamless
than that I think well okay you and then
you fast so if you guys not much looking
into archiving media it looks like with
especially with media files like your
photos or your music you have this
implicit idea this is my collection or
my corpus but in many cases you may not
have enough room on any one particular
device to keep to keep all that to keep
all of your photos on on your work
computer and so how do you can you avoid
losing some of that that data evidently
or keeping up-to-date on multiple places
I well no we haven't looked at that and
I so their questionnaire always archival
issues and that's one archival issue for
for those of us who have what's the
what's the what's the what's the
standard capacity hard drive today we're
well it's bigger than act III said I
said well you know a lot of us had 80
gigabyte dries it and I was talking to
people in the CSE department at UW and
one of them store didn't ha i am
terabytes of data so i don't know that
might be an issue for some people and
then but there are other issues of our
an archival a preservation of digital
information over the long run and you
know will will the formats that it's in
still be supported and the durability of
the the the media for restoring it and
those are big issues that we don't deal
with those Kathie Marshall has been
getting interested in that and there was
a very very popular New York Times
article that came out a couple of years
ago by Katie Hefner about the durability
of digital information yeah so a couple
of years ago at tripled up there was a
panel just so this is going with the web
metaphor metaphor rather are a web
domain rather than the personal domain
it was a fun panel with three people
from three different companies taking
different views on the best way to
recognize information on the web it was
oh really search versus hierarchies
taxonomy is immerses that other great
buzz word fascist right mentioned facets
here what does that does that metaphor
translate or scale down to the desktop
oh yeah I think almost any of those have
I mean if you talk about property
property based versus hierarchical for
example that's a that comes up in a lot
of different guises and actually I have
a slide on that but I just prepared
coming soon to a desktop near you or our
issues that we think about in other
contexts like component ization in the
context of software development well a
lot of us now are reusing pieces of
of old presentations or old old talks or
even if we're in a company and we're not
writing we still have to write reports
so there's a issue how do you how do you
divide things into components that could
be reused and you know people would
necessarily talk about about that way
another one is information integration
that gets back to this we've got all
this information fragmented controlled
vocabulary as well I don't know that a
lot of issues that have had that has
sort of come up in industrial strength
of situations may be coming up now for
each of us as we now are talking about
not just gigabytes of information but
maybe terabytes of information and
version control why thought version
control would be mostly for people that
write a lot for example you know you've
seen the document that says final
version you know not to believe that I
mean documents can't speak for
themselves about whether the final
version or not and but I talked to the
the CEO of GTE finance and he said oh
that's a big problem for me because he
does lots of different presentations to
different groups and and a lot of times
the presentations are just slight
modifications of each other but it's
very important that he gets the right
version I mean it wouldn't do to have
one person's client information on the
presentation for another client so he's
facing that as an issue so i think that
sort of speaks to what you're and did I
remember to repeat the question I don't
remember if I did yeah who else had oh
you did okay yeah
back to your earlier lies from going you
know I can put stuff in where it might
go and I was kind of curious about
before your designs around bleach that's
clear what they're not well I have some
thoughts on that so the question was
whether concerning deletion what are we
deleting are we deleting the link or the
actual or a copy or the original and all
of its variations or whatever so that it
it's forever more I have a I have a
position of that but I don't know if
it's the right one and obviously it
wouldn't wouldn't have worked for Martha
Stewart or who I think tried to delete
email messages only to realize it there
were still copies around it could be
subpoenaed but and that's happening with
lots of people but so they thought is
that for most of us it doesn't matter
anymore storages dirt cheap and what
matters is as your attention and so I
would say the appearance is what you
want to delete and so when I do these
tutorials on p.m. and talk about
practical tips one of the ones that
people seem to always relate to pretty
well as it's the the advice move don't
delete because the lesion brings up the
wells something over Berkman cause of
the deletion paradox or i call it the
old magazine effect that you really if
you look at something and you say oh
should I can I could do without this or
not it's like looking at an old magazine
suddenly you say oh but there are so
many articles in there that might be
useful to me at a rainy day and then you
can't do it is so so just move it out of
the way so that it's not continually
competing for your attention and so I
would say you know you could keep the
original but just move the appearance of
it whether that's a copy or a link or
whatever move it away from your visual
field so that you can populate that
filled with other things that are more
more relevant who else had yeah
Alton in tell you stuff put up a chart
and said we're in the human Center
coming era and it showed a person
managing organizing all their devices
information and his thesis was we got to
get out of this era and took out alive
but there's an era where the devices are
kind of servicing use order and where
the devices are one are kind of doing
some of the work for you automatically I
know dark I had a big project called
radar at sea of the USSR I motherly to
kind of help manage your calendar you're
getting all your stuff for you is
computer science we wait long enough
going to solve some of this or should be
real honest credits that are organized
here's my FBI to help health of this
morn
let's see well let me try to paraphrase
and you can tell me if I got that wrong
or right but the I think one question
there is some of the issues I brought up
or will they sort of go away as
computers get better at doing things for
us and and that's sort of related to
this idea of what some people might call
it ubiquitous computing or that the sort
of is there more a part of the fabric of
our everyday life computers in their
support will some of these things be
taken care of for us that we don't so we
don't have to organize and it was that
was there is that a fair expression okay
and i don't i don't believe that it's
never going to happen i don't think that
computers are we going to do our
thinking for us and and i think people
are organized to think better so you
know there are there are parts of that
that they can the computer can take over
like you know notions of auto archiving
for example we don't ever take the time
we don't have the time to move things
out of the way or do whatever so maybe a
conservative start to get smart about
based on our usage patterns about fading
things away and you know they're still
there but but they're not in view but
there are other things where you know
it's what makes us human is to be make
creative new uses of the information and
use it in new ways and so I think that's
always going to be there I think maybe
one last question and then mm I think
that'll be probably should wrap up or
maybe there aren't any of the last
questions yeah so what's the conclusion
give me are we didn't have folders
whatever or if we're one sir that's a
good question yeah so the question is
what's the conclusion AB and I think
that are we going to have folders
forever no I don't think so or I think
they'll what what I think it's the
conclusion is before we talk about
getting rid of folders let's understand
how people use them now and and the ways
that and a lot of the ways that i showed
you we're not anticipated by anybody
when they they design the folder
metaphor it's kind of funny now you know
microsoft talks about their new release
and they talk about virtual folders as
search folders and I think virtual
folders you know that
folders that are there were originally
virtual folders but now we just sort of
think that was as the real folders well
they were virtual when it came out so I
think that you know I think that we need
to start thinking about what are people
trying to do and I think in the course
of doing that we're back to I guess the
conclusion which is sort of what I
raised the rules are there are rules
that people are playing by that that
they're different from what people do on
the web and as we understand what people
really need to do with their information
we get we can really start to change
these metaphors in very profound ways so
that whether we call it a folder or not
it'll be it could be profoundly
different from what we've got today out
there I guess that is a good way to
that's a good point to to save thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
