basically I have given this talk in the
number of different contexts for
different audiences and I just want to
apologize in advance if I'm emphasizing
things that that may I wasn't sure how
to how to pitch it to this group so the
remedy for that is to ask questions and
for the people in the video that's there
you know they don't have that
opportunity so they'll have to email me
or something but basically please if I'm
not covering what you're interested in
hearing about let me know just ask
questions don't raise your hand shout
out because I won't see your hand the
the project that I've been working on
for the last several years at Smith
kettlewell the Smith kettlewell I
research institute is called team app
which stands for tactile maps automated
production and it's the the concept is
very simple it puts together
geographical information such as you
know vectorized map data with embossing
and tactile production technology and
distribution over the internet so if
you've got a means of producing tactile
images such as a braille embosser and
you've got access to the internet and if
there's a site such as mine which is
serving embosser ready tactile files
then you can actually for the first time
have well formatted standardized tactile
street maps of any area that you might
want so long as we've got that area in
our database I'll talk a little bit
later about what the what the data set
is that we're using and what our
limitations are but basically right now
we've got the whole us and we're still
in a very limited very limited rollout
there's there's very few users basically
because it's an experiment it's a
scientific research we don't have the
the wherewithal to do a lot of technical
support so we're just studying how
people use this technology and what
sorts of advantages or features they
might get or want from this so
the re idea here is basically to provide
high-quality tactile street maps to
people blind and visually impaired
people for to facilitate their ability
to to get from place to place so that's
there are a number of different terms
for that I'll use a few of them
wayfinding is one orientation and
mobility is a term that I'll also use a
little later on but basically for blind
people it is a different proposition to
get from one place to another than it is
for a sighted person you need much more
detailed information ahead of time about
what sorts of turns you might take and
what sorts of landmarks you might
encounter and for that reason tactile
maps are a hugely helpful tool for blind
people to get from place to place the
the reason I wanted to come and give
this talk at Google I I borrowed your
logo there I friend said that I might
get in trouble for using your logo but
I'll delete it if that's a problem but
basically the Google mission is is is
has some very interesting crossover with
ours and in fact the words Universal and
access our featured prominently in the
in the Google mission statement so I
think that one of the things that that
I'm thinking about and I hope you will
think about is how Google might consider
either working with us or in the future
producing some sort of some sort of
facility to produce tactile maps that
would be extremely useful to a lot of
different types of blind and visually
impaired people and people who work with
them so who does need the tactile street
maps that's that's you know your your
customers and your your clients are
always one of the most important things
you need to think about obviously I've
already talked about blind people need
tactile maps that's those are the end
users but there are also some ancillary
users such as
um orientation and mobility instructors
these are people whose job it is whose
profession it is to train blind people
on how to get from place to place so
they they teach you how to use a cane or
a dog they teach you the landmarks that
you might look for along a specific
route and in fact they very frequently
use tactile maps but in these situations
until now orientation mobility
instructors have had to create their own
maps by hand it's a very arduous process
and then of course the other group of
people that might want to use tactile
maps are teachers of visually impaired
kids to teach young kids how to to teach
them to develop map skills and tactile
exploration which have a whole lot of
crossover benefits in terms of being
able to read diagrams related to
mathematics and science just it's a it's
a synergistic proposition to be able to
have these tactile maps and to educate
kids and tactile maps early on the the
idea of tactile maps basically
facilitates a bunch of different types
of learning being able to map a two
dimensional space on a piece of paper to
a real world space promotes a lot of
different skills related to cognitive
map development the in the classroom of
course there are a bunch of I'm sorry
not not in the classroom but in the
orientation mobility independent travel
they're a bunch of advantages to tactile
maps you can learn about how streets
connect with one another you can learn
about how they how they what the
intersections look like and that's going
to facilitate the way the choices you
make in very dangerous situations like
Street crossings for example if you know
that there's an intersection with a
bizarre or unusual shape you have a much
better chance of navigating your way
across that intersection if you know
what the shape actually is or conversely
you can choose an intersection that
isn't so funky then of course the the
educational aspects of tactile maps my
project focuses on street maps but of
course the technology is broadly
applicable to a lot of different map
types so it would facilitate blind and
visually impaired students who want to
study issues like demography or natural
resources or or politics you know
political science that type of thing
well as you know color doesn't we would
have to remap that that particular
parameter but no and besides it's too
depressing so hmm there's a chicken and
egg problem here I referred to it
already basically the problem is that
production of quality tactile maps oops
production quality tactile maps is very
difficult therefore there aren't the
teaching materials available for
teachers to teach blind kids how to read
maps therefore blind and visually
impaired kids when they grow up into
adults don't know how to use maps or
have any experience with them and that
leads to the original problem which is a
basic lack of lack of availability no
demand no supply it's a very simple
problem but it's it's it's a vicious one
in our case because they would be
extremely beneficial so that's one of
the things we're trying to address so
just to make it to make it it really
explicit about why tactile maps are
difficult to produce then it's not as
simple as taking a print map and say
okay I'm going to make a filha Belov
this print map and many of the tactile
maps that you'll see in the in the world
maybe in public places or or otherwise
are exactly that they're there just feel
about print maps fillable print maps
make some of the most useless Maps or
tactile maps around and also serve as
really bad advertising for tactile maps
in the blind community because it makes
people think oh that's not going to work
for me so here are the reasons why it
doesn't work
um basically there's Braille as i was
talking to mark about this morning
Braille doesn't scale it comes in one
font size or maybe two and is takes up
an enormous amount of space relative to
two prints so the standard Braille an
eight and a half by eleven page might
hold a hundred braille words okay that's
that makes labeling and annotation of
tactile maps and diagrams really
difficult so you almost always have to
abbreviate and then create a legend or
key that's associated with the
abbreviations Braille is not doesn't
come in a lot of different fonts or
colors or shadings Braille is
essentially black and white and most of
the production methods Braille embossers
that produce tactile diagrams are
capable of producing a dot or not a dot
and that's analogous to black and white
so you don't have all of the color
coding options that you have in print
maps so you need to be very very careful
about how you how you code your
information on a tactile map that
doesn't use color or rich texture and
finally you don't have the opportunity
in Braille or in the tactile modality of
if if there's a piece of the map that
you want to see better you can't take a
closer look there is no zooming in the
world in the tactile domain what you
feel is what you get and that makes it a
very difficult proposition to create a
detailed tactile map so we're fighting
all of these sort of in creating a
tactile map you're trying to balance
these various requirements and there are
more but I'm not going to go into
excruciating detail but suffice it to
say that creating a tactile map requires
skills that are different from creating
print maps and not everybody has them so
that is part of what contributes to the
the limited availability production by
hand of tactile maps which is how it's
been done until now is a very slow and
arduous process it's more art than than
anything else and basically what you
have to do is you have to draw on the
back of a piece of paper with something
like a tracing wheel which is like a
gear it makes dots on the reverse side
and then when you want to feel the map
you actually have to turn it over and
feel the map which makes it a very for
doing any kind of Corrections or or
additions or changes is a very very slow
and painful process and has generally
been done by volunteer transcriber xand
other other magnanimous people who
donated their time but there have been
very few professional map creators
because the the the cost of the time is
actually if you really build for your
time creating a tactile map it would be
prohibitive and nobody would be able to
afford it so another another factor
involved in the dearth of tactile maps
so there's another type of map that I
want to talk about also which has been
with the sort of increasing availability
of computers and touch screens coming
around and that's audio tactile maps and
basically this technology involves a
tactile overlay on a touch-sensitive
surface the tactile overlay is created
by some sort of embossing or engraving
tool and then you place it on the
touch-sensitive surface hooked to a
computer the computer somehow knows what
the overlay is showing and has regions
mapped to those map features so when you
touch a spot on the tactile overlay the
computer is able to provide auditory
feedback in the form of either recorded
sound or synthetic speech about the
object that you're touching and you can
really richly layer information in this
way because basically once with this
technology the requirement for labeling
is much reduced so you can offload all
of your labeling in
nation into the auditory channel and
that that makes that gives you the
ability to make much clearer more
concise maps without a lot of text
clutter which really impacts readability
of the maps the the skills required for
audio tactile maps is obviously you need
to have some programming skills to
create these so it doesn't just come
from you know again we run into a
situation where you need skilled labor
to make a map and then you need some
other form of skilled labor in the form
of the production you have all of the
same problems with the original paper
only tactile maps or you're doing
collage or you're doing engraving which
again requires special skills so so
basically there's a long way of saying
ain't no tactile maps available unless
you go to a method like we're doing
which is tactile maps automated
production which basically it would be
with the automation involved in the the
algorithms that we've that we've that
we're using completely eliminates the
need for a skilled map producer and if
you've got the the internet and a
production method like a Braille
embosser which many people do you
actually can just download and print out
or emboss out a high-quality tactile map
of any street network in the US which is
completely as simple as it sounds here
at Google which you know you do maps all
the time it's it's a completely
revolutionary technology for us just by
putting some simple off-the-shelf things
together so the the team app now I'm
going to get for those of you who've
been sort of rolling your eyes waiting
for the technical stuff I'll start to
talk a little bit about that stuff the
the user interface model works like this
the first thing that happens is a user
request on the the website so the the
user connects to our website and
requests a map the the either by an
address entering an address or an
intersection that they want the map to
be centered on the the engine the the
the the team App Engine then takes the
the map data that it's got on the server
and the location being requested and
processes that along with a bunch of
user specific parameters like for
example what kind of Braille embosser do
they have what size paper are they going
to use do they use what type of Braille
do they do they like to read and what
scale is the map going to be a bunch of
other parameters and turns out a tactile
map file so that file can either be
downloaded or sent to a professional
service for embossing so that it would
then be snail mailed to the user and
finally either by embossing or by by
snail mail the user finally gets the map
into his or her hands and is able to is
able to get information about the street
network that was never before available
so the the the technology that we're
using underneath is is the the map data
is from the Census Bureau it's the tiger
line data from which most commercial GIS
data sets are built but it's you know
some people sneer at it some people
don't sneer at it but the fact is that
it's free so hey it comes at a good
price we use a MATLAB compiled MATLAB to
do the the geocoding and the map
production that's because it's it's easy
to rapid prototype in in MATLAB they've
got a good maps toolbox that that can be
used and but ultimately this is
something we want to move away from
doing things in C++ or Python or
something like that the user interface
is programmed in PHP and HTML and
and that's what does a lot of the
website and also the the telephone
interface that we're working on using
voice XML and PHP and for keeping track
of user preferences and map history
we're using MySQL to to be able to
provide the user with you know so the
user can specify their preferences once
and be able to recall them back and
stuff like that so we also support a
bunch of different file formats because
the idea is to provide printer ready
files and so there's a standard set of
there's a specific file type for most
older Braille embossers which is called
BRG that supports a bunch of different
embossers then there's some other ones
there's PRN which is support some of the
more modern high resolution tiger
printers tying the word tied the code
word Tiger is used too much so anyway
these their printers called Tigers that
have nothing to do with the data set and
nothing to do with the Mac the apple
screen reader and then we also are now
more and more producing SVG scalable
vector graphics which has some
advantages that I'll talk about the want
to mention a little bit about tactile
hard copy and Braille embossing one of
the neat things about Braille embossers
is that they by and large are workhorses
the way the way the mechanically work is
like a heavy-duty dot matrix printer but
instead of inking dots on a page they
poke holes in it and the holes on the
reverse side turn out to be dots so it's
the same technology for embossing
braille as it is for doing tactile
graphics the beauty of a braille
embosser versus a dot matrix printers
that or some other kind of print printer
is that there's no there's no toner so
even 20 years later if you've kept if
you've kept the thing in decent working
order
it still works and this leads to a lot
of different embossers you know there's
there's a huge embosser fleet out there
that aren't necessarily modern but they
still work and so there's only an
increasing number of embossers available
to the blind and visually impaired
community they tend to more and more
individuals have them but in fact
institutions like libraries and schools
and and service organizations for blind
folks tend to have Braille embossers and
it's it's for those of course you don't
have Braille embossers as I mentioned
earlier we would like to ultimately
partner with professional Braille
production facilities to be able to
professionally produce these tactile
maps and snail mail them to the the user
so this is what I'm now showing a visual
version of that of a team app I'm also
gonna I think let me let me just hand
out some of these tactile maps that I
brought with me to my enormous audience
here is there somebody that wouldn't
mind handing these out okay so there's a
couple different maps here and there
they're labeled the stapled ones have
Braille keys associated with them that
decided people don't need the Braille
the stapled ones and there are two
different versions of this map that I'm
handing out one version is a map that I
made of this area the Google the
Googleplex but of course it doesn't show
any of the streets internal to the
campus it just shows where the the
outside streets are and this is a
suburban area where the streets are
fairly wide apart I used a scale of 1
inch equals 500 feet which is a little
bit loose for an environment like this
and one of the one of the things that
we're working on is an automatic scaling
algorithm that will provide users
automatically with an appropriate scale
for the the geography the other map that
I'm handing out is a map of your new
york city office ninth Street or ninth
avenue and that is a much tighter grid
in midtown Manhattan that that provides
you with a better the same scale one
inch equals 500 feet but a better view
of how a pedestrian because I don't
think that a pedestrian would use the
map that I made here of the Googleplex
other than to just say oh I am walking
anywhere you know I'll stay here and
have lunch in the cafeteria but but in
New York City you can see that that
street network is much more complicated
and interesting and would be much more
usable and helpful for visually impaired
pedestrian I'm going to point out a
couple of features of these these maps
their standard on all of the maps that
we produce at the upper right hand
corner you'll see a little Braille
Braille text if you will and underneath
that a short line that's about an inch
long that's the scale so above that line
it says 500 feet or if it were at a
different scale it would say a different
thing or if it were in metric it would
say you know whatever at the center of
both of these maps is a small circle a
loop that shows where the address is
that was requested and it shows which
side of the street it's on and
approximately where on the block it
might be that's done with interpolation
of the address range so also at the top
of the map is a Braille legend that says
the requested location so 1600 I gave
away all my map 1600 amphitheatre drive
or Parkway or something and then the
other one is anyway the location in New
York okay Oh
great so so basically these these
features are standard on every tactile
map that's produced sorry it's a 76
ninth avenue in new york city so one of
the big problems for Braille tactile
users of tactile maps is that every
since since making maps by hand tactile
maps my hand is more of an art than a
science every cartographer would use
different a different scheme a different
set of labeling methods a different
shapes different anyway you get the idea
and so each blind user when introduced
to a new tactile map made by a different
cartographer would need to first
understand what the what the what the
map format is and what the what the
information means so there's there's
this learning curve that's introduced at
the beginning of every handmade tactile
map that really slows down the process
and makes you say I forget it just tell
me where I'm trying to go whereas with T
map since the maps are standard the
first time you learn the the features
and the the organization of the map then
every other map is is then that much
easier for you to understand so that's
that's a really key feature is
standardization of these of these maps
another thing that I just want to point
out is that all of the Braille labels
are oriented at the ends of the streets
around the edges of the map around the
parameter there are no Braille labels
interior to the map itself that's for a
couple of different reasons one is that
in a tactile map your enemy is clutter
the more clutter there is the harder it
is to read the map and the less useful
the map actually is so
text labels interior to a map I believe
lead to a lot of clutter and confusion
because then you need to worry about
which features this label referring to
and is it covering up other features of
interest that's eliminated by putting
the the labels at the edge of the map of
course there are some streets that don't
hit the edge of the map so they don't
get a label this is also a motivation to
to use audio tactile maps because on an
audio tactile map every feature gets
labeled whether it's interior or
exterior another reason to leave the
braille only exterior to the map is that
many Brandlin bosses can do Braille dots
of only one height this the embosser
that i used here actually can do
multiple dot Heights so it's easy to
distinguish the graphical features from
the text text features on this map but
that's only because the the graphics
dots are lower in elevation from the
page then the Braille dots on a braille
embosser that doesn't have that feature
you need to keep your Braille well
separated from your tactile graphics
features in order to make sure that your
user knows that these are text objects
not graphics objects so another thing
about the maps by the way is that North
is always at the top this leads to
Street grids that are often at some
angle to the page itself but the
feedback we've gotten indicates that
actually that's more useful than
problematic because it actually it
actually gives you an idea of where true
north really is which is something
ordinal directions or something that
blind and visually impaired people use a
good deal more than most sighted people
because they do a lot more talking about
which way they're going to people who
might be giving them directions before I
move on any questions about the map
organization
ok so the audio tactile maps that we've
been working on use use SVG as their
file format and that's that's really a
great thing because basically what it
allows us to do is embed in the scalable
vector graphics all sorts of labeling
and annotation information so each
Street segment in addition to being
grouped with all of its other street
segments has a text label so it's got a
name and then it's also got embedded
into the description field a number of
different pieces of information
including what the address ranges are on
which sides of the street how many lanes
of traffic there are whether there's a
median or not and ultimately we can
embed all sorts of other information
like which side of the street might be
better for a blind pedestrian to walk on
than another or whether you know where
crosswalks are other other sorts of
information there so that's easily
embedded into SVG and in addition the we
can transmit a single file to the to the
user the the audio tactile software that
the user has on their machine which I'll
talk a little bit more about in a minute
it will be in charge of taking the SVG
and rendering it into a tactile version
using a braille embosser and then also
using that same file to to do the
corresponding digital information for
for what the user might might hear when
touching specific features and you can
also link SVG to audio files and stuff
like that so that's that's a great it's
a great format for us and robin and i
have talked a little bit about kml and
other formats that that really have
potential for this as well but SVG is
what we've been using at this point so
the
this is an example this is an image of
one of the the audio tactile systems
that we've been working with the most
it's called the talking tactile tablet
or the TTT from a group called touch
graphics inc they until now I've been
producing very nice maps of the world
and and and other educational materials
based on audio tactile technology but
now we're partnering with them to
produce talking team apps and they'll
simply download an SVG file as I said
and print it out using their software
and then the user can touch the map
anywhere and hear what they're touching
there are some technical aspects to this
that I don't want to gloss over 11 is
that when you put a let's say you've
you've downloaded 17 different tactile
maps and printed them out now you've got
17 pieces of paper and you want to put
map number 3 back on the tactile tablet
how does the computer know which map
you've got on there so what they what
they've done is to put a essentially a
barcode at the top of the of the page
where you touch three spots along a
twenty a bar that has twenty
possibilities it's a fairly fairly big
namespace and the computer then can
identify based on the locations of the
the three spots on the barcode which map
you're going to be working with and can
automatically load the digital file
associated with that also on each of the
the TTT overlays are some UI features
one for example is this cursor cross and
a and a select button in the middle
these all the UI features are off to the
right hand off to the right from the the
map workspace so the the cursor cross
can be used for things like scrolling
through a list of streets that are on
the map or
possibly scrolling through other an
alphabetical an alphabetical or
geographical list of other features that
might be included on the map and then
when you find the one you want you can
select it so that can be used for then
it can guide your finger for example to
that location by telling you left down
right and then it tells you when you got
to the the location the numerical keypad
is just it's just a tactile drawing of a
numerical keypad and that can also be
used for entering data are making menu
selections you for example could enter
an address using this keypad and then
your finger could be guided to a
specific address in the same way and
then there's there's an escape key at
the top which you use for saying okay
I'm done here I'm going to load a
different map or work with a different
type of type of tactile overlay so a
couple of other features available in
the this prototype of the talking
talking team app is you can do multiple
taps to get through information so for
example the first tap tells you the
street name the second tap might tell
you might spell the street name the
third tap might tell you what the
address range is on that block and you
can keep tapping until you you know
cycle through all of the information so
that's a very nice way of layering
information on it on a map without
without a lot of complex user interface
elements or going through menus or
whatever you can also do distance
calculations you touch along a number
you touch way points along a route and
it adds up the the route segments as I
pointed out earlier you can use the the
cursors to scroll through a list of
features and have your finger guided to
a position and that can be done for
streets or points of interest you can
also have your finger guided to an
intersection just by selecting Street
one from a list and then street two from
a list of streets that intersect with
that first Street so that's we're hoping
to do a lot more with that so if there's
any stuff that I haven't covered here or
stuff that you want to know more about
you can go to my the website which is
wowsa Iorg / TM ap or of course you can
email me at TM ap at sk i dot org and
i'll elaborate on all of the things that
i glossed over today so i have a bunch
of collaborators at smith kettlewell and
touch graphics john Braben debbie gildan
steve landau bill Gary and Tom foul and
many others our work has also been
funded through the Department of
Education the National Institute on
disability and rehabilitation research
and we're certainly hoping to do to do a
lot more with this this is at a very
early stage so we're hoping that this
talk today can produce some ideas on
your side and ideas on my side maybe and
we'll move forward in in some fashion
hopefully to make this a real a real
product that can be used by blind people
who really need it rather than just a
cool demonstration that I'm doing as a
research project so I just want to say
thank you and of course if you want to
get in touch with me there's my email
address and that's it any questions
yes
no questions I was totally clear so one
