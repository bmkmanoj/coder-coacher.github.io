chell paw and I'm the one who's been
spanning pretty much all email lists at
Google so way excited to have shefali
here today she's a president of cry
America and she's been with cry over 17
years and spent spent 12 that in India
and she was a part of like finding cry
America so be very lucky to have her
here she's from Boston so hopefully my
goal is to get inspiration out of her
and hopefully have some more Googlers
because as far as i know this is telling
that I'm probably the only googler who's
closely involved with cry and so
hopefully we'll get a group together
here and meet regularly and build some
momentum and making a difference I just
want to spend like a minute talking
about what got me here I have always
wanted to volunteer and I think all of
us at the back of our mind somewhere
were like oh I want to volunteer I want
to make a dino do something and give
back to the society we grew up in and we
are in but something that kind of just
moved me recently was somebody was just
casually asking me what's the best gift
your parents gave you and I thought
about it thought about it for two days
and then I you know when I look back at
everything that God has given me today
and I think we're all fortunate to be
have the kind of education and
employment that we do was education
that's what God is here so I started to
believe in the cause and then I try to
look at organizations in the bay area
that I can support and cry was want to
fit so I am and you volunteer but I'm
just excited about like the opportunity
that exists and then I read some
heartbreaking statistics about India so
you'll be shocked to know that less than
twenty percent of Indian children have
access to secondary education that's
just heartbreaking that they don't even
have the opportunity to go to school and
less than fifty percent of them between
6 and 14 actually go to any kind of
school and then you see the girl child
every one out of six doesn't live to see
her fifteenth year and you know they're
like 17 million child of workers in
India and about 5 million sex workers so
it's all very heartbreaking i mean it's
endless statistics and there's without a
doubt a reason to help and hopefully
shefali will talk more about how we can
help the difference we can make how cry
is unique and you know how they actually
have people in the field doing a lot
the work to make sure projects get
executed you know schools get built etc
so again thanks for coming and i'll have
shefali do the talking
hi everybody it's really wonderful to be
here today thanks Lord Silva for
inviting us and for everybody for coming
and for others who may be watching us
through the computers too we are here
today to share with you like shall pass
at the cry story about some facts about
India and we also have with us a project
partner who works directly in the field
from Jharkhand with us couple of
volunteers and employees so and we'd be
happy to take a whole set of questions
or any questions that you may have
so the India that most of us know is a
you know large diverse complex we have
60 years of independence we are the
world's largest democracy and it is you
know where we have different languages
we are home to all religions we have
nearly seventy percent of the population
living in rural areas and what we know
of what most of us hear about in here
today is the fact that we are doing so
well and all of us are very proud of how
well India is doing on the economic
front in terms of its unprecedented
economic success our GDP crew is growing
at nine percent and many many Indians
are feeling this success and
experiencing the success today in terms
of corporates even in terms of
employment in terms of salaries
especially the one-third of society the
top one-third of American society I'm
Indian however in this context if you're
not part of the top one-third or the
middle one-third and you are the one
third that is at the bottom which is not
able to afford you know good quality
education health and not part of the
growing sectors not part of the upper
classes and castes then you are not
really experiencing the success that the
rest of India is experiencing in terms
of the fact that you don't have you know
proper education you don't have access
to quality care health care even in
terms of economics jobs Economic
Security Social Security and your
voiceless in in the in terms of you know
making a difference if and from that
section of society children of course
more impacted and their EE impacted
because their voices are not heard at
all
so some statistics like Shilpa was
talking about fifty percent even though
India's GDP is growing at time %
corporates are doing well business is
booming you know we have some of the
best of the schools teachers educators
and on the other side you see that
India's children all of india's children
are not doing that well fifty percent of
India's children are not even school
today many many schools today don't have
teachers many schools don't even have
blackboards and in many many areas
schools may not even exist today india
is home to the largest number of working
children in terms of you know the
justice statistics of the number of
children keep wearing but even in terms
of 17 million so you see that all the
numbers in the millions 17 million
children not working I mean sure our
children working and in inner hazardous
conditions which are detrimental to
their well-being and deny childhoods
even in terms of health millions of
children die due to preventable causes
there's lots of anemia I mean lots of
anemic children underweight children
large numbers of women are children who
are not immunized forty-six percent of
children get married before they turn 18
and gender discrimination is also quite
I think one of the major problems that
that we face if you go back to the
Indian Constitution which was in
nineteen fifty actually it recognizes
the fundamental rights of children and
if you see some of the articles that are
shown here for example article 21 it
says that all children should have free
and compulsory education if you look at
article 24 that two talks about
prohibition of employment of children
you know if you look at article 23
that's also about prohibition of forced
labor article 15 talks about prohibition
of discrimination on grounds of caste
race sex and article 17 week reaffirms
that you don't a cast should not be an
issue you know Anna's or should be
totally banned
in 1992 India was also a signatory to
the united nations convention on the
rights of children which is a important
international convention which sets the
standards international standards of
what are the rights of children and here
the rights of children essentially are
divided into four rights the right to
development the right to survival the
right to protection and the right to
participation the right to development
is mainly about education recreation of
four children the right to protection is
about protection from abuse exploitation
neglect the right to survival is about
health nutrition nationality and the
right to participation is including
children in this process of change so
India up in this population at one point
12 billion today nearly 15 million 16
million babies added every year of which
the number of children is 400 million
and for millions of underprivileged
children their fate is still determined
at birth and there are many reasons in
terms of why these children are or
getting left behind because there are
there are root causes of caste gender
religion class etcetera which deny
children their basic rights and
opportunities to a childhood and
millions of these children are now
trapped in a kind of imbalance even
though on one side we're seeing this
unprecedented economic growth on the
other side wasting millions of children
are trapped in this imbalance that is
excluding marginalizing and you know
exploiting their voices are still not
being hurt
so cry actually I started 30 years ago
and through these 30 years there are
certain things that cry has learnt that
are absolutely key in making the impact
on the ground and some of these is what
we are kind of calling our child rights
approach today which is that we are
learning that if we have to make this
lasting change and you know I'd really
impact the lives of children and make a
difference then they have to be some key
elements in this approach and these key
elements include a rights-based approach
which is more from a social justice and
human rights point of view in terms of
rights versus charity point of view a
holistic approach that you can't only
look at education or only look at health
the only look at child labour you need
to look at children's issues in totality
and look at children in totality is
besides which when you are working with
children in a particular community then
you also need to address some of the
larger issues of the community like
issues of livelihood issue of water
issue of land so that you're looking at
issues holistically and not in a
sectoral manner or in a piecemeal manner
going beyond which if even if you put
all this in place and do not look at the
deeper biases that are disabling
disabling this process of change which
are issues of gender issues of caste
then the kind of change that you you get
is somewhere superficial and not really
not really changing the lives of people
there for any model that is looking at
making a lasting or impactful change in
our communities of a community or in the
lives of children need to look at all
this in totality ultimately also looking
at changing mindsets and the way we see
the way we see our children and the way
we look at the whole process of change
more a most key also is the fact that
the approach cannot only be top-down
wave you know another set of people have
determined an agenda which is going to
work for a different set of people the
unity which is looking at the change has
to be very actively engaged in this
process of change so more of a bottom-up
type of an approach and in terms of
involving children themselves because
ultimately we are talking on making a
change in the lives of children so
including them too besides the work that
we do at the micro level they also needs
to be some kind of macro there has to be
a macro environment where we do have
policies legislations programs budgetary
allocations that also enable and
facilitate this kind of change that we
are talking about and for that we will
need far greater political will to make
that happen for example today the
budgetary allocation for India in the
area of education is a four percent now
that needs to be moved at least to eight
percent for example today the budgetary
allocation of India on public health is
one percent of the gdp that needs to be
moved at least a four percent of the gdp
so while we have to do a lot of work at
the micro level with the communities at
the macro level also we need to be
looking at policies and budgetary
allocations etc so that they work in
tandem and ultimately the
underprivileged underprivileged
communities alone you know will will be
able to make an impact up to a point we
the others the rest of civil society the
people who have the voices and the power
also need to get engaged in this process
you know so larger civil society will
also need to get involved in terms of
seeing what they can do in terms of
individuals businesses media etc to make
sure that some of these issues that we
are talking about really gain the kind
of prominence and importance and you
know we can because of that we can put
children ahead because in a sense is the
right thing to do
in this model like I said we have to
look at a multi-tiered approach in terms
of from the micro situation or working
with children in terms of what the
immediate needs are like education and
health actively engaging communities in
this process of change and then also
local government governance or village
level leadership groups etcetera to
ensure that those leadership groups
don't represent only one part of the
community or the other but these locals
have self governance groups also have
representation of all voices of that
village and community then working with
the local government bodies also to make
sure that you know whatever services
need to be provided are there and all
the projects that you're working with
all the communities that are working on
the ground kind of enable a process
whereby they get to know each other and
they share and they learn experiences
from these each other and then
collectively it we can you know push for
better policies and legislations and
things not not just the projects that
are working with an underprivileged
communities but even along with larger
civil society so in a sense each one of
us has a key role to play here so what
does cry America do so all that I've
spoken about to now we try and our
approach includes all of that and
specifically we work with the projects I
think India has supported over 500
organizations crime America supported
about 30 projects and will be you'll be
listening to one of the speakers also
will be talking to dr. neeraj about sake
project from shark on but and what is
our role our role with projects is
really that of a grant maker but more
than a grant maker is really of a
capacity builder or let's say a venture
capitalist who is actually looking at
enabling or partnering organizations to
make this you know change possible and
to make this change impactful and to
make this change you know effective
so there's a lot of capacity building
the skill building this perspective
building thus trainings there is
information support there is a
networking support and guidance and its
really of working together with the
project partners so as our names you can
see our name I write up their child
rights and you in fact we changed our
name last year we were child relief in
you and across we've changed our name to
child rights and you to reaffirm our
commitment to the child rights approach
and as the name says essentially there
are children in need that we need to
support and we don't actually have any
of we don't have any projects of our own
they're independent organizations that
are working there with the community who
we are calling development partners or
project partners and on the other side
we also have you know it work with we
have a civic engagement programs we work
with volunteers we have donor programs
we have media programs and we are
appealing all the time to the public to
get involved and to be put to become
part of this process because ultimately
all everybody will have to get together
to make children a priority so and and
we believe that injustice is for
children exists all over the world you
know in Africa in America in Brazil in
India it's just that our expertise cries
expertise lies with the cause of Indian
children and then we have a model that
we can promote but we stand for I mean
is we believe that injustice is a def
for children across the world and as as
society as a whole we need to see how
well then just wherever in justices
exists for children we need to do
something and we need to put children
ahead
so we just like to share with you a
little bit of the the impact that we've
had so we've supported in the last five
years so cry Americans just existed
since 2003 so that's three four five six
seven just last five years we've been
able to support with the help of all our
volunteers and donors we've been able to
support 30 projects and as you can see
here you'll see some of the data that's
come in terms of the impact that we've
been able to make through the support to
30 projects you'll see in the area of
education for example now of the 1211
1211 villages that we've been able to
support in that 296 villages today have
hundred percent enrollment of children
in schools you will also see that 160 in
villages where there were no schools 160
schools have now been activated on our
functioning and communities are deeply
engaged in this process of education for
their children and we have about 930
such community-based groups across the
projects that are actually addressing
issues of education for their children
in the area of protection you will see
that we have about 318 villages that are
now child labour free that number macys
miss Ames seem small but actually it's
required a lot a lot of work and a lot
of effort to now ensure that 318
villages do not have child labor their
child labour free and this would not
have been possible unless the
communities were deeply engaged in the
process
here's an example of a project Child
Welfare Society this child welfare
society is a project that we be we are
supporting it works among tribal
communities in coralville district in
uttar pradesh and it started as a
response to child labor because to child
labor especially in the carpet industry
because the carpet industry are used to
employ a lot of children and their
childhoods were really delight not only
was that the case the tribal children
there were hardly any tribal children in
schools in 1994 child labor was rampant
in the carpet industry they were hardly
any education or health facilities in
those villages at that time there was no
immunization nor birth registrations and
lot of physical disorders of children at
that time and there was a lot of
oppression of tribal communities by
landlords and carpet loom owners now if
you look at it over all these years
that's also quite a few years if you
know so nearly 13 years of work they
have now got through this process of
community engagement and working with
the local government and they have got
involving children they have got 17
primary schools there today they've got
three middle schools in those villages
today and they even I will have a high
school there which is which is really
great and in 20 villages there is one
hundred percent enrollment of children
in schools you'll see also in sixteen
villages there is no dropout rate
because even if children get enrolled in
schools many times they drop out and
many many children keep dropping out so
there's a process by which children have
to be brought into schools and then
retain in schools also in twenty eight
villages today there is no child working
in the carpet looms anymore and that
that is really that is radio of
important achievement because that's a
large number of villages and it's taken
this long but now those communities have
said that our children will not work in
the in the carpet industry and those
children are going to school today where
there were no health facilities
they're there are health centers there
today and the children were working
essentially were taking up also or
spaces which should have gone to adults
for adult work so the child work was
replaced by other adult work and the
wages that were very very low and
exploitative of children the community
got together and said no we would we
need minimum wages and today there is
minimum wages for the adults in those
areas besides which of course the
immunization as they're both residual
registrations are happening and the
tribals have got together and they have
got each 815 acres of land where they're
doing collective farming together so not
only education and health but they're
also looking at other larger issues of
livelihood they looking at land and they
are also looking at becoming part of
leadership groups of local villages etc
so how did this change happen it was
really that process of getting the
communities aware and engaged you know
they were village education collectives
they were health collectives there were
farmers collectives there were education
programs children's groups there was
working with the government to get all
the education and health programs there
there was a lot of community taking on
and challenging discrimination and
oppression by landowners discrimination
and oppression by Lou Mona's and and
they also became part of larger networks
so that you know they could spread their
message and learn from other groups that
were also working on similar issues in
terms of here's some more impact for you
in terms of the right to survival you
can see the whole set of public health
centers have now been activated 85 of
them regular health check-ups are now
being held for thousands of her children
and pregnant women children are being
immunized health care is a much better
today and even in terms of right to
participation we have over three hundred
and twenty eight groups of children
themselves across the projects that are
getting involved so like I said over the
last five years primerica he supported
30 project
impacted the lives of over 150 6,000
children across 1211 the rural-urban
tribal slums religious communities
here's another story of Mahan seva
sansthan which works in a very remote
ajihad all-district in Rajasthan and
here too you see there were large none
of them a large numbers of child
marriage great poverty the schools that
existed in and work there were large
dropout rates large numbers of working
children very low immunization and
health situation today after Mohanty
vasantha has been working and working
with the communities etcetera you see
that there are regular health check-ups
now for children even in terms of the
mothers and there's you know awareness
camps are being held medical support is
their birth registration is there an
infant mortality has significantly
reduced women are now aware about health
issues
so the children's groups that we spoke
about how are they getting involved here
is an example in boro boro lee village
of the same project Mahan save our sons
that you can see the hell's its
children's group over there and there's
Mahendra Singh right in the middle of
the picture he is the leader of that
group and this particular group in
bitterly village they have you know
taken up the issue of a water pump for
their village which they got they have
taken up issues of absence of teachers
from schools they've taken up issues of
malnutrition and child labor &amp;amp; mahindra
Singh is the head of that children's
group and he says essentially every
village should have a children's group
and when I you know and he says I dream
that when I grow up that I will become
the leader of my village and that I will
you know provide these facilities for my
community so in terms of cry India's
achievements like I said three decades
India's probably a cries India's premier
child rights NGO has supported over 500
grassroots organizations impacted the
lives of over 1.5 million children and
developed a very successful local
indigenous flag of philanthropy has a
donor base of over 100,000 individuals
ten thousand businesses and has also
been very proactive in terms of looking
at a legislation that should be changed
etc and more importantly I think because
of this role that cry has between
working with projects and the media and
privileged individuals and businesses
it's a kind of you know it's a unique
position to have in terms of being able
to talk to and influence only different
types of communities and part of civil
society to get engaged in this process
and I think that a today cry is a very
credible independent secular
cross-sectoral voice of India's children
cry America we started like I said in
2003 we've been here for five years
we've impacted the lives of 156,000
children we have about 500 volunteers
across 20 cities that are involved we
have a base of about 8,000 owners today
we we run we have quite a few events
that are becoming quite popular we have
one coming up in the Bay Area which item
will be talking to you about soon and
then we have the primerica website if
you need more information it's it's
really a good place where you can find
out a lot of information about cry
what's happening was happening in your
city was happening in the lives of
children and and for that our URL is a
URL is America dot cry dog so who I
really has made this possible the impact
in the lives of children and you know in
terms of all the programs and the
projects that we have and in terms of
the work we do it is really the projects
on the ground the 30 projects that we've
supported the underprivileged
communities the children and like we
said we have 500 volunteers who come
from different walks of life shilpa is
one atom is another they're sitting here
please speak to them and and and we have
20 action centers 9220 all across the
u.s. today and we are really looking at
how we can build our civic engagement
programs further and really be thrilled
if you could join us
thank you so I probably go skip the mic
part that I said I went with Microsoft
before but yeah I was in the CL chapter
I briefly volunteered there I have to
say that that's one thing that they're
doing really well just because of the
number of people at Microsoft and you
know they're able to build a community
within Microsoft and they have a bunch
of events and these are like donors who
have you know high potential to donate
so they are able to do like ooh bahar is
a big event that they're like a charity
event that they hold they hold something
like cry Idol they have the walk and
they have a multiple event so I think
you know just being Google and I'm
amount of people we have to support here
I'm really excited about the opportunity
to build a micro community within to
support kids an idea so just want to
call it out and the many reasons which
you can get involved we are appealing to
the virtual to everybody to either
volunteer to donate to the media to
write about crime America to write about
the cause of of Indian children and all
this collective action because we really
feel that no one person or no one
organization will be able to make this
change alone and it's all of us putting
our my together and I think that that is
one of the beauties of Christ approach
that you know you know everybody's not
expected to stop what they're doing and
then start working in the field with
children whatever you're doing you know
there's a role that you could play and
all this collective action is really
towards building a just world in which
every child irrespective of gender cast
class color ethnicity has an equal
opportunity to grow to their full
potential and in which children have a
voice in matteson effect that affect
them so please do join us and really
looking forward to seeing this group
grow within Google and any time that you
know we're having question answer
session now but even later if you'd like
to contact us a talk further we will be
happy to do that and so just to end my
part of it it's really that we would
like to be the voice of India's children
and we would like to make the dreams of
children like my
like Mahender Singh from that borivali
village come true thank you dr. neeraj
is the head of sati project one of the
projects that we support in Jharkhand
and he is here to share with you the
work that he does with communities with
children with the local government and
all that you heard me talk about here is
a he will tell you the real the real
story in terms of actually working with
the communities and the children dr.
neeraj first appalled Namaskar to
everybody and dear friends ladies and
gentlemen I dr. neeraj kumar from sathi
as you see here society for advancement
in tribes health education and
environment and NGO working among the
tribals especially the primitive tribals
in Jharkhand actually the objective of
Em's of sati is to ensure that the most
vulnerable sections of the society
especially the Mayas children and women
in and around the four districts of the
Jharkhand where we are working attain
their fundamental rights as guaranteed
to them in the Constitution of India
actually as you see here sati works in
the Jharkhand estate actually this is
the map of the jharkhand state and it it
comes under actually it lies under the
eastern India so here most of the tribal
people are residing and in the in this
in these four district
the men astray of livelihood of these
tribal people are agriculture so here
this is one of the initiative of sati
and organizing actually the one of the
initiative of sathi is to organizing and
strengthening of balls and said the
child Parliament as you see in America
or in any other country so in a
parliament there are two groups one
groups is the ruling party and another
group is up in sitting in a position so
as you know they see the opposition
group posing so many questions put so
many question to the ruling party
regarding the problem any any raised in
their country so similarly here children
are in two groups as you know there are
two leaders here one Anita Morandi the
children of the Voyager block one of the
tribal Development Block in the area and
another is permis former and either
another leader sitting here and here
questions questions are posed and the
questions were related to actually this
child Parliament have been actually
organized in the office of the highest
level of you sell that divisional
commissioner there so the children
sitting there in the in the office of
the divisional commissioner and in the
commissioners office dep they are posing
several questions one of the questions
they posed it related to they actually
they said why the teachers are not
coming to the school's regularly
similarly they posed the question
related to why the health officials and
the the people's from the health
officials are not coming regularly to
the health centers and they are not
providing proper treatment and other
info infrastructure related to the
health etc so regarding this so many
questions have been posed by the
children especially related to their
sports and other things also in the same
child Parliament
here besides the other children a girls
were presented Gulf children were also
presented on equal basis and she also
posed questions related to them as while
she is not going regularly school and
she is working in their houses so these
questions were also posed by the Gulf
children similarly so many child
Parliament were organized in the area
and across the jharkhand state in the
year two thousand five and two thousand
six in which more than 800 child
participated joint in this chilly child
Parliament so actually the children who
participated in this in this child
Parliament actually came from in this
from these backgrounds actually they are
from the child labour they are from the
society where more mostly that the
people are are slipping hungry and this
area are actually as you know jerkin so
peoples are from the displaced family
migrants family and also these are from
this they are also the child labour and
when we started work earlier so actually
the children are also dropped out and
most of children are not seen ever even
the local schools also in the earlier
stages so as you see here they actually
in the children came from those areas
had no basic infrastructure facilities
like railways roads etc and as well as
the district which I have mentioned in
the figure here our lowest from the in
the lowest ladder of the inn at the
Indian context as well as well as from
the development in index and these
children these districts still lagging
behind since I've after the 60 years of
the India indepen
so actually in this process through this
process now we have more than 500
children Parliament balls and such
they're in in our area in the jharkhand
state and by through this church child
children's many sessions were organized
by them as as I narrated here and
through the children certain ball may
lodge were also a child gathering
together shared their views etc real to
them and biologic are actually one of
the most participation example of the
child participation here the children
really organized and lobby with the
government officials regarding their
schools regarding their hospitals and so
on in the area so and child children's
magazine were also published and all
children participated in magazine
regarding their situation letters etc
and dig children at this magazine helped
us a lot to advocate the issue of
children in our area with the local
governance and the policy makers
actually sathi along with these children
Parliament the ball sunset and the
community groups had actually enabled to
free compulsory and quality education in
the eighth in the area of the where the
children are deciding and in this regard
so many schools have become functioning
involvement one hundred percent
involvement have been achieved fifty
percent and more than fifty percent
retention of the children in the school
serie also achieved girl children were
also retained enrolled and retained in
the schools Andrew and we are we have
tried and succeeded to remove all forms
of child labour in the certain areas
actually I am besides the above we threw
our actions and the common actions we
also reduced the infant child and
mothers mortality rate through
channelizing certain government schemes
like integrated child development
schemes in the areas and through this
certain sessions were also organized and
through all this effort we actually we
tried and succeeded one hundred percent
but registration in our area we are also
tried and succeeded to function the
local health centers we are also tried
to channelize through through our common
efforts various generalized the various
schemes government schemes such as food
pension etc in our area and one of the
actually actually our HT meant more than
55 public distribution centers have been
activated in our area actually as you
know these public distribution centers
is is meant to provide the grants to the
two to the marginalized section of the
community in a quite low prices so say
one of our achievement so actually how
we make it possible actually these are
the programs these are the processes we
adopted we started to awareness aware
and actually also pray also we organized
certain campaigns regarding to demand
the schools in area closer to the
children where they reside as well as we
are also it informed the community
regarding their legal rights as well as
the role of the local government bodies
to the community so that they can they
can demand their their their rights and
it's in this through this process
irrigation facility and scientific
knowledge and agriculture practices were
also I have been made access and certain
campaigns were also organized to
advocate and actually we also organize
certain social audits and public hearing
in the area as you know social audit
actually the our audit of the any
government programs which have been
implemented in the area whether it is
right and wrong the community group
formed together and they they they audit
all this process through the auditing
certain tools and through a common
gatherings hearing all also done by the
people and the where government of his
cells also participated and through this
process such as
admin mid besides the above certain
raylene i will also are also organized
in the area to control these tribals on
the local and natural resources so in
this process through this process we
tried and succeeded 20 acres of draught
flown aerial and cultivate make them
cult culty cultivable and besides the
above certain village level cooperatives
were also have is formed and this
strengthened to control over their
natural resources and to support in
their livelihoods we have also
introduced certain traditional methods
of agriculture as well as we tried and
succeeded to form village level green
banks and seed banks in the area so that
the people's can cope up during the
scarcity period as well early in periods
and initiated certain collective farming
processes in the villages so that the
peoples of the of the area and the
villages can collectively Cullen can
collectively their livelihood are so
insert their livelihood also so in
certain village village emergency funds
have been also formed and through so
that they can protect their community as
well as themselves during the lame
periods so in this regard actually in
all this process we formed and
strengthened several village level
consoles and traditional and local
effects level organizations and as well
as regional level alliances as Saif Ali
mentioned earlier that our approach is
the bottom-up approach and here we
started first formation and strength in
the village councils then effects level
organizations then regional level forums
and all these by the people's group and
the community groups so the uneaten R&amp;amp;D
in in the same child Parliament said if
children can turn the whole world
upside down actually if he need a proper
care and and men is trimming to the
education and other things thank you hi
everybody my name is Adam McGregor and I
have been a volunteer with cry America's
since october two thousand three and
while i'm getting my presentation i'm a
very brief presentation cued up here i
should also mention i'm not actually
from india but i was my interest in
india that led me well you know yeah
it's my interest in india in the culture
in the history that led me to volunteer
for cry figured it would be the nicest
way to combine in an interest in
volunteering with a learning that
opportunity to learn some more about
about india just by working with folks
from india so I had some add some brief
slides which I'm actually going to skip
past because we're a little bit out of
time but what I did want to stress that
there's an opportunity for each and
every one of you to volunteer with your
local action centers the berry Action
Center enthusiastic large and active and
they have coming up on the fifteenth of
june i'm going to skip ahead to this
slide here so odd that's going to be
coming up on the fifteenth of june it's
a Bay Area Walk and it's going to be
held at shoreline park in mountain view
which is just I would imagine right
around here we have received an
overwhelming response thus far from
people across the San Francisco Bay Area
um it promises to be a huge high yield
event and we would love to have each and
every one of your support there is a
walker or you can let people you know
colleagues friends family know about
this as well um we really really would
welcome you to support our event through
whatever you can offer us and I just
included a picture of a walk that the
Pittsburgh Action Center had should skip
ahead to that actually oops
okay so this is a walk that we had in
2006 in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and we
had some great participation and the
nice thing about this year was that most
of our participants were children and
its children from America helping out
children from India and you know I don't
know I don't think you could get much
more basic and fundamental than that in
Christ's message of participation and
outreach and show of solidarity to
really so the bay area chapter is a very
action center rather is going to be
kicking off this year's walk event with
as I mentioned their walk on june
fifteenth ship i believe has the
information how to register correct we
also have mailing list that you can sign
up if you'd like to do it the
old-fashioned way via paper and other
than that we just we thank Google for
inviting us here and we thank all of you
for your attendance and I think we can
open up the floor to some questions
briefly so thanks very much everybody
giggles registration is to give you some
sense of what that means for two dollars
funds the child's entire year of
education in India and if you come as a
couple it's $25 and that will almost
cover your health comes for and tighter
so just one impacting the impact you can
have by just doing a walk and on it's a
beautiful it's going to be a beautiful
morning in June and also just want to
close it up with why cry is unique and
if you see everything that they did I
think I believe in Christ so much more
than a lot of the other organization is
yes we want to teach them how to fish
and that's why there's so much of focus
but if you see the change that's
happening in kids they're teaching other
people how to fish so you know they're
doing ball panchayat or you know ball
Sun sets which are like groups of
children being the voice of the own
community and making other people think
like the way they did so we're not just
trying to help them fish but we want
them to be the people who teach other
people how to fish so I'm really excited
and hopefully we'll get a lot of
participation from everyone here in the
walk and in a Google cry group so thank
you and via feel free to hang around ask
your folly questions Adam questions or
any questions right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
