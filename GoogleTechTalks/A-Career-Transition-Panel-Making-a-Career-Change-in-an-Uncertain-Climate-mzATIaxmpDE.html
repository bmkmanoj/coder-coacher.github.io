my name is Anita scribbling gray I work
in the Google University alumni
relations and I'm very very happy to
welcome you tonight on behalf of Google
I am extremely happy to see so many of
you as you know Google has a strong
history with Stanford and we have a lot
of Stanford alumni working here at
Google we've been building overtime
strong relationships on the student side
but what is new is that now we are
looking to build also strong
relationships with alumni organizations
and it's a great pleasure to start our
partnership with this particular event
with the Stanford Business School black
Alumni Association so it's really a
pleasure to see so many students and
alumni here tonight and I'd really like
to thank the other Organization for
working with us I would like to thank
Linda Parker Pennington who will be our
moderator tonight she's a former
president and a very active member of
the Association I'm sure many of you
know her and she will introduce our our
panelists tonight Eggman we have a I
think great panel and I think the topic
will be very relevant to all of us we at
Google believe very strongly in
diversity well first of all because we
want our own Googlers to represent the
diversity of our users and also because
we have a social responsibility and
really want to support communities and
support diversity in general so we hope
that this is only the first of many
other events that we'll have together we
also want to promote networking because
that's actually what works the best in
promoting people's Korean opportunities
in life and so we hope that you already
had a great chance to network with each
other during this first hour and we'll
have some time at the end during that
discussion if you have any questions if
you want to you know if you want to
participate we'll have a mic that will
actually come here in the middle and we
would like to ask you to come in the
middle we make things easier actually if
you can line up and ask the questions
that way the
thing I wanted to tell don't be shy if
you can move actually you might have
noticed that the two first rows have the
wonderful book of dr. Greene some the
two first rows have the copies available
so the first ones to move will get it
the other one's gonna obviously order it
online and we'll give you more
information at the end so don't be shy
come on here
with that I will wish you a wonderful
night I hope you will really enjoy it we
are very happy to see you so well we are
hoping that you'll have a wonderful
night and I'll pass it to window okay
thanks Anita actually we'll probably
take that one let's leave it with our
teas Thanks good evening everybody I'm
Linda Parker Pennington it's so nice to
see some smiling familiar faces and so
all I'm gonna do is do double duty
originally I was just going to introduce
everyone and now I've been asked to
serve as moderator but I first want to
thank Google and Lafon Davis and Sunita
for putting out the money to do this and
for actually getting you all here and
supporting the Stanford black alumni GSB
black Alumni Association of which I'm
one of the cofounders as it happens so
I'm it is my honor to welcome you and
what the way we like to do things these
programs at Google is we like to make
them very interactive so I do have a set
of questions that I'll take our
panelists through but there are just a
few questions and then we're going to
leave about a half hour for your own
questions so I want you to be thinking
about your questions and then there will
be a microphone that we'll have you on
and we are videotaping this session for
YouTube for just start off by
introducing everyone briefly and I think
you have their bio so I'm not going to
read their BIOS or anything but I'm
really excited that everyone is here who
we asked and I I know everyone here so
I'm quite proud that they showed up so
Frank Greene is an icon in Silicon
Valley I think a lot of you if you
madam before have heard of his
accomplishments as a venture capitalist
and a leader and recently he's been very
focused on developing his foundation
called go+ which he'll tell you about
and then next to Frank is Stacy Brown
Philpott who is the president of black
Googlers here and she's been at Google
for several years and she's a GSB alum
so delighted that she's here with us and
then Lamar bunts who is also GSB alum
and an entrepreneurial guy with many
gifts and then finally artists Hardy who
is also GSB alum and I won't say what
year people are from because then people
start to think about age and this is not
necessary nor relevance in my humble
opinion so and all of them graduated
after me so we're definitely not talking
about that and so you won't get a chance
to meet ed Bailey who would have been
our moderator this evening but I hope
you get a chance subsequently to meet ed
who's one of the talented team here at
Google so with that I will start with my
first question which is actually for all
of the panelists so I'll ask you to kind
of go and order so first I'd just like
you to describe the most important
career choice that you think you have
made to date and the benefits and upside
of the choice maybe how you went about
the choice and the benefits of having
made that particular choice you have to
start three career choices and it's hard
to tell which hasn't been most important
I guess the first one when I decided to
be electrical engineer when I was coming
out of high school and also going into
Air Force ROTC which opened up
opportunities for me to see a whole
different world through working at a
place called national security agency
and seeing what high-speed computing
really is all about excuse me in this
country a second choice and related to
that first choice was coming out to
California working at fair Joe and so as
you know in life we make choices and a
choice creates a result and then you
make another choice in
you create a second result so it's hard
to just isolate one choice because a
choice usually leads to a whole series
of different different choices and
different results but a distinct choice
a different choice Camille's leaving
Fairchild and starting a software
company in the early seventies with a
couple of other engineers and learning
what it took to build a company from
scratch without any management
experience and or I had a lot of
leadership experience because of my air
force and just life experiences and I
had to fall back on that leadership
experience and that's one of the things
I've been talking about in writing about
here in recent in recent years and that
led to a whole series of other
activities for me which I'm not done
talk about in detail but that was that
idea of starting a company and really
taking starting to really take charge of
my own future create a whole different
concept for me of how you can do things
in your life and then the third choice
was because of a good friend of mine
who's also one of my ski buddies I felt
my name is John Douglas I think you know
John Douglas John called me one day and
he said have you ever thought about
starting a venture capital fund and this
was about 20 years ago now and I said no
John I haven't and a plus I didn't think
I mean that wasn't something that I
could see myself doing he said well why
don't you have lunch let's have lunch
and talk about it and he had another
fellow I was thinking about the same
thing and so the more we talked about it
more I kind of liked the idea and so
about 10 years ago I did start a venture
capital fund and that's what I've been
doing for the last ten years and that
exposed me to a whole different range of
the life experiences you know in the in
the boom days of the of the internet we
were seeing 500 business plans a year I
mean I was personally seeing 500
business plans a year I sometimes I'd be
talking to one or two groups a day I got
a lot of experience in dealing with
folks who are thinking about starting
companies and understanding the
challenges that they're facing and
that's another another factor that has
given me some insights about what people
need to know about leadership and that's
that's part of the life experience that
I've had as a result of these choices
now can you say one is more and then
along the way and I'm not trying to make
this as if it's kind of a fourth choice
it's really in a lot of ways maybe the
first choice is I've had a family which
has been really near and dear to me and
and so that was another important choice
but I think since we're here to talk
about careers and probably not families
I'll stick with those okay thank so
since he did for you know I could do
five beat that now I think I'll do three
okay they'll be quick
you know I'm efficiently I think the
first for me was choosing to go to
business school I had applied to the GSB
I had gotten in and I was at Goldman
Sachs and this was in 1999-2000 and I
had an opportunity to stay and they were
like stay you're good this is gray M&amp;amp;A
look how much money you can make and
this is a great trajectory it's fast and
something about that seemed really
really interesting and I liked living in
New York I was happy my friends were
there but I applied to Stanford because
I wanted to experience a different part
of business and that's that early stage
part and just see what that was like I
grew up in the Midwest in Detroit I
lived on the East Coast and so coming
out to the west coast was probably one
of the best things that I've done
because I got an exposure to things I
would not have gotten exposure to and
then having that experience the GSB you
know obviously help that along the way I
think the second one was joining
Google's I just told somebody my like
this decision to join Google either like
how did you know that this is going to
be such a successful company and I
didn't I joined Google in 2003 we were a
search engine that had a business model
that was successful but was private and
it wasn't proven and so no one knew so I
didn't join Google because we were this
successful company
I joined for you know it was I jokingly
joined because I really wanted a dog and
you can bring your dog to work and so I
got a dog I've been I could go for five
years my dog is five years old do the
math but the other reason is I had a
conversation with someone who was very
insightful and said a company like
Google is the type of company that I
think only comes around once in your
career where you are and they have been
working in business for like twenty
years and I said really and so I think
that the decision to sort of listen to
that person on top of the people was was
a great one and then the last one was
changing jobs and I had done the same
thing for four years it is very easy to
get comfortable in one position in one
job but I have learned a lot you join a
company a lot of people are looking for
jobs right now joining cumin is growing
because you will get opportunities and I
got an opportunity I was scared I took a
risk is something totally different I
was a finance person I'm a CPA I did
accounting and auditing and now I run an
Operations team and so it's very very
different but I took a risk and having
done that have learned and expanded my
skillset far more than I could have ever
imagined this woman so for me I'd say my
decision my most important decision was
highly influenced by a mentor that I had
also before business school I was in
investment finance doing consulting
advising large investment funds and so I
got to know a lot of the private equity
and venture capital investors who were
coming looking for money from large
College endowment set cetera so I was
pretty excited by that and came out to
business school from the East Coast
wanting to get involved more in the
technology investing and or work in a
big technology company for a little bit
and then do investing what I learned
during business school it was actually
through a mentor through the alumni
mentoring program a person convinced me
to join a biotech startup
during my summer and I had more fun than
I ever imagined you could have on a job
right and I learned that you can you
know have just an amazing time and still
call it work right and that influenced a
lot for me I mean it it meant that for
me just compared to talking to my peers
who were going to consulting firms and
banking investment banks who were making
good money and felt pretty secure I
guess in many of them in reinforces for
me I felt so charged up by what I was
doing I felt like I was changing the
world it was biotech so you could talk
about you know saving lives and all that
stuff but we had so much fun just
working with a small team I had an
incredible boss who was a CEO a really
dynamic person who was one of the most
interesting people
you know I'd ever met - so just it
taught me about who you work with
and what you're doing how you feel about
what you're doing and that you're having
fun every day is really important so I
ended up actually circling back to a lot
of my mentors who are investors I even
talked to Frank back in the day being
someone who is seasoned in in venture
capital and what they all told me so you
still want to be an investor long-term
if you really want to be a good investor
get some good experience in an operating
company and then maybe you know 10 20
years come back around and and you'll be
much more valuable you'll have a network
and you'll have you know experience
actually knowing what makes a company
tick etc but they all said something
something else it was really important
that probably influenced me more they
said if you're having fun though keep
doing it you know why not keep doing it
so that's kind of what's influenced a
lot of my career I've done a lot of very
entrepreneurial and even intrapreneurial
things within bigger companies starting
up new divisions and business units so
I'll speak to maybe three career turns
and one of the things that's been key
for me is that pretty early in my life I
had done a couple of things that would
from a lifelong perspective be very
important to me
one was travel internationally and when
I was 23 I think it's been about a month
abroad and so when the first career
decisions was to not go to Wall Street I
was a closeted finance person at the
business school so a lot of people were
were pretty surprised when they found
out I was going to Bankers Trust which
no longer exists and then they were just
as surprised when I decided not to go
and and decided to stay in in the Bay
Area and work for a high-tech firm so my
first company was was tandem and and at
tandem I then decided that I wanted to
be a very non-traditional finance person
I fought and never went to corporate I
did everything from run and mis team to
their traditional strategic analysis I
spent a year doing regression analysis
forecasting revenue by the way I never
thought I'd do that one GSB folks know
why and but my stint at that tandem was
very key in terms of really solidifying
for me some core values which was I
needed and wanted balance because I was
a a parent the the second move was to
still within high tech but it was to
move to another company that gave me a
lot of international experience and
while I never lived in a in a foreign
country I there again I had some very
clear parameters and that I would travel
internationally but never really live in
a foreign country and so I negotiated
the number of trips that I would take I
had responsibilities worldwide
travelled a number of times to India
because I said up operations there I had
operations in in Singapore and in
Ireland very early in my life and I'll
speak to this I have responsibility not
only for my family but also caring for
aging parents and then third it was to
really decide that I wanted to take a
break so to speak I and and I did that I
decided that I wanted to work on a
part-time basis and was able to do that
and then spent time really going from
being a leader in a company to a leader
in my own company and and and it's a
large stretch it's a change from
becoming a someone within a corporation
to actually leading your own endeavor
and I've been doing that for a while so
thank you that's you know I noticed a
couple of themes to everything that you
all said one was you all seem to choose
to take the less obvious route and to
pursue that route somewhat differently
from what would have been you know sort
of a logical choice but then the other
thing that struck me was that it was
always based on what's your passion you
know it was driven inwardly as opposed
to saying okay yeah I could make a lot
of money over here but this one feels
right for me you know and that seemed to
be those were two things that I noticed
about your responses which was
fascinating so I wanted to ask Stacy a
follow-up question what were the the
real factors behind your decision to
switch from financial career when you
made that important job switch from
something that was your comfort zone to
something that was outside of your
comfort zone what was behind that and
you know were there mentors that helped
you you know come to that decision yeah
there were mentors but I think
ends up what triggered my decision to
look around was I kind of looked up and
to some degree I felt like half of the
time I was going through the motions and
the other half of the time I was like
thinking and actually doing something
and it wasn't going through the motions
because I was bored or uninterested in
the work it was because I started to see
cycles of things over and over and I'd
been in finance and so anyone who's in
finis knows that there are cycles and
when you start doing that and getting in
that place
you start to lose the ability to be
creative and innovate and the thing that
I really liked about joining Google and
when I first started was I could just
create whatever I wanted this finance
job was ever whatever I wanted it to be
and creating things and being innovative
was really important to me and I didn't
have that I didn't have as much of that
so I started looking for that next thing
and as I started to do that I realized
that there are parts of my brain I just
wasn't using having a finance background
was very core to some of the things I
learned in school but right after I
graduate from business school I didn't
join Google I actually tried to start a
company and so there were things around
sales I had worked in a business
development around marketing around
operations that I had done before that
had gone kind of latent a little bit so
I thought I want to look for something
that allowed me to use other skills that
I weren't that I wasn't using in this
current job and the reason why I was
important was because I needed like a
long runtime I can get bored very
quickly my attention span is about that
long and so I knew I needed something
that was gonna give me two years of like
interesting weird crazy challenges and
so I want it like 180 degrees different
from what I was doing and so that was
when the mentor came in that person
helped me see that you know what maybe
you should think about not being in
finance like what about another group
but I had never thought about that and I
said you know what maybe I could join
another group and she helped me get the
job that I have and she helped position
me very well for the job that I have and
so I run a group called consumer
operations we support all of our free
products so there's like very good
there's no money one pays us to use
Gmail none of you today right pay me to
use Gmail and it's a very interesting
model where I have a team of people who
just want users of Google products to be
happy with the products it is not
necessarily about like how much money
we're gonna make it is about how
delighted you are with the product which
is very very different but when I was
doing in finance and so coming in and
running this group of like over 150
people that's very much about creativity
and innovation and I was already you
know my group was like 10 people about
finance was totally different and so I
think that gave me an opportunity to use
some skills that I hadn't used before he
created and be innovative in a way that
I hadn't done before and that's really
what sparked that change for me okay
thank you that's fantastic I want to go
to the Marne out with a follow-up
question because Lamar is this you might
have noticed from hearing his background
kind of a serial entrepreneur and I
wanted you to describe what is it that
inspires you to make those leaps you
know when you have to make judgments
about taking something that's that's
different what is it that and and you
know if you fail at something because
maybe you don't always make the right
choice right how do you recover and
what's your your recovery process like
yeah i partly mentioned it before is
that you know if I'm having fun it just
it seems right but if I'm mostly I'm not
doing things that are totally off track
in a lot of cases some of the things
I've done actually my first roll out of
business school was within a company I
worked right here on this campus with
SGI and we had a mandate to start a
services business to build a
billion-dollar business that was going
to be like a third of the company's
revenues right but I got hired in to
work with a guy who was on the CEO staff
and to see all the inner workings of you
know what goes on in the c-level club
and understand you know growing a
business from within a big company from
like zero
up you know what there's a lot of
excitement in that a lot of
possibilities a lot of room to try
different things someone coming right
out of business school you know to have
the opportunity at that level to to make
things happen to build business plans
and see them come to fruition and make
it make things really happen you know it
was fun and exciting but at the same
time I knew I was gonna have a paycheck
you know the next couple weeks so it
wasn't something that was totally risky
but I had all these student loans to pay
right so but then I also had
opportunities later on because of my
network I'd built I got recruited into a
lot of these other opportunities so I
helped start a company that actually
Frank was a big contributing this to
Easi actually started out Frank's
conference room back years ago but you
know a company that was a lot of these
senior execs fortune 500 and execs who
wanted to put together software a
company and they called on me to help
him do it you know to be the future guy
to take over the range so that you know
there's a lot of fun in and helping make
that happen with some experience people
help raise money you know raise the
venture capital do a lot of research for
them to help figure out what kind of a
product it was where there's gonna be I
did all the research for the customers
you know talking to in our case it was
CIOs people who ran IT and big big
companies and governments so I talked to
about 250 CIOs to learn you know what
their real problems were understand what
you know what they really needed and
then we it was my job to build a product
around it then we had something to sell
I had to go and help put together a
sales organization the processes and all
that and then we needed you know to
actually deliver this stuff and the
customers wanted help you know what do
we do with this we put together services
business I was instrumental and helping
put that together so you know for me it
was a way to try different things but in
each of those cases - there was a little
bit of pull going on where people said
oh you've done good work here
would you consider moving over here and
try on something else so for me
it was not so risky it was an
opportunity I'd look more it was the
opportunity versus some kind of a risky
track moving away from something that
was certain I'm gonna let come back to
the second part of the question later
when we go to the Q&amp;amp;A okay cuz I do want
to add cuz I think I'm like ask that
question to everybody - I'm gonna go to
Artie's and I'm gonna ask final question
to Frank and then we're going to open it
up to everyone so Artie's so I want to
know and you talked about this a little
bit because you you know decided to take
some time and just start your own
business and so it gave you time to
focus on your dog raising your daughter
and so how have you balanced your
personal values and your professional
aspirations on your path to success
that's an ongoing process I would say
it's always just being honest about what
the trade-offs are looking at what your
values are picking organizations that
are aligned or endeavors that are
aligned and I'm a person who really
comes from my view of the world and my
value set and and so it takes a lot of
soul-searching I'd say and understanding
that I'm just looking for and promoting
the lifestyle and the answers that work
for me and that what I bring to the
table even with my values that is very
valuable and it seems to me that takes a
fair amount of self awareness and self
understanding to get to that - so so I'm
gonna ask one last question here just
for Frank and Frank could talk for for
two days about the stuff that he has to
talk about but he only has
two minutes or three so-so
and I know you're gonna spin this
differently anyway so but given the
number and variety of tools that are
available to for career development that
are now available what do you think is
the best way for someone to figure out
what will work for them you know and
developing themselves in their career
before I answer that question I want to
just ask you all huh I mean you read the
theme for tonight's discussion right how
many of you are seriously thinking about
making a major transition in Europe how
many of you have the confidence that you
know how to do that how many of you've
made transition to major transitions
before and done it successfully okay so
now if I was to go around and ask you to
explain to some younger person what was
that process all about I'm sure each of
you would probably have a different way
of answering that question and part of
the reason for this question about tools
is to address this this question of if
you're thinking about making a major
transition in your own personal life
your career or where we're going your
family where there's a big significant
change that situation has a different
has a different label now what we
typically learn in in school is we learn
about management and when you learn
about management you learn about
processes and that's where you learn
about tools so you learn about
accounting tools you learn about
personnel policies or you learn about
manufacturing policies and so this is so
that works so the language becomes
really critical and so what I wanted to
make the distinction
about is a difference between management
where we talk about these processes and
tools and we try to keep everything kind
of under control
versus when you when you're making these
major transitions things are out of
control I mean that's the whole reason
you're making this transition so you're
going
- as a theme said an uncertain climate
so we're not gonna have we don't
necessarily know which quote tool it
will work because we don't even know
what the situation really is for sure so
now we need a different process that
process that people use to make these
changes is often called leadership and
you know I've been doing this work on
leadership for a while now and not just
in the last couple years because I've
been writing about it but didn't
thinking about it and in trying to
understand what's the biggest single
factor for between the success and
failure of most startup startup
businesses and I've talked to a lot of
people I know in the venture capital
business and in the business community
and it usually comes down to this
concept of leadership the problem is
there's not a single definition
everybody tends to have their own
definition so in discount of self
defense I said okay it was talking to
Willie hooks who Lamar knows he gave me
an insight which I found is very
valuable is one way to think about
leadership it is the way you is in terms
of the work that you do as a leader and
when you think about that way you
realize that everybody who does
leadership work you got a you got a goal
when you decide to take on a challenge
you started off with a vision or an idea
or a picture or something that you
wanted to do differently then you hadn't
already done so let's just call that
part of vision you had to get some help
hopefully you got some help from some
smart people who could give you some
advice that would likely work or they
may also need to work with you that
process we call building relationships
and if you look at leaders that always
are good at building relationships and
then the fourth the third parts gives me
is how do you get accomplish the results
what is it you need to do with the
people what do you need to learn for
yourself in order to be able to
accomplish results that part we call the
execution because execution is kind of
one of the in terms in the in the
leadership management world
and so we've developed this process
called the VRE leadership model and the
books that are on that these first two
rows talk about this VRE model but that
turns out to be a universal leadership
process anybody any bakken's I could
take anyone in this room has gone
through a a uncertain changed situation
in their own lives and they've always
gone through that process you may not
have thought about it that way but when
you do think about that while you begin
to realize I've done that before I can
do it again and so part of what we try
to do is know and we're teaching fifth
fifth and sixth graders this same
concept because they always accomplish
something we had workshops with 65 year
old men of folks who've been through
senior management and they use the same
process and they help work with their
teams because it's universal the thing
about leadership is personal it's not
it's not a set of tools it's how we
develop our relationships you mean
there's attitudes and there's emotions
all kind of things happen you know
sometimes it's good sometimes it's not
so good but hopefully we try to make it
better than then that's it but not so
the better so I just want to kind of
kind of put that out there when you talk
about tools to make the distinction is
that when you're doing taking on a new
challenge you may not have the tools and
the tools is not a good way to look at
it once things are kind of gotten some
structured and you can talk about tools
but when you are starting out with a new
challenge you've got to figure out what
is my vision I'm gonna get some people
interested and inspired to support a
vision and then how am I going to
execute to be able to accomplish that
vision and so in this sense we're
talking about something that's a very
creative process I mean in a sense you
may be starting with a blank piece of
paper and you are going to create but
that pictures gonna look like and you're
gonna have some other people helping you
create that picture that's a very
different process than the book that you
have is about on your success and it's
only about it so it's all about taking
on this as it as if it's a creative
process as if you're an artist not as if
you're a manager and as that is a
a different way of thinking about things
and if we don't start thinking about
things this way in our lives in our
country we're gonna be you know we're
already having our lunch eaten and it's
just gonna continue to be eaten that way
but on the other hand you know this
country is what I mean people in this
country are well-known about being very
creative and that's where we've had our
strength it is in our creative ability
and I can tell you from this personal
experience I've seen so much creative
ability going around this country it's
unbelievable and so I just want to kind
of leave you with that thought that what
you're talking about when you start
making a major transition is think of it
as a creative process that you are going
to take ownership of and not just a
management process well if I can just
find the right you know the rule on page
35 well I think that's a great
jumping-off place now for questions so I
know there's got to be at least a few of
you who have questions so if you want to
oh hi Leslie if you want to come up and
and to the microphone because we want to
record you so I hope this will be
alright since you'll be that way we can
hear you mic so if you want to line up
what we usually do at Google is we sort
of line up at the microphone so we know
how many and I'll try to moderate it
because I wanted to us to finish this
segment by 8 o'clock and then we'll have
dessert and some more networking and
coffee and wine and so if we can ask
your question you know pretty succinctly
while you're at the microphone that
would be great come on up you first
Leslie Leslie to be another a quick
question for dr. the book you mentioned
or your writings I'm sorry say again the
title of although there's one book
called own your success and there's some
copies that are on the first two rows
here tonight now I have a few more
copies if you're interested there's
another book that we're writing for
students which is called create the
future you want and within that we have
some booklets that we
developed about being Bing your very
best and in this case is being your VRE
best so that we help students realize
what you know how how to realize a much
higher expectation is one of the things
that you've heard this expression seeing
is believing you heard this expression
seeing is believing how many people
believe that you're not sure you know
this is a trick question right so you're
not sure I can tell you they're not many
risk takers in this room well it turns
out in the psychologists of a confirm
this is that it's believing is believing
is saying I've gotta say it again
believing is seeing and it it turns out
if you do not believe it you can walk by
something all day long all year long or
your lifetime log and you will never
think that you can participate in it
because you don't believe it and so what
we try to do with students especially is
to try to change their belief system as
a way to give them help open up for them
the possibilities of what they might do
it in their lives and you know I work
I've done some work with some middle
school kids and East Menlo Park this was
a special boys program what they see is
a lot of what's on television so a lot
of them want to be what professional
athlete but then as soon as we start to
say look ok we can show you how to do
that but first you've got to get into
this stop cop school all these these
boys want to go to USC so we said ok
let's talk about how are you gonna get
into USC and so when we started saying
look we don't tell a kid you can't do
that if we tell a kid let's put a plan
together on how you get in the USC it
changes their whole attitude we had one
kid it was smart kid but he just had a
tendency to get distracted he was not a
vacuum about being action or he wanted
me you know you need to be an action all
the time
any rate he went through this this
program using some of these VRE concepts
this grade point average went from 1.5
to 3.5 in one semester because we helped
change his belief system first and all I
can say is that if there's nothing else
that you get tonight and if you if you
don't believe me
there's books you can read there's a
book called smart work which is one of
the references in our book which talks
about this idea of the difference
between seeing it
I mean believing it in order to see it
and if you don't believe it the your
lack of belief will act like a filter it
will block the same you know you and I
could be looking at the same picture and
if you don't believe it and I believe it
I'll see a whole different picture than
you'll see thank you that was that was
my easy question my real trick question
to the whole panel was in this recession
that we are in how do we be like our
teeth and make a committed decision to
go from some corporate America out of
our finance comfort zones into nonprofit
or philanthropic and if you can keep
your answers brief because I see we have
quite a few more questions to thank you
2008 was a year when I decided yet again
to stay out of economic or an endeavor
and try to figure out what I wanted to
be when I decide to be grown up the next
time and it really from I think looking
at your strengths or finding out what
your strengths are being very clear and
and honest about what your desires are
and being honest about what some of your
non-negotiables are and and in what
environment those non-negotiables come
in to play and at different points in
your lifetime you may have different
realities but for for most of us
our values and and the beacons and the
buoys that keep us steady in choppy
waters are very clear it's just a lot of
times we don't know what they are or we
may have have chosen to reshift our our
priorities and sometimes when we're out
of balance not only are we facing both
external challenges but also internal
challenges and can't really distinguish
between the two I just have a quick
answer to that question when you
starting to do something new always
start out with the people who know and
love you don't start out with a bunch of
strangers because if you can't get good
advice from people who know I love you
how you hope how strange is gonna give
you good advice hi my name is Andrew
Harris on the course and I have for the
panel is what's the biggest mistake that
you've ever made in your career how do
you think we can learn from it thank you
for coming back to that and that was the
second part of the Lamarr question so
imma let you start so I think I told you
about some of the most of the jobs I've
ever taken were right in line with what
I wanted to do
I usually judge things by it's for four
main criteria right is it important is
it highly visible is it a growth
opportunity and is it fun gonna have fun
so I always that was before I even
started digging deeper I used those two
sort of criteria to think about my jobs
I did come across an opportunity where
they were willing to pay me a good
amount of money and you know it was high
visibility I was working for the CEO
company on a high growth spurt you know
profits going through the roof and all
that and it was a good opportunity for
me to to be visible and grow the one
thing that was I think the mistake that
I regretted and I learned a lot about
is it's really knowing about thinking
about who you're gonna be working with
the people that you work with day to day
matter a lot your satisfaction on the
job the team that you're working with
especially the person you work in for
but it can turn a great opportunity it's
a real just a real drag yeah I got to a
point where I was just while I was doing
good work I enjoyed the customer I
always did a lot of customer facing work
and I enjoyed being out there and and
but you know there are some team members
the way there were work ethic the
motivation was all different from what I
was used to I used to being around a lot
of you know motivated people like any
Stanford Business School types and
Google I see go-getters and I ended up
with some people who are just you know
they had different kind of work after
they just drugged it dragged everything
down it made a real impression on me of
how important it was the people that
surrounded me in the workplace a couple
of years ago I'd say about four years
ago I started playing poker and one of
the greatest mistakes I learned was when
what you want is on the table you need
to know when it's time to cash it in and
and that can be on a number of things
know when it's time to decide and
execute because sometimes the window of
opportunity may be very very small and
and so get advice but also listen to
your to your gut and if you've gotten a
lot of expert advice but you still got
some uneasiness in your gut I would say
go with your gut especially if it's only
advice and you're the only one who has
something real tangible to lose just a
quick answer about the mistakes I mean
I've always liked the good work I've
done at the time I was doing it so that
that was for me never a problem but I
guess the biggest mistake
made and over the years is acting out of
being angry or fearful about something
because you know we could go we have
this little process where you can go
from fear anger and go to stupidity and
I have made some really stupid decisions
when I've been angry and upset and so I
mean if that's the one thing I've
learned is to try not to make a decision
when I'm really upset because I you know
I have really done some dumb things
which and it's too late you can't take
them back
my question is for Stacy my name is
Lindsay main aragÃ³n class of 2009 and
my question is for you because I believe
you graduated around the tech bubble
burst and what they've told us at the
GSB is that now is the time in our lives
to take risk job risk and my question is
what is safe right now versus risky as
you see large companies failing and
things like that is now the time to
start a business or is now the time to
go the traditional route and what did
your classmates and how did you keep
that in mind so I I lived my life up
until probably two years ago with like
this grand master plan so like I was
like I grew up in Detroit single mother
I wanted to go to college I went to
college people you know did so much to
sacrifice me to get there so I had to
get out I had to get a good job I wasn't
getting married by this day have kids by
this day my life was so plan I've all
written down I had a structure and then
things just nothing I mean I don't have
children I suppose have children my five
years ago I have any you know I met my
husband like way too early I've known
him for 14 years and we've been married
for eight years I wasn't supposed to
meet him until
seven years ago so I mean clearly I've
terrible planning but you know a lot of
these things these and a lot of it is
like okay this is the right I'm gonna
take this is the path I'm gonna take and
you know what what happens is this
things just don't work out like you
expect but they work out for the best
and you know I found my soul mate you
know I love him very much and I'm glad I
found him earlier cuz there he was and
so I mean I I would say that you know
when 2002 when I was graduating I didn't
have a job and I remember everybody in
my class was interviewing very early on
cause like the banks and the consulting
firms will come first and I didn't want
to do those jobs they were like
contacting me like are you coming back
over tax coming out you come back and
you know the consulting firms I said you
don't want to do this like I know if I
went did I had one of those Moe's I know
if I went and did this I could be
successful but I wasn't excited about it
and so as I started to look for jobs in
the technology industry and I had worked
in venture capital for the summer and I
got the very same advice that you got
about you know if you want to be an
investor long-wear and go out and get
some experience I was like great there's
all these tech companies I'm gonna go
get some experience and men they just
weren't hiring as much so you know you
end up in this place of like okay so
what do I really want to do what really
drives me and so I thought about
starting a company I was actually
working with somebody start a company
for nine months before you know I joined
Google and I think underlying all of
that is just you know taking a little
bit of long-term perspective and that's
hard to do when you're about to graduate
it's really hard to do but also thinking
about like what matters to you like what
are you interested in and what are you
excited about and do that thing because
even if it doesn't work out at least you
will have some personal fulfillment and
you will do well because you're excited
about it and you'll be the best at it
and people will notice you and so I
think that that's one thing that I would
give to someone who's graduating to
think about as you began your career I
think there are still companies that are
hiring so I think
what's safe is companies that are
actually hiring and growing and there
are companies that are hiring and
growing even as some of these companies
are failing or laying off and things
like that so go and find those companies
and get a job there and take the job you
get don't get picky you know seriously
like don't like take the job you get as
long as it's a growing company you
respect the values of who founded the
company and the leadership and you think
you can learn something you work with
those people that's a good opportunity
for you can I answer a little bit
differently or give another perspective
as a Stanford GSB grad I would tell my
friends a lot I don't forget why I came
to the GSB and I came to the GSB and I'm
only speaking for me personally even
though I ended up with a job at a
corporation I went to this GSB to have
every option and so Stanford trains you
if it's your desire to work for a
company but Stanford is the
entrepreneurial school of the world and
and so in turbulent times if you have
ever wanted to start your company if you
have ever wanted to run a company I
would say yes look for a a position but
excluding your student loans and
excluding the fact that you know we have
to have you have to provide for your
living you know use this as an
opportunity to go for it to really go
for it because it's at the beginning of
your career where you can really set the
stepping stones for your ultimate dream
and if your ultimate dream is to own a
billion-dollar company to knock okay to
be a strategic partner to Google to be
it's the time where you should be
willing to start putting those things in
place I just like to make a comment
that's probably going to sound like
heresy and I'm saying this on the basis
that of probably all of all the business
plans and people I've talked to we used
to ask them one question what's the
value proposition are you what do you
create how are you creating value for
somebody else not for yourself but for
somebody else and I would guarantee you
I mean I'll tell you 90% of the people
did not answer that question they never
thought about that question and so the
heresy that I want to put on the table
is the world is not about you you may
think it's about you because you've been
the stanford and you get out in the
world and you discover there are people
out there who know how to create value
for people and and those people who not
to create value they're the ones who are
making all the money and so when you're
starting to look around for where do you
want to go and what do you want to do in
your life part of it part of the answer
to me is how can you create value for
somebody else that they don't want to
spend a lot of to pay you a lot of money
so if they'll want to invest in keeping
you around other than just giving you a
place to work are you knowing and having
you down on the expense line you
actually what you want to do is you you
want to get you don't want to be down in
the expand every organization has a line
you don't want to be down below the line
which is the expense line you want to be
above the line but they're investing in
you because they expect a return the
only way they're gonna get a return is
where you're creating value for them
that's why I say it's not about you it's
about what can you do for somebody who's
gonna help hopefully pay you a lot of
money and and that is such a fundamental
difference that folks miss that I mean
like I said 90% of the people they when
they couldn't answer that question that
was kind of the end of the discussion I
mean I don't know if you don't if you
know what the statistics are for
companies that raise venture capital
anybody anybody know it's the statistics
are they actually raise money I mean of
all the companies that are going around
with business plans that actually raise
money
it's usually less than 1% I mean what
makes Google so great they have figured
out how to create value for their
customers a lot better than their
competition it's a very very it's very
simple so now if you want a job at
Google what are you gonna do that's
gonna create value for Google that's
gonna help them increase that percentage
of people that they can create value for
this so they become more competitive
that's why I say it's not about you it's
really about what can you do for
somebody else and the problem in our
society is often the focus is on us and
versus saying what are we doing to help
each other and when you know to me you
know probably person ought to get the
entrepreneur award of the century is
Barack Obama because when you think
about it you know his community
organizing experience he learned a lot
about how do you create value for other
people which makes him so powerful as a
leader and so it's not about but is he
gonna get out of the deal how do you go
find a job well find those job look for
those opportunities where a company
needs have some value created where you
can create that value for them and when
you think about it that way there's a
lot of opportunities in the world
there's a ton there they don't show up
on the on the job listings because
nobody says I'm looking for people to
create value they said I'm looking for a
person to do accounting and so I'm you
so I'll stop I mean that's my my hair
heresy for the for the moment we're
gonna take you're very patient thank you
just about relative risk what kind of
path you take I think you know some
people say you can you know get a skill
take a kind of big company path and go
from job to job and sort of climb the
ladder and then there's another path so
sort of seems more like gambling to some
people you kind of go in from
entrepreneurial thing to entrepreneurial
thing and then maybe it's harder to go
from that to the more stable big company
versus the other way around
I just think especially coming out of
business
kind of early in your career the
relative risk is just it's not that much
different I mean and I've been in enough
for these closed-door conversations and
big companies when they start making
decisions on what they're gonna do and
not do anymore and stuff and there's a
lot of risk in big companies too you
could still you could come out of school
and get into a big company and be laid
off the next year to you know not for
performance reasons or anything there's
a lot of so just I'm just think if you
want to try something if you feel like
there's something you really something
that could really charge you up and you
could do really well at because you're
so into it you're so it's at the core of
what you what you're about and you can
create value doing it it's important I
think now is a relatively less risky
time to try to thank you so much for
being patient you have the last question
when you're in your decision to leave
finance for something else what were
some of the criteria that you went over
that sort of pushed you over the edge
you said okay I'm gonna take on this
risk and go into operations and also if
you started in operations would you have
done the opposite and go into finance
hmm I think what do the criteria first
not tell you if I had done if I would
have done the reverse I think I think
the decision to move to operations
wasn't as wasn't really part of the
criteria the number one criterion I
gotta talked about was I wanted to just
do something that was a hundred and
eighty degrees different from you know
what I was doing now and so when I
looked at the skills that I was using at
the time I was like using very heavily
analytical skills a lot of the work that
I was doing was very very
cross-functional I didn't have people
reporting to me but I still had to
influence without authority I mean that
was a lot of my job I had a lot of
global responsibilities in there I
wanted to keep the global responsibility
but I was very much interested in having
a larger organization so I could
continue to build some leadership skills
and so I wanted to have a role that gave
me an opportunity to do that I also was
in
stood in a lot of what I had done was
built relationships in Google
cross-functionally but a lot of those
functions were very much on the but what
I call here the business side of the
company so within sales and within
people operations in HR and within
finance and I did I had not reached out
and built really effective relationships
with people who were in engineering and
in product management and if you see
yourself at any long-term career in any
big company you want to make sure you
have those relationships across the
board so it was important to me that I
got to build some relationships with
people who were in parts of the company
that I didn't have them so the role that
I was looking for would give me some
exposure to working more closely with
engineers working more closely people in
product management so those were kind of
the two things I wanted kind of some
leadership people management
opportunities and then some
opportunities to work with functions
that I had not had as much or a deep
exposure to and that's how I kind of you
know sort of decided what I have done
the reverse I think having worked in we
had John Thompson who's the CEO of
Symantec come to Google and I am gonna
quote him because it was his quote that
he helped me actually now realize the
value of having moved from what I call a
support role to an align function in his
career he had moved back and forth
before he became CEO of Symantec and he
said having the other the other person's
perspective being in a support person
versus a line function and being able to
do both and see how the other side
thinks makes him much more effective as
a CEO because he understands the
trade-offs that each side has to make
and I didn't really realize the value of
that until I moved out of what's
traditionally a support function into a
line function I have a deep appreciation
for the value that finance organizations
bring and I now have skills and
obviously relationships that help me do
my job better and I see that there are
managers in my organization that would
very much benefit from having that
understanding and be much better leaders
as a
so I think taking some time in your
career to flip-flop between both if you
can do so in a large company would be
valued plus antibody in the long run
thank you so I thank you all for your
questions your wonderful questions and I
want to give at least two or three
minutes to art Mei before we close
completely an art is the head of the
Stanford GSB black alumni network and I
think he wants to talk a little bit
about what's coming up and anybody going
to the inaugural Obama that there there
is a Stanford Stanford Alumni
Association kind of gala on the 21st the
GSB black alumni heather has been also
invited so if you did not get an
invitation for that today
you know let me go because you're more
than welcome to to participate in that
and then there are some other things
that are coming up and we'll send
information about it the students are
looking at trying to put together a
mixer in in San Francisco in February at
a place called MIT mister which is a
barber kind of Club and we had an event
last year at this location so look for
that potentially in in February you know
in March
royal and J Ward are trying to put
together a panel on venture capital
this will be held in the East Bay so you
know it's another thing that were they
were trying to put together we'll have a
minute for Natasha to talk about the
conference a PBS a conference is coming
up in April but there are several things
that were coming up but one thing that's
really important is participation and an
assistance so you know these are these
are things that are done by people like
you know like royal or Linda that step
forward and say you know I think we want
to do this and we think it's good for
the alums so we need to hear from the
alums what you want and what you like
and what doesn't work and what does was
work and what works well for getting to
know other alums and me it's events like
this where you can cross connect and
talk to other alums that we think that's
that's important so that anybody that
that has any input I know there's a
survey but please feel free to give me
if royal royal a stand-up give royal or
Linda or somebody some information like
like yeah I like this or can you guys do
this art no hey I want to do this and
I'll take this on I mean we're looking
for help
and in that in that light I mean the
Alumni Association's looking at trying
to retool itself so we're looking for
volunteers to join aboard and and help
for the students and help with the
Association so you know again just
please feel free to step forward
well that I'd like to ask Tasha to come
up and talk a little bit about the
conference to make sure you all know
about the PDSA conference hello so I'm
Natasha Wilson I'm one of the presidents
of the black business Student
Association along with Ashley Payton and
Julia Collins and we want to take this
opportunity to invite you to a great
event the BBS a annual conference is on
April 25th 2009 and I mean it the the
theme of the conference is leadership in
the new America what is our role in
shaping the black social economic and
political agenda and really focuses on
the fact that America is changing we
have our first African American
president coming up and the the role
that we play in African American issues
has also changed
moving from traditional civil rights to
the new issues that we're facing and we
want to make it more of a working
session
we're coming away with actual action
items and solutions and so we're using
the day time to have round tables which
will be kind of the starting point for a
white paper that we're developing on the
subject and then in the evening we'll
hear from Marc Morial who is the
president and CEO of the National Urban
League and you know about how is he
facing the challenge of taking a
traditional civil rights organization
into the 21st century
so like art said it's really about
participation we would love to see all
of you there but also we work in
collaboration with the Alumni
Association and planning the event so
you can reach out to art or myself if
you would like to help in that thank you
can I just comment on the importance of
supporting these kinds of events I mean
I hate to see people banging their heads
up against the walls trying to fight
find jobs through online listings and
things like that where I saw some Bureau
a Department of Labor Statistics showing
like five percent of jobs are found that
way through these job listings like that
something like half the jobs are found
through referrals networking and
supporting these kinds of events is how
you network the people I met everybody
here on the panel through just casual
networking over time and the worst time
to be trying to network force it is when
you need a job or something now is the
time to take advantage of these events
just mingle with these people get to
know them and then you know who knows
you might be able to help them later
they can help you a friend of theirs can
help you it's important to really
support these kinds of activities and
then I want to bring it back to Google
and then turn it over to Sunita but I
also want to say for the Googlers here
let me see who the Googlers are here as
I think networking continues to be huge
and there's there's never enough time to
do that when you work for a company like
a Google which is 24/7 all the time so
I'm glad that you take advantage of
hosting and really appreciate the fact
that you're having us here the black
alumni and I want you to take advantage
of us being here - okay
thank you and actually a students did a
tremendous job last year and reaching
out and you know to the black alumni
around the 25th anniversary of the
conference the black business students
conference there so I really appreciate
that so I want to let Sunita wrap it up
here and remind you that we have
desserts I guess and coffee and more
wine so stick around because I think
we're here until 9:00 for those of you
who want to continue networking hi I'm
not Sunita my name is Celeste
and I work in university programs I just
wanted to see if there are any
first-year students here none okay well
if you know any first-year students who
are interested in Google and would like
to find out about our internships if you
can come see me and I'll give you some
information to take back to them Thanks
well golden opportunity just one
so don't worry I'm not going to take
long
first of all I'd like to thank our
wonderful panelists I think they deserve
another round of the plows I personally
found it very inspirational thank you
for your very honest and personal
experiences this is this was a very
great to hear and I'm sure we can learn
a lot from from your experiences I'd
like also to thank Linda and art and
there are two people I'd like to thank
they're not here so hopefully maybe
they'll hear that on the YouTube
it's lafawn davis who works on our
university of on that relations team and
who actually put this event together and
was in contact with our panelists and
EDI lee who was also supposed to be
there they unfortunately had to leave as
some of you noticed but they've done all
this great job so I think it's thanks to
them that we're all here tonight
one last thing so we many many of you
mentioned the importance of networking
the importance of being involved as I
said in the beginning we hope that this
is just the first of many events that
Google and the Stanford Business School
black alumni and student organizations
will do together to do that we actually
also need your help and we'd like to
hear from you you probably have seen on
your cheers there's a short question
here very basic it takes one minute
there's a few questions on the event
itself and there's an open question
about your suggestions and your comments
and we'd very much like to hear from you
what you'd be interested in what kind of
events you think that you are a student
or alumni organization and Google would
do in the future I'm not promising that
we'll do everything but we'll definitely
take this very much into account it's
very very useful for us so if you can
just take a couple of minutes we're not
done yet we have some desserts and some
coffee and some more food in the back we
hope that you can stick around and
continue to chat and network with our
wonderful panelists with each other and
we very strongly believe in the power of
networking and we very strongly support
that and so my maybe last request is
continue to come to these events
continue to talk to people and get more
people involved
and we'll try to find ways to help you
do that so thank you very much for your
attention and see you soon again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
