your guys benefits package team put
together referred to as the year of
living healthy or healthy living and if
you go to your benefits website that
gives you more information I think each
month is going to have a different theme
this month had financial health theme
this March which I don't think it's
posted yet is going to be based on
nutrition so each month and response to
that Google guys survey that went out
looking for people to enhance her to
their work-life balance and state of
well-being they've launched this year of
healthy living and so anyway that's why
we're going to kind of start off with
more of a nutrition talk since that's
the theme for March specifically me for
nutrition you know sort of why to give a
nutrition talk I am NOT a nutritionist I
practice internal medicine so I take
care of adults all day but I can tell
you the vast majority of what I do all
day is related to people's poor
lifestyle choices and nutrition is
probably one of the areas people make
the poorest choices and so you know for
me it's a natural consequence of almost
everything I do
food is clearly a huge part of the
culture here at Google so I think it's
important that everybody kind of learns
how to manage themselves in this setting
since just about any time of day
anything you want is here and ready to
go so I think that's also another big
piece the other thing that's kind of
interesting is that again in my practice
if I boil down almost every concern that
someone calls my office with I'd say 90%
of it boils down to do I have cancer
and do I have a heart disease so you
know is this eight cancer am i having
chest pain is it related to me I'm
almost everything worry wise not
necessarily stated upfront relates to
and my dying of cancer or is this going
to be a heart attack or am I likely to
have a heart attack so heart disease and
cancer are always on people's minds and
again nutrition plays a huge role in the
prevention modification of risk factors
for that so again it's just a
huge part of what I do every day so it
ties in although I must say I don't get
a ton of time to counsel people that
much about nutrition because of how
constricted my time frame is at work and
that's just a whole other talk on
primary care problems so so anyway I
would again describe myself as a food
moderate I will never preach an extreme
in any aspect of medical care there are
very few extremes that are sustainable
over a long period of time people try
extreme diets good and bad they don't
work they don't last and they usually
have no consequence that's lasting so
what I hope this is in a very brief
period of time is just some key bullet
points that you should be able to take
forward and use anywhere anytime to kind
of guide your own nutritional choices ok
so what's the whole point you know I
mean if you want to kind of get down to
just your own personal needs some of the
health benefits of eating well you feel
better I mean if I sit down for
breakfast and have a stack of pancakes
with syrup and butter and try and go to
work probably by about 10:30 in the
morning I'm kind of getting a little
woozy in the head having a hard time
concentrating kind of feeling sluggish
wishing I was laying on the couch taking
a nap somewhere so again just how you
eat how you approach eating generally
kind of guides how you feel a most
hour-to-hour again not knowing that it's
a young kid I think we all kind of
indulge in different foods not
necessarily fruits and vegetables and it
dictates a lot of your ability to
concentrate think be alert have good
energy especially heading into the
afternoon we all get a little sleepy and
drowsy in the afternoon so again just in
general eating well you generally feel
better
maintaining ideal body weight again I
can't overemphasize that maintaining
ideal body weight will guard against the
other things that people worry about
heart disease diabetes arthritis a whole
host of medical problems that as your
body weight or BM
body mass index climbs so we're your
list of medical problems there's just no
doubt that those things correlate
tightly and I see it every day and
that's certainly looking good in bathing
suits fun so so you can approach this or
look at what I see every day and our
country which has the most abundant food
supply and the entire world suffers from
this by far more than the other so so I
had to kind of cone down basic
fundamentals of nutrition and put it on
one slide this would be it okay so if I
was just going to give some very brief
bullet points and we'll go into these in
more detail
eat more brightly colored fruits and
vegetables you know my kids in
kindergarten learn to bite bright ok so
they're teaching young children in
elementary school going back 14 years
now my kids are teenagers eat foods that
are brightly colored and we'll talk
about what's the point of that anyway I
mean it seems somewhat obvious or
intuitive but teaching kids to see a
variety of color on their plate in fact
they taught him look at your crayon box
and see if you can find the colors of
your crayon box on your plate every
night okay if everything on your plate
is this color mom and dad need to beef
up their abilities so so that's a key
piece and we'll talk about that reduce
your intake of saturated in animal fats
okay animals produce saturated fat
butter lard most of the fat that comes
on meat is very high in saturated fat
and we'll talk about why that's
problematic and when you have to trade
out cuz that's an important part of
bodily function we want you to choose
fruit vegetable or fish fat so fish
being sort of the one exception okay and
also when we get down to talking more
about fats tropical oils even though
their plants are also exceptions coconut
oil solid at room temperature very high
in saturated fat okay but for the most
part olive oils canola oils we'll talk
about those very healthy in terms
of diet limiting sweets and salts and
I'll again kind of give you a few
exceptions to that there are some good
sweets to engage in and there's good
reasons to engage them drinking alcohol
not in a duration but moderation okay
and I think everyone's probably aware
about the benefits not only of red wine
but probably that extrapolates to all
forms of alcohol and we'll talk about
that and then portion control or serving
control that being probably one of my
favorite topics to preach upon because
I'm bad at it
and until I really gave this talk I
don't think I really had a full
understanding because I think you're
thrown ounces and sizes and cups and I
mean I I don't know what an ounce of
anything looks like I mean you know so
hopefully give you some guidelines that
make it easy so that when you kind of do
your food math at the end of the day you
have a pretty good sense of making good
estimations on portions so food pyramids
nice tools that Dietary councils put out
our government puts out just to give you
a sense of guidelines about food groups
servings per food group that you should
take in each day this is somewhat
old-fashioned by dietary standards okay
so this sort of is a older food pyramid
with the idea that again fats oils
sweets are at the tip of the pyramid
they need to be in smaller quantities
and we'll talk about what that means
your milk group and your meat group
again two to four servings per day and
we'll talk again what a serving means
your fruits and vegetables again more
plentiful this three to five servings
per day and then your grains breads
cereals group in six to 11 servings per
day the reason I like this is I think
it's easy to remember and the way I sort
of simplify this is I think of it as two
four and six
okay so - from your meat and your milk
group or from your fruit and vegetable
group and six from your whole-grain
group and that doesn't mean there aren't
exceptions because a lot of this is
based on are you male/female are you a
growing child or you know beefs adults
so but in general if you kind of stick
with those basic principles I think it's
easy to remember and I'll kind of go
forward again and explain what servings
are and why I think this older pyramid
which isn't that out of date but there's
a newer one that the government likes to
promote I think this one's easier to
remember this is the new one okay this
is the one that they tout as being the
the accurate one I find it very
confusing I I mean I look at this and I
close my eyes and try and memorize it
and I can't frankly tell you what each
of these colors mean unless I had all
these tables here down below so I think
it's well-intentioned I think the
amounts of foods they're describing are
certainly accurate I don't think anybody
can commit this to memory you know it's
just you're standing there you getting
ready to serve so six ounces of a grain
what is 60 I have no idea so again they
make good points they talk about again
limiting oils getting regular exercises
more fruits and vegetables and grains
less meat and milk but again I think
it's confusing there's too much
information there and again if you're
supposed to take that forward into the
food choices you make each day I don't
see how it helps oh that's my little
criticism there there are food pyramids
for everybody if you like to eat kosher
if you like to eat Chinese if you're
purely vegetarian if you're a vegan
there are food pyramids that fit every
person every situation okay and what I
like about the Mediterranean style food
pyramids specifically besides liking
Mediterranean food specifically a couple
key points here meat is mentioned as a
monthly
foodstuff I mean that's amazing I can't
imagine anyone in our society eating
meat once a month okay but that's what
they emphasize and then weekly fish and
poultry not daily weekly it shows up
occasionally and in small amounts and
then daily emphasizing cheese yogurt
olive oil fruits vegetables
pastas whole grains and again the basis
of all of this to Europeans move okay
they walk they don't write around on
their cars I guess they drive their
Vespas everywhere for the most part they
move and so daily activity again not
being necessarily a nutritional piece
but a huge part of a Mediterranean diet
and the other piece I like a lot is a
little wine every day didn't hurt
anybody
okay so again pretty much a food pyramid
to fit everybody if you go to Google
Images and type in food pyramids it goes
on for pages I mean you you choose how
you like to live and there's a food
pyramid to guide you okay so what's the
point of bright fruits and vegetables
and again not that y'all don't know what
they look like but I just grabbed some
stuff out of my fridge went shopping
this weekend I'm lucky I have kids who
eat well so I don't have to pander to a
bunch of weird picky eaters but
specifically bright fruits and
vegetables obviously this is healthier
than iceberg lettuce iceberg lettuce is
the second most consumed vegetable in
our country only preceded by anybody No
yes white potatoes her favorite
vegetable perform you know cooked in any
fashion okay so very nutrient rich a C's
folic acid calcium you name it the
darker it is the healthier it is okay so
what do brightly colored food vegetables
fruits and vegetables have they have
phytochemicals these phytochemicals are
lycopene Tomatoes high in lycopene in
fact concentrated Tomatoes even higher
in lycopene that's why ketchup gets such
a good rap ketchup actually has higher
lycopene cons
trations than a fresh tomato so high in
lycopene carotene obviously vitamin a
important all the brightly colored
fruits and vegetables again also high in
lycopene the emphasis an important of
those AC the lycopene carotene grouped
together they're referred to as
antioxidants and I'm sure you've heard
that term thrown around a lot
simply put anti antioxidants which are
concentrated and nutrient rich in these
brightly colored fruits and vegetables
helps scavenge up free radicals free
radicals are felt to be responsible for
cellular damage often at the DNA level
and cellular damage at the DNA level can
lead to cancer syndromes heart disease
inflammatory States like arthritis early
cataract formation so lack of those
antioxidants can create those natural
disease problems so that's a huge piece
hiya 90 oxidants vitamins you don't have
to take a multivitamin every day if you
eat that kind of food the other huge
benefit that fruits and vegetables have
that really a lot of other foodstuffs
don't is fiber okay a lot of people
think fiber is just there to help you
poop okay there's more to it than that
fiber is you start breaking it down into
what we call soluble and insoluble fiber
you don't have to worry about what's in
fruits and vegetables because there's a
little bit of each in all fruits and
vegetables soluble fiber
if you swirl it in water turns into a
clear gel okay so when you ingest
soluble fiber into the stomach it helps
bind up fatty acid so a lot of the
saturated fats in our diet will be bound
up by soluble fiber it slows the
emptying of our stomachs and when
digestion is slowed down you get less
surge of glucose so again it helps
regulate glucose metabolism it slows the
sort of rapid dumping into the GI tract
which again can create a lot of bloating
and
for some people so foods that are
naturally high in soluble fiber oats
psyllium flax seed all those foods that
again add bulk to the foodstuff that
you're eating slow metabolism help
absorb fatty acids out of our food that
we're also ingesting so in general kind
of a food sponge insoluble fiber pretty
much passes through our GI tract intact
okay and that's what's adding bulk to
the stool it draws water into the colon
by doing that it adds bulk which avoids
constipation which is a disease of
Western societies the other consequence
of chronic constipation hemorrhoids and
diverticulum in Western societies
diverticula are these benign little
outpouching you get in the lower colon
that can inflame rupture lead to
abscesses emergency emergency type
surgery so again I see a lot of that
every day
again you don't see those in third-world
countries where their diets are rich in
raw foods high-fiber foods
it's truly diseases of highly refined
diets so takeaway message on bright
fruits and vegetables high in
antioxidants high in fiber high in
vitamins that's the benefit of those
okay so reducing your intake of animal
fats while balancing that increasing
your intake of fruits and fish oils so
again just to emphasize I think
everybody knows this olive oil liquid at
room temperature okay animal fat butter
solid at room temperature so if for
nothing else for illustrative purposes
imagine this is the stuff that plugs up
your arteries this is the stuff that
doesn't okay so when you see a fat that
is solid at room temperature it
generally is a saturated fat it has more
hydrogen bonds that lead it to be solid
okay so again most of those that with
the exception of tropical oils like Coke
oyel tend to be the high saturated fat
so when you make a fat choice choose
olive oil monounsaturated canola oil
avocado oil peanut oil those things that
sit in your cupboard liquid at room
temperature and again the benefits of
that being that when you consume not
only less of this and more of this that
helps lower your LDL cholesterol which
is the bad cholesterol we want to see
down in terms of discouraging heart
disease olive oil also has an
anti-inflammatory effect often felt to
help retard certain types of our thrid
''tis but generally it's kind of a
heart-healthy issue and still students
heart disease is the leading cause of
death of men and women in this country
that's why it gets a big push okay now
fish fat a lot of people go what kind of
fish is soul just as good as salmon the
issue with fish is fish that have to
live in deep sea freezing cold waters
have to maintain a high body fat content
to survive and that fat is rich in alpha
omega fatty acids again high antioxidant
activity it creates sort of an
anticoagulant type of activity where
platelets tend to want to stick less
well together so again all those things
tending to promote a healthy heart
discouraging formation of plaque in
coronary arteries so limiting sweets and
salts well that's boring no man wants to
hear that okay and the whole point is
dessert is packed with calories it's
usually packed with fat all the lovely
desserts that are sitting in there in
shade they're not made with olive oil
okay and they they taste good not only
in your mouth but later because they're
high in fat they're satisfying that
sugar tastes good I mean I say for most
with a few rare exceptions most people
have a little penchant for a sweet tooth
and that's fine as long as it's done in
moderation meaning rather than daily
maybe passing through the dessert
counter on a weekly basis and then
keeping portions under control but the
one exception I'm going to talk about in
terms of sweets is chocolate
okay chocolates specifically dark
chocolate okay dark chocolate unlike
milk chocolate is much higher in cocoa
content and cocoa is very high in
flavonoids flavonoids again fall into
that antioxidant group flavonoids have
actually been studied in fact they've
taken people and had them consume high
amounts of dark chocolate versus a group
that consumed just white chocolate which
really isn't chocolate at all their
blood pressure went down insulin
resistance which is part of the
mechanism for diabetes went away LDL
cholesterol went down while their HDL
good cholesterol went up someone that's
a little hard to believe since it's all
made with cocoa butter but nonetheless
an ounce and a half of chocolate is
actually considered a heart healthy
nutrition sound recommendation so if you
have a sweet tooth and you like
chocolate pick the dark stuff it's
better for you okay
salt again salts usually not a problem
unless you have high blood pressure and
high blood pressure is rampant in this
country most people don't know they have
it some people are more salt sensitive
than others and salt generally a low
salt diet is trying to keep it below
2000 milligrams per day salt adds up
quick in our food supply if you buy
anything packaged pre-prepared
in a box a bag it's going to be
generally fairly high in salt most
things that are labeled though you can
check salt content it's all it's a
preservative it's a food enhancer it's
been around for millenniums it'll
continue to be there mostly any issue in
terms of people with high blood pressure
okay so alcohol my husband bit off big
when red wine see me hard healthy thing
to do okay so but truthfully alcohol
probably in any of its form beer wine
grain alcohol and we'll talk about what
a serving of that means it's probably
not a bad thing in terms of your
Giller system it again helps lower LDL
cholesterol while raising HDL
cholesterol it helps lower blood
pressure again if you don't consume
excessive amounts of it it makes again
your platelets less sticky platelets
responsible for clotting so again
probably a lot of complex things we
don't understand especially since wine
has over 200 active chemicals and it's a
very complex food so not all of it's
understood but red wine specifically is
high in an antioxidant called reserve at
all and that's the same active
ingredient that's in red grapes
so for teetotalers that don't
necessarily want to take up alcohol
Concord grape juice probably offers
similar health benefits okay so it
probably goes beyond the ethanol in a
wine probably has a lot to do with sort
of the grape and grape skins and the pre
wine formation so again if at all again
we don't encourage anyone to start
drinking but if you do choose to drink a
serving for a man ok 2 to 3 drinks is
considered normal and what a drink is is
a beer okay which I think most people
know what a can of beer looks like a six
ounce pour of red wine so if you got
those big fishbowl wine glasses you can
fill it to the top six ounce pour is a
serving of wine and an ounce and a half
of grain alcohol is considered a serving
okay women because of our body fat
percentage and muscle percentage one to
two is considered okay two to three to
much for women three to four to much for
men okay then you start to lose some of
the health benefits and gain some of the
liver toxic issues so so anyway portion
control again sort of my favorite piece
and the last part and sort of the bullet
points here the one thing I kind of want
to emphasize is and again I think
everyone this room is old enough anybody
remember what your plates look like when
you grow up as a kid okay
this is one of the plates I grew up with
that was our dinner plate and I think
that's probably average size for what
most people ate their supper off with
with their family this is probably a
salad plate today okay this is the
dinner plate that I've been using for 21
years of marriage which you know that
was a long time ago but we still have
the same dinner plates they're bigger
and we fill them up my boys especially
load these plates up there's not enough
room on this plate for them okay so
that's just one little piece of how
portions have changed over the last 30
40 years and what leads to some of our
over nutrition problems in this country
so one little piece there if you guys
seen supersize me yeah it's a great
little documentary piece again it takes
nutrition to an extreme but I think it
makes some great points about everything
that we consume in this country has
grown and so have we
okay so it correlates pretty tightly so
let's talk about what a serving or a
portion means real briefly
okay so grain so if you remember if you
go back to the old food pyramid green
sit at the bottom six serving six to 11
servings is considered a normal part of
a healthy 2,000 calorie day a diet okay
so you go to Toshi's teriyaki you think
you're having a healthy lunch well
Toshi's teriyaki he's got that big
little styrofoam bin that's loaded up
with rice for a family of five half a
chicken and there's your lunch okay so
really how many servings of that are you
consuming a general rule you want to
think about it he's serving of pasta
rice some sort of grain okay is
generally considered half a cup that's
about what an ice-cream scoop is okay so
if you scoop up that much rice and put
it on your plate
that's a serving so if you want more
that's two servings okay one massive
mound is not one serving okay just
because it all sits there collectively
with itself
so generally cook
Stowe's Rice's half a cup think of a ice
cream scooper piece of bread I think
everybody knows what a piece of bread
looks like in crackers six crackers you
can imagine sort of fitting on a piece
of bread okay so when you think about
grains think half a cup or an ice cream
scoop okay
fruits fruits are good but you know
consuming too much fruit is too many
calories so again if you want to think
about a serving of a fruit talks about a
tennis ball okay look at the fruit that
we have in our grocery stores I don't
think I've seen an apple this size in 30
years okay you can grow apples like this
in your backyard but the ones that are
commercially available or twice this big
okay that's how big apples used to be I
think when we grew up
but they're bigger and I don't know how
they got bigger I don't know why they
got bigger but they're bigger so when
you have a big juicy red apple you're
probably having two servings okay so
when you think of fruit okay
generally you know cut up fruit berries
apples bananas things like that think
about the size of what a tennis ball
would be that's a serving okay so if
you're gonna have three or four servings
of fruit over the course of your day if
you have one big apple you've had two of
your four servings okay
vegetables same sort of idea except raw
leafy vegetables so lettuces spinach
things like that
if you dice all that up about two cups
of a leafy vegetable is considered a
serving so two tennis balls okay
otherwise if it's cooked if it's chopped
one cup half a cup if it's canned sort
of cooked down and again probably mostly
because a lot of the water has been
driven off so in terms of raw leafy
vegetables you get two tennis balls one
raw vegetable you get one tennis ball
and if it's cooked you get about half a
tennis ball okay so just to kind of give
you a sense and again you're gonna go
overboard go overboard in the fruit and
vegetable Department and then dairy
products when we say dairy cheese butter
some of those kinds of things that stuff
calorically adds up super quick and if
you want to think about cheese and again
they have nice cheese out there at lunch
every day think of what the size of a
domino is okay two dominoes okay so
they're thin and fairly small is a
cheese serving okay and again that adds
up kind of quick Melkor yogurt a cup is
considered a serving so just to give you
a sense obviously little more calorie
Laden so you don't get as much for your
serving and then meat and beans and I
think again a lot of analogy people are
comfortable with a deck of cards is a
serving of meat and similar analogy
about what fits in your palm so if
you're gonna have a serving of salmon or
chicken or beef a serving is about three
to four ounces so I think everyone's
comfortable with what a deck of cards
looks like and also you can analogize it
to the size of the palm of your hand
okay that's a serving if you're allowed
two servings a day of meat or fish once
you've had two decks of cards you're
done and again people tend to load up on
it men especially I think it's more
satisfying so more filling stays with
you longer but again high in fats
traded fat more caloric Laden alright so
just as a kind of brief run through kind
of hits a few key points again there are
semesters of information taught on this
but hopefully just to give you a couple
of key things to work on again none of
it extremes I think everybody has their
moments of indulgence but as with all
things you get back on track and you
keep heading forward and again if you
try and stick by those principles in
general it all kind of pans in the end
and I think if I had to pick any one of
those things that I think our society
struggles with its portion control and
that's because we don't get a lot of
help in the supermarket department in
restaurants and the way we're serve food
I think everything discourages good
portion control so anyway any questions
that you guys have anything that you're
wondering about again any I don't think
there's any food that I would say is bad
fare and I didn't get into a lot about
trans fats mostly because those have
pretty much if you live in modern
metropolitan areas have been ridded of
our foodstuffs most of the fast-food
restaurants that used to cook with a lot
of trans fats pretty much have been
eliminated so unless you get into the
real old-fashioned junky food almost
everything nowadays is labeled you know
trans fats zero it's almost kind of hard
to find things that are high in trans
fats so I didn't get into it too much
all right all right well thanks guys
appreciate you coming yeah appreciate
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
