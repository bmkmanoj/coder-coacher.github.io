is really very simple get together in
one place for a relatively extended
period of time a lot of really bright
active creative young women and men who
have distinguished themselves in the
early and mid career stages of their
activities as engineers bring them from
a very disparate or eclectic group of
fields and backgrounds bring half of
them from industry and half of them from
universities and national labs and so
forth and put these molecules together
and let them bounce around and see what
comes out the other end I have always
told people that one of the things that
strikes me about the f.o.e is I've
attended quite a few of them now both
our us and our international ones which
he'll come back to in a moment and I
have yet to see a single discussion that
the chair did not have to stop and so I
hope this year will be no exception to
that so what is the National Academy of
Engineering the first few times I went
to things like this I failed to say that
and then of course discovered that a lot
of people didn't actually understand
what we are so we are an organization
comprised of approximately 2,000 highly
accomplished engineers again more or
less half from industry and half from
academia National Labs and so forth and
we in the first instance try to honor
people and their accomplishments in
engineering many dimensions by election
so an honorific organization and we hope
that people aspire to ultimately become
members of the National Academy of
Engineering but we also have a very
important function we together with our
sister academies the national academy of
sciences and the institute of medicine
are chartered by the US Congress to be
the primary external outside the
government advisers on
matters of science technology medicine
and health and we do most of that work
through an organization several of you
are already familiar with by
participation called the National
Research Council there's sort of the
operating arm of the three academies and
we produce as hard as it is to believe
around 200 reports every year for the
federal government mostly for the
federal government on big questions they
ask they may be big overarching policy
questions I was just talking to Al
Spector who's serving on NRC committee
right now that's wrestling with really
one of the difficult issues of our age
what is the ethics of some of the modern
weapons systems that our department of
defense and intelligence agencies are
deploying what does all this mean are
there limits that we need to think about
in this totally new world of warfare we
produced rising above the Gathering
Storm which is driven most of the policy
conversation in Washington about the
role of k-12 STEM education our research
universities and public support of
fundamental research and what it has to
do with the future of us competitiveness
we may go down to very narrow topics we
produced a report that got a lot of
attention this year and was very well
done reviewing the science that the FBI
used in tracking down the anthrax spores
and trying to determine who the guilty
party might have been in the attacks
that were perpetrated on several members
of Congress and the media so we do a lot
of things like this and then in addition
we have a third mission as a national
academy of engineering which is really
what we use a code word for public
understanding of engineering really
trying to project a more truthful more
exciting more engaging image of
engineering as a profession to the
general public to policymakers and
especially to
young boys and girls and getting the
message out that if you really are
serious about wanting to change the
world for the better about converting
dreams into reality engineering is a
critically important path for for doing
that so we're active in a lot of fronts
but I particularly like our frontiers of
engineering programs because it's my
chance to be around a lot of younger
people again having spent most of my
career in universities and really get a
sense of what the cutting edge in both
academia and industrial practice in
engineering and engineering related
activities is so that's why we're that's
what who we are that's why you are here
I want to note something in particular
today one of the primary sponsors of
this program is the Grainger foundation
and after a lot of background and work
by Janet Hunsicker who's really the
spark plug and organizer of the whole
activity the Grainger foundation has
allowed us this year to announce Granger
Foundation frontiers of engineering
grants that will support
interdisciplinary research projects that
are really stimulated by conversations
and interactions that occur here at the
f.o.e symposium these are modest in
scale but we hope will grow to be very
important there will be two grants of
thirty thousand dollars each that will
be awarded by a process you'll learn
about at the end of our f.o.e meeting so
this is a way of helping to keep you
engaged in a very substantive way at
least some of you after the meeting and
we also are working very hard to build
kind of an alumni network tying us all
together on the web I also want to note
the gilbreth lectures made possible by
the philanthropy of wonderful nae member
john armstrong former vice president for
research and technology to IBM toward
the end of this meeting you will be
given the opportunity to vote literally
on who you think the best and
most interesting speakers have been and
from that from the outcome of that two
of you will give talks at the National
Academy of Engineering's annual meeting
in Washington in the fall and two of you
at the nae what we call the national
meeting that occurs here in California
in the spring I also want to note as I
mentioned very briefly a moment ago that
in addition to the US f.o.e we have
several bilateral frontiers of
engineering programs with Germany one
with Germany one with Japan one with
India and in the last couple of years
we've started two new ones one with
China which is met twice now once in
China once in the US and now with the
European Union they're a little bit
smaller than this but the format's the
same I think there are a few of you here
who may have participated in those and
this again helps us now not only to
build collaboration and understanding
and information exchange across
disciplines across sectors but now also
across political boundaries all this of
course is made possible by the
organizing committee chair this year by
Andy whiner and I want to really thank
him and all of you for the tremendous
amount of work that comes in putting
this together to thank the sponsoring
organizations including the Granger
foundation government agencies and SF
and so forth but especially at this one
google for not only being a sponsor but
making these magnificent facilities
available to us and i say as i said at
the end of the day they really are
absolutely emblematic of the kind of
thinking the kind of activities the kind
of world changing things that engineers
like yourselves are capable of doing so
with that welcome and I'd like now to
turn the podium over to two earths Herzl
the senior vice president for technical
infrastructure at Google who I hope is
somewhere in the room there we go and I
hope I didn't butcher your name and
tirely all right I'm going to make this
short because I I know you didn't come
here to hear me speak you came here to
talk about fun things but I wanted to
briefly welcome you to google we're very
proud that you're here and also happy
hope you have going to have a great time
ah of course we're proud to be
associated with the nae we have a number
of any members on our own staff
including scarily both the previous and
the current CEO of this company um so if
you're an engineer here you can't get by
by saying oh it's complicated you know
let me let me handle it like that
doesn't work here and and of course
Alfred is and isn't any member as well
so one of the things i think it's
especially fitting to have a meeting
like this here is that I think we all
believe that engineering is very
important especially today and that in
fact it may be more important or
becoming more important than it has been
in solving some of the world's problems
and also in bringing new products that
that delight users while bringing
advantages that are that are both
technical and societal wait soso cloud
computing is in everyone's mind and has
a number of benefits that can range from
from you know much better convenience in
the sense that your data is with you all
the time even if you just have a phone
to also potentially large benefits in
terms of cost reductions or energy
reductions to run the same services that
we used to run in a different way before
and and you know why my own background
running technical infrastructure is
about the data centers that servers the
networks etc that actually power google
and and I think that's a very good model
for where we're engineering really can
can can change the world so to speak and
I see that we have
additive manufacturing is one topic
afterwards you know hope one day we're
going to print data centers but let me
just tell you you know in one minute how
data centers and the whole a sort of
server industry looked like you know
just 15 years ago I you know 15 years
ago data centers were basically you know
you did well your forefathers did right
there had been almost no development in
the past 30 years you know since the the
the the area of mainframes you know data
centers or basically cold rooms with you
know people in white lab coats and and
something like that I and then suddenly
they became really important not just to
a few large companies but sort of to
consumer to the consumer industry
because all the wet mail and search and
etc was ultimately server-based that
needed to be powered by data centers and
the cost pressures there were much
higher than then they had been you know
at large companies and so therefore the
innovation a speed really ramped up and
so in the last 10-15 years probably more
happened there than in any prior time
and I wasn't immediately apparent like
if you had asked someone in 1995 you
know our data center is going to change
they would have said oh yeah they're
going to get bigger but yeah not really
right and and so but yet there has been
a lot of change from the physical you
know the way they're built energy
efficiency you know green etc etc to the
hardware you know the network's
virtualization cluster computing you
know all that infrastructure layer to
the applications themselves you know
fault tolerance sort of built in the
whole cloud computing you know your data
being being distributed being accessible
being partially cashed at the client you
know really the whole world sort of
changed in just the last you know 10 15
years and I wasn't immediately apparent
and I hope that some of the things
you're going to talk about today or you
know may well may may 10 or 15 years
from now be viewed the same way right
you know additive manufacturing for
example the whole 3d printing now kind
of entering the main the mainstream
well might actually right now look like
a you know a niche sort of endeavor but
you know 10 15 years might actually be
really important so with that I'm going
to leave you to a program again welcome
to google I hope you're going to have a
great time and and I'm sure you know
alpha and everyone is going to take
great care of you so thank you very much
it's a good morning I'm Andy whiner from
Purdue University I'm this year's
symposium chair and so I'd like to add
my greeting and welcome to those you've
already heard i'm looking forward to
very exciting two and a half days and i
first got involved with this back and i
believe was nineteen ninety-eight i was
at that time still in the appropriate
young to mid-career age cadre but i was
involved in i think it was the fourth of
these us frontiers of engineering and I
just remembered as a great time to mix a
lot of different people i'm sure i would
never get exposed to otherwise and a
very stimulating thing about ten years
later i was fortunate enough to get
elected to the national academy and
probably a month or two later I got a
call from Janet hunsaker who probably
most you've heard from at some point
she's the professional in a staff person
who really makes this and the other like
meetings happen and she said Annie I'm
not sure I've ever asked a new member
you know so quickly to do something but
you know we need a new chair at this
point will you do it and because of the
memories was easy to say say yes I also
did a little homework and found out the
na did such a great job that it might be
a little bit less work than other
meetings we may organize so this is the
third and last cycle that i'll be
sharing this and I'm you know thrilled
to be here one more time I'll just sorry
I don't get to do this next year and so
I hope everyone here as a really as rich
and experience as I've had in my
opportunities to participate in this
meeting
at the welcome reception last night
there were two questions I got asked
again and again and so at the risk of
boring those people who actually asked
me them I thought I'd get into them a
little bit and one was generally how do
we choose the areas of our sessions and
the other was how do we how do we pick
the people so in terms the areas the
main things we're looking for our areas
that will be a broad across engineering
interest we hope and to try to balance
those areas so they're not all in one
area of engineering but you know pick
things across different areas of
engineering the thought is that except
for our session organizers and speakers
there will perhaps be a few but not many
people who are expert in any of these
many of you will probably think like I
certainly think that i'm not expert in
any of the things that we're going to
hear about today but you know we're all
engaged you know achieving engineers and
so you know please tune in and sort of
the interdisciplinary discussion that
ensues you know it's really something we
want to us stimulate technically what
happens is there are suggestions from
for example former members at some point
you'll be solicited and asked if you
have suggestions for future meetings
give us your good ideas perhaps you'll
become a session organizer in a future
meeting you know are you know we get
other inputs through our staff from very
sponsoring organizations and through
other venues and at a certain point I'm
presented with a you know fairly long
list of options and information and I
have a you know get to choose a little
bit which ones sound exciting to me and
ask some more questions and so it's kind
of that route but much it comes in
through different different suggestions
than we try to pick to achieve a we
hopefully a balanced and very
interesting program in terms of the
people we had I'm told and at some point
I saw them all upwards of 350 applicants
for the meaning this year they have room
for about a hundred people and that
includes our speakers and so forth which
means we really have room to
take about 80 people out of the pool
that I mentioned and you know to very
high extent these you know everyone
looks extremely good really off to a you
know a very fast start in their career
so it's you know it's hard but you kind
of know that whatever we do you know
we're going to have a good set of people
but some of the things we look at our
tried again to bring people they're
balanced across the engineering
profession we try to as dr. best
mentioned you sort of have a good mix of
people from academia from industry and
from government and we also try to avoid
over-representation from any institution
we really wanted in sort of all ways
that we can think of to mix up the the
participants again to you know have
people are doing good things or on their
way or many cases already sort of doing
things at the forefront of their
profession and bring them together in a
group that they wouldn't normally see so
what's your responsibility here well
your responsibility or you know really
your opportunity is we hope everyone
will participate as actively as possible
dr. vests already mentioned that he
hasn't seen any case for discussion
stopped without being cut off so I find
that a little bit scary I would hate to
break that record but I'm confident it
won't be a problem but please at the end
of presentations we try to you know
budget in a good amount of time for
discussion that's one of the very
important snot just listen to talks but
it's it's the engagement in the
discussion quit questions at panel
sessions you will notice that there's
quite a bit of time for breaks and
really let me call the networking
opportunities get to know when each
other see what kind of interesting
things you hear see what kind of
collaborations may form and just to make
make the most of your time what
announcement I'm tasked with asking
people I don't see any out yet but we
ask you we ask you to please a if you
are tempted to
away your laptop's you know in these
days I know many of us and I do this are
so busy that we multitask and sort of
listen with one error and do email with
the other error and you know we can
imagine and do some more things we
really ask you to focus on what we're
what we're doing you know here
completely I have had people point out
before there are some there's some uses
for laptops that are in sync with that
for example people you know may want to
be entering notes and question points
and so forth so I leave it to you to you
know decide what sort of an appropriate
use or distracting use and stay tuned in
and so with that again I wish all of us
a a great meeting and I will now turn it
over to Michael seamer who is an
organizer our first session on additive
manufacturing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
