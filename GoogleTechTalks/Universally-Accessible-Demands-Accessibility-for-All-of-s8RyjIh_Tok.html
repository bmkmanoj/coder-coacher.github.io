terminar speaker for today I've known
Jim for over the last 14 15 years and he
is a pioneer in the field of
accessibility now I've always known that
Jim was a genius and I always know know
that what I know believe is right and I
was proven right yesterday because he
got the co genius of what is this year
one of this year's MacArthur Fellowship
Award winners Jim's done a lot of
interesting work in the technology field
and focuses a lot of his technology work
today on users with special needs which
makes his perspective here at Google
very interesting um he'll be talking to
us about universal access and you know
it's an accessibility the way I think
about it if you look at the google
search engine we scoured the whole web
and do very well at covering what we
call the long tail of contact so if the
you know our algorithms excel at finding
that right piece of nugget of
information that's hidden away in the
long tail and if you think about
accessibility one way to view it is
users are not all made the same either
just as each user cares about a
different piece of content each user is
different and today what we've done with
our interfaces is do an excellent job of
addressing what Jim refers to as the
head and there you know a lot of users
are but and you sort of then go down
that tail what does it mean to make the
world's information accessible to
everyone meaning truly everyone so take
it a video ok thanks a lot TV all right
so so I'm here as an engineer high-tech
entrepreneur social entrepreneur and
activist and so that's a lot of things
but you know I'm an old guy so I've done
a lot of these things so so what I want
to do is kind of cover how I got into
this particular way of using technology
basically helping people who are not
necessarily the people that the average
high tech industry focus is on that's
sort of ten percent of humanity that's
rich cited speaks English oh maybe it's
five percent of humanity whatever but
anyway instead thinking a little bit
more broadly about what things
do so going back I went to Caltech I was
a you know an engineer and the one good
idea came up with in school was well
learning how to make smart bombs so I
was in a modern optics class and we were
learning how to make an optical pattern
recognition device and of course the
example this being the 70s was how you
use that to target a smart missile and
so you would have a camera in the nose
of the missile and then you would have a
representation of the target a tank
bridge an airfield and the machine would
go out there would scan the environment
find the target lock on and go and blow
it up so I went back to my dorm room
going you know I wonder is there a more
socially beneficial application of this
cool technology and so then I came up
with the you know the only good idea had
in school which was you know you can
make a reading machine for the blind
with that no I didn't know any blind
people I don't know where the idea came
from and of course you know being a tech
I kind of felt like pond scum relative
to you know all these great Nobel Prize
winners and all this sort of things and
and you know the first lecture I went to
there was by Richard Feynman so so you
know I aspire to you know a couple of
milla fineman's on the genius scale but
anyway but it's um I went back talk to
my professor he said boy that sounds
cool good luck and so I came off I came
here to Stanford I still get a PhD
program a couple guys we found out about
there was something called business I
had no idea about business we brought in
some speakers into the engineering dorm
brothers memorial the first one was the
head of a private you know a personal
computer company and the second guy was
running a private rocket company so I
quit my PhD program joined the rocket
company and the rocket blew up on the
launch pad and so sitting there go back
to grad school so I try to start my own
rocket company and no one gave me three
hundred million dollars to start my own
rocket company I was really completely
disappointed so but then my former boss
from the rocket company said hey I've
got this buddy he's a he's a chip
designer at HP Labs and he has an idea
for a company so we got together at a
local restaurant and he said well I
think that we could make a custom chip
that rather than being a general-purpose
chip like a cpu
or a ROM or a you know memory could be
could actually read characters through
optical character recognition and of
course my reaction was that's cool you
can make a reading machine for the blind
with that so we went out and make a long
story short we raised 25 million dollars
in venture capital and we invented what
is called omni font character
recognition so at the time character
recognition came in essentially two
flavors font specific and this was just
in the area where people getting away
from typewriters so you know you would
buy a prestige elite ball or a courier
new ball and you could buy up would
read that font but only that font or you
had machines like the curt small machine
where you could train it you would teach
the machine so what we did instead of
that approach is we gathered millions of
examples of characters and we got a
network of 40 sun-tues at the time and
we compared everyone to every other one
and and kind of came up with a map of
what an e was like in our feature space
and what a see was like and then we
could say all this this character is
pretty close to a knee or a C and we
draw different boundaries around that so
we actually came up with something that
could read anything and this is what was
crucial to make a successful reading
machine for the blind because if you try
to scan a document and it doesn't work
ninety percent of the time you're not
going to keep beating your head against
that you know but if you could actually
read eighty or ninety percent of the
document pretty well you actually had
something useful not only for blind
people but for lawyers reading contracts
and the Postal Service routing the mail
and you know insurance claim forms and
the like so that's so we built a company
we did this and of course we sold the
venture capitalist on this big market
for optical character recognition and
but secretly we still wanted to build a
reading machine for the blind so after
about five years we had a secret team
building this reading machine and you
would take a piece of paper and you'd
stick it in the scanner you push a
button it would scan the page to get
picture do the character recognition
send it over to a PC and a very
mechanical hardware voice of the sizer
would say you know these aren't that
times that time and songs but much less
quality than that
so and our board say oh this is this is
really cool what's the market size and I
said well we think we think it's about a
million dollars per year and they said
well we fail to see the connection to
our 25 million dollar investment your
firm and that's the problem that
Benetech and I have been working on ever
since is there are many really cool
applications of technology that help
people that aren't
hundred-million-dollar markets that are
growing at forty percent a year and so
and that's what venture capitalist and
high tech companies generally are
looking for so we went off we started a
nonprofit tech company a deliberately
nonprofit tech company as opposed to all
the accidentally nonprofit tech
companies that I had been starting and
we within two years became a
five-million-dollar a year social
enterprise so it's the only high tech
company I've ever been associated with
that actually beat business plan but
partly is because our expectations were
set so low and what we did is we
actually created a charity so it was
actually a what's called a 501c3 that's
the charitable status but inside it
looked like a regular high tech company
you know we had a product manager we had
tech support people we had developers
you know we had a sit one salesperson
and so we went out and we over the 1990s
sold 35,000 reading machines reading a
dozen different Western European
languages with customers in 60 countries
and during that entire time period you
know we were profitable but we would
just spend the extra money on more
engineering or more outreach or whatever
and so we ran within one percent of
break even so in 1999 everyone thought I
was absolutely an idiot for not trying
to start a regular for-profit company
because everyone was going to come a
multi-billion her and so but but I
decide you know let's do more of this
and so we started talking to people
about raising money and about that time
a venture capital group back who bought
our reading machine for the blind
business from us for several million
dollars and we took that money and since
it was we were charity I couldn't pocket
it we put that money and we created
several new tech ventures and some of
these are I think very relevant to the
topic of my main top of my conversation
today which is accessibility and access
to information
the first one the first new venture I
came up with was because Eileen
Richardson who is the acting CEO of
Napster live two doors down and her
teenage son gave my teenage son Napster
a late 99 and so i came home and i said
hey Jimmy what's this new icon on the pc
yeah dad it's a it's a snap stir thing
it can't you know kid couple doors down
his mom works on it cool so we spent an
hour playing music you know he was
playing 90s Punk and I would play Pat
Benatar to show that we had music like
that too when I was young and I went
back and forth and I said gjv how much
did we pay for this and he said well
nothing dad nice and of course I'm a
software guy right I hated right oh my
god this is so illegal but it's so cool
and so immediately the idea came to my
mind could we do this for blind people
because we had all these people 35,000
people scanning books and it takes two
or three hours to scan a book by hand
and then if you want to proofread it
takes a lot more hours huh giant pain in
the ass and you know a best-seller come
out hundreds of our users will be
scanning it the same week and there's no
legal way they could share it so I did a
little bit of and I called this of
course book stir right so and so I ran
around I start talking about books sure
you saw that sounds kind of cool and
then someone told me if you call it
bookstore the publishers will sue you
into the ground so we renamed it
Bookshare and we found out that doing
this is actually legal under us
copyright law now they never could have
imagined the Napster model when they put
this change in the mid-90s into the
copyright law but it's at a non-profit
serving the people disabilities can do
not have to pay a royalty or get
permission to provide access to books so
we can scan any book we want to and we
don't have to get permission or anything
so whoa and of course the traditional
model of providing books to blind people
is you hire professional narrators with
real nice human narrator voices and they
record a book and it costs five ten
thousand dollars a book to do it this
way or you can do it with volunteers and
there's a volunteer studio here in Palo
Alto recording for the blind dyslexic
has a studio and that cost them two or
three thousand dollars if you include
all the staff time and the mastering
costs that well if you get blind people
already scanning books you know
even with a little bit of staff time
just to make sure we're being the
copyright law less than fifty dollars a
book to put in and this is in low
volumes you know so we start scaling up
so the other thing we did is we went to
the publishers a year before launching
and we addressed their copyright
committee and this is of course a group
of people that some people at Google are
actually talking to these days took it
out and and I described this this dream
of Bookshare and how we're going to do
this and and they said actually I think
was the main lawyer for the
association's that no one has ever come
to us and told us of their plans to
steal our stuff in advance before I said
it's not theft it's the bargain and
copyright law between IP owners and
society in there yeah yeah yeah can we
can we actually kind of like work with
you a little bit here and so we made a
few concessions in terms of digital
rights management but in general when
one of our users gets a book they can
unlock the drm container and take it out
of the lock why because people who want
access to ebooks want to do a gazillion
different things to it they want to
stick it on a Braille note-taker and
carry it around with them they want to
rip it to mp3 using a voice synthesizer
and carried on an ipod if they have low
vision they want to print it large they
want to put it in Braille so well what
we did instead of providing strong locks
which is the traditional digital rights
management approach we provide
essentially we clocks think of it as
like zip and strong social pressure okay
you here's this book we're giving you a
lot of power over it because you need it
for access don't screw up the rest of
the community who can't read print books
by posting it for free on the internet
and so when the publishers heard we were
serious about essentially not screwing
their mainstream market they got really
supportive and of course you may not be
surprised Tim O'Reilly gave us all of
his O'Reilly books for free to
distribute globally to people around the
world and that's one of the limitations
about using a copyright exemption thing
is that it only applies in the US so
right now actually three years after Tim
O'Reilly gave us global rights we're
starting to work on the major publishing
industry to give us those rights so that
we can provide books to everyone so
that's kind of oh yes question
he gave us the electronic content in
beautiful docbook XML with permission
and so a new books get published they
just have to be him to us and so I mean
O'Reilly is a great company and so but
we also i'm going to touch on these
things briefly before going into sort of
more the accessibility wrap we also we
wanted work in the human rights field
and because we had been break even
during that time period we didn't have
any extra money but when we got the
several million dollars for selling our
reading machine for the blind business
we went off to all the human rights
groups and said here's a hughes an
industry that does nothing but process
information and no one writes IT
solutions for them and yes I mean they
need a web browser and they need a word
processor and they need a simple
database but fundamentally a human
rights group has lots of other
challenges that aren't necessarily well
solved by your off-the-shelf solution
and so one of them is cryptography I
mean human rights groups have their pcs
stolen at a greater rate than any other
kind of group on the planet right so
because it's an information processing
how do you hurt them well if you're in a
country where they're not killing you
they steal your computer's so so what we
do is build strong crypto we made it
look like essentially a Eudora light so
it's something familiar user interface
and you know build public private key
crypto in there and free backup services
and it just happens automatically so you
sign in with your name and password and
the crypto and the backup happens
automatically and yet the this tiny
grassroots group and the riots you know
in some developing country actually
controls their information and who gets
to see it which is the key thing so so
we are now probably the leading IT group
that solves problems for human rights
groups or running software for
environmental groups and we're doing a
humanitarian landmine detector but about
half of what we do is around alcohol it
broadly literacy access to information
and one of the things that that's
happening is you know the world is
moving to a place where we're we're
moving away from sort of a charity model
for solving society's problems
you know the charity model works great
when you are a prisoner of war that's
where the Red Cross got started it works
great if you've just been hit by a
hurricane or a tsunami and you need food
and shelter and and and there's always
going to be a need for charity but one
of the things that we found is that
applying charity of the things like
technology often doesn't work give
someone a free piece of technology odds
are half the time they won't use it so
what you want to do is actually make the
technology accessible and affordable and
one of the great things of course about
the pc industry the networking industry
the web based industry is that we've
made lots and lots of technology with
very low marginal cost to serve these
other audiences so that's actually my
core mission actually as a non-profit
here in Silicon Valley is to spread the
word about how easy it is to do things
that access the larger population and no
ramen used the longtail argument you
know where where Google is focusing on
the long tail of web content but of
course you know the tail up you know in
the long tail on the bolt all depend on
what your frame is so if you think about
web content yes but then if you talk
about all the world's information oh
we're you know we're not even beginning
the scratch all the world's information
how we going to get access to that and
so that's where something like Google
printing Google library comes from and
I'll touch on that minute but you know
it's to try and get that that initial
information and actually reframe it well
think about the the long tail in terms
of humanity okay right now Google does a
good job of serving a certain number of
people who have pcs to a much lesser
extent have other kinds of devices and
provides them with access to this
information but there are large the
majority of humanity is still left out
of this equation and so part of my
advocacy is that the marginal costs to
serve the rest of humanity with
technology and information that they can
actually use is going down all the time
and we have immense power as
technologists as entrepreneurs to apply
that technology that content that
expertise that money to solving these
problems and it's actually
quite easy so first of all in making
information accessible one of the most
popular concepts and accessibility is
universal design if you make it easy for
everybody your market is actually going
to go up you know because the average
user of technology is not a 35 year old
average height and weight Caucasian male
okay that actually does not represent
the majority of humanity so if you
actually start broadening who you're
designing for you'll start saying oh I'm
doing something for people with low
vision oh well guess what most people
over 60 have some form of image
deterioration visual and duration and it
helps them you know there are a lot of
people who don't hear so well they won't
claim to be deaf but we all know people
who don't hear so well and so if you can
do something that allows them to get
access to information not purely in an
auditory fashion you've actually
increased your market and of course it's
much harder to retrofit a solution with
accessibility than it is to build it in
from the get-go and I think that that's
a lot of what the accessibility movement
is about is trying to get people
developers the people who write the
specs the product managers to actually
think okay it's going to add you know
half a percent to our development cost
to add in these extra features and you
know what it might actually enlarge our
market by five percent or ten percent
but people haven't been used to thinking
that way but we're now starting to
realize that you know to be as
successful as our companies want to be
we need to do that and I keep making
that argument on both sides of the
equation both the it makes business
sense and it makes social sense and if
it doesn't make businesses I'm going to
make the social sense argument next but
you know and you know and some people
some people will go purely on the social
argument so people go in the business
argument but I'm pretty familiar with
the way things work in Silicon Valley
just like my venture capitalist is said
you've got to be kidding what I said
we're going to go after this
million-dollar market investors and
business unit managers are always
looking for how to make some money so
what I want to do is help people frame
these important social missions in terms
of why it makes business sense so as we
sort of look at some of these
accessibility issues you know Google is
is increasingly ground zero for a lot of
these accessibility issues
and I'm going to touch on a few of those
examples you know as a technology google
started off with an incredibly
accessible tool okay simple user
interface equals universal accessibility
equals ease of use for blind people and
people who aren't very tech savvy and
people who don't read very well so the
less cluttered your presentation is the
better so it turns out that what Google
was doing was great and now Google is
experimenting with lots and lots of
additional services and products and
people aren't thinking about
accessibility when they're building them
and so we're getting a lot a steady
stream of new capabilities that suddenly
an existing part of Google's user base
can't use and suddenly the sort of
vision of Google is providing accessible
information starts to get chipped away
and you know people are going to come to
you and say do it because it's the right
thing and at Google I think that that
argument gets more attention that it
does that say it did it Microsoft when
we started working on the many years ago
but there are going to be other
pressures I mean you know I've talked
about the national by organizations who
are discussing should we be suing google
over google print because google print
is scanning all these books and
providing them in an image based format
that a blind person can't read so I as a
sighted person can look at that page and
read it and ramen and Jim can't and you
know is that fair oh no what's the
business case harder to make but I think
it's part of the social responsibilities
organization to start thinking about how
to solve that problem oh sorry Jim and
then we run into the other issue it's
not our stuff okay fundamentally when
Google is scanning books it belongs to
somebody else and then you're looking to
copyright law and fair use and other
concepts to get access to these books so
for the public domain books no problem
for let's call them the orphan works the
books that are out there but no longer
in print harder to get up
people probably don't care i don't think
the publishers and authors really care
about whether you guys scan a 1940 novel
that hasn't been in print for 20 years
or 60 years i mean they don't care and
then you've got essentially that front
end of the of the Bulge right the
current best seller is that the two
hundred thousand books that people are
actively interested in so and you know i
do know that google is working directly
with publishers to sign them up for
those sort of current books so it's a
permission thing so Google actually has
signed an agreement with a lot of these
publishers that says we won't give the
entire book to anybody we will only do
this this and this and then when I show
up and say well do accessibility they
say oh well we've already committed to
the publishing industry that we can't do
that so it's been an interesting
challenge for us and it turns out that
because of the current conflict between
publishers and Google the publishers
don't want to make any concessions to
Google even for a socially beneficial
thing so at the moment we're at a
stalemate for example there was one of
the five biggest publishers who was
working with us and with Google before
Google print was announced Google
library was announced so it back when it
was a permission based kind of deal and
they were going to give Google
permission to give us all their current
best sellers that they're providing
digitally and when the big thing blew up
the publisher said oh god no we don't
want to do it with Google right now how
about we give you the content directly
just like O'Reilly is doing but don't
tell anyone we're doing it so now we've
got a pile of great new perfect
best-selling books with global rights
because they are we also convinced Lee
give us global rights but we can't tell
anyone who it is and so now I'm going
around trying to come in sailor
publishers well I have what are your
cohorts oh I can't tell you who it is
they're like is there a problem wow you
know so so I do it give you some idea of
some of the complexity but it gets back
to if you think about the publishers and
you think about what does it cost them
to give us the rights to serve blind
people around the world how many books
are they selling the blind people around
the world right now not a lot and so for
my stable I say what's the sleeves off
your best why should you care just going
to give it to us and as long as we can
uphold the social deal they'll give it
to us well start
taking this argument a step further
there you know blind people aren't the
only disadvantage people in this world
right there are people with other
disabilities and there are awful lot of
people who are poor and we're not
serving them all that well how about you
give me the right to deliver that same
digital book to poor people the
developing world and you know tell you
what um I'll even give you half of the
money I make and I promise you that
whatever your cereals were four books in
Sierra Leone I'll triple it so even at
half of whatever I charge even if i only
charge a buck and so I think that what I
want to give you some idea is that we
have access to the intellectual property
owners the authors and the publishers we
do business with them we speaking
generally Silicon Valley Google and the
like and people innately would like to
do the right thing as long as it they
don't get screwed by it and so we have
to construct these kinds of deals to
make this possible one of the other
genius award winners I'm sorry MacArthur
Fellowship sigh got to use the
politically pret room is victoria hale
and she runs a non-profit pharma company
in san francisco and it's exactly the
same analog you know there's this drug
it saves a hundred thousand lives a year
those are poor people in india why would
any pharmaceutical company ever do that
and none will because a hundred thousand
poor people a year can never pay what it
costs to do a clinical trial in the US
and so they dropped that drug like a hot
potato it's the same thing that happens
in almost every other area that involves
intellectual property and so if we can
go to them and say well watchu licenses
the right to go after this thing so
Victoria goes and says give me the right
to make this drug to fight this parasite
disease that affects people in India and
if the drug turns out to be useful for
something else you can continue to sell
it in you know if it turns out to be
good for lifestyle issues in North
America because that's where the money
is so so accessibility is the same kind
of thing you know we've got immense
amount of information we've got it in
immense server farms we're
getting our hands on it we have
platforms that are dirt cheap there are
a billion cell phones in the hands of
people around the world and another four
years they're going to be 2 billion cell
phones how do we use the incredible
infrastructure for a low marginal cost
to change the world and the next project
that we're getting launching launched is
we've taken a technology that was
developed for people down syndrome it's
designed around teaching Down syndrome
young adults to read and we're doing it
we r beta testing it here at car which
is middlefield road and palo alto it's
the local rehab center that focuses on
people developmental disabilities and
the whole idea is that if you're a young
adult with developmental disability
you're no longer in school you don't
have access to a primary school teacher
and yet if you can learn to read your
chance for an independent life to live
alone or live in a group home rather
than an institution your ability to be
independent get a job goes way up if
you're literate so imagine that you have
content based on creative commons
licensed images so like flickr images
because i don't want to pee pee for what
they want to charge me for their
pictures and a little bit of text you
know a 16 page book on tiger woods'
tiger wears red great picture of tiger
woods and then in the corner there's a
little teacher icon that instructs the
literate but in expert teacher the
parent the volunteer the special
education aid how to teach reading gee
Tiger where is red look at Tigers red
shirt do you know what letter the word
red starts with is it L R or tea and if
it the person chooses L you say well it
could be L but then it would sound like
this lead in but it's red so it's our
let's go on and of course that's the way
an expert teacher would teach it as
opposed to me which might say no you
stupid get it's not L it's our car you
know that's not actually the way to
teach reading so so we're actually
rolling this out for diwali disabled
people but you know can you imagine the
exact same content on a cell phone and a
literate twelve-year-old girl teaching
her illiterate mother how to read on the
family cell phone okay its technological
barriers
zip licensing barriers nothing because
we have creative commons it you know
images that we can distribute everywhere
so what it is it's more of a
distribution operational channel
challenge and is some kind of need to
get really rich on it no at least not
now so someone has to do it so part of
what my mission is is to encourage the
people who control technology and
content to be open-minded about the
social applications of their technology
low marginal cost protecting you from
from essentially leakage into your main
market or undercutting your main your
main financial strategy and whether you
go up and do it yourself you know as an
entrepreneur to just chooses to wear
social hat or whether you do it as a
company they decide to do it as part of
your social responsibility or you just
let someone do it let's not erect
artificial barriers to making sure that
everyone benefits from the information
in this world and the technology that
we've all helped create so thank you
very much so I'm happy to go into
answering questions and focusing more on
anything that you guys are interested in
hearing about sup we have a questions
problem there's something that you want
to make sure I said
you get into a deep excessive is a man
okay yes if you see any promises
yeah and so the social contract is not
perfection but active honest efforts to
minimize the damage is if i go to
something to add the perfect year-round
the villain will ever violated you know
that's like a challenge so we have
suspended the accounts of less than five
blind people who have violated our terms
of service by disturbing the books to
people that they weren't supposed to
distribute them and when the publishers
here that we've actually done that that
reassures them are we because no
publisher on the plant wants the SU of
line person even if they've broken the
law but as an organization that's in
this community we can actually say luck
and our community agrees with us what
this is part of the deal let's let's not
post that book for free on the internet
because and of course publishers all
know that all these books are published
23 on the in it already anyway it's part
of trying to encourage people who can't
afford books back to buy the books and
not being a source of people who could
afford my book to get it for free and
that's actually more important I'll give
you a really have a funny example is we
work with the publishers for a year and
then we've heard from science fiction
and fantasy writers of america which is
the most technically savvy authors group
and there is no office association every
genre has a bit of a mystery writers
guild so section leader
and every science fiction writer that I
had read as a kid started sending me
email like you are the devil incarnate
you are stealing myself and my God and
obey me what did I do wrong and so and I
kept going now now now and I said I
talked to the publishers turns out
science fiction writers hate publishers
of the passion because most of them are
making a living being a science fiction
writer so so we actually they actually
threaten the siouxes even though what we
were doing was legal and I would end
itís said look we're really a
non-profit we're really only helping
disabled people we will support you in
fighting piracy because because the
electronic piracy of books is the most
rampant in the science fiction area for
probably obvious demographic reasons and
and we'll give any author who wants
rights to come and inspect the book on
Bookshare and look at the number of
errors from our scanning and
proofreading and if it falls a bolo
higher than our minimum threshold knows
we set a higher bar the publisher going
to ask us to pull the book until we i
mean the author can ask is fully booked
until we fixed it and in exchange the
science fiction authors will will
encourage all science fiction authors in
their membership to give us the direct
digital content for free globally so we
can serve blind people zero authors have
asked for access but dozens of authors
have given us global missions it really
was making more of an acknowledgement
that authors are important and that we
cared about their economic issue they
were willing to let us have the one
percent of the population who cannot
pick up a book and read it normally yes
you know I see authors being in a
stronger position versus publishers in
the future so you know we now see people
developing their books online or
insisting on a Creative Commons
licensing deal as part of their
publishing contract and you know I will
contrast the publishing industry to the
recording industry okay the publishing
industry fundamentally is more socially
minded and conscious and has
traditionally done these kind of deals
for society on the side whereas the
recording of the street never has an
enema and a moment yeah so so I think
the publishing industry is a little bit
more socially minded but um and you know
I mean you know the latest issue of wire
talks about you know bands way around
the big I a I think that's probably a
good thing I think we'll see a sort of a
more robust culture where yeah I mean I
see a lot more self publish books
they're actually quite good just because
they can't convince a publisher to do it
and yet you know the 500 people you
really must want to read that book
and doing more katsu yes
a you an example of great country model
in Hungary if you win the equivalent of
the nobel prize for literature and
hungarian they pay you I think the
equivalent of three times a normal wage
per year and all of your works become
electronically available to all
Hungarians for free I mean and you know
no one turns it down you know and so but
I mean I mean so I think we've got a lot
of different models and and actually
that was one of my pitches to the
publishers is you know it costs our
members fifty dollars a year for all the
books they can read and we have a
hundred and fifty daily newspapers that
land on our site every morning we get a
direct feed from the newspaper industry
and we format it into digital Braille or
into digital talking books and we
downloaded directly to users and fifty
bucks here for all you can read I said
look this is a chance for an
all-you-can-eat model that you guys can
watch and if it works you can say what a
great idea let's do that and if it
doesn't work you can say what a terrible
idea but of course that was that special
social thing so I think this
experimentation actually leads to a much
greater access to people yes ma'am
as a rock
she offered
choose that
she
a job
which is
which is I love this
because
google says did you eat
I kind of approach our
and of course me the nickname in the
accessibility field our virtual / cuts I
mean curb cuts are put in so that people
in wheelchairs can even go on the corner
you can go on the sidewalks on the
street well it turns out of course that
the most frequent users of curb cuts are
not the wheelchairs it's people pushing
baby strollers and delivery guys with
boxes and pardon me yep it ever big
benefits of it so it turns out that in
many many cases a technology that helps
disabled people helps non-disabled
people inside universal design concept
and you know he you know what I meant to
type instead of what I did type helps a
lot more people who are dyslexic you are
a lot of us justice times and actually
Bookshare is is also for people with
severe dyslexia so they don't have to
hire a leader that's that's why our
biggest potential market but we've been
kind of start with the blank is there
the most technically savvy and then we
branch out to schools to kitchen
possessive is much harder to identify
this lots of people outside of school
the powers for
or under the physical disability that I
can't hold a book several policies so
great yes Jeff actually exporting
psychological challenge
well the issues generally aren't the
technology you know i mean the issues
are lousy connectivity an ISP that's run
by essentially the secret police people
who you know the reason that they're
human rights activists is because their
family was murdered and they were a
farmer and now they're very passionate
about their cause but you know they
didn't go to university they don't know
how to use Tech and now they're being
thrust into this role that's actually
throughout the social sector you know I
say the social sector is often two to
twenty years behind the business sector
in terms of its use of technology and
yet you know I mean think about some of
the problems we're facing you know
global illiteracy hiv/aids economic
development women's empowerment all
these issues that technology is going to
be a piece of and even if you assume
that we have a limited amount of
resources if we can if we make those
resources work twice as hard then we get
twice as much social good for a certain
amount of money so I mean technically
you know we I'll tell you what we do and
I'll be quite honest one of our metrics
for a project is low technical risk see
our business plan is we're going to try
and take a technology from a company or
you know or from a lab or university and
we're going to try and make it into a
standalone self-supporting tech venture
for a million or two million bucks so if
we have to hire an army of programmers
to invent something from scratch that
that's your sort of 10 or 20 million
dollar project not your million dollar
project so so we go for a low technical
wrist so usually it's much more in this
operational risk and also the fact is is
that we have very few competitors and
that that's kind of scary sometimes
because we don't actually know what the
right solution is and one of the things
that you know we keep finding out
working for example with disabled people
or human rights groups or environmental
groups is the problems we think they
have are not the problems that they
think they have and usually they're
right and so we have to actually pay
some attention to that occasionally you
can invent something completely new that
they don't know that they need and then
they like it but that's the exception
rather than the rule usually you know
let's say for things
yes
Oh
okay the I'll contrast it with Silicon
Valley's high-tech approach if I create
a brand new startup company in Silicon
Valley or I create a great project
inside of a high-tech company and the
technology works and customers are
excited and it's going to grow fast the
money flows not easily but I mean we
definitely have a way that that we
reward success with more resources and
you can take off okay the social sector
works in the opposite way okay the if
you want to get big well abundant Grand
Tours traditional foundations will say
well we funded you two or three years
ago we're done now we're on to the next
thing right and oh you're big so you
must not need our support anymore so
actually the access to growth capital
for scale is probably the number one
issue for social entrepreneurs and and
actually a in about in the next couple
weeks okay I have a paper coming out on
this that i co-wrote with a guy from
calvert which is one of leading social
responsible investment funds as well as
jet Emerson who's sort of a very famous
homeless advocate here in San Francisco
and it's all around you know can we
actually set up a system the social
sector that rewards risk-taking rather
than punishes it and and it punishes it
a lot of ways not just money and then
actually encourages people to go off and
do this and as one of reasons why I'm
excited about technology is that you
know to a great extent most things that
we're doing have been developed by
somebody else try it out technical risk
is low and i'm building out the last
social mile me you know and you know
what i mean i don't ya because my brain
goes to you know Google's founders right
and Bill Gates ellis cose I mean Bill
Gates can set out to back say every kid
on the planet and it's not a stupid idea
he might not succeed but it's plausible
and you know and he's got a team of
people there who are sort of system at
going about it you know there are a
hundred people in Silicon Valley who
could set out to have a literacy on the
planet and have a one in five chance of
succeeding you know it's actually
plausible I think people forget the
amount of power and leverage that are
here in this community that we usually
use to create new companies and new
ideas well social ideas are
some of the coolest problems that you
could be working on how do we actually
make it possible to make a living doing
that because you know I talked to an MBA
student who comes out of grad school
with a hundred thousand dollars of the
debt you know I may not be able convince
them to go work in the social sector for
forty thousand dollars a year you know
there's a fundamental structural problem
there so some of the NBA schools are
actually setting up something where
they'll forgive all your debt if you go
into the social sector yeah and you know
why why don't we do that for engineers
you know I mean we have I mean lawyers
have a pro bono tradition doctors you
know will volunteer in low-income
clinics right now we focus our effort on
the open source folk area which to be
honest is mainly geeks developing for
other geeks where the geeks developing
for the rest of humanity and so how do
we set it up I mean we have a few good
examples you know I think I think you
know Mitchell Baker at Mozilla has I've
got you know is actually you know their
average customer is not a technologist
now they're building on the back of a
whole bunch of open-source work that was
done with Mozilla because technologists
were passionate about it but it gave
them that platform that then they could
add you know the user you know interface
experience a little bit a product
management and then go up and take over
whatever it is eight or ten percent of
the browser market you know we should be
doing this in every area you can imagine
and it's within our power anyway do it
do it don't do it so any more questions
yeah Robin you what you had one
together
and each serving from
I so closely
one laptop per child 5 box we have
qualitative snail but so I
is not harm the single
may
do
creative content
and that final part of passion that you
get
here
the final say
right
hi look at this issue it's just another
version of the volunteer challenge you
know we get a lot of volunteers you know
people who want to volunteer for us and
you know if you're a book lover and you
like chopping books apart and proof
reading books we've got a web-based
solution where we can manage hundreds
actually thousands of volunteers with a
porter kind person because we've
invested the time into the
infrastructure but if you come in to us
and say I'm an expert in crypto and I
want to come and help you guys it takes
a lot of our mind share so we actually
have to design a project so that you is
the crypto volunteer that extra techie
can come in and help us out and it's
also a good use of our time so these
volunteer deals are the sort of partner
the open source community right now
delivers acknowledgment which is what is
the primary currency of a volunteer did
what I do make a difference and it makes
the kind of changes that you want to
make pretty possible you know I want to
see this patch an Apache because I need
this capability and you know was a very
great and scratch your own niche then so
what we're trying to do and this is
something I'm hoping that we do with
some of the money that we're
increasingly getting is to set up sort
of these more structured volunteer
options where you know again we're going
to start small you to 25 people can
volunteer 10 hours a week and and have
us help tell them you may not know what
blind people in the developing world
need but we've spent time with them our
product manager the project leader
actually know what they need and if you
do
this it's going to matter and and you
know I think firefox you know did a good
job of that and managed to keep the
community we need to replicate more
models of that and you know I know that
the spirit is there in that Brian
belador mr. patchy music I want to do
more social stuff I want to help you do
more social stuff you know so so anyway
I don't know ramen if that is that's not
address your question but I think you
know people need a real opportunity if
you can eat them off like the model
that's different than the ones that we
traditionally have which is make a lot
of money and then we have this other
more socially oriented models of the
open source and I think like the open
content movement is a great example of
something that's kind of bridging some
of these gaps I mean the average user of
open content is not a geek helping a
geek get someone sharing a picture on
flickr or you know or a band that
decides the putting out their stuff on
open content is going to actually help
them get more gigs and therefore they're
going to make more money in a better
living so so I think we need to keep
that going so yes
there any way she can
yes but this will be an interesting
statistic the majority of blind people
in the US are over 60 less than five
percent Bookshare users are over 60 and
there's reasons for this one is
computers comfortableness I mean we
don't have a human speaking these books
we have a voice synthesizer speaking the
block and their average seniors
especially of the 80 to 90 cohort when
screaming from the room when the
computer starts speaking even though we
made some advances of that so generally
it's the person so its own use and what
are the solutions available to someone
and what do they want to accomplish so
the Library of Congress provides free
books on tape anyone who's blind it
comes in the mail they're actually
delivered on audio cassette tape still
okay but it's free and the narrator's
are really high quality and so I'd say
that your average person in their 90's
of loss division is taking advantage of
Library of Congress's free service and
it probably feels a need that they
actually have if you have someone who's
really how to motivate it then you know
there are ways to teach but but you know
I mean a lot of us have had people or
seniors who don't have a disability it's
hard enough to get them engaged with
technology and so you have to find the
 whether it's email or digital
photography when Ephraim so if you can
find a hook you know
your favorite mystery author isn't going
to be out for another year or always
never recorded by the by the audio book
industry so the only way you're going to
read it is by listening to the computer
place then we might actually have salt
pepper what a technology option that
someone actually care enough about Vicky
endeavored to do it and the person to
come on us to keep making that there you
slower so well great well I wanted to
thank you guys I know it's it's a little
bit after 12 and I really appreciate you
coming and hearing about social
applications of technology and if you
have great ideas if you have buddies you
couldn't get into google and you want to
send us it out we're hiring get out
first I don't want to poach here can't
compete in salary or anything like that
but I think there is you know I think
there are a lot of people in tech world
and need to know that these options are
out there and we want to help either
help them join us for help connect them
with some of the other projects because
even though Benetech is not a funder at
all we do our own projects I'd say that
most people were doing tech social
enterprise end up coming through just
because well you must know where the
honey is right it's up we try to help
them out want to thank you guys again
for coming today and today interesting
