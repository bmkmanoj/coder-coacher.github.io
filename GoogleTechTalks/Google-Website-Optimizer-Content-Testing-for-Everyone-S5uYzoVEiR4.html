for coming out to Google tonight for our
talk my name is Greta cook and this is
my coworker right here Victor janovski
we are both engineers on the Google
Website optimizer project and we're so
happy to have you here tonight so I'm
going to give just sort of a brief
introduction into the web content
testing product space and before I do
that I'm actually a little bit curious
how many of you already know something
about this space so how many of you
believe that you know what web content
testing is behalf okay how many of you
have actually set up a Navy experiment
on web pages all those same people okay
how about a multivariate experiment just
a few hands okay great thanks very much
all right so let me just introduce the
space for the other half of you who
don't know very much about it what we're
doing here is we are trying to help web
marketers increase the conversion rate
of their pages so let me define that for
you when you have a website you're
probably trying to get something to
happen with that website if you have a
business and you're selling a product
then you're trying to get people to buy
the product if they buy the products
then you can consider them a successful
conversion but it doesn't have to be
just selling a product you might be
trying to get people to download
software or fill in a form or something
along those lines now everybody who
comes to your site is a visitor is a
presentable conversion but what we found
is that of all the people who come to
your site almost all of them leave again
after just a few seconds maybe it wasn't
at all what they were looking for maybe
it was just a bad idea to click on that
thing in the first place or maybe you
didn't do enough to
have them in the first few seconds when
when they come to the site so we call
all those people bounces now of the
people who stick around and actually
explore the site a little bit just these
small fraction of green people remaining
right here quite a quite a number of
them are still not going to convert
they're going to look around they're
going to decide that what you have to
offer is not what they wanted so they're
abandoning your site and you're left
with just this tiny little wedge of
conversions right here these are the
only people who have actually taken the
action that you wanted them to take now
you know this company this hypothetical
company that has this website has
invested potentially quite a lot of
money and making sure that this green
bar is big it may be that the company
has purchased advertising to get people
to come to their site and unfortunately
only this many of them are actually
taking the action so people are pretty
good at making this farming and our tool
is focused on making this far bigger
with respect to the incoming traffic now
I'm kind of playing on playing into that
idea when people buy advertisements
that's a tool that a lot of people are
really comfortable doing at this point
they they know how to you know for
example with Google participate in the
AdWords program they get the ads to
appear and also a lot of people are
becoming pretty comfortable with a tool
like Google Analytics which allows you
to track all the visitors to your site
and see how they're moving through the
site what they're clicking on where
they're abandoning the site and where
they're continuing through this tool
with a google website optimizer is kind
of the next step in making your sighting
successful so it's looking to actually
make the content on the site good so
once people get there getting them to
convert now how do companies decide what
to put on their site one way that they
do it is by
I going to what we call the hippo that
stands for the highest paid person in
the organization now this person is
really important you know they can throw
their weight around in meetings and they
have strong opinions about what they
want to have on the site whatever they
say goes that's one way where the
content comes from another way is maybe
the company has hired a creative genius
who went to a fancy design school and
they have a lot of ideas about what kind
of flash movies to put on the site
that's going to make everybody buy the
product or download the software
whatever it is these are both good ways
to start with but unless you're actually
measuring what's going on and trying to
improve it you may find that the
customers are just hitting the back
button so here's what we're going to
talk about tonight um fixer and I are
actually going to sort of tag team this
talk so Victor will come up and he will
show you how you set up an experiment
using google website optimizer that part
maybe a little bit repetitive for some
of you who have set up experiments
before sorry about that but we'll try to
get stupid quickly then I will give you
a beside behind the scenes of view of
how that experiment actually works then
Victor will come back and show you some
of the technical design decisions and
some of the trade-offs that we made in
constructing the product and then I will
wrap up over to you Victor thanks for
Anna hi everyone thanks good to be here
so i won't talk about how to set up an
experiment and i'm going to motivate
this by giving a concrete example so you
probably heard about picasa which is
google's photo organizing and sharing
tool and this is what their land pay
landing page look like you know sings
human believes in eating our own dog
food which means that we try our
products to make sure that they actually
work for the user the picasa theme
descent they try to optimize their own
landing page so what they were trying to
do is make this page more convincing so
that if you see this page you will
convert and for them a conversion was
landing on the download page so if you
get here thing that means fewer
conversion and
the landing page was successful what
they decided the test was the content of
outlining read the headline the download
text and the image and by using website
optimizer me running experiment and they
were able to get a three percent
increase in their conversion rate and
their landing page at after the
experiment is this one this is a winging
page that led to the increase
conversions and one thing I'd like to
emphasize here is that the reason why
you need to experiment is so you can get
actual data common knowledge would say
that having an image of your product
will be really helpful it turns out that
the image was not helpful for picasa
there were more conversions without me
and makes men with and that's why you
need to meet testing your your web
content acai i'm going to walk you
through the process of setting up an
experiment and as we do that i'd like
you to keep in mind that the Wizards
that i'll be showing are targeted at
users who may not be HTML savvy all
thing it's a marketing person in an
organization who wants to set up an
experiment and he or she may or may not
have access to the actual page source so
we created them it starts to make that
whole process easier for them and one
thing that you'll find is that actually
instrumenting your pig has shown the
alternate content is where a lot of
people get hung up we do the actual
instrumentation using javascript and for
a lot of people and that's a problem so
we try to make that easier and to
provide feedback along the way so to get
to the website optimizer you log into
your AdWords account you don't need to
me running a gallon or campaign and you
don't need to spend any money but you do
need to be logged into AdWords there's a
link at the top that says website
optimizer and that's what you click to
see your experiment list this is a list
of all the experiments you've set up
whether you're still sending them up
whether they're running whether they
complete it and you can see in this
example I have one experiment that I'm
running and let's pretend them planning
on the link on the
Papa says create another experiment the
first thing you see is a choice between
two types of experiments and for those
of you who are not familiar with the
different types of tests let me tell you
what they are UAV experiment which is a
simplest type to test when this let's go
to your site they see either one version
of the page or a completely different
version and we see which one of those
two is most effective in getting your
visitors to do what you want them to do
like my product or download software or
what have you and of course you're not
limited to pages you can have as many
pages as you want a multivariate
experiment is slightly more complicated
there you have one landing page but you
identify sections of your page that you
want to vary independently in the picasa
example for example they might have
tried different headlines and different
images so if they have three hemlines
and three images they had a total of
nine different combinations so if you
were a visitor and you went to picasa
your experience with the one of nine
possible experiences and our tool lets
you find out which of those experiences
is most effective in getting your users
again to convert for this example let's
pretend we're doing an AV experiment
you're taking to a checklist that lists
all the information that you will need
to set up your experiment and the reason
we have this is because we've found
through experience that people often
start going through the process and then
get frustrated because they can't
proceed any further interestingly though
usability tests have shown that people
don't really read checklists so we try
to make the text really short and
they're still didn't help and we try
putting a check box at the bottom now
will not let you continue until you
actually check the checkbox and that's
ill doing help that's the best we can do
after you've done that you actually set
up your experiment you provide a game
which is what you see in your experiment
list or in your report and you provide
the URLs for the pages that you want to
test you provide you
I'll for your original page and for your
variation page and you can game your
variation so that you you can refer to
them more easily in your reports one
thing we do when you enter the URLs is
we go out and make sure that the page is
accessible and if it's not we gave you a
warning and if it is we give you a
confirmation in this case you see page
found and again the reason we do that is
to hold people's hands because the
people who might be using this product
may not me web developers themselves
finally you identify the conversion page
and then your basic setup is done now
comes the complicated part and that's
actually instrumenting your pages we
give you a choice between having your
web team thinks all the tags or excel in
the tax yourself if you're a marketing
person who doesn't know HTML unless you
have access to the pages this is what
you'll choose obviously if you're a mom
pop operation you'll probably do this
either way the expressions are the same
but we do give you a choice and if you
choose a web team installation all you
have to do is email a URL to the
appropriate person and they'll see the
expressions the expressions we found the
gang usability tests are kind of
intimidating so we try to we try to
guide people step-by-step by
highlighting what page they're working
on I'm making it very clear that they
are these snippets of code that they
have to paste on their pages before you
can proceed once you think in pace of it
we make you validate pages before you
can continue and when that happens we go
out we fetch the pages and we make sure
that this grip actually was copied in
the correct location and if it is you
can prove scene if not you are asked to
go back and fix the errors and we try to
give you informative error messages for
that
now let me step back a minute and talk
about what the instrumentation looks
like at a high level we'll get into a
bit more detail later in the top pouring
AV experiment recall that you have a
test page this will be your original
page what you are using before and you
have the new pages that you want to test
and then you have your conversion page
this is where people download or buy or
convert so to instrument your pages you
put a control strip at the top of your
test page when the listener to your site
tries to displays that page the control
strip will contact google and get
information about what content is
supposed to be displayed and then the
page will display that huntin and I'll
talk about that a bit later and then at
the bottom of the page you we have a
tracking script which tells Google that
yes and then you have seen this page
this is an impression for your variation
pages and you might get redirected
through a variation page because of the
control strip that were there again we
tracked you to keep count that you saw
page v or page see or what have you
finally you go through the whole process
and download process at checkout process
and you hopefully you get to make
conversion page and there again we have
a conversion spread that tells Google
that yes you convert it and these
statistics impressions and the
conversions are what we use in the
reports for a multi-variant experiment
no markup is slightly more complicated
again if this is the HTML representation
of your pages you have a control script
that ask google went huntin to actually
display and then you need to instrument
the content on your pages you identify
which sections you want to vary you put
a snippet of code before and after and
you do this for every such session so
for picasa for example that would be
their headline their image they're
downloading out text and in the UI you
can provide authoring a content for each
of those sections so when the viscera
schnauzer comes along
it fetches the combination information
and then as a partisan some rest on the
page it knows what to display and again
as in the AV experiment you have a
tracking strip at the bottom to record
the impressions and the commercial strip
at the bottom with your conversion page
through recorded conversions once you've
tagged up your pages either Amy or
multivariate you're ready to launch your
experiment you get a final confirmation
page preview your experiment and you're
set to go so you launch your experiment
it runs for a while and then you want to
see the results the results something
like this this is the reports page that
we have for each user experience for
each content combination that your users
see we try to estimate the conversion
rate and we provide the bar to give a
confidence interval this means that with
ninety-five percent confident a real
conversion rate for that particular page
is what's shown there we show you the
commercial rate for your original page
and then for your alternate content and
we actually rank this listing so that
the best performing combinations are on
top and using this page you can compare
how one page did relative to the
original and in this case you see that
humming issuing 11 did really really
well so you might want to switch your
website over to always use combination
living and you'll get more more
conversions for a multivariate
experiment we also give you some
additional information and that is the
page settings this tells you for each of
those sections that you identify in your
HTML page how relevant it is to the
actual success of that page now this is
somewhat simplicity that it doesn't take
into account how long section my
influence another it doesn't take into
account correlations might not give you
an idea of what might be a place to
focus your attention and yeah I'll hand
it over to Greta who will talk about the
internals
make sure all my microphones are still
one of those for the video camera the
other one is so that you all can hear
what I'm saying all right so now i'm
going to give you that behind-the-scenes
tour I promised you of how that
experiment actually works you've seen
how it was set up and now we're going to
see what happens when an end user
actually comes to the experiment and
lands on that landing page and
potentially converts so for this
experiment we're going to be talking
about a fictitious online bicycle
retailer so it's a company trying to
sell bikes on the web and they're called
Timbuktu com it's made up I think if you
go there you'll you'll see some you know
domain reseller okay here is our diagram
of here in the corner we have Alice
she's the end user she is thinking about
buying a bike she's done you know some
kind of web search and found links and
she has clicked on a link that takes her
to the timbuk2 com server which I guess
it must be a mom and pop operation if
they're serving from a computer that
actually has a head on it rather than
not of a server rack but I guess my clip
art collection was that this
comprehensive as it could've been anyway
here's Timbuktu calm she has requested
this file bikes HTML which is the
landing page for Timbuktu calm and when
she retrieves that page here it comes to
her and it's just as you saw in Victor
slides a few moments ago it's a
multivariate experiment so we have the
control script at the top we have three
sections in the middle and then we have
the tracking script at the bottom so in
this case perhaps three sections
represented a headline and image and
maybe a navigation button at the bottom
so as her browser begins to render this
page the first thing that comes to is
that control script at the top the
control script is going to gather up
three pieces of information it's going
to find the experiment ID that is the
you know the
this is the timbuk2 to a common
experiment it's going to take note of
what the current time is and it's going
to look on alice's computer to see if
she already has some cookies present
indicating that she's already a part of
this experiment it will then packaged up
those three things and send them as
query arguments to a get request for a
file called Saito Jas and it's going to
send that request to Google so I'm going
to back up just for a second here and
explain a little bit about what's going
on in this big cloud that I've labeled
Google as you can imagine there's a lot
of products and services served out of
the domain google com and somehow when
we get a request sent to some host
google com / some path we have to make
sure that that request goes to the
writing process so in this case the
exact host name and path for this site
open joyous request indicates to google
that we want it to go to a specific
process the content server for website
optimizer so the request actually lands
at the content server and not just you
know we don't just run one copy of this
content server you know in Mountain View
California we actually run lots of
copies of this all over the world and we
make sure that Alice's request goes to a
particular copy of the content server
that is close to her and when I say
close I might mean geographically close
but what I really mean is closed on the
network so we want to make sure that her
certain her request gets served quickly
because remember this is happening at
the very top of the page so if this
takes a long time Alice isn't seeing any
of the rest of this page yet we can't
have it take a long time because we
don't want to affect Alice's experience
when she's looking at timbuktu com
alright so the content server receives
the request and it looks at those
arguments I think I have more
information here yes it decides which
combination data to send back to her it
decides on the basis of those three
arguments that she sent before so it
looks at the experiments
need to make sure that it's sending
Timbuktu calm data and not say because
the data that wouldn't be any good it
uses that current time that she sent to
make sure that that request actually
gets all the way to the content server
we don't want the request to be
satisfied by some cash in between and so
by having the date in the URL there's no
way that the URL will match a previous
request then finally it uses the cookies
to determine if alice is already a part
of this experiment if she has previously
visited Timbuktu com we want to make
sure that we are serving the same
content she saw last time we don't want
her to sit there clicking refresh seeing
a different picture every time she
clicks we want it to be the same so in
this case alice is a first time visitor
to Timbuktu com so the content server is
going to choose a culmination randomly
when the content arrives at her computer
now her computer can continue to render
the page it's going to fill in the
actual headline image and button that
was selected randomly for her and then
we'll make it all the way down to the
bottom of the page so at this point the
latency is over Alice the human end user
is not noticing any anymore ill effects
if any wherever there in the first place
from that the fact that she's taking
part of the experiment we get to the
tracking script at the very bottom of
the page this is also requested from
google but is requested from a different
process within google it's requested
from the tracking server which is
actually a part of an entirely separate
product here website optimizer takes
advantage of the fact that we already
have Google Analytics available to us
Google Analytics is an entirely separate
product that lets users excuse me lets
customers track how users click through
their sites and that's exactly what we
want to do in website optimizer we want
to see how users are
from the landing page all the way to the
conversion page so we just make use of
that existing functionality in Google
Analytics we request a function called
urgent tracker and then the way that we
actually instrument the fact that or the
way that we record the fact that alice
is now taking part in this experiment is
we request a single one pixel image UTM
dodge if this is the way Google Google
Analytics does all of its tracking so at
this point Ellis has been reported as an
impression for the experiment now she's
going to continue to click around within
the site and what do you know Alice
decides to buy a bike so she picks out
the bike she puts it in her shopping
basket she enters her shipping
information and her billing information
she clicks confirm and now the sale is
final she's being shown that page that
says Thank You Alice for buying a bike
you'll receive it in four weeks and at
that point Alice has converted so her
browser requests this Thank You HTML
timbuk2 column serves it back to her
this is the conversion page for that
experiment so it has that tracking
script at the bottom this page renders
instantly from Alice's point of view
because there's no instrumentation on
the top of it at all and just as in the
case of the landing page this tracking
script talked to the tracking server
back at Google and records the fact that
Alice did in fact convert so now when
the operator of timbuktu comes back and
looks at his report let's say Alice was
randomly served combination 90 so here's
the line for combination 90 in this
report if you look all the way over on
the right side you see the number of
impressions and the number of inversions
other way around actually number of
conversion
over a number of impressions and because
Alice did convert one of each of those
was her and that particular combination
did pretty well ok Victor you want to
give him some technical stuff sure I
Greiner so I'll go over some of the
technical design decisions obviously
this won't be comprehensive because
there are a lot of such decisions but I
want to give you a flavor for what we
have in mind as we were creating this
product so the first thing we keep in
mind is our users and the visitors to
our users sites come from all over music
all sorts of browsers on all sorts of
computers through all sorts of
connections what this means for us is
that the content that we serve out must
work with most routers it must be
unobtrusive and it was have low latency
or to put it very simply we must not
right in the original pages the user
experience must feel the same so as I
mentioned earlier we're using javascript
proves display the variations so the
first question you might ask is what
happens if you don't have javascript or
if it's turned off the answer is that we
always have the original content on the
page so if javascript is not there we
display the original content and the
user is none the wiser let's see what
this looks like for a multi-variant
experiment in this example the taxing
black the image that Jeff is the
original content that used to be on the
page the way you instrument the section
is by putting a snippet of code above
that holds the JavaScript function you
TMX section and a snippet of code that's
an ending your script tag after the
session you know let's pretend you don't
have javascript the browser comes along
it sees a script tag it goes it doesn't
have a JavaScript so it ignores that
everything hanging inside that script
tag yes in the original content the M
extraction
it renders that and then it gets in the
ending your script tag you know you
might be bothered by the fact that
there's an ending your script tag
without an opening your script tag but
it turns out that HTML parsers are very
lenient and that's actually not a
problem in essen tossing error so the
parser ignores that and keeps rendering
the rest of the page so the end result
is young JavaScript no problem if you do
have JavaScript the euchy MX section
function call expands to a document
right of your alternate content and
annoying your script tag and that in
turn is the same as if the original
document had had the following the
alternate content and opening your
script tag the original content and then
ending your script tag so let's print
thing where the browser once again we
come along we display the alternate
content image to then we get to make a
script tag obviously we've gotten this
far from the process we have JavaScript
everything we exciting no script a gets
ignored and the parser continues after
with the rest of the page and that's how
we display page variations for a for
multivariate experiment for a Navy
experiment is even simpler the control
sprint has aligned at some JavaScript
sing about that calls you TM x function
again if you don't have javascript this
gets ignored and the rest of the page
renders so you have your original
content if you do have JavaScript this
function expands to a document that
location that replace of your new URL so
the parser comes along it seems this and
it redirects you to the new page before
it renders the rest of the original page
one thing I want to go here is our use
of document application replace and the
reason we do that is so that the new URL
will replace the current URL in the
browser's history that way the user only
knows that they landed on a page and if
they go back they go
back to where they thought they were
before so if you read the regular from
page 82 page me messing visible to the
user and it may hit back they see the
page that they were on before page a I'm
sure you've all had the experience of
being on a website where you hit that
and you can't get out this avoids that
another issue if you're you sailor is
what happens if Google is sung available
if it's slow or unresponsive or what
have you whatever it could go wrong we
don't want to affect latency on the
user's pages on the experiment pages as
much as we can so here's what we do as
Brenda mention we put the tracking
script at the bottom so if there's any
latency associated with that it will be
invisible to the user because the user
is a human they're reading the page
they're really slow and in the
background their browser is contacting
Google and waiting for a response
another thing that we do is in the
control script we have default
implementations of the functions like
you TMX session or UTM X so that when
the controller gets the actual code from
removal if it doesn't get a response at
least there's a function already defined
nessuno up so when the page renders
there's no javascript errors and you see
the original content once again and
finally our google servers are
configured to time out promptly if
google lesson get a response from our
particular service provider that gran
was talking about within about four
seconds fishes matta 502 responsive at a
gateway and the browser is not left
hanging and it just renders the rest of
the page now as I mentioned some users
some visitors might be a really slow
connection so we want to limit the
amount of information that we transfer
over the wire so we compile the
JavaScript we all know that javascript
is actually interpreted but what we do
is we get rid of unnecessary white space
and unnecessary comments before we send
the code over the wire to you this is
what your computer gets this is not what
we have here at
in our content in your source control
system and we actually have myspace and
comments and indentations beautiful code
but this is what your browser sees we
also try to avoid advanced language
features one of the visitors to your
experiment site might be your
grandmother on then all 386 using an old
version of Netscape and she may not have
JavaScript version 17.5 so we try to use
as small subset of the language as
possible now ask random function we are
piggybacking on Google technology we use
Google's DNS system and load balancing
technology to route your request to
machine that's close to you on the
network and relatively unloaded and we
are able we actually point responsive
when you contact our servers and we get
the experiment data from a big table
that houses the information for all the
experiments that transaction takes some
about 4 milliseconds and the round-trip
time from a visitor to Google and back
it's under a 100 millisecond we've made
under 100 milliseconds and offering is
quite a bit lesson that like about 50
milliseconds so we're very we're pretty
responsive and what this means is that
Google latency is a small fraction of
the actual lightning see that the user
has they're more likely to see latency
because of their isp than because of
google and that's the way we like it
finally I want to talk about some
advanced cases we went through the
wizards and I explained how we were
trying to target marketing people who
may not be HTML savvy however some of
the people running tests might want to
do more sophisticated types of tests so
I will talk about to such advancing
areas one is symmetric AP tests and the
other one is query parameters in your
URL
as you recall this is what the markup
looks for a pouring a/b test and this is
what we call an asymmetric Amy test and
it's asymmetric because the control
spread is only on the test page not on
the variation page you know let's say
that I come to your website and I am
assigned variation see you have three
variations like I'm assigned area Shanxi
and then Greta hung here website and she
sees variation B but she thinks it's a
really cool website and she emails me
the link so i click on the link and I
get to variation B even though it's the
same website so i have a different
experience depending on how I got there
and that is probably not desirable
another example is I landed on variation
see but after you finish your experiment
you decide that variation B is actually
the best performing variation and you
want everyone to see variation B if i
were ready bookmark variation see i'm
not going to see your choice I'll always
keep going back to variation see to fix
this we made the asymmetric av-test
symmetric we put a control strip on the
variation page what that means now is
that whenever I land on the variation
page I still go through a control spread
which will still contact google which
will redirect me to the appropriate page
so in the first example i'm seeing a
variation see a reticent boa you link
bookmark for variation B well I click on
it but variation B has that control
spread it yo sent a link to this
experiment before and it will redirect
me to the page that I saw earlier so my
experience is not interrupted likewise
if you end in the experiment and I
bookmark variation see that has a
control script as well and that will
redirect me to the page you want me to
see so this solves that particular
problem and to implement this this is
this is how you do it there's actually
an optional parameter to the UTM X
function which is called current page I
mean that's an index which you type into
your page to identify what
pager on whether your page 0 for the
original page or 123 in the function
call there's a little bit of code that
compares the page that you're on which
you provide in the page itself with the
target page that google says should be
displayed and if you're not if they're
not the same then we redirect otherwise
we do nothing so your original page your
control strip would have a one that
looks something like this it's a UTM X
function call with an index of 0 and
your first variation will be very
similar except has an index of one so
again if if I bookmark your first
variation but I'm supposed to see
variation 0 it will go to this if
statement see that they're unequal and
redirect me and that's how we solve the
a symmetricity problem of Av tasks a
certain problem is a query parameter
sometimes what you're testing is part of
a of a long procedure like a checkout
flow English case you might be sending
information from one page to another
using the query parameters so if you
knew that and a visitor comes to your
web to your landing page for your
experiment with some 40 parameters
obviously we want to propagate those so
we do that now in your experiment maybe
you're also permit rising your
experiment pages with a URL parameter
the query parameter that says for
example variation one has a parameter
version equals one and your second
variation has a parameter version equals
two so each of your alternate pages has
a URL parameter of its own or more than
one but your user also lands in the
experiment with his or her own for a
parameters what we doing that case is we
merge the query strings of that the user
comes with and that you type into the UI
when you set up your experiment into one
big long URL string for a string and the
function that does that is called append
query
ring if you're interested lastly you
might be testing a complete redesign of
your checkout process now 48 parameters
are completely different you're using
completely different games including
different format what are we doing in
that case well we want to give you the
utmost flexibility so to do that there's
yet another optional parameter to that
function call that is home filter and
filter is a reference to a function that
you provide and that function that you
provide case as an argument the
variation that we are telling you will
be displayed and it returns the URL that
you want us to use for that redirection
so for example here this would have the
page 1 URL and then inside the function
you might mangle on the query parameters
however you want and then you return the
URL that we will that we will redirect
to right after this miss code block
that's where we read the racks and
whatever you give us and that's what we
use and that takes care of the general
case because inside that function and
then whatever you want and with that
I'll hand over to rid of our final
comments thank you so I just have a few
last comments to make it and we'll have
some time for Q&amp;amp;A after that we're done
with kind of the hardcore technical
stuff this is just going to be a little
bit of overview of kind of where this
fits in the big picture so why would you
or why would any organization use google
website optimizer rather than for
example building their own Amy or
multivariate testing if you're a small
mom-and-pop operation the answer is
pretty clear you don't have to know how
to build this and it's free so clearly
you want to use the thing that google
built if you are a larger organization
and you do actually have the engineering
resources to throw at a problem like
this we feel that Google Offers these
for reason
why this product might be a better
choice for you than building your own
and the four things are the first one is
log collection so if you have multiple
web servers that are serving out your
landing and conversion pages you might
be tracking what's happening on each one
of those servers but then you're going
to have to collate those results
together and that's just another task
that you have to do the second thing is
that analyzing what happens with the
statistics how can you tell when one
combination is truly statistically
significantly better than any of the
others there's actually some significant
statistical work that statistical
analysis that has to be applied to those
numbers and at Google we employ fabulous
statisticians who do all that work for
you and so it's just taken care of and
you don't have to figure out that math
yourself and your own organization the
third reason is this content management
system that we offer so what I mean by
that is once you have marked up your
landing page with the different sections
you can have that marketing person very
the content in those sections on his or
her own without continually involving
the IT staff so if there is a big
communication issue in your organization
between the person who is deciding about
the content and the person who is having
to implement that content it can cut
down a lot on the communication
round-trip time that's happening sort of
through the different parts of the
company and finally there's the
scalability you know we we already have
this huge production infrastructure with
the servers that are automatically close
to everybody who might be participating
in the experiment and you know it just
it just works it's there and that's
something that that companies can use so
one other high point that we didn't
really hit on earlier is that
testing doesn't have to be something
that you just do once you can start out
by doing a high-level test maybe an AP
test to decide on the overall layout of
your landing page make big decisions
first and then once you've figured out
the layout you can come back and you can
keep doing more tasks you can you know
start out with a B and then once you
kind of get the hang of it you can move
to multivariate and you can keep going
until you find the page that gets kind
of the highest natural conversion rate
that you could ever expect for what
you're actually trying to sell or
promote and this is going to be a little
bit of an awkward segue but not only can
you continually improve your experiments
but here we go here at Google we are
continually improving our software we're
continually adding new features to this
product this product is under active
development we have new features coming
out all the time and we have openings on
our team so if any of you are interested
in working at Google either in kirkland
or in Seattle we have a brand-new
engineering office that we just opened
up in Seattle last week there are
materials scattered around please take a
look at those all right finally googles
mission as some of you may be aware is
to organize the world's information and
make it universally accessible and
useful and I see this product google
website optimizer is really fitting
right in here in this useful bit so it's
I think it's pretty clear how website
optimizer helps Google's customers
Google's customers have spent a lot of
money on advertising trying to get
people to come to their sites and if
they can improve their conversion rates
they get a better return on that
investment they make more money that's
fabulous but what I really like about
this product is that it's not just good
for Google's customers if it's if it's
really an effective tool then it's also
good for their customers so it's good
for all of the end-users everybody who
uses the web when all the websites are
clearer and easier to use and more
effective
and have better transitions and better
flow that's good for everybody so I'd
like to just quickly acknowledge the
local team here in kirkland we have
engineers to have worked on this product
over here and other folks such as PMS
testers and so forth on the other side
we also have some staff and a lot of
Utah this year and that liked open for
questions how many companies are
currently using google website optimizer
I think that's actually unfortunately
something that we can't share with you
I'm really sorry question back there you
do need to her question is you say it's
free but do you have to have the
appliance of AdWords to use it currently
yes you do need to sign up for an
AdWords account however you do not need
to enter any billing information and you
never need to spend a single penny on
AdWords advertising you don't even need
to set up a campaign yes
I think so yeah I'll let you talk them
to repeat the question so so what you're
asking is on one of these mmmm
propagates so the first thing was if you
have a shopping cart experience that
spans multiple pages and you vary the
landing page and the conversion page is
several patients down the road whether
that information gets propagated and the
answer is yes because you instrument the
pages that you actually varying and the
page where you actually have that
conversion and you don't need to
increment the Vegas in the middle but
once they get to the conversion page we
know oh you're running that experiment
you have a conversion so yes that that
impression page way back there actually
led to a conversion
let me ask a clarifying question so are
you interested in making sure that
content can actually be varied in the
same way in multiple pages through the
experiment is that the question okay all
right you know in doughnut check you can
do that right yes yes you can instrument
multiple pages with with those section
markup tags and as long as everything's
all set up we have our tech lead in the
back giving us cues just in case we're
not really sure so that's very
comforting to us but yeah you can
instrument multiple pages to your site
so if you want to have that same
headline used throughout you can have
that happen yeah yeah and a benefit
technical detail on that the way you do
that is you remember you have the UTM
extension function with a name for you
that was your section game so if you put
the same section game later on in a page
it also has the appropriate sprints then
the same content will be displayed for
that section because the earring is in
the same game so yes we can totally do
that the question Vicki ya back there
please very low traffic like that how
many do you need to get statistically
useful information
so the question was if you have a
website with low traffic such as perhaps
an entering a website how how many how
much the sex are you need to get kompom
alone you need to run an experiment to
get meaningful statistics and we we have
a bunch of riterion that with a fright
area that we recommend for example
running for at least a week to the into
account seasonal effects you know like
some people might click on something
more on monday and less on friday these
are thinking about going home or vice
versa depends what you're selling we
also have some rule of thumb numbers you
reek home with those are Eric for a
number of impressions these are
technically this is Eric vasilich sure
so the the number of amount of traffic
that an experiment would need is
dependent on the number of combinations
you have the original conversion rate
that you're tell your original test page
experiences and the amount of lift or
the additional conversions that you get
from a particular page and if your
conversion rate is low or your lift is
low you'll need a significantly greater
amount traffic if your conversion rate
is near fifty percent and your lift is
say ten or twenty percent you could
probably get away with very little for
example under the most ideal conditions
i can see fifty to a hundred impressions
per combination would be sufficient
however if you start to get down and the
very low conversion rate range you may
need really low you maybe a thousand
something like that so the thing you
have to consider when you're running an
experiment is how many common you think
you control basically is how much how
many combinations you produce and so I
would recommend you start slow or start
small and then if you find out that your
conversion rate is reasonably high and
you have good lifts or you're fairly
confident
an alternative content will produce a
significant jump you can start to to get
a little more crazy with that stuff the
confidence interval reflected in the
tools so i can if it's turning out that
much lower than i expected i can see oh
I really gotta let this thing run longer
absolutely as as the experiment begins
the confident the intervals are very
wide because it's you know we don't
really know if with with any great
certainty as you get more data they
start to narrow and as they start to
narrow and separate then you start to
get more confidence that that a
particular combination is doing better
than another to keep it the so the
reports are designed such oh yes the
question is at what point you decide
that there's not enough difference to
merit changing to an alternative the
reports are designs such that when the
bars separate entirely you'll have a
ninety-five percent confidence that one
accommodation is better than the other
if first you know after some period of
time if that hasn't happened say in a
month or two then I'd recommend stopping
the experiment trying different
variations may be cutting down on the
number of variations because at that
point you're starting to measure
differences that are too small you need
to drive more traffic at a fewer number
of combinations so it's really sort of a
judgment calls really how long are you
willing to wait to measure a certain
quantity you know of a fairly small
number at that point now if you're the
differences are great you know within
the day you might see wild changes and
potentially be able to make decisions
very rapidly although again we recommend
running for a week to deal with enter
week variations in traffic and decision
making
what kind of content can be
any kind of content you'll notice Victor
pointed out I believe that we use
document dot write to inject content
into the page so anything that you want
to inject any HTML you want or any
fragments of HTML thereof you can
substitute your original for you can
substitute that for your original
content so pretty much anything now we
don't host resources so if you want to
test you know some alternative flash you
would host that a turnable flash at some
URL but you would have the alternative
content would be a reference an object
reference to that flash for example so
you get to host all the content we get
to host the snippets of HTML they got
substituted in your page and the same
goes for images or any thought the
resource if you wanna do what again
absolutely if you want to test a form
you again you just whatever you want its
to put in that page it could be a form
tag it's not limited to any particular
kind of HTML it's it's pretty flexible
absolutely yeah you're not limited there
either you can write out your variations
can be script tags themselves in fact
there are some techniques where you want
to write out script tags so you can
perform much more complex changes to
your page and multivariate experiment
the editor looks at the variations as
just a raw string that it sends down the
wire that gets docked all written in
place of the original content yep I
think there was another question so at
the web extreme you could say I've got
three comedies like 27 possibilities I
have 127 chance for every combination or
as the experiments going along you can
start putting more of the clips onto the
more popular the more successful company
we do not dynamically vary the amount of
traffic to accommodation yeah you put on
one of erik's favorite topic yeah so
yeah look to the future for something
along those lines any more questions
what load-balancing do we use the drive
customers to the closest server and the
answer that is just basic Google
infrastructure we run clusters of
servers in every geographic region in
the world for some definition of
geographic region I mean which primarily
goes Asia Europe the Americas sites in
the top secret Antarctic summer that's
and so basically DNS is configured to to
route traffic to appropriate servers
yeah we locate data centers throughout
the world for this purpose you know to
keep the latency between the end user
and our and machines are in jobs as low
as possible that would be nice no users
cannot define the latency we try to make
it as small as possible I mean what
would you I mean you had like oh I see
no the control script is the one where
you have to worry about latency and
there are no browser features which
allow you to control latency in this
fashion unfortunately you just have to
time it out at the server basically and
there's a global setting for that is it
data collection we're doing with the
traffic to Google so we have just
pointed out the talk there are two main
servers there's a content server and
there's a tracking server and so the
content I'm just wondering
there's some piece of Google to
determine what context that we serve
other than
well the clients yeah I'm not really
sure what the question is but but but
the question I think is is there
anything at Google that determines what
the content is at the remote server yeah
so if I've understood you correctly I
think the answer to your question is no
so if it's a first time user to the site
we choose randomly and if it's a repeat
visitor we serve them the same comp that
they saw last time does that answer your
question if the cookies are disabled how
do you do okay so the question is what
if the end user has cookies disabled and
in that case actually we will just serve
them a random thing right and as they
will continue if that in that case if
they click refresh they will continue to
see different content each time what
about being able to measure conversion
for that we will not be able to do so so
do you skip that or do you have errors
in statistical errors those those
visitors are not included in the reports
whatsoever they just see you know
something and then they got tracked
whatsoever
funny you should ask so the cookies the
question is do the cookies have a
lifetime yesterday they had a 30-minute
lifetime today they have a two-year
lifetime yes so we just pushed the
change today so the issue was that some
websites it takes a little longer than
30 minutes for people to convert and
you're buying a car or whatever it's a
big decision so in 30 minutes was not
sufficient I mean it was it rules out a
significant amount of traffic in some
circumstances and so now we have the
cookie set for two years so as long as a
user comes back to an experiment every
two years they'll see exactly the same
combination to get the opportunity to
convert as well now we don't recommend
you running an experiment for two years
so but yeah that's a lot of time issues
not at the moment you won't be the other
you can't the question is can you drop a
variation right so you can't you can't
modify an experiment and completely ad
hoc manner you can't just you know drop
out one combination and then continue on
as you were but what you can do is you
can run a follow-up experiment that just
runs on the original actually isn't any
two combinations looks at the original
versus if the original versus one one of
your combinations head-to-head so you
can you can take the one that you think
is the winner and drop out all the rest
and just a double check that that one is
definitely the best and you can also
make a copy of an existing experiment
and change around what what the
variations are in that experiment
without having to do any new tagging of
your pages so that can be quite a boom
oh I think the question is based on some
parameters in the URL can you force a
specific user to see a specific kind of
content I don't know right is the
question you've made like three tests or
three variations and you want to choose
a particular variation yeah so there are
techniques where if you're running three
separate tests play for example on a
single page at your web server you can
roll a die and select what experiment
the user will see and and as long as
you're tracking that user with your own
cookies and continue to serve out that
control script for that experiment you'd
be able to subdivide your traffic among
multiple experiments that is a
possibility if you want to force them to
see a particular variation then what you
can do is stop the experiment and select
an arbitrary combination to show the
user so let's say you find a combination
that is a winner you can stop the
experiments select that combination and
will force every user from then on out
to see that that comment that
combination is that ensure question I
still want to
oh I see you want to segment the users
into seeing we want to filter function
so if you're running a navy experiment
Ryan a the experiment remember that you
have that filter function optional
parameter at the end so we do that to
give us whatever URL you want inside
that function URL that we give you which
is the one we think you should be
redirecting to but you give us whatever
URL you want so that's where you do that
yeah but in the back
so the question is we we have use of
profiles from the people visiting your
experiment and when we can tie that in
with with our reports is that right you
know we don't do that at the moment we
all we do is just figure out the
conversion rates and give me a report
may some that right talking about
segmenting your visitors and doing
something different depending on who is
visiting uh-huh yeah well we don't do
that yeah is there time out between then
click on the experiment feature page and
if conversion like if I go and look at
the bike in that example today and then
when we can go in
make a purchase does that get computed
into the experiment customer so so the
question is in the my example say you go
into the website one day and it takes
you say two weeks to actually make the
purchase does that get counted and as of
today yes because we have those cookies
that last for up to two years so then I
have a follow-up question i looked at
the bike today and i had there was an
experiment on that page but i really
didn't want to buy a bike the order
fight one has the conversion tracking i
wanted to buy a helmet two weeks later
and i just that wasn't in the experiment
but i just went and then made a purchase
but because of the cookies are said
because of the tracking being said you
would still mark it as conversion um
yeah that's right if you instrument your
pages when we've sent in this scenario
and the scenario is the following that
you going to the website you see a bike
so you have an impression but what you
really want to buy is a helmet you come
back later you buy a helmet it's that
how to this at conversion and yes if you
if you instrument your pages not evenly
if you will yes that will happen however
if you have a different thing new page
or if you put the tracking code so
somehow i get conditional so that it
only execute if you bought a bite and
got a helmet then giving actually
measure accurately so there are ways
around them but you'll have to be more
clever how you mark up your pages in
your health system I'm not sure whether
we have samples we might if not we can
certainly ask them probably just one or
two more questions I would think is I'm
sure what are two more questions I think
we'll see how long it is
tell us information passed
so basically pass
flag is tell us that while males are
buying spike
okay so this is another sort of customer
segmentation question he wants to know
is there some way that he can pass in
whether the particular customer are
seeing this experiment is for example
male or female and then have the reports
break down by that parameter that he
passed in and have that be shown in the
reports and we sort of already talked
about this right i mean do you want it
the short answer is no we don't do
segmentation based on sort of advertiser
supplied dimensions i can i can imagine
hacking up a scenario where you could
potentially do that by mucking with the
cookies that the control script creates
but that would be a really advanced
scenario so there is i can say there's a
there is a company I think it's roi
revolution it's one of our partners they
did this very nice I don't even call it
a hack because it's really nice but what
it does is it it sets a variable in the
Google Analytics tracking code so that
the combination that a particular user
saw is actually communicated to google
analytics and and you can actually
render reports there that show you all
sorts of segmentation and and and what
combinations were selected by those
users there's no statistical analysis
done by analytics with that but it is
possible to look at the raw numbers with
respect to segmentation and if you want
more details on that we can probably
figure that out for you find that that
that paper that they did
okay I think with that we're probably
going to close down the general Q&amp;amp;A
because I think some of you have had
your fill so please go back and have
another drink and enjoy yourself anybody
who has further questions 2.a for us
please feel free to come up and we'll
answer them one on one on one thank you
