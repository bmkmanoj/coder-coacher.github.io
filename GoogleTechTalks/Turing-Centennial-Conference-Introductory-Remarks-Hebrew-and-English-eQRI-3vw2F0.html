so welcome everybody and and I'm very
thrilled to have you all here this year
marks Santillan a year for Alan Turing
he was born in june twenty third a 19-12
legendary founder of computer science
provided the first formalization of
concept to computation and i'm sure
we'll hear a lot about it today major
contributor to the happening of end of
World War two so this conference or day
is devoted to do Turing celebrated life
and achievement and to discipline the D
founded from his own groundbreaking
scientific discoveries achievements to
the impact of his innovative ideas to
recent advances in computer science but
I view that as actually a celebration of
science in general of computer science
in particular and also of technology
innovation and engineering emiram will
talk more about Alan Turing but I'd like
to make a few brief comments to me
symbolizes many of the great attributes
of our field both on the scientific side
on the technology innovation side on the
engineering side he was a mathematician
theoretician scientist and in the same
time an incredible engineer and
entrepreneur well not so much
intrapreneur and what we typically call
to the entrepreneurs but he actually was
I think symbolized what we are looking
for in entrepreneurs he was setting bold
vision such as his propositions on
future machines that could think
inspiring the quest for artificial
intelligence up to this day and setting
benchmarks and stepping stones of how to
deal with those thoughts and taking a
really important well critical project
breaking the Enigma and executing on
that so that's really much beyond
engineering much beyond sand
achievement this is really an execution
in best terms this combination should be
an inspiration to all of us especially
for the younger generation this is also
by personally I'm very excited was very
excited about this project and also why
Google got involved in the conference
quite heavily and we also need to
remember how we will shamelessly treated
on the personal level and keep it in
mind as we promote the diversity and
tolerance well thank you all for making
it happen so I'd like to shout out a few
names because quite a few people worked
quite hard to actually bring together
this day so starting with the organizing
committee and of with knock on door
service from Tel Aviv University levy
Darrell from Weizmann Institute mmu day
from Tel Aviv University Tomic line from
bar-ilan much of the work well perhaps
most of the work was done by by diligent
team of organizers these include
jonathan baron from tel aviv university
Leon coin from Tel Aviv aura lahav from
Tel Aviv char on their own from white
sponsor it quench Allah from I core Ron
and Michael from Weitzman and a lot
tremendous amount of work done by early
on by current karpati from google and a
frat Agassi who probably this was most
of her occupation for the past few weeks
and help from others galit parrots from
google we had other people involved in
getting things done Shimon sewer tel
Aviv University google in I Corps your
wall from she loved University thanks
for the a mushy mushy beam Favata fucka
Madonna for setting this up together and
again thanks for the sponsorship of I
Corps and day and the academia llamada
and last but not least who are all here
actually to hear some legendary speakers
so I really like to thank all the
speakers who came from all over the
world and also from all over Israel so
start in just two
them professor michael rubin turing
award letter law laureate from Hebrew
University and Harvard professor Jacobs
Eve from technion professor joseph
sifakas during World Laura from a very
much an EP FL dr. Alfred Spector VP of
research at Google who came from New
York Professor Shimon Ullman from
Weizmann Institute vessel Misha Misha
shadi from Tel Aviv University professor
Cornett Cortez from google from New York
as well and and again professor the VDRL
from white one so I think this is a
really a lineup of legendary speakers
that I'm sure going to excite with the
with providing us pictures anything from
the very early beginnings and connecting
us from from the mathematics to the
early computation all the way to the
future views of where we are today in
computer science in learning in
artificial intelligence and and
hopefully this will be inspiring to
everybody so thank you all and I'm
looking forward to the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
