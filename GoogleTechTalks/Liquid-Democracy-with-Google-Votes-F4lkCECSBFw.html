Google votes and I'm going to talk about
liquid democracy and I'm going to talk
about Google votes then I'm going to be
talking about the design decisions and
UX we use to for Google votes as well as
going into the algorithms for delegated
voting that backs it all so in terms of
democracy for the for the scope of this
talk we're talking about democratic
decision-making there's other aspects of
democracy such as individual liberties
or freedom of the press other
institutions like this here we're
focusing on the decision-making aspects
you've got a group of people and they
have a bunch of issues or decisions and
somehow you want to aggravate not
aggravate but aggragate democracy has
has that that effect as well but you
want to aggregate individual choices
into group decisions kind of the options
we have right now are direct democracy
and representative democracy dimeric
direct democracy is kind of like perfect
utopia you know it's great it's
everybody votes for everything you have
control you have transparency
accountability that's fair doesn't scale
does not scale at all there's no way
that everybody has the time and
expertise to really vote on everything
that affects them at every level so we
typically scale by using a
representative democracy system and and
here again we're talking about groups of
all different levels this could be city
state national governments this could be
the you know the chess club at your high
school or it could be a PTA or a
volunteer organization you you elect
some representatives to who have the
time and the expertise to to vote for
you now this this leads to a lot of
problems which is kind of the typical
things we people usually complain about
politics and that you know it's not
transparent or accountable and that you
end up with this focus on on the
candidates these these people who become
this focus of you know their
representative they have this extra
power people start carrying about things
like you know does your representative
have good hair
and that matters you also get and as
opposed to focusing on the issues which
which do matter he also get distortions
from the election cycle itself because
elections take a lot of overhead and you
get so again you get silly things like
oh we can't make this happen it's an
election year it's that's purely an
artifact so liquid democracy is a design
to approach the shortcomings of both
approaches and take the best the best of
both direct and representative democracy
so in liquid democracy or delegative
proxy is kind of the the term you'll see
in the literature people can delegate
their votes to others and you can you
can delegate it anytime there's no
there's no elections you just use a tool
to set who your delegates are and
anybody can be a delegate so your your
delegates are often people you trust and
you know or that people you know they
know and delegation is is transitive and
that if I allocate one person they can
delegate to others and my vote can flow
through this an entire tired delegation
graph now you never have to do what your
delegate says unlike representative
democracy where you know you kind of
sell the farm when you dealt when you
elect someone to be a representative for
example this is character in orange with
the cell phone he's delegated his vote
to the right but then for issue one you
can see he's got a long arrow and he's
chosen to override his delegated vote
and and vote directly so it kind of
creates kind of a meritocracy for
example that the woman in green you can
see a lot of people have delegated her
she's kind of analogous to a
representative and that she's gathered
quite a bit of power but still all these
people can vote individually if they
want so liquid democracy the earliest
paper I could find was written in 1969
by James Miller and it's quite a good
paper it's only six pages but it's kind
of lays out the whole foundation of
delegated voting and defines the term
delegate proxy even kind of talks about
computer voting which is pretty good for
its time
I mentioned I'll mention two other
papers and there's a number of others I
have a kind of reading list compiled
that go slash Google votes if you want
to to find out more another paper is
this but by James Greene Armitage which
is you know voluntary delegation as the
basis of a future political system this
is just a really good overview of
delegation and has a lot of background
for different approaches that have been
taken up up till there it's a real good
introduction to the concept then also
another paper I mentioned just because
this is the paper that seemed to have
the most details on like how would you
actually build such a system and it has
this concept of hierarchical forums
which is kind of similar to the concept
of tags Google votes tags which I'll
introduce there are several
implementations out there liquid
democracy the most famous is liquid
feedback which is used by the pirate
party this is the pirate party was
founded by the founders of the Pirate
Bay who are you know not big fans of
copyright to say the least and but the
pirate parties have spread across Europe
and their biggest success has been in in
Germany where they've won seats in in
the parliament and at various times in
liquid feedback is kind of these issues
and there are very distinct phases like
you you kind of create a new issue then
there's a discussion phase where people
talk about it and then you freeze it and
then people vote on the results it's
kind of a full life cycle thing there's
there's also some other products out
there adhocracy also used in in germany
it's kind of been used by some local
local groups to talk to their citizens I
don't know if it's really taken off as
well as they'd like but it's kind of got
a similarly kind of a wicky-wicky like
feel to it I also ran across a product
called net conference plus I couldn't
even find I mean it's all about mentions
in literature but I couldn't even find
any screenshots much less anything
actually running on this guy but I found
a cool little book there's this Swedish
group called demo X or democracy
experiment that managed to get a seat on
the suburb of Stockholm
and in their City Council and they ran
their platform was that whatever people
would vote for on the online tool that's
what they would vote you know directly
as represented and they did this for a
couple years and you know it was you
know they had some success so it's kind
of interesting okay so Google votes so
this is mixing liquid democracy and a
social network there's this concept that
a lot of the reason liquid democracy
hasn't taken off is it requires a lot of
infrastructure to do it and that hasn't
been available you know until now we're
now we've got this type of
infrastructure to actually automate
these type of things count votes have
better identity and such
now given that I'm an engineer at Google
and I work for social you could probably
guess which social network I had in mind
to to implement this on so the analogy I
kind of think of is a an electric
network so an electric network you got a
bunch of wires and you know electric
devices kind of plug together and an
electric what network an electric wire
can flow either information or power and
if you're a USB cord you do both but
social networks similar you've got these
links and edges between people mostly
they're used for flowing information so
the proposal here is to implement a
liquid democracy system and flow power
through your social network and this is
binding decision making Authority so my
you know this Google you you write code
so I'm like okay let's let's let's build
it so two and a half years ago I started
building a a delegate of proxy back-end
and I've been working with workplace
services doing running votes across
Google Google since then so my goal here
is to build kind of a live active
delegation Network internally within
Google within Google internal Google
Plus and then kind of use that to get
support to build this stuff natively as
public product which I'll talk about
more at the end this is just a bit about
Google votes at this point we've been
running it for two years
11,000 Googlers have cast votes using
Google votes about seventy-five thousand
votes for example the Kirkland Halloween
costume contest hangouts t-shirt as was
chosen with Google votes as well as the
name of the troll cafe in Seattle
also some products with a Google store
and named a few buildings but by far the
biggest one has been the September
Mountain View micro kitchen fair and
this is a product this is a event where
about 8200 Googlers attended and we got
4,600 Googlers to vote based on this
this event this is just all you can you
got to see the picture in the in the
corner in the upper right corner there
it's you know they fill the whole
football field for full of vendors and
and then all the vendors kind of have
little posters and QR codes and say hey
vote for me and there are 25 categories
of food so based on this vote this is
that vote is actually what defines the
2014 Mountain View micro kitchen lineup
so all the choices in the micro kitchens
are based on on that on that vote so
that's kind of all right that's our
biggest success so far terms of
delegation usage we've actually some
ways gotten more than we expected
because the big thing with building a
liquid democracy system is having a
liquid democracy system a
decision-making tool and using it by
yourself is silly you need people and
you need groups is a very strong Network
effect so we're like okay how do we get
over this hump and get people to
actually vote enough to make delegation
meaningful and that's why we partnered
with workplace services and have mostly
been focusing on the basic voting
experience making the UI polished and
and making it you know easy to vote so
you can see my my talk last week which
was all about on the voting mechanics
and the voting algorithms and you know
again you can go to go slash Google
votes and find links to that talk it's
about a thirty five minute video still
we had delegation implemented we didn't
really
advertise it but some people figured it
out and in fact nine users out of 4,600
they started sending around delegation
ads which I showed and they managed to
get the nine of them managed to control
2900 votes out of 62,000 so we got 0.2%
of the users controlling 4.7 percent of
the vote which is like a twenty four
times multiplier and and we weren't even
trying really like the most successful
delegate was an engineer in Mountain
View who sent a email to the vegans
mailing list saying hey I'm gonna
represent you for for vegan food options
you don't want to bother voting all
these 25 things give me your delegation
and you managed to get 15 voting power
okay so now I'll talk a little about
design decisions so as I mentioned a lot
of the literature doesn't really drill
down into how do you actually implement
a liquid democracy system so you know he
just kind of tried stuff and saw what
work so here's the decisions decisions
we made so first we've got the notion
that there are that are issued obviously
there's people and there's issues that's
kind of obvious but we would with this
concept of tags that issues have a tag
for example the lunch issue is tagged
food and delegation flows via tags so
this woman sherry she delegated her food
voting power to Lynn and he voted on the
lunch and thus he had two votes for that
for that day vote because the delegation
she did not delegate her IT tag to Lynn
so when Lynn voted on tablet purchasing
he only had his own vote another thing
is that power flow is all or nothing
because you get this whole graph effect
now there was a paper written by let's
see I think his name was Palo Baldy and
believed 2000 to 2009 and he described a
whole system of flowing power through a
liquid democracy network where it kind
of had this exponential damp off and
your
our split and float as it as it went
deeper into the graph I wasn't real keen
on that idea I like the idea that people
have to make decisions you know we want
to encourage people to be decisive you
got it so you do as you rank your
delegates you have to choose that yes I
want
I trust Lin more than I trust this other
this other care this other guy for food
voting and then Lin gets a hundred
percent of the vote if he votes if you
didn't vote then the other guy would get
nine percent of the vote so another
thing that does is it makes the system
more understandable if I look and see
what happened with my vote it's very
strange to explain to a lay user that
twenty-seven point two three percent of
your vote when this direction thirteen
point four five percent one in this
direction like what does that mean if I
say you delegated to this person who
delegated to that person and they voted
on that you're like oh that means
something that's an accountability chain
if I didn't like the vote I know who to
talk to so I like this all or nothing
approach another one is that issues can
be restricted to groups for example the
hangouts t-shirt vote we restricted to
RTC all then we also found out that
there are a few like buzz sre and a
couple of people who weren't an RTC all
who wanted to vote so we ended up adding
like buzz s re and Inc con server and
there a couple other people are hangouts
related and they voted on the t-shirt so
obviously people who aren't in the group
are not allowed to to vote on group
restricted issues but there's this
subtlety that you don't want power
flowing across group boundaries like for
example you can see that sherry the
woman on the less left has delegated her
vote to somebody outside the group and
if we didn't have that restriction her
delegated vote would have bounced back
into the group again to somebody who
could vote and that would mean that that
person had like three votes which would
include the person who's not in the
group so we cut anything that crosses a
boundary another thing is that for
simplicity in the UI we only include a
single tag per issue the backend engine
includes multiple tagging and after we
get to the point where we get some more
even more more delegation user usage
then we'll start seeing
if it makes sense to expose that
functionality in the talk on the
algorithms at the end I will assume
multiple tagging the more general case
another thing is this whole notion of
privacy transparency there's something I
call the golden rule guten Google votes
which I'll just read if I give you my
vote I can see what you do with it
it's this notion that delegation and
visibility are complements so you see
this kind of little example here where a
delegated their food vote to be which
means that B has to give visibility on
their food votes to a it kind of
reverses the arrows so in this case the
minimum visibility that's acceptable in
this graph is for is for a to be able to
see that be voted on the team lunch but
it is not necessarily the case that a
can see whether it be voted on tablet
purchasing because they didn't delegate
to be for for IT and I'll note that the
golden rule is only defines the minimum
acceptable visibility it doesn't
actually give the visibility policy for
example the everybody can see everything
visibility policy is in fact compliant
with the golden rule so for Google votes
we pretty much just employ it and
implement link level visibility in the
sense that if you can get the link to
somebody's user page you can see all
their votes which is why on every single
Google votes page you'll see a little
butter bar that says hey your votes may
be visible to all google.com accounts
you know take it with a grain of salt
but typically we only share that link
when people have a delegation
relationship and again that that's also
kind of in the things we'll be doing
more of as we need it if we need to
implement that tighter okay so let's get
into the specific UX experience of
delegation again I'm not going to go
into the whole mechanics of voting
please just watch the video for my last
talk if here you're want to hear about
that I'm going to talk all about the UX
that's specific to the delegation our
first observation is that delegation is
hard to explain in the abstract people
are kind of like okay what what good is
that but if you show him an example
people like oh yeah obviously okay
because people are kind of familiar with
representative democracy and proxies and
you know people voting for them so
examples are good instruction manuals
are bad of course that's just a general
UI design principle and always another
thing is that the delegator and the
delegate have different perspectives but
often somebody is both a delegator and a
delegate at the same time so you kind of
have to make the UI friendly for work
for both both those roles and you can't
use separate screens another things we
look at the difference between what
delegator and delegates want is we say
we want this accountability which is
kind of this we want well if you
delegate your vote to someone you want
to make sure they they do the right
thing with it and you want to see what's
going on otherwise you get there bad
things a representative democracy where
people get your vote and they do
whatever they want with it but you also
want to keep the process from being too
too obtrusive because otherwise you
start getting too close to direct
democracy where you have to do something
for every vote and then that doesn't
scale in general the delegator well
there's kind of this beauty of liquid
democracy in that it benefits both the
delegate and the delegate are the the
delegator benefits because they know you
know they don't have time and expertise
to vote and they get someone who they
trust to do it for them and generally
they want to find people who they can
trust to do delegate to the delegate
benefits from liquid democracy because
they get more power and thus more
influence over over the world so there
were kind of two approaches we could
take we could say do we want to start
with the delegate experience or with the
delegate or experience we decided to go
with the delegate experience in terms of
making it easy to gain entry into the
system because voting power is kind of a
gamma fication aspect to it it's kind of
fun to acquire voting power and we
figured that would be an easier entry
point than the the delegate one the
delegate entry point would be doing
things kind of like here are suggested
delegates or ei I see you voted in this
this way this way and this way maybe
you're interested in this person who
votes in similar ways and we're also
planning to go in that direction but we
went with the delegate experience first
so here's how a delegate kind of gets
introduced to delegation so they just
voted and after they voted they have the
regular share button which allows them
to do share and Google+ and to the
conversations and and Google votes has a
nice discussion aggregation feature
where as you're voting you can scroll
down and see all the Google+ posts in
one place that's kind of the regular
share but it also has this advertise
yourself button and it's thing kind of
gives a little teaser that hey you can
get more than one voting power who
doesn't want more power so you click
that and you basically make a delegation
at a little political ad on G+ and you
got to fill it out and tell people why
they should trust you with their with
their food vote okay so we send it and
then a potential delegate sees this ad
and okay well I'll bite
click click on it and from that they can
see they can see the delegates voting
record and they can from there click on
some of the issues the delegate voted on
and see hey do I want to trust this
person with my food vote or not so okay
so they do they delegate and now we go
back to the delegates view so they're
there they're looking at an issue and
they have some power here one thing to
note is that you're gonna have different
power on different issues even if they
have the same tags because if people
voted directly you don't get their their
delegated vote and it also you depends
on the entire graph topology to see how
much power you get so at the bottom of
every issue there's a little voting
power button and if you click that it'll
tell you exactly what your voting power
is and who delegated to you in this case
Vijay just gave us his is delegated vote
so he's included in the list of
delegates we call this coverage which
I'll
come back to and we get to algorithms
another thing is this notion of
accountability in that what happens is
we say app if you vote in someone's name
you have to tell them that you voted in
their name and we do that with by
sending them a Google+ post so right
before we delegate to send that
notification we ask the delegate we give
them a choice because there's actually a
privacy issue for the delegate here
which is that maybe I don't want to tell
people what I voted maybe I just want to
vote and you know because other people
delegated to me I don't necessarily want
to share this specific vote so there's
always the option of casting a personal
vote which will only give you one point
of voting power but it won't send
notifications to anybody else or you can
accept voting power and then it'll send
notifications a subtle thing here is
comes with purely an implementation
detail but with the OAuth flow we got a
lot of flack early on with Google votes
because it required all kinds of scary
Oh auth permissions because we're making
Google+ posts on your behalf to do that
it's an app engine app you get a lot of
scary-looking dialogues so people didn't
like that we got a few cute memes about
that one but so we restricted it to
where we're only going to ask you for
Olaf permissions at this point so up
till now people can vote be regular
voters do everything up until this point
until they click accept elevations on an
issue at which point we'll trigger them
through the auth flow and ask for a
permission to post on Google+ so here's
like an ad that I serve our notification
I'd sent so as a delegate I see I see
this stroke in my stream I see the
little mr. mr. jingles notification
thing and I can see oh someone voted on
my behalf and if I choose to you know
the good thing is I don't have to just
accept it I can say oh I don't really
like coconut juice and I can click on it
and I can override their vote so here's
here's my view of a vote that's been a
delegated vote and you can see that the
selections are all in yellow and it says
who you indirectly voted to
and you can just choose to select vote
like usual and and override it also at
the bottom you'll note there's it this
is a Google votes link which brings
which always brings you to your your
profile page so as a delegate I can I
can see what's been done in my name and
you can see some of these things have
votes that say like solid choices via
and nia-malika with a link where I can
also see the person I delegated to I can
undelete from this page by removing them
another thing is that this page has to
work for the delegate as well as the
delegate or so this page will also show
if people are delegating to you and show
you and show you all the votes that
you've cast okay so now that's let's
talk about how do you actually implement
all of this stuff the algorithms behind
it there's three fundamental algorithms
behind Google votes tally coverage and
power now tally is you know basically
who won and including all the indirect
votes that's all like in this case you
know you see mineral water one but
mineral water actually got some
delegated or indirect votes coverage
that's kind of your profile page it's
it's what has been done in my name so it
includes all your direct votes and your
indirect votes then power is a very it's
a per issue thing which is how much
voting power would I have if I voted on
this this issue it's kind of the oddball
one tallien coverage we can compute
together and with power we have to do a
few funny things and we actually just
get an estimate of power but again the
two dialogues here we showed is that
that we need power for is so you can see
that your voting power on an issue if
you you click the link at the bottom and
also so that you can send a delegation
notifications to the right people when
you put it on there but you're half so
here's kind of the object model I've
been physically using this the same
diagram notation but I'm just
formalizing it here users are circles
issues are rectangles the set of tags
for an issue is
next to the issue just right next to it
a delegation is an open arrow and its
annotated with the tag if there are more
than one outgoing delegations from a
node it also includes this number n
which says whether it's that person's
first second or third delegate choice
and then votes are solid arrows for
example purposes we're just gonna look
at yes/no voting as mentioned in the
previous talk you can do Google votes
also supports multiple choice voting
with single selection which is called
simple plurality it's supports multiple
choice voting with multiple selection
which is called approval voting it
supports ranked voting where you can
drag drag vote votes and kind of make an
ordering as well as range or score
voting where you kind of have a
five-star options for everything made
and you can you can try this out you go
to go slash Coogler votes and you it'll
show you how to actually run things but
regardless of the type of voting the
flow is always the same so we can just
assume that it's a yes/no vote and each
of the yes/no votes is annotated with a
plus or a minus indicating what type of
vote it was just as an implementation
note we store the votes on the user
object and as people are voting that you
don't get so much right contention
because everybody's just writing to
their own object with one exception and
that's issues have a closing time at
which point they won't accept any more
votes and that tout the first tally
that's created after the closing time is
the final tally the thing that actually
says did this thing pass who was the
winner so after an issue closes the
tally stored on the issue becomes the
authoritative object not the votes
stored on the user in fact if the user
gets wiped out or deleted from the
database you don't want to start
changing changing the past votes the
issue has to have this keep the same
result so also introduced the syntax of
vote paths so we have ABC plus 1 means a
delegates to be delegates to see who
votes YES on issue 1
I'll note that switching paths or
switching tags on a path is allowed a
can delegate to be via one tag B can
delegate to C via different tag and yet
still a has voted on issue one now kind
of my logic there you could make
arguments in either side for this but
the way I think about it is that if you
delegate to someone you're trusting them
you're saying I trust this person to do
whatever it is they do to make this
decision now maybe they're flipping a
coin you don't know you're trusting them
with your vote maybe they're asking
other people maybe they're doing
research maybe they're experts on this
on the subject matter but we're saying I
said yes I trust you yes I trust you
with this issue from then on to black
box so based on that I said yeah they
can choose to delegate according to a
different tag as long as that issue has
both the tags on it cycles are important
because what we do is we allow cycles in
your delegate graph I can delegate to
someone they can delegate to me we can
delegate however you want and it's all
resolved on a per issue basis so for
example an issue two here you can see
that C voted on to be delegates to see
you voted on to a delegates to be
delegates to see who voted on - but like
Ezra and this is alcohol kind of you got
to see the algorithms all this kind of
prefix thing where you grow the paths
backwards but as soon as we try to
create a path see ABC - it goes on you
know you basically you know fails an
assertion in the code even you know you
you can't make a path that has the same
node in it twice with a cycle and it
works out fine because you'll notice
that for example issue one also gets all
three of these people delegating to it
but they're they're different it's a
different ordering than for example if
both B and C voted on the same thing
then depending on the delegation
relationship different they might get
different sets of delegates
if if C were to vote on one if C were to
vote on one then you would have yeah
you'd get be getting a vote and then a
delegates to B gets a vote so which is
kind of what you'd expect so then as I
mentioned before delegations are ordered
which resolves you know this kind of
multiple paths problem actually I think
all odd some Q at the end but but please
please keep your questions I am
interested okay so let's take an example
and I'll show how the tally and coverage
algorithm work you know we've got this
this this whole graph here and we want
to say did issue one or dis you to pass
and how did these people vote well let's
let's find out so the first phase is we
start with the issues and we call the
kind of level zero is we take all the
direct votes for so for issue one we
take all the direct paths to it and it's
same for issue two and then we just do
breadth-first search going backwards
important thing is that as we're growing
these paths were not allowing cycles and
also we're checking that the paths all
respect the the tags so for example you
know you can't do FD be a because F is
delegating to Devia gamma and or FD be a
one and when one is not labeled labeled
gamma so you go back you backtrack and
you get all of the all the possible
paths for all issues the next stage is
you you make a bunch of user issue pairs
you you gather up it's kind of like
making a matrix so that for each pair
you have all the paths that go between
that user and that issue this is kind of
like a reduced step in a MapReduce then
after that for each set of pairs you
grab the best pair this is where we're
getting rid of duplicate votes I may
have different two paths to the vote
through two different ways but I only
get one vote now some
comparisons are easy like in Rossi you
see see voted directly on issue one and
see also delegated to a who voted on
issue one direct vote always beats an
indirect vote so that's that's a clear
winner there in this particular table
there's only one comparison that's
that's not trivial and that's Fe C 1
versus FA 1 and which case you actually
have to look at the the delegation graph
and see that F ranked e above a in their
their delegation ordering so we could
have used this very long obnoxious
syntax that would have all these number
signs in it but that just gets too early
okay then after we have all the best
pairs we accumulate by rows and columns
so for issue 1 we add up all the yes
note votes and no votes and it passes
yes
saint ratio to coverage we add
everything in the other direction and we
get for say user c they can see that
they voted on both issue 1 and issue 2
as well as knowing exactly how they
voted through these delegated people
okay that gives you tally and coverage
at the same time now power power is a
weird one because power is saying how
much power would I have if I voted I
haven't actually voted on this thing so
the information is all so now we're all
at request time like tallying coverage
we did all in the background with
background jobs and we can do long graph
algorithms there so I am a so as soon as
a is looking at issue 10 you know we
don't actually have an edge in the graph
between a and issue 10 that's the tricky
part
so what we do is we pre compute
something called potential for all users
and then we use that to to make an
estimate that is fast enough for request
time now what a potential object looks
like is that for every user we say what
is their potential for incoming votes
from that tag so for example user a is
beta potential you can see that
see delegates to a.f delegates to a so
that gives them some potential and we
also do this kind of breadth-first
search
backtracking to compute potential
objects to give for example that F could
delegate to e could delegate to seek
could give a a vote on anything labeled
B then it requests time we apply the
potential so let's say a is thinking
about voting on issue 10 another thing
that's tricky is that in the background
for for each user we don't know exactly
who's voted on what issue because again
in the background we don't know that
there's a connection between this user
and this issue so at request time we dig
up the potential for all of issue tens
tags note that we ignore the gamma
potential because issue 10 is only
tagged alpha and beta so we dig up the
potential and then we look up all the
users in the potential and we see if
they still exist if they voted make sure
there's they're in a group they are
you're allowed to be in and we filter
them note that you can't have a path
that has invalid user anywhere in the
path like like FECA
because c voted which means that c
already grabbed that vote so FEC and he
already gave their votes to C so you
know they're gone you can't use FEC a or
ECA all that's left is B a and F a and
we say your potential estimate is 3 from
those two users and and yourself so this
estimate has has some problems I mean
it's kind of good enough in practice for
people to get a an idea of do you know
do I have a lot of power on this issue
and it's worth me putting up a lot of
effort because you know hundred people
are delegating to me or do I not have
any power on this issue it's it's pretty
good but there's some edge cases it
doesn't cover like it doesn't cover the
switching tags thing because we're doing
potential per tag so if it switches tags
you're out of luck so so DBA actually is
a valid vote a but since DBA is a tag
switch from beta to alpha it isn't
included in the estimate
and also this whole kind of global best
path Singh doesn't get covered so F
actually gave their vote to C because
they went through FEC a along the right
side of the graph but a thinks that F is
in its potential so but the the
algorithms that really matter the most
tally and coverage they do get it right
there exact algorithms so the vote gets
counted correctly and at the end at the
end or you want to say what did I vote
on what happened that is also uh
accurate okay and I'll conclude with
just a thanks to the extended Google
votes team my co-lead in this is Greg
Wolfe
in San Francisco and the third main
programmer is Leo Lopez in in Brazil who
especially did a lot of the UI work
right before the micro kitchen fair and
then our workplace services point of
contact Courtney Nelson who's been
working with us for the last two years
who's just talked a lot of customers and
worked with groups to actually set up
votes coordinate the timing of things
and follow up on a lot of things she's
been invaluable as well as other members
of Roos who recorded coordinated events
and other 20% core contributors who
contributed either a code or UX design
so um so thank you very much and I'll
take any questions now okay actually
I'll I'll pass the mic around for this
so we can get on the recording
so um yeah it's on so it you've got some
really great examples of how this has
worked on kind of one-off votes but we
see from game theory that strategies and
outcomes change pretty significantly
once you iterate a scenario do you have
any thoughts on how you would dog food
deaths in kind of an iterate did multi
vote with the same delegates in the same
group sort of thing yeah that's been our
kind of big goal is to get iterative
voting and we're aiming for that with
the food thing for though so as with the
micro kitchen stuff in terms of being
able to vote on the product and then as
they have little tweaks for each micro
kitchen to say oh hey here's a new
product do you guys want to vote on this
and then you get the same group of
people delegating and continuously
voting that's our our primary entry
point to get into that space thanks
couple couple quick questions is there a
way you could see all of your
consolidated votes that you've cast
either personally or delegated yes just
going to go /g votes that's this the
profile page and in the bottom of any
voting page is a link that just says
Google votes you click there and that
gives your whole thing so that's also
the whole coverage thing in the coverage
algorithm generates generates that view
ok another quick question um is there a
way you as a delegate tool to see
abandonment people had their overrode
your vote or abandon you not explicitly
right now I mean you can the only thing
you'd really be able to see is that if
you look at the issues voting power at
one point and it's later on it goes down
then you'll know that people have either
voted directly or delegated away from
you you can also look at your user page
and see how many delegates you haven't
obviously if that's going down people
are bending you we don't have metrics on
it or like graphs or something so when
someone creates an issue they could
conceivably deliberately add tags that
are not appropriate or deliberately omit
tags that would be appropriate do you
have an idea of to what extent this
system can be game
that way yes I've thought about this the
whole kind of taxonomy problem in some
ways the our current solution or current
approach is you tagged it once at issue
creation time and that would people look
at the issue they can they can see if it
if it's not tagged quite right we don't
have direct protection against that one
concept which I want to would like to
build is something I call the no vote
which is not implemented right now which
is the idea for somebody to say it's not
a I don't I it's not I'm voting no on a
yes/no vote it's a I don't think this
thing is worth voting on that I vote on
this thing and it basically buries my
vote because what happens is let's say I
have a lot of delegated power behind me
somebody else also has some delegated
power but I'm I'm more trusted and I
look at this issue and I say this is
garbage you know they're using
misleading terminology maybe they're
playing games with the tags they've
purposely excluded the options to take
options that all just happen to be
favorable to them yeah what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna say this vote should be
buried or this issue should be buried
because if I don't do that and then what
happens is everybody who delegates to me
all their votes go nowhere as opposed to
what would happen is if I just ignore it
like I do in a regular democracy system
all those votes that that I would people
have trusted me they've gone they go to
someone else who's maybe less reputable
or less thinking about other problems of
the issue it's kind of one one thing I
want to put there another thing is in
like a public product there's this whole
notion of how do you introduce an issue
and find that it's trustworthy and I'm
leaning towards an idea of kind of like
a quorum or like let's say you have a
group and you're doing a fully
distributed thing you typical rule might
be anybody can create an issue but the
issue needs at least 60% of the group to
have voted directly or indirectly in
order for it to pass so then because
otherwise people can just introduce
issues have to people vote on it and it
passes or is that me right so in this
case also a no vote would
kind of keep the issue from getting it's
it's it's quorum and it would just be
lost those are my thoughts in that
direction you mentioned that once
there's a tally it's authoritative and
users can even be deleted after that
point is there an audit trail once
there's the tally even if users go away
yeah when we have the full voting record
including the indirect votes when the
vote was cast
we don't keep changed votes so if you
delete your vote or if you change your
vote before the thing closes that that's
gone but the final the full paths are
are kept with the self as a record of
that deleted users as well right I know
other questions just a technical
question how do you handle conflicting
tags like if an issue is tagged with
alpha and beta and I've delegated alpha
D to you know this person invaded of
that person
how are those prioritized is that ah so
one case one thing I talked about the
prioritization of tags and kind of those
old number signs though those
prioritizations are for the entire let
me just go back and grab one of the crab
kind of and one of the nodes here like
like like something kind of like kind of
like this but imagine that instead of
both of them being you know one of
them's food the other one is budget and
the lunch is so expensive that you
actually is tagged both food and budget
because you got a vote on how much money
you gonna spend for lunch in this case
the way I resolved that is I use a
per-user a global ordering so you
actually did this number one number two
thing is actually saying for all the
it's actually per user not per
delegation tag so yeah and it also kind
of makes the UI a little simpler in the
sense that rather than looking at all my
delegations I look at a list of users
and they say which of these people do
you trust more and I got to say I always
trust this person more than I trust this
person and you're later on if we really
really wanted to get fancy you could
make the numbers per per tag but
I wouldn't envision launching something
with like that anytime soon any other
questions okay well thank you fall for
your time thanks for attending</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
