us today the present that tater today is
a company called EMP it's one of the
very interesting robotic startup coming
from Japan and as you may know they're a
bunch of robotic startup in Japan but
most of them are sticking on two legs
robot and they were but this uniqueness
of this company is recently they decided
to go into the consumer market and
trying to integrate it in daily life of
us in this case you see the earlier
robots in the middle which which was
selected one of the best invention of
the year by time magazine last year and
then later they're going to show you the
newest robot camera which is integrated
ipod without Wi-Fi hopefully it will be
connected to some google service in the
future so here's we have two people the
president of zmp and also the the main
business engineer who's talks about the
company introduction so how do i go away
my name is Hisashi taniguchi the founder
and the CEO PMP incorporated in Japanese
robotics company so we have developed
mural the robot which I I am going to be
talking this afternoon so GMP was
established in january two thousand one
and we have proposed our vision so crazy
oven new lifestyle useful and giroux and
so by incorporating robotic technology
into our daily life so without further
delay
I thank you for the opportunity
opportunity to present our company and
the demonstration so I will pass the mic
and one of our members and mr. David
Arriaga rich thank you very much mr. de
anoche my name is david le haga i'm in
charge of international management
strategy offices in cmp and i'm going to
be presenting our robots so first of all
I mean that the main theme of this
afternoon is our latest robot but you
know to give you some idea who are we we
are going to be brief introduction of
our previous robots by previous I don't
mean they are not useful anymore they
are very useful so this is basically our
history so I'm going to be talking about
this our first robot was called Pino
this robot was the result of a Japanese
science and technology project which was
a technology technologically transfer to
us and we started commercializing and
after that we made a complete redesign
of the Interior and so that became penal
version 2 and and this year we have
actually resigned it again and now it's
much more stable and it's peanut version
3 as you can see Pino had a very cute
exterior that was the objective of both
the project and also for our company we
believe that robots you know you see
rowboating any other companies or in any
other places and you see robots that are
very you know clumsy and you be a lot of
cables or whatever and we believe that
you know robots a personal robots have
to have a good theory or a good a
pleasure all exterior because they're
going to be interacting with with us
with humans and so we want to be
pleasure I mean we want to be you know
it's a pleasurable experience to to have
them and 22 well not to talk with them
but maybe in the future so that's why
this
cute exterior was created for the robot
and actually became very popular in
Japan appear in television commercials
like NTT DoCoMo mobile cell phone UCC
which is coffee company and also a video
of a Japanese pop star with a la Hikaru
and she I mean our robot appear in the
individuals well and also appear in a
museum of modern art in new york so it
was as a character became very popular
and our second our second robot is
called Nouveau and actually we have one
over here you know so I'm going to maybe
you know we ready for you know
interacting me and nuvo together so
hello nouveau I wish I it personal you
know when he enters into you know like a
little for happening that that's okay
you know and what else can you do
anymore okay you see the return home
also
maybe he's a little tired now lost you
oh he's doing a little extras you know
opposite opposite you know he actually
does more extra than me yeah little lazy
you know
say hello to everybody please say hello
to two new o as well alright so as you
can see these are we wanted to make a
robot with a stylish design and
cutting-edge technology that can you
know dance while playing music announce
the time become a cameraman I don't know
if you have noticed that you know it has
a camera to take pictures for you and
also you know it can be used by a cell
phone so it can keep security at home
because you know what's happening at
home when you're not there and as you
can see also receive a lot of exposure
actually you can see over there will
admit you know when he came to Japan to
promote that the movie irobot you know
yeah I mean no was there so bleep well
he wanted to be there and also a New
York Times appear in Newton's the
magazine time actually nominated like
one of the coolest inventions of 2005 so
and it has several cool features first
of all you know that it was developing
collaboration with several creative
people you know very creative people
like for example Kano cuyama who is a
very famous industrial designer of you
know Ferrari or pin pin pin ocarina and
several other artists that you can see
over there and also when not only artist
you know it was also technical people
several companies several technical
companies ruinous ends and I'm for
example seiko that robot shoes because
as you can see it has shoes was
developed by by mizuno which is a
Japanese company as well and so it was a
huge effort and we were very very happy
to develop something like this but also
i'm going to present another robot you
know this is these robots called nouveau
and there is in tville meaning
educational nouveau because you know
this this robot is for everyday people
for people who want to you know you know
play interact use the music voice
recognition all the features and but you
know there are people who wants to learn
how it works right i mean why does it
work why why is it moving so that's why
we develop this
over here and you can see you know that
the the lower part is very similar so I
mean putting aside or the camera and the
boys recognition features you know with
this robot you can learn all areas
related to robotics like electronics
mechanics control theory programming so
and this different than other robots you
know this is a totally open system so we
view this we our code how we do it how
did it we splain it software everything
so this is actually being used in japan
very much being used in japan as you can
see there in the photograph that's a the
photograph of a university in japan in
which they are using you know this robot
for i mean one robot one student they're
learning robotics over there and also
outside japan we we have some clients in
Mexico some clients in Singapore some
clients in Taiwan I believe some in the
United States but I'm not really sure
and you know I put the mexico won
because first of all they're very good
you know they put these Mexican hats
over there and second of all their
Champions you know because they went to
Korea and they want a robotic contest in
Korea may be in 2004 so well they
deserve a place to be there you know and
plus they're cute well those are the
robots we have been developing the
philosophy of our robots is as I said
they have to be robots that are you know
near the human it's not like something
as tarek or anything you have to have a
very you know pleasurable exterior or
interface with a human and and change
somehow the lifestyle of us of humans so
talking about this we are ready we are
ready to talk about mural our latest
robot which is a little bit different a
little bit different so Bureau is a
short form music innovation based on
utility robot technology but
that's very very very long and what we
want it to be is as you can see it in
the in the screen we want it to be my
personal DJ that's that's our objective
our dream or vision so without further
delay I think maybe we would like to see
a little bit of the robot is the camera
okay alright so let's see small
demonstration I'll cover robot you know
it's the as you can see this is not a
bipedal right and you know it's dancing
and let me the camera so if you're
careful so you know it's dancing and I
maybe want to dance you know with it
right so because I want to keep with it
with it with a rhythm all right and you
know oh I have to have to tell you the
dance is not just some part that we
program because we're crazy no easy as
you know the fires of the dance it is
you know a tone with a music which is
much better than me I can say
alright so sick or their do alright so
and this is our musical robot our mural
and I'm going to be explaining a little
bit what is inside Bureau I mean why is
it different because you know you see
using your rocket moving it's cute but
ok it's a musical player nothing else
well no I mean if you think so that's
nothing you know we don't want it to be
and I'm going to be repeating this you
know the whole afternoon so please just
get used to you know we don't want it to
be just a musical player one more of
many you know in the market that's not
our objective but first of all I'm going
to be talking what's inside you know our
robot we want to integrate into the
robot both musical technology and
robotics technology and we have
developed this robot I mean it was a
coup effort together with kenwood which
is a Japanese company you know for for
very specializing music and so first of
all talking about only sound and music
it has three characteristics that make
it a very good high quality sound I
think we were going to be listening soon
an example of how good that the sound is
and the first the first thing that you
know you see when you see the robot is
that you know it's a sphere so even for
kenwood it was a it was a challenge you
know they have never designed speakers
such as these you know spiracles now now
listen
you know it's a very good reproduction
for its size it's the best and and you
know first as I said the shape this is
very good shape even though it was a
challenge for kenwood you know the
experts in musical technology said that
you know that's actually the best shape
that and then the speaker can have so so
actually it was it contributed to the
quality of the music the second thing is
that you know we divide the speakers in
24 channels you can see here to over
here for that for the low tones and two
over here for their high tones so we
didn't want to sacrifice the high tone
reproduction for example just to make
sure it works you know it's it it
actually works I mean with high tones
with low tones and the third thing that
you can see an escomm attic in the in
the in the presentation is that there is
a double enclosure meaning that inside
inside the robot you know there is there
is a double mean well enclosure and said
with the objective that you know that
the music the sound comes from here not
from some weird you know song from here
and there's a reverberation it would be
awful to listing it so these all
qualities of musical technology of
course as I said it was a co-development
with kenwood and the other thing apart
from music Oh first of all I'm going to
tell you what kind of music I need play
first of all it can play ipod and please
we are going to see our words the ipod
over here because I a dog I'm not a dog
but you know a place to put the ipod
over here can see and you know this
supports you know third generation long
i put so no not only the one who is over
there and also not only i mean with ipod
you know you can
insert the ipod and see the contents of
your output totally I mean with when
it's connected the mural with the ipod
also I can you can enjoy your iTunes
music library or your windows media
player music library by using this mural
connected with our I mean through a
wireless land with a pc and finally I
mean last but not least and you know you
can use it to play internet radio and i
have to point for you that you know you
don't need a pc for that I mean we are
going to see a we're going to see oh the
reproduction I know if you can see it
very clearly with the camera but anyway
we are going to see how how this works a
little bit first of all let's suppose
you you you buy I mean you're you get
your your mural you bring it let's say
here the ring here and then you start
searching for fora for you know that
then what is networks that there is and
here there's Google and Google guest and
I think we are guests so we are guests
oh ok then let's let's do it with a
google guests and once it's it's on then
we can already play some internet radio
and so what I wanted to convey was that
you know it doesn't need a pc just in
it's just that you know the wireless LAN
connection so that so that the robot can
you know play your favorite music I mean
by the I mean your favorite how to call
it station radio station and those three
are I put internet radio and itunes and
windows media player there things that
you know this robot can play and the
schematics electronics inside first of
all there is the robot module which is
in charge of controlling all the robotic
you know features like the display the
gyro seller agent sensor oh I didn't
mention the gyro strange i'm going to be
mentioning later distance sensors motors
everything related with gino robotic
technology there's the el dia model
which is in charge of everything related
with audio you know a Twitter the woofer
and also you know sound effects
everything that occurs a good
reproduction of music and the multimedia
module which is in charge of the camera
and oh I I didn't mentioned it has a
camera and full of surprises you can see
and the world land so now talking about
motion because we have talked a lot
about music now we are going to be
talking about motion you know this robot
can perform several things you already
saw the dance right and I was pointing
out while dancing sorry my enthusiastic
dance but you know I was I was pointing
out that you know this dance is not just
some pretty cool pattern patterns that
you know they just for example i don't
know i mean you play something really
really funky and then after that you
know starts doing some kind of ballad or
something I mean there is a sign
synchronization between them the rhythm
I mean the music music the rhythm of the
music and and
movements of course you can somehow
select different basic patterns but then
after that there is a dynamical
synchronization so ok see you can see
there now now we are going to be
interacting a little right so they look
I'm not touching it I'm not touching it
si si no he's not touching it ok not now
no gloomy see I'm not touching it so
there are sensors you know for object
detection of your robot and also for
edge detection here so you know that's
that's what it makes you know that some
several features that we believe are
very very interesting in terms of dance
also there is another feature I'm going
to be telling you that the center in
feature now you can see there's a there
is a bottom in that in de in the remote
control and present that bottom makes
you you know make the robot center
through you and you can move and the
robot will will follow you and see where
were you going and you keep moving and
you keep moving and the robot will keep
you know looking for you right
it's so a mural we try to face you which
is that to achieve the best spot for
listening quality Hey excellent all
right no no you no you see that's moving
and moving and going around and whatever
but you know it should be you know in
that that you know the center should be
moving also you know and maybe the ipod
would you move over there so why doesn't
do this you know we incorporate also
balancing technology that means even
though you know that the robot is moving
and moving all the time you know the
center it's you know keep its kept
stable stabilized because we used a gyro
accelerate your sensors that keep keep
it stable so that you know for example
that the ipod is always in our
horizontal position so these are some
features that this robot has and there's
one more feature that i want to talk
about and actually it's one of the
features that we are more enthusiastic
about and your later you're going to see
why why we're interested in this feature
and this video is called autonomous
motion now autonomous motion means um
well it's its name says you know
autonomous in the sense that the robot
will move by itself I mean autonomously
I mean okay okay we will await your
orders of course with that with a remote
control of course because you don't want
a robot to be out of control right so it
will await your orders but other than
that it will it will act by itself so
already all right so let's suppose I'm
going to explaining this later but let's
suppose you you have a favorite
listening point and we are going to be
moving I mean you move there listening
the robot to the favorite listening poem
for example over there oh okay that I
like it there I like it there so you
want to record this listening point
and you record it with that into the
remote control you select a location and
say okay you want to record it and yes
it has been successfully safe so now
this this listening point is into your
remote control and then you know that
robot keeps doing what it has to do you
know move dance and do stuff and you
also do your stuff and then maybe later
that day see you know I want to listen
music in my favorite spot right so all
you have to do is yes you know press the
button which it has been record and then
you know you just go and have a
cappuccino because the robot will start
okay oh so the robot will start
calculating its route to their listening
to the listening spot that you did that
you liked by itself I mean you don't
need to direct it you need to do
anything so now why do we want to do
this you know it's not because you know
we have fun you know some engineers in
our company you know hey why don't we
put some returns motion that would be
cool and then you put it and then you
don't know why no but actually there's a
reason why we want autonomous motion
first of all as i said before i was
going to be repeating it all the audio
afternoon we don't want this mural of us
to be just another musical player you
know one of the many that are in the
market you know the difference between
our mural i mean at least our vision of
mural and you know another musical
player that with a musical play you are
the user you go to the missile player
okay i want to play this all right and
you're listening and that's a matching
all right but we want to achieve not
just a machine we want to achieve what
it says in the beginning you know your
personal DJ some some kind of a partner
to you that can you know finally be
somehow to some degree independent from
from from you I mean you don't have to
be doing everything all the time
and of course it there's a long way for
that but you know the first step into
this direction is the autonomous motion
let's suppose i'm going to put an engine
area for this let suppose you wake up in
the morning and you're you have to be in
the mood for going work right because if
not if you if you are delayed you nor
your boss will get a we get angry right
so I'm anyway so you know you need some
kind of music that wakes you up and
actually you need near your bed so you
okay you're you're sleeping in your bed
and then the robot comes and plays your
music wake you up and say okay I'm up
late in the afternoon you have to do
some overworked maybe after after coming
from the from the company or after
returning home but you have to do some
you know a little coffee before you know
to gain a little energy and so you want
the robot near you to be playing another
kind of music and okay you make your
coffee and then in after you finish your
work maybe in at night when you're okay
or a little bit more relaxed then you
just go and sit down and you don't read
a book and you you want some kind of
soothing music you know maybe near the
couch so those are for example three
different three different favorite
listening positions and you want the
robot to you I mean you come home tired
and you don't want to be directing your
robot moving your oh but you just said
okay go there and then the road goes
there and and start playing your music
so that that's the idea i mean it has to
something that helps you not something
that you know butters you and how do we
do this I mean first of all inside the
robot there is a first of all sales
localization based on the multiple
sensors cuts including the camera I
didn't show you the camera oh it's over
here the camera well I can you know
point here there's the camera over here
so can the camera is one of the sensors
that are used for self localization and
of course we have also sensors in the
inner wheels for using for odometry
and I mean so it's kind of a multi
sensor technology and also the robot has
map making capabilities meaning that you
you put it in your room and starts
making a map of your room so finally
that's how it sells localized itself I
mean in your room because it has a map
of your rooms knows more or less where
are your reasoning points but the camera
is very important because you know you
know okay if you put it in the floor and
you know it keeps moving and recording
how much it is going here and there okay
you can use the steel odometry and your
map and well okay that can work but what
happens if you know I don't know one of
your kids come some oh I want to play so
I they take it and put it over here
that's it you know your drama tree
already has died so that's why we also
incorporate the camera because you know
once you want it to be localized again
you know it use the camera to search
where it's where it is and finally finds
in which point of the map he is of
course if you take it I don't know you
take it to New York then that's the end
of it because yeah don't do it all right
so well we want to achieve with this is
customization based on the user taste
that's what we want to achieve and
autonomous navigation to favorite
listening positions one example of this
for example with remote communication
when you have you know a mobile phone
and you know you're outside home and
then you left your kids in a I don't
know if all of you or many of you or
maybe none of you have kids I'm sorry
I'm saying kids I'm just so you know
making an exception but anyway let's
what you love your kids calm and then
you want to you say oh I wonder what
they are doing so I your again send only
the order and the robot will go to to
where your kids are usually playing go
there take a photograph send you the
photograph everything is all right okay
and play some music and for you that
doesn't have kids that I can also you
know work for your boyfriend or for you
here friend you know just check check
what's happening and play some music do
you know some to have some reason you
know I just wanted to play some music
for you and what a mechanical design
over here basically very very fast I
mean you can see here that there is the
display over here the ipod dock over
here there are the distance sensors and
the gyro can be seen because it's very
in the center and in your in the back
view in the rearview there are still the
distance sensors and the cameras I told
you over there so now you know we are
talking so much about the robot and you
maybe you're wondering okay but why
these guys are here you know what what's
our relationship with this or maybe they
just want to say hey you know in Japan
were doing these cool things or at least
what we think they're cool things well
i'm going to be sharing with you i mean
telling you a little bit what we want to
achieve with all of this i have to
already tell you a little bit but
basically you know you have a robot
there which is has some autonomous
motion features but what you want to
achieve I mean what we want to achieve
in the end is my personal da that's what
we want to achieve how can I say then a
physical agent should I say that well I
don't know I mean I creature mirror
maybe even a robot we can call it a
robot that actually helps you to have a
better and more joyful lifestyle as mr.
Channing which is said you know not
something that bothers you and what I
mean not not something that you do
another one I mean another thing that I
have to learn how it works and
everything no i mean because something
it has to be something that you know
lets you enjoy music in a in a different
way and for example my personal da muro
will let you enjoy your favorite music
anywhere
anytime in the place you like it at the
time you like it the music you like and
in and in a moment you like so and how
do what was the idea here I already
talked about the bedroom the living room
I mean how they move autonomously but
finally you know we are our technology
we can build what we call a live lock of
you know our of the user tasis you know
in what at one moments he likes it what
kind of music what volume i don't know i
mean the taste of the of the user and
then finally even sharing it with other
personal life locks and maybe find
something like for example I know you
like classical rock and then maybe if
you like the Beatles thing maybe you
will he will find a little rolling stone
sank and I think I'm reeling my age over
here sorry but anyway so that's
basically what we want to achieve in my
personal da you know it hasn't been
achieved yet it is not achieved yet so
to do this of course there's much more
technology has to be apply on this robot
but why are we here I mean first of all
we have been kindly invited to to to
give a talk in Google and second of all
you know we're aware that you know for
example if we will live locks it has it
implies a lot of data user taste and you
know this this mirror and the other
mirror and the other mural you know it's
it's a huge quantity of data and we
wanted to I mean we dream of a half of
the robot being adaptable to the user
cases so and we know of course Google
that I mean that the kind of technology
that are you working or with an
so I imagine how many things I mean now
you can do some autonomous motion but
how many other things can be achieved
you know if we put our heads together or
something like this so you know we built
a new interface with a contents and we
provide a customization with the amine
with that user taste how who where when
what kind of music and without you know
technology for searching and several
other kinds of technology you know if
they are put together you know then the
personal DJ that can be enjoyed by both
me and you it'll come in even come and
you know can surpass any any anybody's
dream so that's basically why we want to
share it with you we wanted to provide I
mean as I said a new interface a
physical interface in which for example
Google technology and you know work I
mean a new way of being of doing things
and well I think that's the end of my
presentation thank you very much and as
i said i hope i can i was able to share
with you what we what what our dreams
and our visioning our company are from
here for the future thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
