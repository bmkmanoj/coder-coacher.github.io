tomorrow Perkins and several other
distinguished visitors she's brought
with us that she'll introduce tomorrow I
met at a Cara benefit dinner where she
was doing grief counseling on a
volunteer basis found out she was a yoga
teacher which is also a passion of mine
then found out she was also a film
director and producer working on
volunteer time to follow her own
interest in heart too i investigate and
document incarceration issues in San
Quentin prison based on the volunteer
work she'd been doing there so now I'm
happy to pass over to my good friend and
super woman herself tomorrow Perkins
thank you so much and I'd like to extend
that thank you back to Paul without him
we wouldn't be here obviously and he has
just been a support from the beginning
and is another true pioneer and activist
and I'm excited to be his friend I'm
excited to be his friend and see how far
he's come and just the short time that
we've known each other so and would also
like to acknowledge our team a few of
the trust team members are here Jessie
Dana is the producer and director
photography simran Gill and sees our
development director and associate
producer and invert interns mint Horner
is here with the camera and Tony did
julia is helping out with fun
development and soon I'll get to
introduce you to dr. Mendez I just want
to take a moment to let you know what we
want to present today first of all Paul
alluded to how I got into this into this
documentary project through the work
that I was doing in San Quentin and I
was inspired by dr. Mendez who's here
today and the work he's been doing for
over 30 years with the National Trust so
we'll spend some time let him just talk
to you about what the National Trust has
been doing across the country and now in
San Quentin and then give you a little
bit of just what the the current state
of incarceration policy and practices
are right now which made me realize yes
we it's
a time to do that film and then give you
a sneak peek into the filming that we've
just finished so forgive us we're a
little bit a little bit tired still
recovering from a very intense 18-day
shoot a lot of that filming was done in
San Quentin and around that and around
the county so you'll be able to see what
it looks like before it gets polished
and massage and just get some you know
just get a behind-the-scenes look at
some of the people that will be
following and so hopefully we'll get to
see you again in about three months or
so and and show you what it looks like
once we get a chance to go through the
post-production process so with that I'd
look to actually just start with our
introductory trailer so you can just get
a sense of what the trust is the the
film
and
it's a long process for us to evaluate
the harm that our cause you know I knew
I did wrong that's not enough to just
know that you did wrong
and kidnap one of the things they look
at is if you've got more than one Victor
problem victims i had with three men two
women and two kids
doing whatever I wanted to do that made
me happy that made me feel comfortable
resulting in me robbing my own home
eventually turning the gun on my little
sister and killing her
robbers or kidnappers you don't look at
the other person as human or as a person
at that time you identify what your
needs I'm another one of those young men
who they talk about who the father was
incarcerated for the most part of his
life our relationship was supposed to be
established through love and caring and
nourishment and support and somehow it
transition and to violence and drug
abuse and and crying you know you don't
want to tell a child that their father
is just really not a good person to be
around and I think Danielle's it that
I'm gonna do this I'm gonna have this
relationship I'm gonna have this love
regardless to what it costs me and it
calls his young life it causes life
we have punished ourselves into a very
severe corner we've had them locked down
for long periods of time now and we're
releasing them back in the community
having failed in most ways to do
anything substantial about their
rehabilitation how many times you've
been back since I've been in here Oh me
I've been back about photons but
different cases these guys go right back
out to the community with no better
skills and when they violated for what
the third fourth fifth sixth time and
they go back out and this is the turn
style that we talk about is not about
rehabilitating it's about punishment
still to this day some people say well
you could get a job that's you
have to know how to work to get a job
someone in your environment has to have
gotten up in the morning dressed Eden
and gone to work if that has never
happened then you don't have that value
if they don't change their thought
processes if they don't go through a
cognitive restructuring process if you
will then if they come out thinking the
same way they thought when they went in
then the recidivism rate will continue
to be high
what we see happening is not the way it
is it's the way that we've allowed it to
be and that can change we're going to
take this thing to a whole other level
we're raising the bar I'm saying that we
want those men to be successful so we
put the trust together saying we have
all these people in the penitentiary we
don't recognize them as a resource I
think there are resource in communities
that say they're resource short we have
a resource that's where we're going to
prepare men to come home and do
community building we think I think a
penitent you can do that that's the goal
the good thing about trust is that it
now helps you get prepared to go to
society and compare your mind if you
accountable once you get into the shop
okay today you guys we're gonna start
off with the trust value system so you
go get the older guys as we pass this
information on to them both culture they
go to other nine selenium there's a
different way to do this and they'll
listen to each other or to offer
ourselves we feel good about ourselves
at the time to work with kids trouble
use I work with ex-cons or guys that are
locked up and keep the processor
reestablishing people's value systems we
are saying at the time that we consider
those our strengths our goal is to get
man back into the community and be
leaders in the community I said now that
sounds good because I or the community a
lot
I destroyed my community so it's time
that I helped rebuild my community you
began flipping your script from that
script of being a victim and and being
an Intimidator to flipping the script to
say you know I could do something
different now I know that I have the
tools to live that through so by
internalizing my value system and
changing the way I see things I think
it's gonna be a powerful asset when I
get back to community to reestablish
myself as a citizen all of these areas
kept us out of trouble at one point in
time but we didn't look at it at that
time my debt to society doesn't stop
because I got out of prison it actually
starts all over now I have to prove to
society at unworthy to maintain a life
out there and stay and we trusted in a
community make the people responsible to
the people and then things change
I have watched the trust infect men with
positivity working with the trust by me
right now it's one like a badge of pride
because I am at a place now I never
imagined myself to be to actually be in
the trust program and to come out and to
actually apply some of the things that
dr. Mendez taught me and to actually put
this into practice I'm a living witness
the people thing is a prison program
knows not its a community development
program turning liabilities and assets
if we can make an investment in these
people that when they go out they do not
add to the list of victims in the
community that's what we do for the
victims that's what we do for Public
Safety that's what we're doing for our
children I put the work in and someday
soon somebody will see that I'm worth to
chat
actually let me come back to that for a
moment one of the people that one of the
amazing people is doing great work in
the community that I interviewed a
couple weeks ago Devon bogan he's
working in the heart of Richmond and he
told me this this this quote and it
keeps coming up for me over and over and
over again because it really to me means
that the time is now the opportunity is
now and everything that we do today can
and will have an effect on our future so
with that let me introduce dr. Gary
Mendez come on up
I'd answer how many minutes because
there's a whole bunch of stuff that
needs to be said about this but we only
have a few minutes to talk about all
right but we're doing here is is not a
reentry program a lot of people think
we're getting guys ready to come home
that's the incidental piece these guys
have to change whether they come home or
not and they have to become resources
and and I was talking to Tony just a
little while ago and I said the state
finds them as a resource and we were
coming over ere you gotta clean and bent
over there that you can put your clothes
in and get them clean okay the same
thing goes on in the penitentiary the
officers and anybody else can bring your
clothes in and put them in that basket
and they'll be clean by the inmates and
they'll end up paying a dollar or
something like that so the state sees
them as a cleaning resource you get your
firefighters from the penitentiary they
take guys from the penitentiary March
them up there and they fight fires they
save money but all kinds of ways the
state saves money by using these guys
when the guy gets busted it's in goes to
court they say the state versus whoever
it is the state versus tomorrow now the
state didn't get knocked in the head the
state didn't have anybody breaking in
this house if I take myself an example
you broke into my house and now the
state is claiming the charge is you
against the state no we don't accept
that so when a guy goes to jail for what
he did against the state that does not
pay back the community it does not pay
back the people who really victimized
and so that's why you're flying in
communities where there's victims
they're not saying let's stop building
prisons they're not saying that that
they want their share out of this and I
tell the guys you owe us you went to
jail
because the state said you go to jail
but you didn't give me back what I what
you owe me and now I'm expecting you to
pay me back while you're in this
penitentiary I expect you to take
responsibility for your families so if
you have kids I want to know how you're
taking care of them guy tells me I'm
locked up how can I take care of me so I
ask them so you're suggesting that i
should take care of your kids that's
you're telling me i should raise your
kids I ain't going to raise your kids
that's your job so well how do I do it
ok that's a different question and I can
help you figure out how to do that but
that's your job that's not mine I want
you to be responsible for your family I
want you to be responsible for the
community that you bet you here guys now
you're and what they're saying right I
owe something to the community that's
what we talked about we don't talk about
will get you a job when you come out I'm
not going to get you a job that's your
job while you're in this penitentiary
all those years you're not figuring out
how to get a job if you're just waiting
for me to find you a job I think you'll
have some problems because I ain't even
going to look for you and not going to
do that if you want me to find your
place to live I'm not going to find you
a place to live that's your job to do
that that's what grown men do and so
that's what we try to convince these
guys but you do it by expecting
something of them if you expect them
that stupid they'll accommodate you if
you expect them to do something to stand
up and do something they'll do it they
may ask you how but they'll do it once
you show them how to do it a guy tells
me yesterday because they all got
stories he tells me yesterday that he
needs a place to stay when he leaves and
he doesn't want to go to a home you know
they have what is it transitional
housing as it's being called right ok
you could go there he says I don't do
that I want a home so what are you
talking about he said all of my life
I've lived either in a group home which
means foster or something right there
the penitentiary or jail I want to go
into my house no
else is in there but me and I want to go
outside when we want to go outside come
inside when I want to come inside and I
don't have to all the time say here's
the rules to stay in this home I've
never experienced that I'd like to
experience that that's a very that's a
very small thing of guys asking right he
didn't ask for a bunch of money he just
said could he stay and I in an apartment
or someplace by himself probabilities
are no because they're going to tell him
he's got to go to some transitional
houses or something like that or they're
not gonna let them out however just easy
things like that guys may be asking us
so I'm trading this guy's okay let me
see if I can help you but you got to
help us that's what I said everybody you
got to help us until you do some things
I'm not gonna I'm not going to do
anything for you use that doubt bus
because you you owe me brother and
that's how I see this whole thing and
there's something else is going on I
should say and I'm calling a silent
crisis and i know i don't know today and
i'm glad you all showed up and i
understood there was a very good speaker
earlier who had a lot of stuff to say
and all that kind of business and that's
cool however the silent crisis is this
one where people aren't finding out
what's going on with incarceration and
what's going on in this country what are
our nation's prisons and here in
california where they're refusing to
sign budgets and all that kind of stuff
nine billion dollars is being spent on
Penitentiary's and that nine billion
dollars is not for rehabilitation I hope
you're already thinking that if you are
a guy had just in time to save you like
The Lone Ranger okay because that's not
what's happening with your money that's
not what's happening with your money and
I and with the kid out the guy I was
talking to yesterday is in the what they
call the reception area at San Quentin
and guys Oh violate parole go back and
forth that's exactly right back and
forth in that area they'll be in for a
few months and be back out and it may be
in up to a year and they'll be back out
now you would think during that period
of time something is going on with that
guy now I'm going to tell you what
they're doing with them during that
period of time where they got this nine
billion dollars they have about 800 of
them or more in a gymnasium
sleeping on these double bunks all
together what do they do during the day
nothing they sleep they sit there they
drive they're using drugs are drying out
well they could continue using drugs
anymore because drugs are in the
penitentiary however we'll assume
they're not having drugs all right
they're just drying out waiting it they
sleep that time or sit around watching
that time until it's time for them to be
released there is no there are no
classes that's where we come in now and
try to say we got to put them through
some process but until now nothing
happens that's half of them the other
half are in a cellblock West block West
block is all cells they stay in
ourselves 23 hours a day for their own
the whole time they're there 23 hours a
day that's the rehabilitation is going
on and they got nine billion dollars and
say they don't have enough if you talk
to them about well we could you give us
some of that money to do some of this
work we're doing we can't we don't have
enough it's all it's all spent so you
should know that when when you hear
people talk about what's going on with
incarceration is in the state and now
they're talking about they're going to
let 55,000 of news maybe they keep
threatening to do that to scare you
because they're going to make you think
all these dangerous people hit the
street nanny was hitting the street
that's not we're sitting most of them
just mess with drugs and as you well
know there's no real war on drugs in
this country it just bet in terms of
where you smoking your dope that's all
you know that there's no real war on
drugs however these guys are in jail for
drugs that's what that's what I'm let
out of the jail unfortunately since they
do nothing with them for that period of
time they're in jail they come out worse
really than when they went in because
they had a value system that's what we
argue all your behavior is driven by
values they had a crazy enough value
system before they went into the
penitentiary in the penitentiary is a
straight out in the house and that
reinforces all that crazy behavior gets
reinforced and when it's tight and
they're going to come back to the street
they come back to the street they bring
that behavior with them and now they
have had this is the silent crisis they
have a major impact on the communities
especially African
American communities so that the value
systems into prison and the value system
in America african community are the
same are moving towards the same and
that means that all this craziness is
going on that's what I think it's a
crisis and we're not doing anything
about it so I try to mobilize at least
the guys to understand we have to do
something so i can convince people
inside we have to do something that's
why they say they want to work with
young people we want to work with people
to stop this now i'm trying to mobilize
people on the outside my man's a project
knows how to run projects I don't know
how to do it in campaigns and work with
him he's going to help me do this and
we're going to put together our national
campaign and address this but not
national groups you know natural girls
don't do anything no profanity right
they don't do anything all right but
local groups can and that's what we
really need to mobilize them and we're
going to try to do that but we'll have
question answers after okay that's
enough so one thing I wanted to mention
there is a duck's is document dr. Mendez
has been working a lot with lifers and
so there's a difference between you know
the majority the folks that are in this
turnstile are the short-term irse and
they don't get any services the folks
that are not coming out for the most
part they're getting the services and
they're the ones that are becoming this
mobilization force because they can
begin to create change from within so
when you see the blue shirts that's
generally long-termer lifers and when
you see orange this is that turnstile
they're talking about and I've been into
quotes lately Dostoyevsky but this is a
what I wanted to show you the gym so
this is this is a gym and we are
actually standing in this little
platform where the classes class takes
place so it's completely open can
imagine the noise the smell that this is
where people spend most of their time if
not
in the five tiers in West block so I
just wanted to just take a couple
moments before we go into the the raw
footage to just talk about some of the
the numbers and maybe Jesse on it so
just looking at the prison system we
talked about the nine point nine point
nine billion that we're spending here in
California its list of 50 billion in the
country and we're looking at gosh the
number has just gone up to 2.3 million
people and jails or prisons and actually
I believe it's seven points or simin 7.3
million people that are in prisons jails
we're on probation or parole so it
really starts to grow when you start to
look at that and then we've got you know
an annual cost of $50,000 an inmate and
the seventy percent recidivism rate so
just to kind of give you a sense of you
know what's happening right now and this
I just wanted to this is what I was
talking about before we've got the
seventy percent recidivism rate for the
short-term errs those lifers who do
actually successfully parole have a
really small recidivism rate generally
they're in their 40s or 50s or 60s and
and so for many reasons they're not
living that criminal lifestyle anymore
this is I think what hits me the hardest
just looking at how from a policy
perspective we've chosen to spend our
funds again up over 40 to 9 billion in
2007 I'm on you know on state
corrections spending and then adding
another 25 billion to that by 2011 and
then just looking at you know from 87 to
2000 where we're sending our our funding
you know I'm near twenty one percent in
higher education while at the same time
121 percent it was over two hundred
percent here in California actually
some some costs here it costs 45,000
generally to keep a man forty-five to
fifty thousand to keep a man incarcerate
an adult incarcerated metalman and it's
about 80,000 to keep a youth in a
juvenile justice center and at our
California Youth Authority it actually
costs around two hundred thousand
dollars to keep a youth am incarcerated
and by contrast to see what we spend on
education is between four and 12
thousand dollars a year so just again I
feel like education is power so the more
we understand about this just looking at
dollars and cents David Manson's and
another good friend of mine who has been
working on his mandate and life is
reducing violence in communities and
just from a dollars and cents
perspective 45 thousand dollars to start
a youth program in a school forty-five
thousand dollars day house an inmate in
the state prison that didn't get that
violence prevention program forty-five
thousand dollars to treat a gun wound
gunshot wound for the person who would
have really liked that guy to have
gotten a violence prevention program so
this is what we're looking at re-entry
and community-building documentas said
it much better than I ever will be able
to but direct community involvement
equals success and yes it's on the
ground level that that we do it each one
of us have an effect san mateo county is
in here with the counties here in the
Bay Area ranked in the highest rancher
rates in the country 650,000 men and
women returning annually but what are
some things that are working so a lot of
people have heard of delancey street I
think of them as more of a direct
service provider so perhaps that's not
going to work unless you get something
like the trust and the National Trust
helping you change your mind sex you
first have to know that you need help or
know that you want to change you need to
find know that there's something more
but still only 14,000 people over 38
years right i mean when you look at the
numbers they're not compare and then
local private he's talking about these
transitional housing the recidivism or
the success rates are phenomenal so when
there is support in the community it
works and these are some of the
obstacles that I don't you wanna just um
so something the reason we're doing this
film and is addressing a lot of what the
obstacles to change our and a lot of
that is public perception of public
perception of who the men are that are
inside prison we all have a perception
that people in prison are kind of crazy
and they probably deserve to be there
and a lot of them do deserve to be there
for the things that they've done but as
doc was saying in his presentation a
minute ago most of them are in there for
drug-related offenses most of them are
people with an illness people that need
treatment and people who after receiving
that treatment are actually genuinely
likable people and just could meet on
the street and never know many of the
men we work with inside if I wasn't
inside prison while I was meet working
with them I would have no idea that they
should be there so that's that's a big
shift that needs to happen in this
country we're bombarded with images from
NBC lockup and various Discovery Channel
shows and all these things that present
a very violent and dark side to all and
people that are incarcerated when the
reality is that's a very small
people inside prisons beyond that other
obstacles to change are of course that
we need more community involvement we
need more funding for programs and then
a larger policy issue is a prison
industrial complex the amount of funding
that the prison unit the prison guards
Union their Lobby is gigantic and
there's I believe it on the book it's
four guards or five guards / 66 cards /
or six inmates for one guard yeah so
basically the six inmates per one guard
so therefore the there's an incentive to
have more inmates in as often as
possible it's an incentive to violate
people as often as possible and that's
sort of a backwards system from the
perspective of having a positive
positive grows in the community I mean
it's great from a jobs perspective for
the prison Union for people that are
working in the prison but in terms of
the communities where these people are
returning to its really backwards and is
something that does have to change um
say one last thing so and just it we're
about to show this the sixth successive
lick and I want to make sure that I
really state restate what doc mind I
said we're not saying that people should
get out of prison that's not the point
of this at all but when we have a 20 to
30 or one sit and eighty percent sorry
failure rate we need to look at it and
when we're looking at third grade test
scores to figure out how many prison
beds two to build had to how many
prisons to build etc I think there's
other ways that we could use that
information so that's the point you know
not that not that we're here to let
people out and people are there because
they did something but maybe looking at
how do we move towards a more successful
way of dealing with the problem is
anything else no footage it up so the
footage that you guys are gonna be
seeing to see you know is we just spent
two and a half weeks shooting in San
Quentin and then out on the streets with
people that are post release and other
people that are in the community doing
community development this is this no
color correction there's no sound design
this is just raw footage it's been
edited to see this a little bit of
context
but it's it's very raw compared to the
trailer that you saw a moment ago that's
polished and has graphics and all that
sort of stuff but it will give you an
idea on the sort of things that we're
getting the head of axis that we have
and the view that we have into this
world and then we'll be coming back as
tomorrow was saying and a big part of
this also is that we want feedback from
you about the work that we're doing
we're making this film in a way that's
different most time people go off make a
movie and they get distribution and then
they show in theatres and that's that
but we're really trying to create a
movement around this and we're really
trying to raise awareness and part of
that process is bringing it to the
community getting feedback coming back
doing more work bringing it back to the
community and having an open dialogue
about what the issues are what is
working what's not working so you know
please keep that in mind as you're
looking at the footage and we have
question and we have questionnaire is
also on the seats around you that
address some of those issues
should say it's just under 10 minutes
Oh
I you sir
we didn't say one everybody coming down
morning
camera
you on the spot is what we call this car
putting you on the spot you guys are
looking at a reflection of yourself and
we're asking these brothers to be
successful out there so therefore when
you get out there you can be successful
with them it's going to take us to come
together as a collective to help each
other out mama we're asking you
gentlemen to do that's going home who's
not cut the umbilical cords keep your
umbilical cord connected with one of
your fellow brothers in here that means
send them a postcard to send them a
letter how much would you get that mail
and finding from here out there and then
get that mail from out there from you
back in here you'll be able to say them
and keep your head up we're pushing and
striving on the other side of these
walls and we ask that you pushing stride
till you get over here with us that's
the main thing don't cut off your
biblical court keep yourself connected
with each other because we understand
the struggles that
yes
cap
okay cause I got a camera crew with me
tonight oh
this is my cage
so all all of those things kind of came
together and basically made me act out
in a violent way against another human
being you a child no less and so
after years of attempting to company
groups it's a severity of what I did and
trying to balance that with who I know
myself to be today I have good days and
I have bad day some days is you know
it's like am I as bad as that act and I
question then there are other days when
I know that doesn't define me
I had to do this making the shelves for
the death bro
police had put their their alarm and
their equipment down there so we have to
bend this up he does a bar folder
I walked away from anything that could
have gotten into that I did and so I
don't ever wanted you know glamorizes
kind of stuff make it look like it's
cool i know they rap about it they talk
about it movies and videos and you know
they don't show the side of the people
being hurt you know families being left
destitute your kids like Raquel growing
up without a father Noel growing up
without a father you know and so uh but
it's real you know income to prison
dealing with you know I can't prison I
realize it there's thousands of guys
just like me for probably worse I'm in
here with my father I came to prison
with my father I only met him five times
I was just like you I had those periods
where you know my grandparents would
come pick me up hey you're gonna see
your dad and I was real exciting for me
and I felt good because mom had too many
rules right she was too strenuous she
wanted me to call and check in she want
me to go to school she want me to do
homework she want me to clean up right I
can't have my girlfriend's car I can't
have my friends come over all the time
that sound familiar to you okay yes
familiar i want you to really listen now
what they say and i went through that
process of turning her into a monster
when that monster was really showing me
all the love in the world and i was
turning my mother into a monster because
she to me she was restraining me from
having my fun and having my freedom and
enjoyment and so when I got around my
father he allowed me to smoke weed he
allowed me to drink beer he allowed me
to do what I wanted to do I'd have to
come in on time I'd have to check in
with him you see the difference right
and because of that freedom I felt like
he was better for me and I chose the
wrong person you know how hook chose the
wrong person because my father was the
one that helped me make a decision to go
out and Rob somebody
Oh
follow me hang on Yuma
yeah that's a three different capital to
you just build on what the middle is the
party
here's the Brooklyn shopping sorry about
that everybody technical difficulties it
looks like
did you copy the desktop
like
the middle one is the part of the top of
the mountain top yeah sorry guys y'all
give me one second
the
just follow me gotta fetch it yeah
that's a three different Capitol Theatre
this building right here is the butcher
shop the middle one is the Protestant
chapel will get the nomination
top
I was living the front right there and
uh this is one during the time i'm i was
in her addiction and um she was she was
on hooked on crack at the time at the
same time by older brother he was
selling crack and so far i said we kind
of was bred into it because you know it
was all around this you know I'm saying
yeah them dimmer puppies ring back a lot
of memory but for me anyway a lot of
memory
recently right before I got out of San
Quentin when I was on selling drugs I
stopped reading this house right here
there should be a crack house I used to
run I used to run this right here yeah
so what it brought me in variety things
to do dating you should let it look like
that but I used to be a crack house
right here too
so that's that's the footage now sorry
about the technical difficulties there
so we'd actually like to from this point
just have a discussion about this about
what your guys feelings are what you've
seen today obviously what's here what
stood out the most what was unexpected
what do you want to know more about what
you didn't like what you did like all of
that anybody have any questions or
comments well I mean you know that's
going towards where we're building
actually a few new prisons right now and
that's going towards the operation of
prisons here in California I believe
it's is it 80 million dollars is that
what it costs to run San Quentin it's
it's a lot but some yeah so each prison
you know is getting a piece of that and
then of course um the I should if I was
gonna I'll get more information about
that but the nine point nine billion is
really for operation and building and
guards and you know infrastructure
nothing
yes the operational budget but they're
using they want another nine billion or
ten billion dollars to build additional
prisons in their car my mom re-entry
centers I think they're calling them
what I doing is you move them from
bigger prisons of the smaller prisons
that's it that's basically what it is
and they want additional analysis for
administration and very little of that
administration money goes to so-called
programs they added our is a CDC are
that's all I did was add our nothing
went with the art up the only thing I
could say that like some of that funding
from an administrative perspective might
might go to UM for example if lieutenant
Robinson shows up for something that
like those torches pay or if one of the
sponsors internal sponsors generally
unless you have a brown card or a green
card you can't come into the prison so I
think that's where they they get the are
from so far so it's really just a yeah
the show but let me say this though to
be to be fair is that if you think about
it they didn't hire anybody to be
rehabilitation people they hired them
the guard people security that's what I
hard and forth and people don't escape
so they do their job but that's what we
expected to do if you wanted now to do
rehabilitation then you have to bring in
somebody who knows how to do something
about rehabilitation and how you change
people and in the prison community their
their their belief is you change people
by you punish them you heard them and in
that then they'll behaving as you know
that doesn't work
all signs are this bit more like I'm
over that finesse is there any
indications of changes coming with the
new administrator federal yes the other
one thing that they I don't know it was
working in any way was the second chance
there is a bill it's been bad past and
funded that they're going to put money
into our so-called second chance but if
you think about the amount of money
they're going to put into I think it's
150 million dollars that they're going
to put into and it's going to be as you
know with the government what they're
going to do is they're going to spread
it out so all 50 states will get a piece
of that money that's the political stuff
as always goes and they may not all have
the same needs Plus as I was saying to
somebody before I came in here we spend
a lot of time on everything but social
issues and somehow social issues becomes
well we really don't have time to work
on the social issues all you do is read
the paper you look at the paper all the
time and the whole papers about social
issues and people interacting with each
other either locally nationally
internationally and people don't get
along but they say we don't have time to
work on that what we need to work on is
I shouldn't say this what we need to
work on is Wall Street we need to save
the banks we need you know there's all
kinds of stuff they need to work on but
don't talk about saving people oh yeah
incidentally we could save some people
if we did this but that's not what it's
about and we don't we don't address that
and I just think it's incredible that
people like myself or like us were up
there talking about these issues you say
well how we going to take care us and
our time ninety percent of our time is
spent on trying to convince somebody to
give us money to do what we do ninety
percent of times that's what we spent
and we don't get paid well even when
when they say okay there should be some
money for it but no one's getting fat on
it you know me
hopefully in some chains come but I
don't know their their focus and other
things again I think before they they
focus on what happens to the people you
know one one thing distant quickly one
of our partners and hopefully is will go
to trust community org that's our
website trust community org and you can
keep in contact with us and send us
ideas and and also we'll get these these
questionnaires but one of our partners
policy link who dr. Mendez also works
with is interested in is working with
Obama's White House to create a reentry
core but the reality is is that will be
done by people like us and people like
you if anything policy will allow access
and or opportunity for something that
come up but it's as far as funding
coming behind that it's doubtful in the
short term but that's why there's a
movement being created so sorry you had
a question seems like there's ten
billion dollars going to president's you
have awarded the same unique
rehabilitation programs or it seemed
like that that's what you say so I'm
just not familiar with how public
policies with respect to prisons is made
and implemented but who's making the
decision that we need to hire more
guards instead of hiring people to teach
these guys who who makes that decision
we do you and I I mean is that a part of
the foot the bills that are past or
funny yes yeah so I mean if if we all
came together and wrote all our
legislators if we really paid attention
to the bills that were being passed that
we're keeping people you know
incarcerated longer and we've longer
sentencing we have a lot of things that
if we're gonna keep them in there longer
yeah let's get them some something
that's going to help them come back
holar ready to be successful in society
so oh look yeah Marsy's law boy I mean
let me let me say something there to how
decisions get made by politicians how do
they make them by being paid so they're
being paid to do certain things right
now
the most powerful lobby and this is not
anti correction officers there is slick
Union they figured out how to get what
they want to get the most powerful
lobbying group in this state is a
correctional officers Union do they
insist that you pay a certain laws or
they pay Republicans and it paid
Democrats and you say you vote our way
and that's what happens that's really
what happens so we a lot of times with
our social issues we try to address
social issues and moral issues on moral
basis you can't take moral issues to
immoral people and expect them to say oh
now understand they're not going to do
that so I think we need to organize our
money and buy politicians to be honest
we have often said that we really should
get some of those Union folks from the
correctional officers into our teachers
unions and you know they can start
distributing them out they know how to
do it they they're very effective they
know how to do it um so something when
tomorrow said that we make this decision
it's very true on the ballot justice
last year Marsy's law was passed and
that was passed as a victims rights
initiative but it all I did was repeat
what was already in the legislature and
in the law for victims rights didn't
actually give victims any more rights
but what it did do was extend parole or
extended the time period between when
somebody is failed to be found suitable
for parole and when they can return to
the board again so as but before the
parole board used to say okay you know
you're really not that much of a threat
we got a little work to do i'll give you
a year you can come back in a year now
the minimum is three years and it can go
as high as 15 years between the options
to even see the parole board to play
your case so there's a lot of a lot of
stuff that happens we're even in
California which has a relatively
liberal legislature where things are
brought to the pit to the voting public
and time and time again the voting
public is the group that passes this
legislature and that puts harsher terms
we saw going from the 70s into today a
change
used to be sentencing that was non
determinate it used to be the inmates
had would get a 3 to 10 or 5 to 15
sentence on a crime and depending on
their behavior inside they would get
released earlier or later and so there
was an incentivized system to improve
behavior that's no longer the case
people are given hard terms now where if
you get a 10-year sentence you're doing
10 years maybe you get 85 or 16 months
or maybe you get eighty five percent
time when you do something to work down
but you're going to get released at the
end of that term and so that's a shift
that's also d incentivized personal
change and there's a lot of stuff like
that that we as a voting public have
enacted I wanted to see if there's any
um any questions or comments or feedback
on the story yes say they heard their
community now they want to go back and
rebuild earlier and I want to know what
I was unexpected as I thought they just
want to get out but I also want to know
well how would wouldn't wouldn't he done
so you doing talk about Kenyatta okay so
the question was what was unexpected was
hearing the men talk about wanting to
get involved in rebuilding your
community it's saying outright that they
hurt their community and they wanted to
rebuild it and then what we've seen has
that happened and how would they do it
it's a question Germans are backing out
it yeah but before I talk about Kenyatta
understand something the average guy in
the penitentiary is not there think
these guys were showing you these guys
have been through a process that's
that's why they're in a trust we go
through a process with them so if they
begin to understand why they need to be
responsible for themselves and we go
through that which is which will take
them it takes me a year to go through it
I've been with those guys five years now
and so they that will work with
others and in our expectations of such
that they can do things all right but
what are the things they do on it that
they do on the outside without being on
the outside is richmond california has a
whole bunch of people shoot each other
so I come back into the penitentiary and
I'll say to them you have to stop the
people from shooting each other in
Richmond we do yeah you know who they
are they come in and out to spend
attention you know you know everything
about it we don't know anything about it
and clearly just saying to people in the
street you need to stop shooting each
other it doesn't work so we want to know
from you so you shoot people how do you
stop it and know what they ended up
doing and say well we need them to come
in and start working with us inside so
they're a group of people who came in
from the city of Richmond and start
meeting and they've been doing it for
the last 23 years they've been coming in
side and sitting down and talking to our
guys about different strategies in a
community they've also organized the men
who are going back to Richmond to work
on them about they need to pay back the
community so we can do that from inside
so the police chief comes in the mayor
has been in everybody's been in from
Richmond has been in to talk with our
guys and see what they can do now we're
trying to set the same thing up with
Oakland and with San Francisco but the
whole idea is to try to figure out what
can they do and although it may be
difficult for them to do things what I
always tell them is it may be difficult
but you still have to do it it was
difficult to do some of the stuff that
you did before you came in here but you
figured it out you know they may tell us
well I need time to I need room to plan
I need space we need this rule changes
wait wait wait wait did you have to go
to anybody to get that squared away when
you're in the street to space the time
and you didn't do that you just went and
did it like you knew how to do so you do
the same thing in here because there's a
rule for example that you can only five
guys can be together at a time so we
have 25 guys so they said well we need a
me
and we don't have space yes you do you
have any yard split up into five groups
of five and then the five have a
representative to come into the middle
and the reports back to the milk then
you go back to the group now you do that
in the street I know anyway but i had to
tell you that of a sudden right okay but
you just have to figure out how do you
deal with this system that you're in
because otherwise they come up with all
the excuses why they they can't do it
and I say no no no and we refuse to let
them be victims you can't be a victim
you victimize people but I'm not gonna
let you be a victim but I just don't let
you be out there without support will
try to support your honor but you can't
be a victim so that's kind of how we we
work with and that guy the reason we're
arguing for the trust is that the guy
you see here is who we think should be
coming home to and so we want we want to
expand what we do so these guys can
affect more people inside who come home
and we let this is bad to say kind of
but we don't want more to come home our
group because that's the infrastructure
in the penitentiary for us to build
around of course I don't tell them guys
that but we really need them staying
there Oh can ya yet Kenyatta yeah we
could bring him down here one time with
us for this okay yeah Kenyatta he did
225 you saw his picture up they did 25
and now he's out now works with us he
works at urban strategies up in Oakland
and with the trust and if you he's
amazing to me he's amazing because you
say well 25 years I know you got to be a
little mad because actually not arguing
people don't have to go to jail they do
have to go to jail however in his case
he was charged with second-degree murder
and it was because they robbed the guy
and left and I got had a heart attack
after and so he was charged with with
murder and then it should have been
homicide I mine up manslaughter they
should have been but it wasn't and his
father talked to him and ask
did he do it and he said yes he did he
said then you have to pay the price not
known it was going to be a life sentence
because they told him it would be a
manslaughter but when he got we went
before the judge nor somehow it got
turned around and he had to do 25 years
but he did the 25 he said because his
father said he's supposed to do that
supposed to give him that time it's
he-man now he doesn't he talk about
being angry that sometimes I'm mad about
stuff and he's cooling me out and I was
saying well you should be mad no no that
doesn't do any good here's why we have
to do this and I say I said well man I
understand that you supposed to be mad
they get into program by these guys
select the guys to come in no because I
used to think that the way to do would
be that I would select them so they
would correct me and say this is when we
started it back in back in New York you
guys say look it we would this guy 24 47
you see him for a couple hours on this
day and you say he's a great guy we know
he's not so let us select let us pick
the guys and let us work with who we
should be working with I said that's
cool but I said on the other side you
can't put anybody out they saluted mean
you can't put them out I said you spent
your whole life being kicked out of
things and when you get in a position to
keep people in you're not gonna kick
them out and I say you can't kick them
out they get mad at me for saying it but
I say you can't kick them out once
they're with us there with us and we
just got to figure out how we're going
to work with a guy that's all but it's
got to be with us so any other questions
yeah so last time I was here a number of
people asked what you know what can I do
directly and you know we've we've talked
about some things that you can do but I
wanted to and go bass this sorry
get involved so the National Trust keep
the chest calm here's dr. Mendez
information you can email some things
that you can do with the trust i would
highly recommend it at least check it
out find out what what's going on with
it we talked about the transitional
housing these are a couple things that
are in in the Alameda County area
healthy Oakland's a clinic that serves
men and women coming back from
incarceration in ended gym populations
and then down here in this area we've
car a grief support a number of the men
we talked to talk about having
unresolved trauma leading to how they
found that path there's a number of
things and then college track it is an
East Palo Alto another opportunity to be
a sponsor mentor lead a program and it's
just down the street and of course the
trust you can help us make this film you
saw some raw footage we have 60 hours
that we just we just gotten this past
two enough weeks in another 30 hours
that we need to to go through and the
good news is that we just received this
challenge grant from the East Bay
Community Foundation which means that
any funding that we received from
individuals will be matched up to ten
thousand dollars and there are many
things that that could cover we have
been gifted in office a production
office through the end of April but then
it's going away and we found out that we
could get in office through the same
organization for twenty four hundred
dollars a year so I'm really pretty
amazing opportunity but then just a
production costs and all that you saw
goes into taking some really raw footage
to a film and hopefully being part of
this movement so another thing that I
wanted to ask is that if anybody has any
ideas about how we can utilize
technology web web two point oh
in order to spread this word spread the
word about this movement about the
National Trust program and the
foundation that it's it's setting in in
the prisons and a number of prisons
across the country with these men and as
well as the film helping people talk
about this creating this national
dialogue and any other ways that you can
think of to get involved so again trust
community org and please any information
that you include on the questionnaire
would be really helpful so diff one more
question yet was I know that you could
do you are a communication people we
want to set up a communication network
across this country where local people
doing things like this or other stuff
building community building can
communicate with each other I had to
have no idea how to do that but I just
think it's a cool idea and I'm gonna try
to get some people to join me and say
hit Mendes here's what you need to do I
can get to people but the system the
technology I had no idea how to do that
but that's what I want to do and I'm
tying into this excuse me when they had
the Million Man March they had a whole
bunch of brothers came to Washington DC
and everybody said are going to go do
something everybody was all excited they
went away and at the time I said you
know we need a system so that we
communicate with each other and share
information who's doing what that never
got built and the thing went away
whereas really there were people doing
things in different communities around
the country so I'm suggesting that you
don't make that same mistake as we put
together this campaign we're talking
about to mobilize our people so we start
getting them reporting in what they're
doing sharing ideas these people are
doing this they're doing this in in in
channels 8 or doing this in Los Angeles
and so we get people sharing ideas I
think that's how you build a movement
but I need help on putting that whole
thing together
yeah so any last comments from anyone
that is really huge inek actually Tony
yeah
right so actually and one one last
question about distribution we're
looking at opportunities for
distribution we've been talking with
HBO's interested we've been talking with
folks at PBS itvs and that's another
thing that you could let us know like
what do you think this should be and we
were definitely utilizing YouTube to
show trailers rough cuts etc but where
do you think this would be the what do
you think the best avenue would be to
present this shorts on YouTube personal
portraits on YouTube that's that's
that's a good point and that could help
lead up and get some leverage for the
film that's off you don't have that kind
of money no no that's a good idea i
think that what that'll be something we
were talking about doing case studies
because we're gonna have so much footage
and we are going to make a full-length
feature film but that is something that
we've been talking about doing case
studies because there's there's so many
different sides to this story and it
really is told through the people so i
think that's a great idea
well exited
well yes no there's no access to
internet of any kind we actually Jesse's
one of the lead instructors in the San
Quentin media project so we are training
men m in filmmaking and media
development and they've been they
started that with warden airs in order
to create public safety based shorts so
kind of like you know what you're
talking about but having a really
positive messages coming from really
hardened men you know so that there is
not a network per se but San Quentin is
a very special place because it has
fifty two hundred inmates and three
thousand volunteers and that's how
programs like that come about you did
you mean a network on the outside of
people who had been locked up to be able
to reach out to other prisoners and
share stories successes and edit
recounted outside actually the other
thing I would like to say with that is
that Paul chimeric came out up and
taught a technology class with the the
man of the trust and more of those would
be wonderful because folks like Kenyatta
although he just did it Kenyatta came
out after 25 years and knew that he had
to learn how to use a computer if he was
going to get a job and he spent four
months learning how to use a computer
and now he's a research assistant in a
policy it's about 30-40 guy and a few
guys from the
for trust and I realized camping
projector I have to get permission to
bring the papers and have some of its
brown part all those things and it
didn't realize that they just don't get
to see technology unless it's in a
commercial they all know about black
rates that commercial with the guys in
there some of them have been in there
for one here some of them have been in
there for 20 years and when you flirt
them tell about Peters the guy's been
under for 20 years and where are we 20
years ago if I google just totally
didn't exist and some of them on the
other hand were running mainframes and
then went to jail for something or
another right so this guy's tell me
about old IBM 360 and I'm tell about my
SEO or maybe I'm talking about you know
monitors come out on paper it and you
realize how much of a difference you can
make by by giving them a heads up about
how things change what the resources are
what they can expect out there and ways
that they can leverage things like
libraries that are you doing this before
you can make a big difference by
bringing some of that information in or
take like tomorrow brings
because as against country
yeah the the only the only in there's an
intranet between the CDC our prisons but
that's not accessible by the prisoners
so I mean that so there is that and it
would be something that as as Googlers
and web activists a technology activists
you could probably help them develop in
a way because there are a number of
things like for example that programs
that happen in San Quentin that do not
happen in prisons like tehachapi in
wasco and you know the numerous prisons
that are in the middle of a desert or on
a mountain pass or some place that
there's not a population ready to serve
in nineteen ninety two or three went
into a prison in New York Green Haven
prison and we were arguing everybody
needs to be computer literate and needs
to be on the internet that was back in
the day right so we were taking those
360 so went to the penitentiary said if
we brought computers in here could we
teach computer literacy they said yeah
okay no internet anything like that no
we're not talking about just basic
computer literacy so they said who would
teach I said we'll find guys in this
penitentiary who can teach it themselves
will farm guys new can do all repair
work software they can do the whole
thing they said we couldn't do it we
found them in that penitentiary we gave
them space I said they say okay what
should we do this and set up a lab and
teach everybody in here well the state
should be doing no we're not talking
about with the state needs to do we're
talking about what we're going to do
ourselves I'll bring you the computers
we went in found computers brought them
in set and they and didn't set them up
friends and say here they are finding
guys in this penitentiary can make sure
all of them work connect them up and all
they did that they ran it and then put
advertising put up things say come and
learn how to use the computers they had
them around the building coming in guys
coming in so I said well the state said
well we've had computer classes but no
one came to him and there were those
guys are telling state doesn't know what
they're doing
so I said okay we know we're doing yeah
and said well we need can we get
certificates for doing this we said yeah
you can they said well who the states or
give you certificates oh no no no I'll
give out the certificates they said well
how you gonna get them out a suit what
do you think God said state hand out
these certificates Danny how it works it
had people who are in charge hand out
certificates I'll hand you a certificate
you know what happened on it the state
started signing my certificate thing
they were giving out but you know what
happened on that whole thing it got shut
down it got shut down after two years
because they said that the Union the
teachers union in a penitentiary came
after us and said these guys are
teaching computer literacy that's our
job to teach it so therefore they need
to stop we went to the union said well
let's share it then you won't have to do
any work you can just have somebody
sitting and get paid and we'll still do
it they said no we want you guys out
they put us out and know it they didn't
have people to teach the classes they
didn't have them they shut the whole
darn thing down they wouldn't let us
open up and then they came up with some
of the stuff that they were worried
about the internet and I said how we
gonna get on the internet they say these
guys are so smart they'll figure way
they'll get on the internet they'll go
to Albany in New York let themselves out
of the penitentiary that's how crazy
this stuff is I said let them out yeah
they'll get access to the records their
own records they'll change their records
and let themselves out I said a minute
ago these guys were dumb guys they
couldn't get out of our grade school and
now you're telling me they don't even
need a modem that was before the
wireless piece was around and they can
go get their records in Albany but they
shut the whole thing down the teachers
union shut the thing down you can
probably see there's a theme here it
really comes back to like having a bit
of a paradigm shift you know we need to
think about how we approach these these
issues because we keep coming up to the
same sort of blockades but I think this
is a time for opportunity so yeah
I work in Dublin women's prison as well
as a federal prison I have not been
working in state prisons for women and I
do know that it's actually it's a good
point that you're bringing up keep
pushing doc here to get the program into
women's prisons because it's actually
they're the smallest percentage about
three percent of our of our incarcerated
folks but they're actually the highest
growing number so it's something that we
really need to focus on at any time I
actually it's funny one of our meet
folks doing programs in San Quentin I'm
always pushing them over to Dublin hey
check it out I'll introduce you to the
chaplain let's get some programs in
there so they do have they do have some
programs and there's some wonderful
theater and media programs that are
happening but again generally they're in
places like this where it's highly
populated and it's all being done by
volunteers so not much we could use a
lot more not much yeah yeah anybody one
time to hook up to the prison work in
California and possibly I guess doc here
can help you out across the country if
you wanted if you have some time you
want to bring a group together or just
come yourself yeah so thank you so much
for your time today and you know we
would love for you to invite us back in
a few months and we'll show you some
more footage perhaps some some more case
study pieces some personal vignettes and
also the footage that we have we'll have
our first act so be a bit of an
exclusive look so thanks again
