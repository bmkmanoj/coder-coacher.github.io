wadell and i'm here with Charles nutter
today he's been working on a new
language called mera which I've been
working with and Ryan Braun from
Google's also been doing some work with
it and we're real excited to see where
it's at today take it away Charles ok
well hi this is my first text hockey
google it's fun to be here we'll jump
right in I write Java code all day long
to write to work on JRuby I right Ruby
for libraries and for little side
applications on occasion but largely I
right job all the time I do little JVM
utilities usually around usually
surrounding JRuby or for JRuby I do lots
of byte code generation it's amazing
when you're able to write like 50 lines
of by cogeneration and it just runs the
first time that's kind of a scary moment
I've got little I've got interested in
doing mobile and embedded applications
I've done some really small like sub ME
embedded java stuff we're like I had to
write my own streams and stuff fun but
you know I've got a very fairly narrow
scope and within this narrow scope ruby
has a little bit of trouble fitting so
my problem is that I really do like Ruby
I like the syntax I like the feel of the
language but I right job all day long
for JRuby is there a way that i could
start using more Ruby I mean we can get
Ruby to run really well but it's going
to be hard for it ever to replace on a
performance level on a footprint level
what we actually do with Java so the
idea for mirek started like this what if
instead of writing this java class with
all that extra noise that comes along
with it what if instead of writing this
I could actually just write this and
lose nothing at all this is the Ruby
class version of this okay and that is
essentially what we're doing with mirror
so in mira we're pulling features from
various languages are pulling syntax
from Ruby the bits and pieces that we
like we're doing local type inference
like Scala and actually some field and
friends here and
goal of this let's take a look Mira is
kind of at the moment like a nicer way
to write Java its Ruby syntax with a few
modifications like type annotations for
four parameters coming in but it ends up
feeling a lot like Ruby and compiles
directly down to Java or two JVM
bytecode and you can produce Java source
with it as well that's one thing we've
been doing is keeping feature lockstep
so you can generate both Java bytecode
and Java source for the equivalent thing
but the key the key feature here and I
think this is one that has escaped
almost all other JVM language
implementers is that we we're really
working hard to introduce no runtime
library at all the code you write
compiles to class files and that's it
done with it which makes deployment on
small devices deployment on mobile
devices obviously much much easier so
let's let's dig in a little bit on this
so features from Ruby that we do have
working optional arguments I'll control
example what that looks like a basic
internal iteration closures are
functional now most of the literal types
from Ruby string interpolation it's nice
to have we have plans for things like
mix-ins and open classes those will be
coming along there's other features that
we want to pull from you know your
favorite language of the week for
example extension methods something
doing it something like c-sharp does but
making it look like you're actually
opening classes in Ruby right implicit
type conversions possibly from Scala
which opens up a lot of dynamic dsl sort
of stuff without actually changing any
of the static typing behind the scenes
pattern matching in case classes means
all sorts of stuff that we could do and
I think we can do almost all of these
with just a compiler and not introducing
any new libraries that's that's the goal
that's the goal right now so let's do
what this looks like in practice here's
you know a simple the hello world from
Ruby and the hello world from mirror
identical code except that this ruby
version is going to require you to
immediately ship a five or 10 megabyte
JRuby jar fly along with the application
hello world has now encumbered you
with that library in this case there's
no and no other dependencies so this is
the basic code that we end up generating
the bytecode we generate for the Ruby
stuff and in here you probably can see
that there's the call site logic there's
some preamble logic and this isn't even
the whole story the call site logic is
going to pick up the puts method from
somewhere that's going to construct the
string from somewhere else and then it's
going to do that call dynamically if you
do this with Mira we're essentially just
turning it into system out print line
same code but compile straight down to
regular bytecode and does does what you
really want it to do under the covers
and then the Java code that we generate
so we have Mira just spitting out
regular Java code that does basically
what you would write if you're going to
write it in Java another example we go
back to fib there's the Ruby code
there's the only change required for
Mira now we've course you can't there's
no way you can read this there's about
six different call sites in there it's
constructing all the fixed num ops doing
all of the the dynamic calls in there
will be able to improve this with some
of the dynamic optimization stuff and
Jerry but it's still a lot of noise and
a lot of overhead the bytecode for
mirror essentially it's almost identical
to what you would have if you wrote the
code in Java and wrote compiled up with
java sea and then the Java code of
course which is not the most beautiful
thing yet but we can always pretty print
that or something optional arguments now
of course in this case we probably could
infer that both of these are ants and
just go with that at the moment the way
that the optional argument syntax works
we do have the type on there as well and
here's just the Java code for that
chaining the methods just the same way
that you would if you wanted to create a
series of overloads with optional
arguments the Ruby code for a simple
internal iteration your code is
essentially identical and there's the
Java code it generates and you'll see
we're doing the same thing as Java 7 at
this point creating an unmodifiable list
of those values and then doing like a
java 5 for loop pulling the iterator out
and doing
the iteration for you but looks and
feels like you're actually doing a
regular Ruby iteration so things like
each and map and select and whatnot
they're all available just by using the
existing patterns of what works on the
JVM without extra libraries a simple
closure so here I'm actually creating a
new thread with the closure and the
logic there is just to do it print out
some texts again same thing in mira and
here's the java code we generate for it
so digging into this a little bit we're
creating a little binding class it's
going to hold the mutable closed over
state and then creating a little
runnable class both this little internal
both as little inner classes all behind
the scenes so closures in this case end
up just being sugar over doing anonymous
inner classes anywhere you've got a
single method interface you can just
have a closure a block of code and it
furs the types of the arguments and furs
all that stuff looks like Ruby and feels
like Ruby but it's actually just doing
the all the noise of an inner class that
you would normally have to do okay so
now it's important to point out that
this isn't Ruby this is just using javas
library it's basically java's type
system you don't have things like eval
and mutable classes we can make it seem
like you're opening classes up but it's
it's not Ruby it's a lot of the things I
really liked about Ruby the apparent
features of the language on top of Java
so I can use those features and nobody
really even needs to know I'm running
Ruby and actually you know you could
have like a commit hook that generates
the Java code if you really want but
that's the thing it feels like Ruby all
of these features that people will talk
about that they like so much about Ruby
in ninety percent of the cases their
surface level features their skin deep
just syntactic sugar syntactic niceness
and you hear a lot about the new
languages that say well our syntax is
just as nice as Ruby and it's just
seemed logical to me why don't we start
with the Ruby syntax and mate and see
how far we can go to compile it down to
the fastest possible bytecode no runtime
library we'll see how far we can take it
alright so now a little more fun with
Mira just to show a little bit more
interesting code for this there's a
application for Android called Garrett
written by Phil hey Gilbert it's kind of
a playing around with Mira so let's open
that code up and see what looks like all
right so I've got all this application
noise around it and one file here let's
make this little bigger all right so
we'll walk through just a little bit now
you notice it obviously it looks a lot
like Ruby right because it's just using
Ruby syntax and Ruby's part Ruby parser
I've got a few imports and from here on
down the only things that are really
going to be different from if you were
to write this actually in Ruby code are
anywhere we have to clarify or narrow it
or cast the type so here we're declaring
the variable a is a context here we're
making sure that these are stored as
floats in what essentially gets inferred
as fields on this class x and y and
radius and the rest of this is all
pretty much just Ruby we've got the
bounce logic I starting to get curious
about what this does aren't you move
we've got touch events we're doing stuff
with release what is that to historical
X now so okay we're tracking some stuff
tracking some some deltas and then draw
drawing circles drawing some text on it
let's actually see what this application
looks like
now it's actually interesting to note
this again this is all the code you can
pile this and you get a couple class
files out of it no additional no
additional dependencies no external
dependencies other than all the android
stuff you're using right and it looks
nice if you like Ruby syntax this is
this is pretty pretty clean pretty clean
stuff all right let's go find this app
Garrett have no idea where you got that
icon from okay ah there we go so let's
let's play our little game actually this
used to be just a bouncing ball but I
thought I'd turn it into an interesting
game so we're gonna grab this ball and
just throw it as hard as we can okay
that goes what's my score still going 31
32 don't think it's going to make it 33
it looks like I think this version I've
still got a limited to velocity of 50
max but oh it did make it sweet 34 okay
so let's go back to the code in the app
like this is again this is all ruby but
when you compile it down let's see how
big these applications are you're going
to make an application like this with
JRuby for example and ship it you'd need
to strip a bunch of stuff out the jruby
jar is anywhere from five to eight mag
depending on how is compressed the decks
process can strip it down a bit more but
you're still you have to ship a pretty
big application i think that rubato IRB
app clocks in at about 10 meg and it's
in the marketplace you can install it if
you like but it's a big app it's a lot
of stuff to ship this so I've got debug
builds here 16k you know and it's
essentially the same code you would
write if you're going to write this in
Ruby but compiling it straight down we
don't have to worry about all the extra
dependencies on a ruby runtime hey woody
where would I go let's see let's take a
look at dubious that would be good and
that's on the mirror account right
let's take a look at this one I'll just
look at the code here so on the web side
dubious is a little framework that's
written pretty much all in mira but
doesn't have the dependencies on a
runtime library other than a few little
things that it ships with doesn't have a
language runtime that it requires and it
runs really fast because it compiles
everything to Java code so let's make
this bigger so you can see all right so
here we go again like we did with Mira
we like Ruby syntax we like the way it
feels let's start from there woody
decided he likes the way at rails
applications are laid out the way
they're structured let's start with that
and see if we can actually do the entire
application in mirror instead of doing
rails let's take a look at a controller
here contacts is the good one here
contacts controller you have the
generated Java code in there too right
alright so what was it dubious demo spot
all right here we go he even sort of
copied the rails front page isn't that
adorable okay so here's our appt
structure and now in here we can take a
look at our contacts controller even got
syntax highlighting and largely again it
looks like Ruby looks like you're
writing a rails application index show
new etc we've got some of these things
what are these curious things down at
the bottom looks like they're pulling
out some templates of some kind right
now what do those do let's go back and
take a look and I could say this all can
compile straight down to Java source if
you like you can go to JVM bytecode but
you can also compile at the Java source
if you take contacts controller and turn
it into Java source this is what you get
out so we've got our index a logic it's
actually pulling out a data model here
if we go down and see the different er
bees that were pulled in the different
templates it's done all of the inclusion
of that into this controller done all
the extra logic of turning it into
string of pens stringbuffer a pen
stringbuilder appends and this is
essentially all you really need out of
this application but this is this is the
only dependencies you have other than
the google app engine stuff that is
running with you taking what looks
exactly like a rails app and feels
almost as nice as building a rails app
and compile it straight down to java
source or JVM bytecode that's the goal
with mirror
alright it's a little bit about the code
base and how it works wheezing JRuby
sparser right now probably going to be
reworking that so we have a little bit
more flexibility to add minor to syntax
changes like I say there's a JVM
bytecode and a java source back end
there's also been prototype
proof-of-concept work to do a c-sharp
source code back end again since it
doesn't have any specific dependency on
the platformer on the type system you
could use these same syntax with
different libraries slightly different
inference engine and output code for
other platforms that's another goal that
may come along on the future essentially
does ast transformation takes the Ruby
Ruby ast turns it into our parser
neutral do ba st in the middle or mirror
mirror AST in the middle runs type
inference over that depending on what
the platform is that we're running on
and then generates the code and at this
point for everything that you've seen
here we've got a mirror code base with
the JVM bytecode and java source
backends that's essentially 10,000 lines
of Ruby code type inference is all
written in Ruby the the but the code
that drives the code generation will not
the ascent at the ASM library itself but
the code that drives that generation is
written in Ruby the ast is Ruby so
here's the basic sequence Ruby with type
annotations and our modified parser
comes out and we get a ruby AST with
type nodes that goes through our
transformer to the doobie AST and we
have various plugins along the way in
macros that can do sort of compile-time
transform time modifications to the code
we run it through the type and ferns
logic which again can have
platform-specific plugins or you know
crazy wild type is type systems if you
like we got our typed ast out of that
and then we generate whatever the native
code is for the back end since we have
all the type information we have the
whole structure we can generate just
straight-up statically typed JVM
bytecode or Java source so it's small
but there's a lot that you can do with
this and being small means it's very
easy to add new features the optional
argument stuff i showed you i think was
50 lines of ruby code to add
it takes almost nothing to add
additional features to the language how
much how much code did adding literal
hashes costs do you think not much I
mean I think I added literal arrays that
do the unmodifiable ArrayList in like 30
lines of Ruby code so you can you can
kind of it you can kind of build the
language the way you want build the
language around your application or
around the libraries you're running with
so places with us being used today the
Java bits and pieces in the JRuby App
Engine tooling was actually written in
mirror i showed you dubious there's a
contributor on the list that's actually
adding the bits and pieces necessary to
do GWT applications reading writing in
in Mira instead I think the main thing
was just getting the little inline
JavaScript native things to work of
course I showed some early Android
experiments and it's a young code base
but there's a lot of lot of fun stuff
you can do with it and there's a lot of
hacking going on right now all right so
it showed you the ABS okay so futures
for this the code base is kind of grown
organically it's still only ten thousand
lines of code but we want to clean it up
a little bit and isolate the different
tiers better mentioned the parser one
actually formalize and expand the type
system and actually learn how to make a
type system they get the remaining
features from Java like Java one we're
at like Java 1 l level there's a few
little things that are above that but
figuring out whether whether or not
we're going to do generics enums of the
job of five features and you know
additional backends and maybe even front
ends since we have that standard AST in
the middle there's no reason we couldn't
transform other syntaxes I like the Ruby
syntax you know some people are married
to curly braces and they really need
curly brace syntax but there's a lots of
possibilities for this just building up
a nice tool chain that can generate all
this stuff for you all right so then the
last the final plugs that I'll do and
we'll have some questions we do have a
using jruby book that's in beta and now
so if you want to get the basic overview
of a lot of different areas of JRuby you
can pick that up we had a JRuby
for the first time last year attached a
ruby cough that was pretty exciting this
year we have two conferences planned
already there's JRuby tigey attached to
Ruby kg in Japan next month and we have
JRuby comp 2010 edition which is
basically taking over the enterprise
ruby conference that takes place in
columbus and i think we may have another
one next spring another jvcom in
Minneapolis where I'm from that'll be
fun too okay so there's a few links and
that's about all I have I can open up
for questions on Ruby or JRuby or the
state of the Ruby world or anything well
i think we probably going to start so
the question was how are we going to do
the process of formalizing the type
system i think we'll probably start by
making sure we have everything in the
needed to represent at least java wanna
level type system figure out which of
the features that we're doing like like
some of the crazier stuff like macros
and implicit sand what not will fit into
that type system nicely and i guess kind
of just looking for suggestions on what
features people are interested in from
other languages especially type type
system oriented ones we don't want to go
completely off the cliff and make a
giant nightmarish type system that we
can't manage but we would we think we
can add almost all of the apparent
features from those different languages
just by minor changes to the type system
and compiler and we're looking for folks
that are interested in helping on that
stuff too yeah over here
now that's a good question the JVM
bytecode back end the question for
anybody else is what's the advantage of
having both a JVM bytecode and a java
source back end well initially since all
I do all day is generate JVM bytecode I
just worked on the JVM bytecode back end
Ryan came along Ryan Braun whose another
Google guy here and he was interested at
least initially I think possibly using
Mira to do GWT stuff so the java source
wasn't record as a requirement at this
point maybe there's not a whole lot of
reason to maintain the two backends but
it is nice to have something that's
going to do the full bytecode
compilation and generation for you
rather than spitting out Java source and
having a second cycle to do the Java Sea
compilation if you needed to do
something along the lines of having
circular dependencies or having external
Java dependencies that require the full
brow Bowl build process to run together
this is the Java source version is also
kind of a nice cheap for that I think
we've talked about only having one back
end but it really isn't a whole lot of
effort to maintain both of them and it
actually kind of keeps us honest about
where we do where we implement the
features of the language if we can
implement all of the features in such a
way that they're mostly macros and ast
transformations then having to backends
is easy if we ever start to slip into
one back end or the other we know that
we're tying ourselves a little bit too
much to one particular format and doing
a c-sharp back end or other backends
would be more difficult at that point so
it's kind of a kind of an interesting
exercise but may actually have some
benefits for the language itself other
questions
time is una do have some more time I
could if you guys want to see I could
dig into the App Engine app a little bit
and show you how it actually works you
guys like to see that okay and actually
if you don't mind just bring back that
browser you had yeah sure so this app is
entirely written in mira there is no
Ruby in it whatsoever the advantage to
doing this is that the app spins up in
about a second java app engine now
supports app yamel in order to configure
the app i just modify this app llamo
file so the app itself has this little
properties window that i can see what's
going on the controller that we were
looking at is actually this i'm
basically copying a a scaffold
generation I don't need to fill this
whole thing out you can generate an app
that looks just like your scaffold and
in this case I've decided to use
unobtrusive JavaScript and so that's how
that works now Charlie showed the app
earlier how we had a controller the
views associated with that are here I
have an edit form and in this case I
basically looked at what would the rails
scaffold generated file look like and
just try it just start with whatever
rails is using and then make changes in
order to make it work if i go back to
the framework file itself I have this
prams object down at the bottom here i
have this delete method sometimes you
want to pass in an ID because you don't
have it in the URL i can generate this
java style overloaded method chain we
wanted to create something that looked a
little bit like data mapper so my model
really is just this I have a property
keyword I'd specify the names of the
attributes and I specify which types
there and you'll see here I'm using App
Engine types like postal address and
phone number I also need to have those
things imported so that's was to import
statements do now
when I compile that Ryan Browns done
some great work to create everything I
need to access so instead of going
through datanucleus he's just creating
the methods I need based on the
attributes that I defined the properties
are defined so if you scroll down here
and notice he's got some methods where
he's he's handling how to get a hashmap
of properties or possibly set the
properties and he's generated all of
this code for me so now I don't worry
about type safety I just do something
that feels like I would do with data
mapper or active record I suppose and
it's it's handled all right well thank
you very much every thank you charles
