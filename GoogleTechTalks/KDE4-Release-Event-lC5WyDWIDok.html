community the KD edgy group this is
actually a picture from our last meeting
in December in Paris we a bunch of us
got together and talked about some
things that we needed to finalize before
the 40 release and where we were headed
with the 4.1 release coming up the we
call ourselves the e team kind of a joke
that came up on IRC one time but they're
there more than twenty two of us from 10
countries and that is not including the
google Summer of Code students that
contributed quite a bit this last summer
there was three google Summer of Code
projects for marble alone and we already
saw marble today earlier but I want to
show you something that's interesting in
it and Murray threw together a KML file
which is just an XML file of locations
for all the locations of the edgy
developers so here we have all of them
in the east and here we have the few of
us over on the west end of the globe and
is really simple to throw together and
we want to thank the marble developers
for adding that ability the KML is a
pretty standard format right that right
right right google earth to find the
format so Marvel developers made us we
can import those into marble a little
bit of brief history about KD a Jew in
1999 first ka jukka is a program for
teachers that was started based on KD 2
and then in nineteen ninety two thousand
k stars k touch and que voc trained
joined the kind of group even though we
weren't really a group at that time and
those four applications were some of the
most popular que te puke applications at
the time then in 2001 the KD edgy
project was created based on those for
applique
I think Anne Murray was one of the
original people that created the group
and then in 2002 the KT edgy module was
officially released with catie three
point 0 release and now we've got at
least 15 applications and more in
playground that are working on and a
couple more in just some ideas that
people would like to do when they have
the time some statistics about us there
are some distributions that are actually
education based right there's edge
Ubuntu there's a skull Linux I think
someone's here from skull Linux is that
right and anyway and and Debian edge you
and the educational software has to be
able to run on small devices because for
example the OLPC and the classmate
they're distributed quite a bit to
schools and used for education right and
also the epc can run all the education
applications and there are also some
rather large deployments of KDA jus
software about everyone that has heard
of Katie knows k stars as we found out
earlier today because that was the big
demo app but there are eight thousand
computers in the canary islands that
have katie edge you on it actually it's
this Medusa distribution and then by the
middle of 2009 around 1100 schools will
have Medusa installed in the Canary
Islands for their students to learn with
and more and more countries are
following in their lead Russia just
recently came out and said that by the
middle of 2009 they are going to have
all their school systems using our
clinics and our clinics is a KDE based
distribution very popular over there
apparently alt Linux oh okay alt Linux
Thank You Troy it's a community effort
here
KD education is pretty important to the
KT supergroup because for one we attract
new developers we have a lot of our
software is pretty easy to read and
understand and help fix bugs in some of
it not so much but a lot of that a lot
of it is so and and because we're such a
small community we are pretty friendly
when new developers come around so a lot
of people in that work on Katie and
Katie lives and some such have started
by working on Katie education apps and
then moving up to work on the libraries
or work on conquer or other things they
also attract lots of new users through
the school systems because we're one of
the only open source groups providing
educational software there's a lot of
new users that come to KDE or at least
come to Linux because of this and now
with Katie 40 4.1 release when when we
ship on Windows and on Mac that will
just explode that much more because if
schools are required to use windows or
required to use Mac or already have Mac
then they can just run Katie edge wats
directly on it so I think we're going to
see a big boom of users when this
happens and we also have something to
show quickly a couple years ago I guess
when the Katie for libraries were just
starting a lot of the katie edge you
apps and KD games apps could be ported
to the libraries and used to test the
libraries quickly and they also give
those libraries a good workout Katie
education has at least see I think last
night I counted six or seven
applications that use k hot new stuff
and recently before the four-point-oh
release there were quite a few bugs in
it it had some issues with networking
and it actually exposed some bugs in ki
o so as we were testing our application
in finding these issues we would tell
the developers of ko and they were able
to fix those things before the release
because they were exposed kde4 has a
some new technologies that we're using
or trying for more accessibility so we
use Q SVG renderer to make all of our
applications scalable for example in
katy 3.5 k anagram k hangman k letters
they're all static sighs window now
we're using SVG graphics so that you can
maximize the window zoom in on it and
it's all still clear we're also using
phone on quite heavily sound is pretty
important to educational applications
you know if it just blinks the kids
aren't going to like it as much as if it
blinks and talks to them you know so so
we use phone on quite a bit actually in
katy add you k letters loses it
exclusively almost to say the letters
for the children to hear and then try to
find it on the keyboard and also k hot
new stuff too as i said there are at
least six applications that use it
already and i think katie games will
follow with using it more but it's it's
very easy to put into katy edge you and
katie games apps because they all have a
specific data format that they need to
share back and forth like vocabulary
files for language apps and map data for
marble for example and on the subject of
data educational software is basically
useless without data if you have some
software that is a wonderful flash card
program but you don't have any flash
cards for it it doesn't help you if you
have a geography program but it doesn't
have names of the places on it it's just
looking at colored shapes you know so
educational software needs data and
that's what we're k hot new stuff to
comes in
it provides download from within the
application you've probably seen it in
KDE three if you've ever downloaded a
new wallpaper from the dialog where you
can choose your wallpaper it downloads
wallpapers directly from Katie looked
org and puts them in a place where it
finds them in a list and you can choose
them very easily you don't have to go
open your browser and come back is there
and said this morning you know open the
browser put it on here go find it choose
it as your desktop it just is one click
to install and then it's there and can
your hot new stuff to is also going to
make it easy to share your data as well
so if you're a teacher of some English
to Spanish class in I don't know
California and you make this long
vocabulary file for parle you can just
upload that file if you choose to and
other teachers on any other part that of
the world that want to use it can see it
and download it and give it to their
children's as well and it also allows
easy collaboration there's a lot of
metadata that's associated with a hot
new stuff for example the author and the
version you can receive updates from it
and you can also translate the name or
the title of the of the document or the
wallpaper or whatever kind of data it is
directly from within the dialog itself
which is very useful because if you see
a some kind of a math data that someone
in English makes and gives it an English
name call it the circumference of a
circle or something for geometry teacher
say a russian teacher who wants to use
that probably wants to translate it into
Russian so that their students don't
have to see understand all these math
names from the other language right have
it in their local language we have some
cool applications it new in four point
oh well some of them were released with
35
k algebra is an algebra application
obviously it does plotting it does quite
a bit of algebra and it also has a
glossary I'll show you a screenshot of
it in a minute step is a physics
simulation that was created by some very
talented physics students in Russia and
it actually started as a summer of code
project i believe and then parlay is
actually que voc trained with a new name
and a new interface it's been redone
quite a bit and actually in 41 it's even
going to have docs and all these fancy
things to make it easier to use marble
we saw quite a bit today probably it's
the world atlas from torsten and Inga
and three google Summer of Code students
help them with that quite a bit less
summer and K stars is the classic Katie
a Jew application I'll have Jason come
up and talk about that in a minute and
the last one is calcium calcium is a
chemistry application that started as a
just a periodic table but recently they
got 3d molecule viewer with so you can
look at molecules put together and move
them around in real space in front of
you I'll show you a screenshot of that
as well here's k algebra k algebra has
this this console where you can do
algebra algebraic expressions and also
graphing tabs and then it's got that
dictionary that shows a glossary of a
whole bunch of algebraic terms and like
sine cosine what they mean how they are
used and things like that so it's kind
of like a knowledge base built right in
and here's a screenshot of calcium with
the 3d molecule viewer you can see
actually I don't know what this is hmds
but I think it cost cars
was saying that it's a standardized
chemical form at the file format so you
can download these chemical molecule
files they're probably all over the
place on the internet maybe and see how
chemicals are put together and made up
let's see saw that okay parlay this is
actually pretty cool and the topic of
data users can actually share their data
with us now it's not as easy as it will
be but you can send it to the mailing
list or to the website and we can put it
up on the website this is a user
contributed file that has five languages
in it it's got English German Spanish
arabic and russian translations of all
these words let's see and and so you can
pick any two languages to practice and
start practicing and enter something and
say I don't know that and it also shows
images if you put images in it so it's
quite useful i use it to try to review
chinese characters that I learned a long
time ago and have since forgotten and it
uses the lightener box system to repeat
the the ones that you don't know more
often than the ones that you do know and
then let's see there was something else
around it oh yeah step okay let's see
that's not step
sorry
okay this is step it's a you can make
objects and particles and all sorts of
things and give them initial velocity
and initial rotation and send them
moving and watch the watch it go see the
authors showed it to us in Paris and
it's very refined it's got a couple
things left to try to work on but I
think it's going to be in the 4.1
release definitely it'll be going in the
end review soon let's see and then Jason
do you want to come showcased ours a
little bit and switch the layout for you
okay so it's that good k stars is the
desktop planetarium program for KDE but
another way to describe it is that k
stars is a graphical interface to a
database that's really sort of
fundamentally in terms of software what
it is the database is all this
information about objects in the sky and
the graphical interface is as you would
see if you just went outside and looked
so right now we're seeing this guy from
st. George Utah because this is jeremy's
laptop and it's for it's the sky at st.
George Utah for 520 on 18th of January
2008 all those things can be changed you
can change the location okay so you've
got some Dvorak keyboard thing going
here right
okay anyway I'll use the menu like a
real user would so if you want to change
your geographic location you can go up
to the settings menu and select
geographic and it gives you a nice map
of the world so you can either select by
clicking in the map or you can say well
I know where I want to go I want to go
whoa okay I just that does not say
Tucson it's okay it's okay we don't need
to do that we'll just stay in st. you're
just not far from tasting so he changed
the time I let me just change the time
to noon because I want to show you what
the reason that one of the primary
motivations obviously since we're in KDE
I do is education that's one of the
things that we're focused on in k stars
now it might not seem like really an
educational application like poly or
calcium are but it really is there's a
lot of thing cool stuff you can do with
this or it's really illuminating for
celestial concepts for students and
adults alike who might be interested in
one of those things that you can do is
understand why we have seasons so here
it is January and we're looking south at
noon and there's the Sun so it's that
high in the sky in fact we can look at
how high in the sky tis the Sun is now
32 degrees above the horizon that's at
noon that's as high as it gets basically
today so if i set this time step to a
day and let it go what we're going to
see is every scene you're seeing is a
day after the last one so right now
we're in late februari going into March
you see the Sun getting higher and
higher in the sky every one of those
days at noon and as we head in this
summer you see the Sun is getting very
much higher in the sky which is why the
days are longer in the summer and why
it's warmer so right there we've already
Illustrated an important concept about
our planet with this program
other things you can do you can learn
about the planet so let's zoom in I
trust the numbers are the same in four
ok let's let's go to the planet Jupiter
which is way over here there it is and
we'll zoom out in I think 0 plus is not
the same ok hold on I think I can do it
k stars has many ways to do things so
there's Jupiter and if i zoom in again
we'll get a better picture of its moons
so there's Jupiter and some of the and
four of its moons around and then change
this to a more reasonable time step
maybe five minutes and we'll let that go
well fives too slow let's try 15 so here
you see Jupiter and its moons going
around and this is accurate if you if
you went out with a telescope and looked
at Jupiter at you know midnight on May
fifteenth that is the configuration of
its moons that you would see in the
telescope I one of the interesting
things about this view for the student
point of view is that the teacher can
then say well when Galileo saw this in
his telescope this was the proof he
needed for himself to realize that the
earth was not the center of the universe
around which everything rotated because
these things are clearly going around
Jupiter and not around the earth so this
observation is of cosmological
significance yeah
oh that would be really nice wouldn't it
something like that and be nice to get
animated too oh that would be nice why
isn't it working oh I know why you know
why because the time stuff is a day
which isn't very long on this on a scale
of a solar system so let's try month is
that still too slow it might be because
we're all the way zoomed out okay there
they go and we can also zoom in if the
plus key worked but I'll just leave it
like that for now it's fine it's fine
and again you can set any date you want
here so you can see what this
configuration of the solar system is
there the labeling is a little bit weird
here we didn't have time to clean that
up but we'll get a handle on that later
anyways do I have time to keep going or
every okay
uh we don't have a top-down view of that
at this point is that what you meant
good what one thing you can do if I can
get this to respond there we go oh hi
whoa it's right next to a cluster that's
lucky I got it right down that date
that's oh that's right for my birthday
awesome what cluster is that let's see
that is M for cluster and Scorpius so
let's see let's learn a little bit more
about em for this is what I mean about
the database this is a graphical
interface to a very rich database of
astronomical information so i just did
it I did a right click on this cluster
called m4 and I get this window which
gives me details about the object I can
get very detailed information about its
position I can look up the wikipedia
page on m4 and actually there's even
more advanced things that professional
astronomers use NASA related databases
that you can query on the basis of this
object other things you can do through
this context menu if you get the click
right is for example you can pull down
images off the internet right in the
application here oops
try that again stalled okay anyway it's
a demo it doesn't always work let me go
so all right I think I need to zoom out
actually Jeremy so can you help me find
the minus key or I could just use the
toolbar button I suppose oh there I go
okay perfect okay let's zoom out a bit
so that you saw that on May twentieth
the moon looks a bit full but let's go
ahead and step ahead a bit watch the
moon traversing the sky now this green
line you see go by every once awhile
that's our horizon I've switched the
mode so that North is up instead of up
being up so everyone smile you'll see
the horizon go by so this is the moon
going across our sky as it orbits around
the earth and we orbit around the Sun in
our common orbit one thing you might
notice here I'll make it go a little bit
quicker so we can see the phase
advancing to so the phase of the moon as
many of you probably know is just
geometry the moon is always half
illuminated by the Sun because that's
the only source of light in the solar
system so whatever vantage point we are
in the earth looking at the moon that
determines what phase of illumination we
see so right now as the moon's getting
dark that means that the moon is passing
between us in the Sun so the one light
source is illuminating the side that we
don't see and actually if this this
brown line is called the ecliptic and it
traces where the Sun is so right there
you see the Sun going by so the moon is
closer to us in the Sun so that's why
we're seeing it back lit now this
wobbling that you see the moon is not
going straight across the sky there's
this wobbling back and forth as it goes
anyone know why that's happening I am a
teacher actually I'm an astronomer so
it's not procession I'll give you a hint
that wobble happens once per day it's
because earth is not a point we're on a
point on its surface so as earth goes
around our vantage point it is it is
parallax I'm sorry did I say it wasn't
yes I did you were absolutely right it's
paralyzed because you know we're on a
moving vantage point on the earth
the earth is spinning so the direction
toward the moon changes a little bit and
it results in that wobble so even that
part of it is is reproduced in case
stars and there goes a nice nebula which
is also sort of shown on the map I guess
I'll just stop there and and we can move
on Jason yeah how about any plans to
integrate marble with key stars yeah
I've heard that a lot of this meaning
actually and it's something that it
makes so much sense that look like I
think that's that's going to happen for
sure and what about water being able to
view a map like marble but of the moon
or of Venus that's interesting yeah I
mean at some level it's just a matter of
having another texture map and another
locations database if people are very
good during this next half year we may
actually integrate the map of the Moon
44.1 will be good oh you didn't mean
that sense oh you did okay good I was
actually talking to torsten who's the
other marble guy about doing exactly
this and he said that basically it would
end up being downloadable stuff through
the hot new stuff yeah the conditional
globe so you can probably get some
interesting location stuff for the moon
map as well on that same topic I
actually happen to know that there are
some people at Moffett Field working on
a similar thing for a more proprietary
on mapping thing but NASA is generally
very good about open sourcing and it
might be something you could talk to
them about another idea another idea
here I think it was from you is that it
be cooled in in marbled wheel to click
on a locations they show me the sky from
that location it's another way we can
sort of try and merge those two
hi I want to know if Kitty educational
have something like iTunes you you know
what is iTunes U you something new from
apple because Apple was always at
lectures let me tell you itunes is for
the love music and iTunes U is something
something like the lattice impatient to
the lower the books from universities
for educational help i can download
books you can look for example chapter
14 the fundamental for greek dramatics
or something like that I am look I until
you see you are here about that I know
that ocular has the ability download to
download e-books and I guess with
another four point oh ok ok
but that will come back i think that
would be more in ocular kind of thing I
don't know well I think the downloads
are certainly planned but I don't know
let's
let's wrap that up because odor you have
anything else for me okay all right
let's put our hands together for Jeremy
