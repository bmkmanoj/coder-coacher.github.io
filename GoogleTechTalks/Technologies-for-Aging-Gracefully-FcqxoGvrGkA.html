Toronto he's going to talk about
technologies for aging gracefully Robin
thank you Nick I requested a very short
introduction you did it great job
exactly what I wanted can everyone hear
me here and in Toronto or wherever else
I don't know how many other places are
watching okay um the i'm here in part
because i've been fortunate enough to
receive to google faculty awards one of
which was really instrumental in funding
very exciting project that i'm going to
show another one of which is now helping
a couple other projects started I get
give version of this talk in Mountain
View think about a year ago but I
thought it would be nice if I said thank
you to google panda that's why I came
out here son well hopefully you'll enjoy
it feel free to interrupt me at any time
I have more material on fourth and I
played it's all right Gate you possible
in conversation and therefore too many
questions out you ask you to hold them
to the end so my lab is called the
technologies for aging gracefully lab
and the reason I created is live and it
follows a line of work that I've been
doing for almost 10 years now that I
started about 10 years ago when I could
see turning 60 on the horizon I can now
see turning 70 on the horizon and this
is me that this work is worth doing the
good news is we're living much longer
and in fact the United Nations stack
that says by 2150 the percentage of the
world population that's over 60 will
have grown grown from the current level
of twenty percent
thirty-three percent is just staggering
that is assuming the world lasted 21 and
the world is going to be a very very
different place and the good news of
course is that many of us will enjoy
that I'm not specifically will be around
2150 the bad news is that we have to
come combat a variety of impairments
disabilities challenges sensorimotor
cognitive etc and you see listed on the
slide some of the things like
Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive
impairment mci if you're diagnosed with
MCI the odds are fifty-fifty you'll be
diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease
within four years there's a fair amount
of research that's directed towards
making the life of seniors easier and
better most of it is research that comes
out of the AI and computer vision and
machine learning community and you
become community and it lost the goal
that says we can make machine smarter
and put them all over the place in the
walls etc and they can watch out for bad
things that may happen for you this is a
very exciting line of research our
approach is somewhat different our coats
involve technology to help make seniors
smarter more capable more resourceful
and to enable them and their family
members and this is D to work together
to combat the effects of certain
disabilities or impairments or just
things that happen when you get older so
we're about 20 people students and staff
at the University of Toronto we have
lots of clinical collaborators in
various hospitals and medical schools in
Toronto and Northeast US are as you'll
see in the talk we use a variety of
technology so it's not just like we're
only into mobile phones we're only in to
look around for human needs that seem
selling and sweet spots where technology
might be relevant to that human need
envision ways in which the technology
could help and then design prototype
build and where possible commercialize
the solutions in the burden that my
students have is that unlike much work
in the field of human-computer
interaction which is sort of my core
discipline where students do their
research by bringing a dozen or two
thousand and three dozen first or second
area Universal Susan to lab to test some
new interaction technique for Senate
performance enhancement in a five
percent error reduction rate we actually
try to build our technologies robustly
enough to deploy them with real seniors
living in your real homes doing real
stuff and this is quite a challenge and
we work with people with a variety of
disabilities and challenges which are
listed there and many of which will be
mentioned an illustrated in this top now
this work does not exist in a vacuum
just in case any of you here are
thinking after you change the world and
make love back for another degree or
whatever we do have for faculty and
computer science at the University of
Toronto listed there myself Robin Kai
and Daniel who do various aspects of
human-computer interaction research you
know I don't want to be too boastful but
we're pretty good at it we have a really
really well regarded group on a world
class scale the mantra of our lab is
research for the journey through life
and our minimal goal is to develop
prosthetics things that help combat some
impairment or disability and that's
where we started so if you think about
breaking a leg the crutches the
prosthetic because use the crutch to
help you walk more ambitiously we look
towards methods for rehabilitation so
again using the example of breaking your
leg once
after use the crutch for a while you
might work with a physical therapist in
order to strengthen your life and we're
also looking for preventive
interventions for example to delay
mammal aging and this is a very
controversial area of great commercial
activity almost literally a feeding
frenzy and I'll talk about our response
to this opportunity a little later we
work in three main areas identity
autonomy family and community and they
can be best understood by going back to
the word need that I mentioned a few
minutes ago and I said we respond to
human needs we try to respond to human
needs you know what is a human need well
there's a psychologist named Abraham
Maslow who wrote a seminal paper in 1944
in which he proposed a hierarchy of
needs ranging on the lowest level for
physiological needs to the highest level
of self-actualization whatever that
needs and to illustrate that the next
slide talks a little bit about what that
means with the lowest level what we need
oxygen to breathe food we need water we
need we need to be healthy the next
level we need to feel safe and secure at
the next level Maslow talks about love
needs for love now we don't really have
a technological solution for that yet
but we approach this from the point of
view of what can we do to strengthen the
family and community and at the very end
of the talk I'll mention one project
that we starting that we're actually
hoping to get google is the end because
it relates to Google+ the notion of the
special kind of circle in Google+ called
the family at the next level esteem
needs we try to make seniors of the
autonomous it's self-reliant as possible
to Aleya allow them to do things that
they were able to do when they were
younger and the bulk of our work is
really in the family community a ton in
the area
and in terms of self-actualization which
is really sort of having a mission to
your life what we do the work we've done
is focused on the need for people as
they lose cognitive abilities through
various forms of dementia to enable them
to retain and their families to retain
that sense of identity and I'll explain
what that means that actually towards
the end of the talk so this is an
outline of the talk I'm going to work my
way up the hierarchy from physiological
needs to self-actualization and the
first to lower levels physiological
needs and safety needs i'm just going to
speak about very very briefly because
we're not actually working in that area
now but i just want to give you a
feeling for some of the kinds of things
that are being done so in terms of
health needs physiological needs an area
of great interest is the area of
websites to help health and again it's
possible that google has some
significantly contributed missouri the
notion of being able to find reliable
information at your fingertips that help
you understand a possible disease
condition and what I've Illustrated here
are three pretty credible and successful
websites for help ranging from pubmed
health which is a government site on the
upper left through the Mayo Clinic a
renowned private healthcare institution
to web and the a company set up to to
work in this area one of the many
companies set up by the the famous
entrepreneur and computer scientist Jim
Clark also at that level one of the
really exciting areas now i think is
technology to help seniors keep fit and
here's some examples of seniors using
the Wii I don't have some pictures of
seniors using the Kinect but i think the
Kinect which my friend bill Buxton says
is the fastest selling consumer product
in the history of the world or something
like that I think the connectors going
to have some significant impact in this
as well so that's all I want to say
about physiological needs are just a
question to engage you I'm in the end
you know you're a you're a web savvy
bunch so I assume you look at websites
how many of you when you bring that
information to your physician how many
of you feel that this helps your
dialogue with your physician or hinders
or provides a new challenge to your
downline if it helps raise one hand if
it hinders it provides new challenges
raise one him okay well you raised in
both time okay so anyway I don't have
time to go into this but the the ability
of consumers health consumers consumers
of health information to know more or
think they know more provides
interesting new challenges for the way
medical care is going to be run let me
now move to safety needs there's a lot
of excitement around about smart homes
and you see a diagram on the upper left
there illustrate sort of an image a
vision of all kinds of technologies that
could be available in smart homes seems
to to monitor electricity to watch you
to ensure that your Stoke goes off
medication adherence etc there are
individual aspects of this that a
reality for the most part this is still
the fiction that perhaps will be
realized in five or ten or twenty years
although this is exciting research and I
just want to mention two aspects of
research that I find particularly
exciting on the upper right is work from
shweta Patel at the University of
Washington this is actually be
commercialized in sweat pack has ways to
hook up electronics both to the
electrical circuits in your house
into the fluid flow of your house water
and actually detect differences between
what's happening today and what happened
last week or over a period and say you
know this person usually runs the
toaster and the coffee pot every morning
I haven't done two days in a row what
does that mean Alex Mitchell itÃ­s a
brilliant young researcher at Toronto
rehab and U of T in the lower part of
this works on fall detection and this is
better than now the following on that
can't get up with someone else and press
the buttons of this if commercially
realizable and I'm quite optimistic that
this will be turned into products within
the next five years would allow computer
vision and AI to detect with reasonable
certainty that it looks like somebody
has swallowed in this case you see the
images of a shadow next to a bed how
many of you use skype to actually so now
I want to move on to the need for love
how many of you actually skype with
family members or significant others or
distant relatives or whatever okay so or
for google I'm sorry google what's the
google video is it called lineman pardon
how many of you use google video for
that i shouldn't shouldn't talk about
skype here okay so bad bad bad bet it
okay but but you know skype skype is
almost become like Kleenex having you
know brand awareness in that field okay
so we're doing something a little bit
different we're not interested in the
kind of people activity I visited my
friend Aaron Marcus a graphic designer
in Berkeley and watched on Sunday
morning as he and his wife spoke happily
and enthusiastically with grandchildren
i think in austin texas and somewhere in
the Far East etc etc we're interested in
facilitating can
goodness and communication for people
who are isolated and lonely and may not
have the psychological resources or the
technical skills to pick up skype at a
moment's notice and chat in real time
and there are a lot of groups like that
something not all but some seniors
living alone 724 homebound caregivers
there are millions of people in this
country tens of millions in North
America who are almost the total support
as a caregiver for someone who's got
Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or something
so something like that people in
long-term hospitalization or people in
hospitals for even 10 or 20 or 30 days
are very isolated from family and
friends because it's you know I remember
once asking someone the television was
free in this particular institution be
if you wanted a phone you had the body
we have to wrap the fun that come
individuals who are quarantined
individuals with chronic fatigue
syndrome we even particular been looking
at people with chronic pain and the
characteristics of all these kinds of
stakeholders is that for the most part
they live alone or with very little
support they may also have some sensory
or motor impairments and they have
little control about their availability
for social interaction of a given time
there there there a bit powerless so
we've been working in particularly with
chronic pain which is an area that I was
introduced to by Professor Diane Graham
all at Simon Fraser who works in this
area and she convinced me and several
paper she she said me that that this is
a far more widespread phenomenon that I
ever thought there's something like
twenty seven percent of community
developing seat welling seniors in
Canada now it's more if you're in a
hospital or institution but
community-dwelling zudem of chronic pain
which we pay that insists over three
months so we've done we've completed an
interview study with
20 it wasn't 30 I think it wound up as
27 people with chronic pain a long
interview study in which we asked them a
lot of questions about their pain and
about their communication with family
and friends and loved ones and their
desired communication and to what extent
technology was playing a role in being
helpful or not and the findings which
will be reported in X frame yet the
conference cscw 2012 is that the
severity of their problems that varies
significantly depending on the kind of
chronic pain and now severe it is but
the intermittent variability of chronic
pain the fact that you cannot predict
when you're going to feel good and when
you're going to feel terrible and when
you're going to feel so terrible that
you can't barely breathe or do anything
causes great uncertainty around
communications and makes it difficult to
schedule face-to-face meetings to
schedule excursions to do skype calls
and things like this and also the human
factors and ergonomics of the technology
that people use ranging from computers
to phones leave a lot to be desired so
what are we doing in this area well we
started working with the concept of a
digital communicating picture frame and
this was first prototype by la macarena
essence of course forth your thesis that
ok at university and you see here images
from elaine's work and now you see this
is projects been taken over by jessica
david and i'm going to show you a little
video that shows what this will be like
with sort of a bit of a a screwy video
message so the idea is that the person
in chronic pain or the person is
isolated will touch the frame and a
message will go out to close family
members saying I'm thinking of you and
there then encouraged to basically turn
on the webcam talk into their smo ballon
whatever it sent back
video message and you'll see that or to
take a pre-recorded video and that's
what you'll see in here okay so some
time later so this would not be a
typical use of this more typically I
mean the idea for this project actually
came as I visited several times my
sister who eventually succumbed to ms
after a 15-year battle the last few
times I visited her the last four or
five times this was at a rehab facility
north philadelphia i walked the halls of
this place and all these people were
lying in their beds mostly most of the
people even the people who were not
comatose were lying in their beds and
there were TVs going often to tvs in the
room and i imagine my sister's TV
stopping for a second a lot voice coming
over we interrupt this mess this
mindless drivel from CNN with a message
from your son hi mom it's neil went
golfing yesterday shot 80 83 burdens
going to see the Mets tomorrow night
coming to see you this weekend with my
new girlfriend love you bye okay now my
nephew and my niece spend eight to ten
hours a day on a computer or a cell
phone this would be a piece of cake for
them to do so we started doing this with
picture frames and we're continuing
Jessica four meses Lisa's is actually
trying to understand better what
actually happens to people in terms of
who have chronic pain in terms of when
and how they communicate with friends
and family and the extent to which the
the extent to which they want to unable
to and will test model two of our
communicating picture frame which is
being built the first one was
well with a netbook which was just a
disaster the new version is on a android
pad on the symptom AB rapidly enough and
we also have all sorts of other things
we plan to do in the next few years some
of which are technological enhancements
to this and some of which are behavior
like what's the what what is what what
are the possibilities for using this so
Alison Benjamin a wonderful research
assistant works with me is now following
up on the study the interview study she
did with chronic pain by doing starting
a set of questions in a complex
continuing care hospital situation and
in a long-term care / nursing home
situation to understand the
communication patterns and needs and
wishes for people are living there okay
I'm now going to move down to oh okay so
I want to ask a question to how many of
you know at least one person who you
would regard as significantly socially
isolated and lonely ok all right so now
I want to move down to what's team needs
so the area that that it's really
receiving the most commercial attention
now is brain fitness how many of you
either have or know someone or have seen
the Nintendo game brain age ok one one
person over there okay there is a huge
feeding frenzy there is a huge
commercial activity around brain fitness
not quite maybe as big as cloud
computing is right now but really huge
ok lots of companies trying to make
money its projected the market to go up
to five billion dollars in 2015 nintendo
is the 800-pound gorilla in the field in
that they've probably sold maybe close
to a billion dollars worth of brain age
over the six or seven years since then
put it up but there are fifty or hundred
other companies and the the idea the
hope is that we can slow mental aging ok
if you do enough of the right
thing now why should we think that this
might be possible used to be 30 40 years
ago psychologists and neuroscientists
while they weren't neuroscientist 30
years ago but the equivalent would tell
you okay by age three four six eight
you're going to continue to grow neurons
you're going to learn from the new
things you're going to increase your
capabilities but by the time you get to
college age or your age or whatever
that's it you know it's downhill after
that that's no longer what people
believe there's a science of brain
plasticity that's emerging that says at
almost any age you can recover from
certain neural damage by essentially
rewiring your brain okay and there is a
concept called cognitive reserve out
there that's most associated view google
cognitive reserve the name of the
researcher you'll come up with the most
often is jakub stern propensity active
stirring at Columbia Medical School and
I visited his lab five years ago on a
half sabbatical and the idea of
cognitive reserve is you can take two
people or tooth a you know a thousand
people and a thousand people who have
matched amounts of brain damage okay
plaques and tangles the things that
often manifests itself as Alzheimer's
disease and you can and yet one of them
is perfectly healthy and the other one
has memory problems and executive
function problems and other things that
make them look like they have
Alzheimer's disease they're there what
what's called expressing Alzheimer's
disease okay why is that well if you
look in large numbers of people you see
that people who went to Harvard or water
or whatever have built that more
cognitive reserve than people with a
high school education people who have
worked as doctors or lawyers or
programmers have more cognitive reserve
and dictators people who have had lots
of friends it's better off than being a
hermit people who have exercised a lot
you're better off than being a couch
potato if you've eaten a medic terrain
diet you're better off than eating
McDonald's or Kentucky Fried Chicken
bilingual education as a young kid helps
give you more cognitive reserve so if
you've been a good person and done the
right things over a lifetime you are
better able to withstand the
neurological damage that manifests
itself as Alzheimer's disease ah but
there's relatively little evidence not
no evidence but relatively little
evidence that says if you start doing
sudoku zat 860 or playing brain age or
whatever did that's really going to help
you ok and in fact if you do sudokus at
a2z there's evidence that you'll
probably get a lot better at sudokus but
there's little evidence that says you're
going to get better at crossword puzzles
or you're going to be less likely to
leave your your stove on when you become
made 70 or 80 or 90 or more likely to
remember your medications it's called
transfer of training so there's a need
for more perspective research studies in
this area and so what we've done rather
than building yet another brain fitness
game like everybody else is doing we
have dope a web portal called tangra
tangra is the protocol proto bulgarian
god of wisdom and thunder valley and
penn delay of the architect of it is a
bulgarian ancestry we built a web portal
it makes it possible to do studies about
the effectiveness of sets interventions
online so that participants don't have
to travel as in the case when jakub
starting at columbia ask people to do a
study as he did recently sometimes they
have to travel up to two hours a day
each way across the Greater New York
area in order to sit there and play a
game for an hour and a half a day and
they do that three times a week for 12
weeks so we've built a portal that lets
you do these kinds of studies online
and there are measure there are a
variety of measures of success and
challenges still in this work that I'm
not going to go on to because I want
time to cover it but I'd be happy to
answer questions if you haven't so going
to then back to esteem so one thing you
want to do is you get all these you want
to remain mentally fit let's they'll be
able to do crossword puzzles you want to
be able to do lots of stuff but as
important or perhaps in some sense more
important or they're all important is
being able to speak and being able to
read okay god what could be more
fundamental and so we have research
going on both directed to being able to
sneak in being able to read so let me
talk to you about the work on being able
to speak and as I said this work was
partially supported by google faculty
award thank you and has led to the
formation of a startup company called my
voice so the idea of my voice is that
it's a help to speaking both in terms of
helping you recall words and in terms of
vocalizes them if your problem is a
vocalization problem and it does this
what's interesting about it is that it
doesn't in two ways it allows you to
access words in semantic categories but
it also allows you to access words based
on your location okay so if you're at a
gym homes will come up with words like
coffee cream double-double 10 bits and
it wouldn't come up with that if you're
in front of a movie theater now that's
not to say that you might not sit in the
movie theater talking about the great
Tim but you just had but still on the
average if you're going to order coffee
having the coffee related words is going
to be useful and so we have built this
it works it's elegant it it runs on both
iphone and android platforms it's
shipping and it makes a lot of
difference to people the person we've
worked with the most is a man named bill
stop it's a stroke survivor at a stroke
about 12 years ago and there's been a
maze
resourceful in terms of dealing with
this disability but what he used to do
is walk around with a briefcase about as
big as you see in the upper left with
all those things in fact a few more that
he didn't have when he took the picture
and now what he does is he carries he
carries his iphone so let me show you a
little bit a couple minutes of this tape
about my voice it's pretty commercial I
mean it's not a research tape it's it's
it's a product takes oh but you'll
forgive that do the right thing those
self-confidence has really increased
especially when he's in public he uses
it certainly at home as well and with
the family and with friends but
especially going out in public it makes
a huge difference would you agree yes
sir
to make a communication aid that's so
simple yet so capable you really have to
listen to your users users like ville
Scott a man I met two years ago who
suffered a stroke that left him unable
to speak do you want to show them in
your iphone there bill show them in my
voice what you have programmed I had my
stroke on the subway on the way to work
I was unable to move when I got to the
step where I was supposed to get on like
lots of people he used a communication
aid that was big expensive and difficult
to use and this is a long-term trend if
you go back five years we go back ten
years you see the same thing technology
was getting better but communication
aids weren't and for the two million
families in North America living with
communication challenges like autism and
aphasia an alternative was desperately
needed and now we've made that
alternative we call it my voice it's an
opportunity for him to share with others
which he had difficulty doing before
alicia is my daughter daddy is my
son-in-law the huge breakthrough that we
had was to introduce web technology to
communication aids with an interactive
website that enhances and customizes
your communication aid my voice is able
to do incredible things like suggest
relevant vocabulary based on your
current location at the coffee shop your
personal coffee order is at your
fingertips
at the movie theater you'll get relevant
words and phrases to make good
conversation you're going to let this
movie Hugh Grant his dreamy simply
drag-and-drop vocabulary from any web
browser anywhere in the world and with
the bookshelf users can add high-quality
content in seconds for instance I'm into
basketball so I would want to add the
basketball books in my vocabulary you
see my voice stinks against it okay so
how do we know that this is any good
well something like 7,000 people have
already not only downloaded it but
signed up to use it that's a good sign
although in truth we don't know yet in
detail what those 7,000 people are doing
and we're just in the process of
designing a survey to do it but we've
been doing some more in-depth testing in
Toronto so we finished the summer field
testing with children with special needs
and i believe the politically correct
phrase now is mild intellectual
disabilities which include difficulties
in speech and language acquisition
social language and behavior and
expression of emotions so we worked and
this was rochelle chem pagado under the
supervision of professor Rhonda McEwen
with about a little over a dozen girls
in one case and students of both genders
in another case ages 12 to 17 we gave
them my boys on iPhones and iPods for in
one case three months in another case
one month and we got very encouraging
results more social exchange more
collaborative problem-solving increase
in confidence ability to learn
vocabulary more socially appropriate
discussion and in the second school a
greater sense of community because the
gap between students who were capable
and students who really had serious
problems seem to break down somewhat
because of the technology now this is a
very small study only as I say that
number of students in two schools over a
small amount of time but still very
encouraging
the report the feedback we get from
people who work with special needs
teachers is very very encouraging and
very exciting our other primary initial
market is aphasia and aphasia is a
communication disorder in which people
have trouble recalling words and in some
cases articulating words that's often
caused by a stroke and the 1.3 million
people in North America who suffer from
aphasia and we're just in the process
we're about midway through of a very
intense study with five individuals with
aphasia mostly stroke survivors in which
we've given them my voice and we're
really studying the the extent to which
they're able to use it and how this
helps them with speech in communication
etc we've also become another doctor
piece of doctoral research this is the
PhD work of carried emmons app and it
really responds to the notion that you
can think about helping people speak
because like they've had a stroke or
something like that but there's another
there's another need where people need
help in speaking and that's not a
clinical population that deals with
levels of poor literacy in this country
which are just staggering the number of
people who literacy as tests that goes
beyond a middle school level as I think
only thirty or forty percent it's very
very poor and also ESL is another
problem so what carries doing for a PhD
is work is building a my voice the
system in the spirit of my voice but one
that instead of having data types of
English word and picture has data types
of English word French word or whatever
word and picture the last area I want to
talk about in terms of esteem is being
able to read and this actually and again
thanks to Google both the picture frame
work and this work are being supported
with my current google faculty award
we we started out and it was really we
were looking at an iPad one day thinking
about things that could we could do with
it and we realize well gee you know we
could enlarge the type that was you know
you didn't have to be a genius to figure
that out and we could also read text
aloud but we started thinking about a
more integrated higher-functioning aid
to reading so the first population we
started thinking about was for people
with poor vision and large print books
and books on tape are pretty successful
but they're not enough of them out there
and they're expensive to produce and
there ought to be a way to make larger
quantities of text available given all
that's happening with electronic
publishing Google's attempts to digitize
lots of books the Internet Archive there
are lots of players in this space so the
first idea was to unify the idea of the
large print book in the talking book as
an e-book and the ultimate technology
became what we call alt the accessible
large print listening and talking ebook
so the first l and the t are sort of the
obvious things the large print them to
talking but let me talk a little bit
about accessibility and listening so the
idea of accessibility is that we realize
that it's not just blind people or
people with very poor vision who have
trouble reading books it's people who
can't hold the books in their hand it's
people who can't turn the pages because
their hands are tremoring or whatever so
we started thinking about accessibility
and what we've been working on is a
variety of methods to allow the altie
book to be controlled not just by
gesture which is sexy but not everybody
can do it but by keyboard and ultimately
both voice and things like
but also we're interested in the idea
and here's what the listening comes in
the idea of collaborative reading there
was a very large survey done in England
about five or six or so years ago and
people who were blind or partially
sighted with very poor vision were asked
about a whole bunch of things about
reading and their their visual
disability and one of the things that
came out of that study was the fact that
one half of blind individuals and
one-third of partially sighted
individuals have somebody read to them
I've called the plywood of reading and
so alt is designed to facilitate that in
that if you're reading as the original
builder of this with Xavier snelgrove in
in a absolutely brilliant fourth year
undergraduate pieces Xavier was in the
habit of going to read to his now 80
year old grandmother who was a very
cultured scholarly literate woman whose
ability to read kept going down as she
became as her vision got ported pouring
now she's totally blind so the idea is
that Xavier is reading to his
grandmother it will listen and record
his voice and she then wants to read or
someone else pick up she can replay and
here part of the stuff being read in his
voice and then when he hasn't when
there's a part that hasn't been recorded
by him it speaks in in
in a computerized voice but we we have
access to some some very interesting
voices that sound much better than I I
don't know about the results about
another language I know that and this is
I'm not an expert on this research the
research is actually done in york
university by OMB allah stock the
collaboration of Fergus crank at
Baycrest but they they basically have a
number of studies that show cognitive
advantages relatively late in life and
differences between people of how to
bilingual education to people of not so
ok are we ok don't you go ok all right
so let me just show you the early
version of the all cook in action it's
videos pretty crude but so this is just
enlarging the type and shrinking it as
the clock struck 12 he heard a rustling
noise in the air and the bird came
flying that was a pure gold radisson was
snapping at one of the apples with its
feet that's the terrible built-in voice
ok now you see an early version of our
keyboard to help people who can't
gesture got a much nicer virgin now the
gardener said his eldest son to watch
what about twelve o'clock he fell asleep
and in the morning another of the apples
was missing
then the second son was ordered to watch
in at midnight he too fell asleep in the
more another apple was gone the gardener
said his eldest son to watch but about
twelve o'clock he fell asleep and in the
morning with ya mr. colt um so we're
feedback somewhere okay we're we're
working actively on this project as I
said we're looking beyond vision loss to
things like ms Parkinson's and dementia
we're working very hard on the issue of
accessibility there's some technical
challenges associated with the listening
feature and we just about have interfit
working interfaces now two large
categories of books of which the two
most interesting ones are booster kales
internet archive and the Google archive
the last area I want to talk about is
the area of identity and as I said
that's closest to self-actualization
we've gotten as you develop Alzheimer's
and the numbers in Canada I think are
around 400,000 people right now it's
supposed to grow to three quarters of a
million by another 20 years from now you
know impact your memory it affects your
identity affects your executive function
it there's a huge caregiver burden
enormous toll on families and
increasingly you and your family members
find it hard to remember and
re-experience what you were like before
you develop the Alzheimer's so I was
talking about this day also more
theology who was a Social Work profit
with the social work in Bank rest about
seven years ago and she had done a
little project in which he had made a
ten minute video giving some highlights
of someone's life and showed it to the
that individual and the family member
it seemed to be well-received so we we
constructed a research project which we
got funded by the Alzheimer's
Association to create digital life
histories of people the aid reminiscing
about what life was like before
Alzheimer's and we eventually produce
DVDs that represented the products of
that so what we did is we worked with 12
participants half with Alzheimer's in
half with mild cognitive impairment
ranging in ages from sixty to ninety
four there was a lot of time spent in
deciding what was the story what did you
want to communicate in it okay these
people weren't lucky enough to be like
Scarlett O'Hara to have a film a three
hour long felt one with the wind telling
the story of their life but the question
was what could somebody say in a half an
hour or 45 minutes in eight cases the
story was actually constructed and
written the biography as it were by
family members at all children or
spouses in four of the cases for the
people with mild cognitive impairment
they actually wrote their own stories
and autobiography so we produced the
these autobiographies typically over a
period of three to six months we then
showed it to them sort of the world
premiere we requested that be viewed
regularly over six months we went back
at three months and six months and
videotape them watching either by
themselves or with family members the
story of their life did lots of
interviews totally transcribed coded and
what did we learn what we learned that
in fact it stimulated reminiscence it
enabled people to soak up the memories
to have the feeling of what their life
was like 10 years ago 20 years ago 30
years ago and primarily that feeling
those remembrances were enjoyable not
always sometimes you'd see a video you
can see in the video someone who had
passed away and that would give you a
moment of pain but in general and we
count
these there were 15 times as many
moments of enjoyment good moments of
sadness let me show you a couple
examples this woman was brought to
Canada from South Africa about six years
ago before this was shot she's 91 at
that time mid stage Alzheimer's and
she's watching a bit about the story of
her life most of which was most of which
was her early life in South Africa
picture
I love this yeah
so she remembers names places people but
also she remembers feelings it was very
good to live there but what we've
discovered is that even more powerful
than someone watching this themselves is
watching it with family members so here
you see ms e it was 85 mid-stage
Alzheimer's and her daughter watching
and this is a very small portion of a
much longer piece watching the video and
you'll see several things with very
quick cuts because this was edited a
little too tightly and you'll hear the
daughter both interacting with her mom
and as the narrator of the story of her
mom's life
staring
so beautiful
can happen
Wow
so it's the interaction with families
the preservation of identity the feeling
of connectedness the legacy for family
that is very important for this not just
as a tool to stimulate recall and
reminiscence for the people with
Alzheimer's and what's interesting is
this also is relevant to third party
caregivers and in 10 of the cases that
people lived at home in two of the cases
that lived in a long-term care facility
and in both cases some of the caregivers
saw the videos and appreciated that and
now oh it's not just woman in the 17th
door of twenty doors along this quarter
they're all between 80 and 90 half of
them are Holocaust survivor but oh it's
the woman from South Africa whose
passion was lawn bowling okay so this
was very powerful so the results which
have been published were very positive
in terms of enjoyment enhancing
reminiscing stimulating family
conversation and connectedness but even
well not even more important but it as
important we developed an approach to
this that is practical it's not without
a cost but you don't need to do the you
don't need what forget Fleming I think
was the was the director of gone with
wing wing wind you don't need something
of that scale you could do this with a
college student or even a high school
student who has some facility with
computers and desktop video as long as
there's some adult around to mediate the
issues that sometimes come up which is
what is the store
what should we include what you'll be
not include because they're often are
our disputes and in theory this should
all become easier in the next 10 20 30
40 years as more of the resources are in
digital form although I'm not convinced
that they'll be any easier to find than
they are now in people's shoeboxes
there's another project that i don't
have really time to discuss in which we
asked the question what can we do in
terms of helping people remember not
their entire life but what they get
yesterday the trip to the zoo and so we
did a study with an experimental camera
called the microsoft sense cam it's now
available commercially from a British
company called vikon as the review and
again I don't have time to go into it
because you're already getting late but
we have in this study which were just in
the process of submitting for
publication added to a growing body of
evidence that says if you have
difficulty forming new episodic memories
in other words recollections of what you
just did if you see a series of pictures
that represent snapshots of what you
just did and you view that a few times
you will be able to remember that for
some period of time and this has been
news is a number about a dozen studies
now of this be working with people with
anterograde amnesia and also with with
Alzheimer's so I'll skip over this so in
summary we've worked and others have
worked with a huge variety of
technologies ranging from the wii to
smart homes to digital picture frames
the context-sensitive mobile apps the
ebooks and collectively the people who
are doing this are helping with needs
ranging from understanding your help to
keeping physically fit to staying
connected with family and friends to
helping you speak and read preserve your
identity another project i'll just met
two other project one nearing completion
my PhD student Mike massimi has
pioneered something called finito
sensitive design fanÃ¡ticos is the Greek
god of death I did not know that several
years ago and Tonetta sensitive design
is the design of technologies that in
some sense respond to the fact that
we're going to die it's an area that has
not been much explored in computer
science Mike's helping to pave the way
for this and he's just in the process of
the final study in his research
designing and evaluating a web portal
which he calls be stopped bereavement
support to help individuals who are
grieving and the last piece of work and
I'm not sure there's anyone here in
Waterloo to discuss this with because I
think most of the effort on Google+ is
in is in that view but we're starting a
PhD thesis is called the family quilt
project that's trying to do for families
what Facebook does for so-called friends
and what LinkedIn does for professional
collaborators of the people who you hope
will hire you or whatever and so and
this we're doing this because things
like Facebook do not serve families very
well grandparents for the most part
don't want to use it the unchill dhryn
are forbidden to participate and there
are lots of issues and I think this
might be of interest to discuss with
Google because in fact Google+ has this
concept of circles and one of the
circles is a family circle and Crick
believes that some of us weren't maybe
roughly involved into this so what have
we learned we've learned that the work
is very very difficult we some of these
studies take three or four years many of
our participants are not available when
we need them sometimes they even pass
away during the study and they passed
away shortly after the study which is
very very discouraging it's highly
multidisciplinary involving a whole mix
of this move yeah
homak mix of disciplines and above whoa
it's not what I thought it was when I
started ten years ago I thought it was
about cognitive prosthetics crutches for
the individual human mind and it's not
about that it's as much about supporting
family and community and caregivers and
clinicians as it is about individuals
and as much about supporting
communication and identity and efficacy
and self-worth as it is about memory and
cognition we're thankful for a number of
sources of support including as I've
said Google research and thank you for
your attention and I'm happy to take
some questions and comments it's all
