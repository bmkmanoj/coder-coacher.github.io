well as a number of other people at
Google the whole aspect of how we
perceive the world and cognition being a
big part of that so without further ado
I'm just gonna let Mike and M speak
eloquently to their work hello everyone
so my name is Michael Gordon and I am a
recent graduate of the neuroscience
program at UC and so today I'm going to
talk today a little bit about the neural
circuitry underlying the perception of
the outside world and so over the last
five years I've been studying how the
visual cortex of rodents mice and rats
encodes information about visual scenes
that they're seeing and so on the right
here I have a schematic of a rat brain
and basically what happens as images
coming into the eye get transferred
through a relay in the thalamus to this
area in beige up in the upper right
called the visual cortex and what we can
do as neuroscientist is dropped an
electrode into his visual cortex and
record the electrical activity of
individual neurons and see how they are
responding to the visual scenes that the
rats are seeing so this is usually how I
start to talk and then I spend an hour
going into all the detail and the data
that I've collected over the last five
years but today I'm going to do
something a little different I'm going
to take a big step back and address what
I think is a very important question
which sometimes as scientists we don't
get a chance to address and it's the
question of who cares why are we
interested in the neocortex I mean first
of all what is the neocortex why do we
care about the way in which it encode
sensory information and if we can figure
out how it works what will we get out of
it so first question what is the
neocortex so shown here is a human brain
so if you've seen it you kind of know on
the outside it's a big kind of wrinkly
mess looks like a walnut the kind of
division down the middle so we've just
kind of popped it in half and we're
seeing the inside
and you'll see that there's this kind of
wrinkly rind on the outside that's the
neocortex and on the inside there's some
smoother structures for the basal
ganglia the thalamus the brainstem and
it's kind of cauliflower looking thing
this is the cerebellum and so although
stuff in the inside of it referred to
collectively as the quote-unquote old
brain the neocortex is wrinkly stuff on
the outside so this comes from the Latin
cortex meaning rind or bark because it
kind of envelops the older structures
and neo because it's new so this is
evolutionarily a recent invention it's
it's particular only to mammals and it's
it only grown large relatively recently
so why are we interested in this so I'm
gonna kind of lay out a few brains for
you so starting at the upper left we
have a shark brain now the shark brain
is pretty much exclusively the kind of
old brain structure so the the middle
parts that I showed you in the last
slide and there's only a very small part
that's kind of cortex like that's
involved in sensory processing now we go
one down the next one over is a rat
brain so this one is kind of mostly the
old brain but it's got a single sheet of
the neocortex covering it one more down
we have a cat brain so here you can see
that we're starting to get more of this
kind of neocortical covering and you can
see it's also starting to get kind of
wrinkled so that the neocortex is a
sheet and it has kind of a fixed width
and so one way of squeezing more of it
and in a fixed volume is by kind of
convoluting it and wrinkling it up so
you get more surface area for volume and
this is carried to a logical extreme the
human brain which you can see is a very
kind of complex mass of contortions and
somes completely taken up by this
neocortex so well say in the rat it's
only about 25% of the total volume in
the human it's over 75% of the human
brain is neocortex and so it seems to be
doing something interesting and in fact
if you kind of look at the size of the
old brain compared to the size of the
creature in general you find a pretty
kind of proportional increase the bigger
the creature the bigger the kind of old
brain but the neocortex you get this
kind of unusual over expression of it in
certain species
so humans are probably the best example
of this we have six or seven times what
you kind of expect given our body weight
something like a monkey or a dolphin
might have four or five times as much a
dog or cat would have a little bit less
and so what we see is kind of the more
neocortex house the more kind of complex
behavior and cognition you're getting
from the animal so this is kind of why
we think it's interesting so this is
just kind of summing everything up and
in broad strokes so the old brain is
kind of responsible for reactions to
stimuli the automated motor sequences
control of your of your peripheral
nervous system whether it be temperature
regulation circadian rhythms whether
you're awake or sleep arousal also
emotion we tend to think of emotion very
small in terms but it's actually very
much part of the old brain and you know
this makes sense even very simple
organisms need to have emotional valence
you know that tasty morsel over there
needs to be good and that thing with the
big teeth needs to be bad now the
neocortex it's so the old bring hope
gives you everything you need for
survival you know if you see something
that's food you can bite it you can
reproduce you can run away but the
neocortex is involved in kind of the
more complex cognition that we associate
with intelligence so complex sensory
processing so not just kind of seeing
something reacting to it but you know
being able to understand you know and
that is an object or what its uses might
be or that is an individual and a
certain individual motor planning you
know idea that you don't just kind of
react to something but you know we might
plan to do something later on today and
we'll actually do it abstract reasoning
theory of mind the the idea that we can
understand what other individuals might
be doing and and all of these by the way
you know we tend to kind of think
abstract musing in theory of mind or
things that only humans do but there's
abundant evidence that other animals do
it as well
consciousness is kind of a stickier one
but we do know the neocortex is somehow
involved there's this interesting
phenomenon called blindsight which is
that if a person has damage to the back
of their brain where the visual part of
the neocortex is and then you kind of
flash a light in a certain location ask
them to point at it they can point
directly to it but they have no
conscious percept of the light they'll
tell you
they can't see it at all so it seems
like consciousness is somehow have sub
served by the neocortex that we're not
sure how so
for in order to kind of sub serve all
these different functions the neocortex
must be is very kind of complicated at
our genius structure right and the
answer is kind of yes and no so you may
have seen these maps before so this is
you know the human neocortex and
different areas kind of correspond to
what their what they process so in the
back here you have the visual areas and
in the middlee of the sensory and motor
areas and the speech areas etc etc and
this is all true it turns out that the
cortical stuff it's actually remarkably
homogenous kind of across the whole
neocortical expanse define these
different areas thank you thanks so much
thank you so it seems to differentiate
these different regions it's not so much
the structure of the neocortex in that
region but rather the inputs that are
coming into it and so so what does the
structure of this neocortical circuit
look like so here we have a picture of a
human brain so this darken kind of band
here is the neocortical sheet that's all
convoluted if you just kind of take a
section of it and then turn it upright
so on the top we basically have you know
towards the outside of the brain and on
the bottom we have towards the middle of
the brain you see this kind of layered
structure so the cells have kind of
different densities and they're
different sizes and the different layers
and this is very Oh typical no matter
what chunk you do of cortex you grab so
whether it be a visual part or a part up
here involved in abstract reasoning it
really kind of looks the same and then
so what's going on here so you can see
these little little lines coming off of
them so each one of those is a single
neuron and there you can see the neuron
kind of blown up here in the upper right
unfortunately image hasn't totally come
out but so the kind of ball in the
middle is the cell body and then there's
a bunch of processes coming off of it
and kind of a tree like structure
those are the dendrites of the neuron
and that's where it collects all its
inputs from other cells if it gets
enough enough input at any one point in
time it gives off this little blip of
electrical activity called an action
potential and we'll send that activity
to other cells yes so all so the
neocortex is always six layered
everywhere in the brain everywhere in
development yeah so the old brain
doesn't have any layers it tends to be
kind of discrete nuclei there are kind
of primitive areas of cortex like the
archaic cortex or the hippocampus which
have a few like three layers for example
or you know some different number but
the six layered structures is is kind of
characteristic of a neocortex and there
some other common alleys that I'll talk
about also I should emphasize it so I'm
being a bit of a new a cortical
chauvinist here and I'm talking about
the neocortex is the only kind of see
way of kind of getting intelligence but
there's actually at least one other
solution that we know of so if you look
at bird brains they evolved very
separately from us if you remember your
Jurassic Park you know they'd ever
sometime around the dinosaurs they
actually have a different kind of
structure covering their brain called
the Neo pallidum it has a lot of
commonalities with the neocortex it is a
layered structure it doesn't have six
layers don't believe it but so there's
some similarities but it essentially
sits a different solution to doing the
kind of processing that the needle
cortex does and it turns out birds are
actually quite intelligent capable of
all kinds of complex and interesting
behaviors and a sensation and you know
creating songs that sort of thing but
back to what I was talking about so
these neurons here that they're all kind
of wired to each other and neurons are
interesting because they basically kind
of collect inputs from other cells and
then decide to either give off this
action potentials little blip of
electrical activity which it sends to
its partners or it doesn't so it you can
almost think of it as it's like the
transistor in the neural circuit and
this neural circuit kind of wires up in
such a way to perform some kind of
computation so you know is this really
kind of a universal
orchid so that there was some
experiments to address this about 20
years ago in which they took ferrets
very early in development and so
normally you have inputs from the I go
through relay you can see it there is
labeled the LGN which then goes over to
the visual cortex and you have inputs
from the ear go through a different
relay call to mgn and then over to the
auditory cortex so what they did is they
actually ablated the input from the ear
you can induce the input from the eye to
go over into the auditory relay which
then went over to the auditory cortex
and what they found was very interesting
to auditory cortex or the quote-unquote
auditory cortex now had visual responses
individual responses actually look very
similar to what people see in the
individual cortex so it seems at least
early in development there's a there's a
fair amount of universality in these
circuits now later in development that
they kind of specialized for whatever
inputs are dealing with and and they
become kind of less you can just kind of
mix and match them in the same way so
we've you know neuroscientist have been
trying to figure out kind of what is a
circuit and what is it doing and there's
been a lot of work on this and we made
some progress even though we're not
there yet
and I've kind of quickly schematized
kind of the the general connections you
see and I'm not going to go into a lot
of detail here but basically you have
inputs coming in from lower regions of
the cortex so this can either be from
the sensory periphery so it was talking
about visual cortex as an example so
this could be from the eye or you also
have a piece of cortex stacked on top of
each other so you have the eye and then
the primary visual cortex and then you
know higher regions of visual cortex so
the input if you're in a higher region
of visual cortex it could be from you
know the the lower area of visual cortex
or from the eye
you also have inputs from higher regions
going down and and then there's some
processing that happens in the circuit
and then it spits out inputs you know
both up the hierarchy and down the
hierarchy and these hierarchies can be
quite complex so neuroscientists like to
show this slide because it makes what we
do look terribly complicated but we
don't actually know much of what's going
on here but so basically each one of
these blocks have represents one or more
of these kind of cortical circuits on
and as you can see they're kind of
stacked on top of each other
but we do know it's kind of as you go up
this hierarchy you get more and more
complex representations of the stimulus
so the visual stimulus going in here
these first levels basically what you
see are the neurons respond to small
curved aughts of light in a certain
place in the visual field next level up
you see they respond to a lines kind of
moving across a certain area of the
visual field up here you get more
complex contours and they also start to
take up a bigger and bigger portion of
the visual up here that they'll respond
to a pretty big area and they respond to
some kind of complex contour and at the
very top you get these very kind of
abstract responses you can get responses
to you know only certain objects
responses only two people or faces or
even certain people in some cases and
and in these cases that usually takes up
the entire visual field so you know it's
a it's a person selectively neuron if a
person is anywhere in a visual field it
will be active and this property is very
interesting because it's actually very
hard to get if any of you have ever
worked on computer vision problems it's
it's almost impossible to program a
computer to be able to recognize an
object and that's because there's
infinite kind of you know ways that the
object can present itself you know if I
have this remote I can turn it around
and you know depending on how I present
it to you you know if I bring it closer
to you it'll be bigger on your retina if
I bring it back we'll be farther away
and yet no matter what I do you can
recognize it but trying to find some
kind of archetypical feature which a
computer could extract and say okay
that's a remote is very difficult so
what seems to be happening is the visual
cortex we have you know this circuit is
kind of combining information from
higher regions and from lower regions
and it's allowing it to do some kind of
useful informative task so some of you
may have seen this already it's kind of
a famous example but if you haven't and
when you try to figure out what is in
this scene and and now I'm going to give
you a hint if you haven't figured it out
yet which if you haven't seen it you
probably happen it's a Dalmatian there's
a Dalmatian somewhere in the scene so
some of you are probably seeing it now
hopefully if not you know there's a head
in this kind of tracing the contour so
now even if I take
get away everyone sees the Dalmatian
right and so what's happening here so
it's you're getting an ambiguous kind of
not very clear input and once you have
you know the higher parts of your brain
or kind of sending it back useful
information that you know there's a
Dalmatian to see and then you can kind
of figure out where it is and what's
going on and this is actually very
interesting because I didn't tell you
much about the Dalmatian I didn't say
which way it was facing I didn't say
whether it was big or small or whether
it was you know down on the ground or
howling up the moon all I said is that
there was a Dalmatian and yet somehow
your top-down inputs kind of informed
your you're kind of lower processing
regions to kind of constrain the
possibility of what you could look for
in order to help you find it and this is
what I think and at this point I'm kind
of leaving factual realm a little bit
and kind of getting a little more
speculative but I think this is the
point of it hierarchy and also the the
point of this whole cortical circuit is
to kind of combine this information
about the high level and the kind of low
level information the section that we're
actually getting and use it to kind of
build up our perception of the outside
world and I think this kind of profound
in a way so the our perception of the
world is not actually what's coming into
our senses but it's actually something
we our brain actively builds and what we
consciously experienced is not so much
what's coming in but the model that our
brain has built so I'm gonna give you
another example of this so I have a
little clip here of what sounds like
r2d2 saying some things I wanted you to
try to figure out what the message is
play it one more time okay so is anyone
actually able to hear what it said okay
one or two people you guys are good but
most people can't now I'm gonna give you
a hint as to what r2d2 there was saying
hit this steady drip or you know he can
read it so it's a little morose I didn't
come up with this example it's Sophia
Plath maybe I don't know but now I'm
gonna play it again and I want you to
see if you hear anything different
so everyone here right now so this is
interesting because it not only are you
you know kind of abstractly recognizing
that it's the same as the sentence I
just showed you but you are literally
hearing it differently you could point
to you know which word occurred at which
time and you would be right and so
what's happening is you're top-down
percept you're top-down knowledge is
changing your perception of the outside
world I think this is pretty fascinating
and I think it's one of the points
basically of this neural circuit so that
you know I've been kind of talking in
terms of perception but this you know
could also be useful for a motor if
you're kind of comparing you know what
you want your motor action to be with
the feedback you're getting from the
outside world
I mean there's this kind of general
comparator circuit it seems to be doing
something very important that allows
humans to do all the kinds of other
animals to do the kinds of cognition
that we do and so this is kind of a
major goal of neurosciences to figure
out how this all works and certainly one
of my major goals and so very briefly I
just want to talk about the kind of
implications of if we could figure out
how the circuit works first I think it's
gonna you know have enormous
implications for medicine so you know
autism epilepsy schizophrenia you name
it almost any neurological disease is
somehow a dysfunction of this cortical
circuit you know whether it be miss
wirings or what-have-you and so you know
basically figuring out how to you know
at this point start like trying to fix a
car when you don't know how it works and
kind of remove parts and stuff in but
you're probably not gonna make it better
but if you actually know how it works I
think what will and much closer to being
able to find cures for neurological
diseases computing and artificial
intelligence there are a lot of things
that computers are much better at than
we are so for example multiplying large
numbers together I think a $5 calculator
could probably be pretty much anyone in
this room however there are things that
humans are much better at than computers
so for example recognizing objects your
average six-year-old can eat you know
your most powerful supercomputer with
really good programmer so you know kind
of write computer vision programs for it
so I think if we can you know we
probably already have the processing
power to kind of do these kinds of
computations at the neural
it's our doing you know they are
impressive but they're kind of within
realms and or if we haven't reached
already we can reach soon what we really
need to understand is the architecture
of circuit and one that's doing and once
we do that I think we should be able to
build the kinds of circuits that allow
you know things like computer vision and
speech recognition to happen and also
you know we tend to think of inputs as
being sensory inputs because that's what
we have but the circuit does seem to be
pretty Universal on it and we can learn
new tasks with it for example we learned
how to read even though our Evolet
evolutionary precursors never did that
and so that you could probably put come
new types of sense information into this
new a cortical circuit and have it kind
of intelligently kind of make inferences
about it and last I'd you know kind of
token you know human understanding I
just think it's you know like what makes
us different from cavemen isn't just
that we live longer and then we have
cooler toys but also that we kind of
understand our place in the universe
that the Earth revolves around the Sun
that we evolved from other creatures and
so on and so I think understanding the
brain is very much part of you know kind
of the about fascination and humility of
the human experience so hopefully at
this point I've motivated you as to why
the neocortex is interesting and we're
studying and now I'm just gonna talk
briefly about some of my own research on
this and so as I mentioned you know I'm
kind of interested in studying how this
kind of primary visual in your cortical
region is encoding information about the
outside world and this is miss studied
quite extensively for the 50 about 50
years or so and it's probably the best
understood region of the neocortex so
for example is known that neurons in
this region will fire action potentials
when lines crossed those part of the
receptive field at certain angle so what
I wanted to do is actually not look so
much at just the responses to the
outside world but see how those
responses change depending on the state
of the animal and we actually a good
reason to think that they would change
so very early on 1930s Hans Berger
invented these EEG electrodes that you
can you know put on your scalp and what
kind of measure the gross neurological
activity says is filtered over a
millions of neurons you can kind of look
like very crudely at what's going on in
a human brain during different
behavioral states and so this is from
one of those patients so on the top you
can see when the when the patient was
excited
you see is very kind of low amplitude
high frequency activity when he was
relaxed you see this kind of higher
amplitude slow frequency activity and
when it's asleep BC like this very slow
kind of high amplitude activity now we
know kind of intuitively that we kind of
perceive the outside world very
differently in these different states
you know when we're excited we kind of
pay attention more than when we're
drowsy and we certainly paid attention
much more than when we're asleep and we
also know that you know there's kind of
gross neurological activity it's going
to affect the neurons and in these neo
cortical circuits will likely change the
responses so what I wanted to see is you
know what is the biological mechanism
you know how are these changes happening
and what effect is it having on the
neocortical circuit and so to
investigate there's I you know you
I picked a system which I had a strong
hint was involved and this is the
acetylcholine system so it's observed by
this nucleus here in the basal forebrain
called the nucleus misawa's region here
it's a very small number of large cells
that send a seal choline basically all
over the neocortex and the reason he was
interested in this nucleus is because
it's known that if you stimulate it
electrically you basically change the
state of the cortex so this is an
example here that I recorded the EEG
from Iraq you see these big slow wave
oscillations and then I stimulate this
nucleus and now you see these much
faster lower amplitude oscillations so
exactly the sort of state change I
showed you in the last slide it's also
known that this system is it's kind of
active at different levels depending on
the state of the animal so when we're
asleep it's pretty much turned off when
we're awake it's it kind of fires tonic
tonic away like a higher level and then
when we come really excited it kind of
goes gangbusters and goes crazy it's
also known to be very important if you
damage these neurons you have major
problems with perception attention
memory so essentially a lot of the
pathology from Alzheimer's and senior
dementia is thought to come from damage
to these neurons and finally it's known
that if you just kind of drop the co
choline on to the visual cortex it
changes the response properties of the
neurons so what I wanted to do is kind
of activate this area while measuring
responses in the visual
cortex to a natural scene and see how
after this area kind of changed the
responses to the to the natural scenes
and so the way I did that I'm not gonna
get into all the details in the interest
of time but I use kind of a clever
technique where we got these transgenic
mice from a lab at Duke and you can
actually specifically activate just two
neurons that release acetylcholine by
using a certain wavelength of laser
light so we drop an optic fiber into the
brain activate these neurons and cause
the ceiling release all over the cortex
then in the in the visual cortex I
wanted to really record from a whole
population of neurons rather than just
one so we used this thing it's called a
poly trode and it's a basically a
silicon chip that has regularly spaced
iridium sites on it and then what
happens is it so it's just kind of an
example of there's some neurons in front
of this chip every time one has one of
its little electrical blips an action
potential you can see it as a kind of
signature blip in the and each one
because they're in a different location
will activate different channels so this
one over here will kind of cause that
one or that pattern of responses and
from that information we can use
mathematical techniques to extract the
the firing properties of a bunch of
individual neurons and kind of look at
populations of neurons and see how their
responses are changing so I have a ton
of data on this that I unfortunately
don't have time to tell you about but
I'm just going to show you one quick
result to kind of give you a flavor for
it so colors didn't quite come out but
so what I've done here is I'm just
taking a look at individual neurons so I
have three individual neurons and
different colors here so let's just look
at this top one now so the top two
panels and what I've done is I played
the same movie over and over again for
this neuron and looked at its responses
and so basically each little hash mark
you see is a response to somewhere in
that movie and what I've done is I've
stacked 30 responses to the 30 repeats
of the movie on top of each other and
the reason why I've done this is that
you'd expect that
if the neuron is kind of giving you some
useful information about the movie it's
going to respond at the same time during
every presentation otherwise if it's
responding at different times and it's
not conveying anything useful at any
upstream regions and so what I wanted to
see was does the release of the seal
coin actually kind of increase the the
information and the response of the
neurons and so what you can see is if
you look at the the top two panels is a
cell I'm going to show you if you look
at the bottom of those two panels that's
the response when I caused a seal coin
release and you can see that there's a
couple of time points at which there is
very reliable responses to the natural
movie but if you look in the control
situation where I didn't induce the
acetylcholine release so the panel above
it you do you no longer see those kind
of reliable responses so it seems like
what's happening and you know this is
just one example Sal but we ran all the
statistics it's a very reliable effect
so it seems like what's happening is
that the aceo coin release it's causing
the cells to kind of better encode the
visual environment and there's a kind of
more quantitative way of testing this
what we did is we took the whole
population of responses to the movies
and we try to predict what movie the or
what part of the movie which frame of
the movie the animal was seeing based
purely on the responses and then we
found when there was a co choline
present we're able to do it with much
higher accuracy than when there wasn't
so essentially what's happening is the
co coing is improving the signal
processing in that region and this is
really cool because it what it suggests
is that you know our brain it's not like
a silicon circuit where it kind of works
the same way each time unless it's
broken it can actually change the mode
in which it operates depending on the
needs of the organism so when you're
kind of zoning out you're kind of not
paying attention to the outside world
because you're doing something else and
then someone snaps your attention you
release you know a CO CO and suddenly
you hear what they were saying to you
which you were kind of ignoring a second
before even though it's the same
stimulus so just to sum everything up
so today I talked about how the
neocortex makes up the majority of the
human brain and kind of underlies or
complex behaved behavior motor planning
cognition etc and that the entire
neocortical
or sheet is kind of composed of a
somewhat stereotyped circuit and
figuring out how the circuit works will
be essential in terms of you know beatin
well in terms of understanding how the
brain works it makes up 75% of the human
brain and will also probably you'll
numerous practical benefits and finally
I showed you kind of one example of how
the neocortex is kind of a different
animal from some of the circus that
we're used to you know it can change how
it processes information depending on
the state of the animal but I'm actually
despite these kinds of things which make
it seem like it's gonna be a very
complicated problem I'm very optimistic
that we're going to be able to solve
this problem hopefully within our
lifetimes there's a lot of new tools for
you know basically so like what I did
recording from large population of
neurons there's ways in which you can
image the activity of large populations
of neurons we also have new tools which
allow you to stimulate Eraser certain
neurons and not others so we basically
have all the tools now to kind of
dissect parts of the circuit and really
kind of take it apart and see how it
works so finally I just wanted to thank
especially my advisor young Dan other
members in my lab and groping thing a
professor he just moved from Duke to MIT
who he provided the transgenic mice we
use and I really talked about the work
but these other people could have helped
me with various parts of getting the
techniques to work and finally a big
thanks to Peter for organizing this he's
been awesome and so I think before we
take questions I'm going to hand it over
to Emily and she's gonna give a short
trip talk on her work and then
afterwards we can do some Q&amp;amp;A any quick
questions is there any studies that show
that your brain has more of that like
while you're performing hi like
intellectually related to higher
performance in general or it's
definitely thought to be related to
higher performance and levels of arousal
fortunately it hasn't been said here
humans it's mostly been animal studies
in which it's a little more difficult to
quantify the amount of arousal but it
seems like so there's been studies in
which they found that if the animal is
performing some task it basically
becomes the nucleus releases
acetylcholine during important parts of
the task thanks ok and hopefully
there'll be time for more Q&amp;amp;A after so
I'm gonna talk about something pretty
different I think that's one of the joys
of doing a tag team talk is it you can
see the breadth of neuroscience research
we're both at Berkeley but in pretty
different areas so I'll begin by saying
that the study of neuroscience is
devoted to understanding how the brain
functions uniformly across members of a
species for example Mike explore the way
systems neuroscientists are tackling the
profound problem of how cortex works but
a critical question is how neural and
cognitive processes differ between
members of a species or even within an
individual in different environmental
conditions thus the question becomes not
how are our brains similar but how do we
differ
thus the purpose of this talk is to
introduce you to two concepts that are
two factors that contribute to
individual differences in cognition that
is genes and hormones and because I
study estrogen apologies to the men of
the in the room because a discussion of
the female menstrual cycle is imminent I
don't want to get too far afield but I
will say that a second loftier goal of
this talk and really this research in
general is to stress the importance of
considering the role of hormones and sex
differences in cognition from a basic
science perspective and intimate
understanding of how our endocrine
system impacts neural and cognitive
processes is interesting from a woman's
health perspective I'll argue it's
fundamental the estrogen cognition
literature and in particular I'm
thinking of the big population health
studies on the use of hormone
replacement therapy that data is
famously inconsistent and we can ask at
the level of the brain why so before we
start thinking about genes and hormones
we should talk a little bit about
chemistry Mike was talking about
acetylcholine I'm gonna talk about
dopamine I assume many of you have heard
of dopamine somehow in the room so like
in what context you shook your head what
is exactly yeah yeah Schultz's is great
yeah so the reward pathway okay that's
good so it turns out that there are
three main a sending dopaminergic
pathways in the brain so you pointed out
one which is the nasal limbic pathway so
it starts here in the VTA or ventral
tegmental area and projects to the
limbic regions the nucleus accumbens and
such there's two others so the nigra
start a little pathway I grew up another
group of cells in the midbrain and
projects to the striatum when the cells
and the substantia nigra die you get
Parkinson's disease and finally the
pathway in red is the maze of cortical
pathway it also originates in the VTA
this projects to the frontal lobes so
prefrontal cortex a part of the brain
that's really important for things like
planning and logical thinking and
abstract reasoning as Mike talked about
and that's the pathway that I'm talking
about today they're distinct pathways
and they carry distinct cortical
purposes now it's been just over 50
years since Arvid Carlsson first defined
dopamine as a neurotransmitter at the
time in the late 1950s it was thought to
be merely a precursor in the
biosynthetic pathway of norepinephrine
another neurotransmitter his basic
science work was really focused on the
nigra striatal pathway and his work led
to the development of using dopamine
drugs to treat Parkinson's disease he
was awarded a Nobel for that in 2000
really great work but fast-forward 20
years from the late 1950s to the late
1970s and we meet Tom brewski who really
demonstrated for the first time the
functional importance of this red trace
the maze of cortical pathway and in a
now landmark study he was able to remove
dopamine from the prefrontal cortex
using this neurotoxin six hydroxy
dopamine and he tested these monkeys on
a short-term memory task pre and post-op
and here's what he found
so in this task
monkeys are asked to maintain a bit of
information over delay
period in some trials with delays really
short and in others it's really long
white race and you can see this is very
expected of predicted increase and
performance as a delayed period length
task but what happens when we removed
open e from the prefrontal cortex
performance begins to tank almost
immediately what's striking is that the
deficit seen in dopamine depleted
animals is almost as bad as those
monkeys who had direct structural
ablation to the prefrontal cortex so
literally you know morphologically
there's there's damage to that region of
the brain and importantly when dopamine
was added back into the depleted animals
the effect went away so the moral of the
story is that dopamine is really
important for proper functioning of the
prefrontal cortex it's this region of
the brain is exquisitely sensitive to
it's in our chemical environment so you
modulate dopamine
you're gonna modulate cognitive
functions that rely on that region of
the brain so the general relationship
between dopamine prefrontal cortex is
clear I've given you one example and
there's you know a whole 50 years worth
of work to show you more but the
intricacies of this association are not
straightforward so if I were to give
everyone in this room 30 milligrams of
methylphenidate ritalin common drug I
may see a quarter of you show cognitive
improvement on particular tasks a
quarter view shows cognitive impairment
and in half of you maybe an all effect
that's interesting right what why is
that well it turns out that the effects
of dopamine on performance are not
linear in fact there's this inverted
u-shaped function or parabolic curve
that defines dopamine's actions in the
prefrontal cortex now this can be seen
at the single unit level if we're
looking at this the spatial tuning of
prefrontal neurons engaged in a working
memory task we see that at good spatial
tuning but in we have too little we see
effect be degraded now importantly this
is also seen at the human cognitive
level so just as the measure of behavior
or neural efficiency beautiful optimal
amount that's performance and on either
end performance begins to tank so what
becomes critical is taking into account
this law of initial value or we're only
knowing that can we predict how
additional dopamine modulation is going
to affect your performance right here on
the curve then you benefit from a
dopamine boost from that good morning
coffee year you've been working well
under under stress both of which are
dopamine I guess
but if you're already optimal then you
don't want any modulation so the natural
question is what does influence dopamine
well I already gave up the ghost and
said genes and in hormones a particular
estrogen but also things like stress and
coffee drugs of abuse like cocaine and
prescription drugs like ritalin so I'm
gonna focus on the first two in this
talk so first a quick note about about
the jeans story and to kind of approach
that topic we need to first zoom into
the level of the synapse and understand
dopamine's by a synthetic and metabolic
pathways so it's released after Mike
talked about the action potential and we
know that neurons communicate by
electrochemical signaling so there's
that the flood of ions down the axon and
then there was a release of chemicals
which as you know from your intra
neuroscience that that cells don't
actually connect there's a small space
in between and it's the the job of
neurotransmitters to relay that
information well so here's the instance
of dopamine it's being relayed in or
released into the synaptic cleft but
there has to be some way for it to get
removed after it's it's done its job and
it turns out in prefrontal cortex the
job of removing dopamine falls to an
enzyme called catechol ohm ethyl
transferase or comped and it's really
important so in the prefrontal cortex
comped accounts for over sixty percent
of all dopamine turnover if we look at
mice who don't express comped they show
increased prefrontal dopamine and
enhanced memory
similarly in humans we can use
particular drugs that inhibit comte
activity and we see of increased Avoca
prefrontal dopamine and enhanced working
memory now just a side note that in
those other dopamine pathways that I
showed you the primary mechanism for
dopamine degradation is something
totally different it falls to the
something called the dopamine our data
dopamine transporter protein so this
comped enzyme is really particularly
crucial for that that maze a cortical
pathway for the frontal lobe and that's
interesting because the gene that codes
for that enzyme is polymorphic so
there's a naturally occurring difference
in the way that gene is structured in
everyone in this room so it's a single
nucleotide polymorphism what that means
is that one of the base pairs is
switched and it's a guanine to adenosine
flip and this is very evolutionarily
recent so this polymorphism is first
observed in humans all animals have the
the G the guanine which is that base
pair difference leads to the amino acid
shift of valine to Metheny and the point
i want to make is that very that sort of
flip fundamentally alters the way the
protein works so an individual so if a
quarter of the population who have this
two copies of this Val Val gene it's a
it's an issue if they're most thermo
stability so that enzyme is physically
physiologically under normal human body
temperatures it's very active so it
clears dopamine from the synaptic cleft
really well and we kind of colloquially
refer to these people as having low
baseline dopamine so there's not a lot
that's left hanging out that's not the
more recent allele again first observed
in humans that enzyme is actually thermo
labile
so it begins to break down it doesn't do
a great job and so dopamine is allowed
to accumulate in the cleft and we sort
of refer to these people as having
increased prefrontal baseline prefrontal
dopamine levels and there's functional
consequences so val/val individuals
actually have worse performance on these
working memory short-term memory type
tasks
and reduced neural efficiency whereas
met/met subjects are a better memory and
better efficiency in terms of neural
response so yeah in general so just if
we were to split this population into
Val Val and Matt net we could see
differences emerge without tweaking the
system at all
so it's interesting and this line of
work is you know at a big picture level
we can see that variation in genes leads
to variation in cognition but clearly
there are many steps in between so we go
from a genetic variation altering how
protein works altering how some neural
circuit works and maybe that bubbles up
to the level of behavior maybe it
doesn't so the point of what we do are
as human cognitive neuroscientist is to
try to look at these endo phenotypes or
intermediate phenotypes and we can probe
brain function to see how genes affect
brain function and maybe behavior but we
can kind of get like an early biomarker
of how that gene is having an effect on
the brain okay so I'm gonna skip quickly
to the realm of endocrinology in a
breath estrogen amplifies dopamine
transmission there's strong evidence in
animals to suggest that estrogen
enhances dopamine synthesis release and
turnover and modifies basal firing rates
of dopaminergic neurons we know that
stimulated dopamine release actually
fluctuates in a rat's estrus cycle and
finally the PFC has amongst the highest
concentration of estrogen receptors in
the human brain
and hormones fluctuate throughout the
menstrual cycle in this very
stereotypical predicted way so esters
bikes to about four times the typical
value record before ovulation so around
day eleven to twelve of a minstrel cycle
so given this fluctuation of estrogen
during the menstrual cycle and given
estrogens ability to promote dopamine
transmission here's what we predicted if
we could get some index of where an
individual lies on that inverted
u-shaped curve we could predict whether
estrogen
was gonna be helpful or harmful so in
order to do that that's that that study
in a series of studies actually this is
kind of a schematic of the experiment we
pre-screened a whole bunch of subjects
from for this comp enzyme it's spitting
into a cup very simple and then we
teased apart the two extreme groups so
the vowel vowels and the met Mets the
low dopamine and the high dopamine and
then we brought them into the lab and we
gave them we tested them on two
occasions so when estrogen levels are
naturally low when estrogen levels are
naturally high and on each occasion we
gave them a battery of cognitive tests
gave them a functional magnetic
resonance imaging scanning while they're
performing different cognitive tasks and
we took blood samples for biomarkers and
this was the prediction that no previous
work they're thought to have decreased
prefrontal dopamine and thus reduced
performance on these very highly
dopamine sensitive tasks whereas met/met
subjects had often with dopamine and
really robust performance now if we
tweak that system and they say to be
more optimal to look like the met/met
subjects if estrogen levels are high but
in the men subjects we'll actually see
the opposite effect that their
performance is best when estrogen levels
are low and they kind of overdosed the
dopamine gets pushed over the edge under
high estrogen conditions so it kind of
alluded to cognitive tasks and
prefrontal prefrontal kind of mechanisms
but I haven't really talked about the
kinds of tasks that we do and I'm not
going to give an example specific
example of what we do in the scanner
because it's sort of long and boring but
I'll give you a kind of
back-of-the-envelope test of what we use
in the field to test working memory or
short-term memory okay so I'm gonna give
you a string of numbers and I want you
to repeat them back to me or you can do
it in your head backwards okay so here
the numbers 2 1 7 3 4 8
is this what you said eight four three
seven one two great so that's working
memory you have to keep information in
mind over a short period of time and
maybe manipulated in some way and that's
a gateway cognitive function for almost
anything you do certain things on a
daily basis here at Google right so
reading a paper and trying to relate one
sentence to the next doing math
calculations in your head that's all
reliant on this really basic cognitive
ability and it's highly sensitive to the
amount of dopamine you have in
prefrontal cortex so I'm gonna cut right
to the chase and so you show you a
couple data slides the first one is just
behavior so how do women perform on this
type of working memory task well it
turns out that if you look at val/val
women solo just naturally low not great
but high so right before ovulation you
see a boost in the interesting and to us
that seemed to be a suggestion that it's
inverted you dopamine response was
actually visible in humans taking into
account estrogen and genotype now I
talked a lot about you know you can run
a gel and you can measure somebody's
genotype for this comped comped gene and
you're either Val or Matt or you're
heterozygous but what happens if we cut
you know sort of leap frog over DNA
altogether and go straight to the source
straight to the enzyme and we can
measure that we can take blood samples
it's a little bit more invasive but we
can measure the active enzyme and we do
that because even within genotypic
groups there's a lot of variance and
that's a whole other discussion of why
that happens but it's really fascinating
the point is that if this model is
correct then I should be able to predict
at an individual level
who's gonna benefit and who's gonna
suffer and the point of this graph is to
show that even at the individual level
we can see this inverted u-shaped curve
pop out
by considering not only estrogen but
active cotton enzyme levels at the time
that of fMRI scanning so now on on to
the brain so again we we did this in the
context of a functional magnetic
resonance imaging or fMRI study in the
data that I'm just gonna show you is
something called a region of interest
analysis so we know exactly what part of
the brain is really important for
working memory so we can essentially
draw a circle around that region it's
task-related region of the brain and
just look at activity mean activity
across that region and compare it
between groups and essentially what we
find is a representation of that
behavioral effect but in terms of neural
activity our bold
from our bold response such that optimal
dopamine groups show a sort of weak
effect in this part of the brain whereas
the more optimal dopamine groups are
really robust effect in this brain while
you're performing the task and
importantly the extent to which any
individual shows this nice robust
activation during the task with
predictive of their performance so we
see that dopamine status predicts PFC
activity which in turn predicts an
individual's performance on this working
memory task
so in summary estrogen improves working
memory in women with genetically low
prefrontal dopamine but impairs
performance in women with naturally high
prefrontal dopamine and we see that this
inverted you dopamine effect is
reflected in behavioral and neural
indices of PFC function so a few
implications first
dopamine's influence on cognition cannot
be fully understood without taking
estrogen into account I argue
second the functional impact of genetic
variation can be explored by a direct
essays of brain function and finally
this kind of loose concept of women's
health can be addressed very
specifically within the central nervous
system and there's actually a really
great addition in Scientific American
mind is talking all about this this his
in her brain okay and a final slide why
should we care I think Mike and I both
get our our armchair points of talking
about this at the end
often in neuroscience sex is something
to be controlled for or scientists
leapfrog over the matter altogether by
studying only males of a species to make
that point clear colleagues at Berkeley
recently indexed all studies and mammals
published in 2009 across ten fields in
over 40 journals and they found a
widespread bias towards using only male
animals the effect was especially
striking in neuroscience where the ratio
of male only to female only studies was
5.5 to 1 now there's a logic to that
it's it's cheaper you don't have to
track things like females menstrual
cycle so there is some rationale to that
but the interesting thing is that this
bias was largest in neuroscience
pharmacology and physiology fields for
which the basic science research has
huge implications for human health if we
only study male species we're gonna miss
out on a few things is what I'm trying
to argue sex differences are repeatedly
found for rates of depression
vulnerability to stress pain Parkinson's
disease ADHD in nearly all aspects of
drug abuse from acquisition to treatment
we know that enormous endocrine changes
happen during menopause but we know
relatively little from a human
neuroscience perspective about how this
normal aging process affects specific
neuro chemical and cognitive systems
according to the news one day estrogen
is good for you in the next day it's bad
for you so yes it's a messy problem I
think the good ones always are but the
problem gets thrown into relief only
after it's subjected to careful
scientific study so hopefully we'll will
continue to do that and understand a
little bit more but in general hormones
and in genes play an interesting role in
terms of brain function I hope I've
convinced you of that today thank you
and late Mike thank you for fantastic
really exciting perspective on things I
just like to open up the floor to
questions and I'll extend it to the
patient people on VC first just to see
does anyone on VC have a question last
chance all right I'll come back to you
anyone in the room thanks both those
were both really great talks I have a
question for Michael first it looks like
he used opto genetics to stimulate the
acetylcholine yeah exactly so that has
really great timing patterns have you
guys looked at all of that the effects
of when you stimulate does it really
matter
so but this you know coin release a it
works a little different so usually
timing is very important for neurons and
the exact kind of timing of assimilation
you give them really affects how they
fire sto Konya is a little different in
that respect in that it's when the
neurons release the seal coin they
release in this kind of bulk way it goes
all over kind of extracellular space and
takes a long time to clear so the term
the effect is much more kind of it's
like spread out in time basically and so
I looked a little basically what I found
is when the light is on the effect is
there when I turn it off it goes away
relatively quickly it's not
instantaneous so giving shorter pulses
it new attendant just not activated all
I kind of had to give like a longer
continuous pulse one other question so
it looks like you recording v1 to see
the effect did you have a particularly
hypothesis it should be there do you
expect it to be in most parts of the
brain it's probably gonna be all over
the at least a sensory neocortex and it
also projects to the prefrontal cortex
but it you know it's just we don't
really know what's going on there
I picked the visual cortex just because
we have pretty good models of what's
happening in terms of sensory processing
already so it makes it much easier to
interpret the results Thanks
yeah so um I mean in my study I didn't
look at the heterozygotes which
represent 50% of the population because
I wanted to look at the extremes and see
the effect but in studies that do
include them you find basically that
they fall right down the middle so it's
interesting because there's this another
group led by Danny Weinberger at the NIH
who studies the effects of drugs and you
can actually in pharmacogenomic studies
you can predict the effect of a dopamine
drug he's used I believe methylphenidate
and amphetamine you can predict the
effect of that drug based on comp
genotype so you see improved both neural
efficiency in terms of FM Reinbold and
also improved performance in val/val
subjects slightly improved performance
in heterozygotes and actually impaired
performance in met/met subjects super
interesting I mean it speaks to the fact
that we you know at least in theory
could begin to do individualized
medicine and this is kind of one example
I was wondering for people who had too
much dopamine did you notice like
increased anxiety so I measured a sort
of state and trait anxiety level so
during the day of the scan because we
really wanted to control for that now
it's an interesting point you bring up
because people say well now obviously
met Matt's the best right you know they
better work memory like we should just
figure out who they are and hire them
all at Google or something but it's not
quite that simple I mean the reason we
have both genotypes is you know it could
be the studio effect but in fact meant
met subjects have increased rates of
anxiety so it's hard to say that you
know there's there's a better or worse
it's just different it depends on what
your measuring stick is did you look at
serotonin as well as I didn't I didn't
but that would be fascinating next next
five years of my life
justice it it's a simple question what's
the prevalence of the two alleles yeah
so they're codominant so about 25% of
the population are Val Val about 25% are
met/met in my sample it was slightly
less I think I had about 20% where Matt
met and again 50% are heterozygotes and
yes of course I genotype myself so when
my estrogen levels are high forget about
it question for Michael you're talking
about how the brain effectively feeds
sort of top-down abstract concepts into
say visual perception the computers lack
I presume that sort of develops during
growth as a baby's brain bootstraps
these concepts to a high level yeah so
it's not known exactly how that happens
what seems to happen is is that the
cortex count develops hierarchically
kind of moving up so like the earliest
areas develop first like the primary
visual cortex for example that first
level of visual cortex it's very early
in development when it when it kind of
you know 2 or 3 years of age and a human
while the prefrontal cortex is still
kind of developing you know even
teenagers come early 20s are still kind
of developing their prefrontal cortex so
it seems like the cortex is kind of
getting progressively trained like in a
hierarchical fashion what do you think
would benefit from trying to sort of do
the same sort of yes I think it could be
so I mean in some ways it's a very
different strategy of computing and and
I think for doing the types of things
that computers are currently good at I
think it's not going to be very useful
but for doing kinds of things that
humans are good at I think it will be
very useful so it's not I think I almost
be like a different type of computer
totally speculating here but I think it
will be good at the kinds of like object
recognition type tasks and in less good
had kind of you know serial hopes
straightforward tasks
I have a quick question for both of you
but I'm having a really hard time
resisting hating you guys for being both
brilliant and beautiful peoples and it's
with all of these findings we get closer
and closer to larger questions of can we
control and should we control these
things
to enhance our own abilities perhaps
there's a better way from just
understanding or biorhythms or perhaps
healthier ways of addressing better
releases for either dopamine or
acetylcholine but I was just curious
from both of you what your perspectives
are on those things so I think the first
kind of priority is to figure out cases
in which these systems are working
incorrectly you know in neurological
diseases and fix those first then comes
the question was like okay we developed
this you know way of kind of
manipulating the acetylcholine system in
order to help people also iris disease
turns out you can kind of give yourself
you know a little boost on test day
should you do it now that's kind of like
a question for a bio a thing I'm a hot
to answer it my I guess I'd say yes
under certain circumstances but I think
that the circumstances are tricky I mean
this is kind of the question that always
that we always get especially with this
the calm genotype you know the important
point is that I mean I talked today
about one single single and nucleotide
polymorphism right but there are you
know an infinite number in the brain and
in the like neural regions genes don't
operate in isolation right they all work
together and they're part of this larger
system so you know until we can
understand how what really that the
ultimate good is like what is the best
it's not just met met genotype it's Matt
Matt genotype plus you know d1 receptor
polymorphism of it you know it's like
gonna be a whole concert and so we're
just literally you know scraping the
type top of the iceberg off when we ask
these questions so I mean maybe that's a
cop-out answer because all scientists
say we have to know more we have to know
more whereas the general public says
where can i buy the drug
so at some point well we're gonna have
to confront these questions pretty soon
I'll extend the invitation to VC anyone
out there with the question all right
well thank you so much you've given us a
lot to think about and be inspired by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
