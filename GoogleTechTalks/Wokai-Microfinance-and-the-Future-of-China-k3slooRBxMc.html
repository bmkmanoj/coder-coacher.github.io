familiar with microfinance and then how
many of you have spent time in urban
China
what about rural China a few okay so
today I'm going to be speaking about
microfinance and the role that it will
play in the future of China say twenty
to thirty years from now I'll start by
introducing you to flee agent one of the
entrepreneurs that we're supporting in
rural stitch one and the model that
we're using it will Chi then we'll take
a look at microfinance
globally and why this all started and
finally we'll look at China today and
how microfinance will play a role in
shaping the China that we see in 2030 so
first let me start by introducing you to
foo ya June via Juden I was working a
number of years ago as a day laborer and
she worked 16 hour days seven days a
week with her husband just to get enough
food on the table for her two sons they
were lucky enough a number of years ago
to start working on a mushroom farm
where they began learning the mushroom
trade and after a few years they were
able to save up enough to start their
own mushroom business
they worked hard waking up at 4 a.m.
every day and we're eventually able to
reach a point where they were
consistently selling out their mushrooms
at the market but they had a problem
they while they were doing well in their
business they weren't able to scale to a
point where they were able to
significantly enough increase their
income to earn enough to send their
children to school and so she was lucky
enough to find out about our field
partner on the ground that all only
distributed loans for people like we are
June but also provided training and
support to help them in their businesses
she took out a $600 loan to buy some raw
materials and scalar business and that
was about a year and a half ago so far
over the last two years since we
launched we've supported about four
hundred and sixteen entrepreneurs like
we a tune in inner mongolia and sichuan
to start the process of either building
or scaling their businesses
and lifting themselves and their
families out of poverty how it works is
we connect contributors around the world
directly with bars and world China you
donate capital it goes step are on the
ground you track track their progress as
they build their business and once
they've repaid you redistributed it to
someone new so that they can start a
business so essentially you're building
your own investment fund in rural
Sichuan or Inner Mongolia over in the
next five years we hope they use this
model to support tens of thousands of
entrepreneurs in rural China to start
small businesses and lift themselves and
their families out of poverty so how
does woke I fit into microfinance around
the world we're actually a very small
player in a much larger microfinance
sector globally the person person--
model that we use was pioneered by a
group named Kiva that so far over the
last five years has helped over 230,000
borrowers in 54 countries around the
world most recently in the United States
to start their own small businesses
person-to-person models like eben Wilk I
fall into a much larger group of funders
in Glu include multilaterals like the
World Bank and the IFC banks like
Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley and
investment funds doing equity and debt
investments on the other side you have
microfinance institutions that are the
guys on the ground screening borrowers
delivering loans and supporting people
to start their own small businesses and
these guys range from small nonprofits
with a few hundred clients to for
profits with millions of clients so why
did all of these institutions develop
and why is microfinance important
essentially microfinance is one of the
only tools that bridges the for-profit
sector and traditional poverty
alleviation it creates opportunities in
a scalable way for people to lift
themselves out of poverty which before a
microfinance we really rarely saw it's
just been amazing to see how
microfinance has taken off over the last
35 years back in 1976 my
finance was basically a crazy guy with
an idea $27 and forty two women in
Bangladesh and over the last 35 years
it's grown to over a hundred and fifty
two million clients around the world so
why should we care about microfinance in
the context of China what's amazing
about microfinance is that it starts
with one person and for me personally I
learned the answer to this question
through getting to know one of my
friends in Beijing
Chuang Miao is a 22 year old migrant
worker from rural China and heilongjiang
province up near the Russian border I
got to know her about four years ago
when I started frequenting a restaurant
where she was working 16-hour days seven
days a week at that time she was
basically stuck with this glass ceiling
she could either work in a restaurant go
and work in construction or work in a
factory but either way she wouldn't be
able to increase her income past about a
hundred and twenty five dollars a month
and you know that was true for now at 22
but it would be true 10 20 30 years down
the line so we had the idea that if I
could teach her English maybe she could
go get a job in a hotel or Starbucks and
break that glass ceiling she was making
a lot of progress and one day I went to
her to do our class and she sat me down
and she basically said look I love what
we're doing but the reality is that in
about four years I'm gonna have to move
back to the countryside and get married
and there's nothing that we can do to
change that situation you're like my
older sister here in Beijing and the
best that you can do for me is to be
just that and you know that struck me
because sitting on the other side of the
sofa from trend Miao I knew that the
only difference between her and I was
that you know she was born to her family
and in rural China and I was born the
family I was in Oakland California and
you know as much as I wanted to help her
there was nothing that I could do to
change that situation and most likely
for the rest of her life join me I was
going to be stuck in
cycle of poverty when we think about
China we usually think about a booming
economy and you know the skylines of
Beijing and Shanghai what we often don't
see is they're about 120 million migrant
workers just like 20 out who are stuck
with that glass ceiling of poverty
that's about four and every 10 Americans
on top of that if we take a look at
rural China you have a situation where
there are over 700 million people which
is equivalent to about the population of
the EU and the United States combined
who are living on an average of $2 a day
that's 1/7 the amount of their urban
counterparts and it's important to kind
of look at the historical context of
this where in China 30 years ago
everyone was basically equal so this
inequality has completely developed over
the last 30 years and so I thought I
would end by taking a look back on what
happened to fujian as you remember she
took tout that six hundred dollar loan
to scale up her mushroom business she
was able to successfully build that
business and repay our loan is with
interest increasing your income and
supporting her family now she took out a
second loan to further build her
business that was funded by myself and
19 other contributors on will kai
according to her projections in the next
three to five years she'll be able to
reach a point where her family will be
permanently changed in terms of their
financial situation in their future
trajectory her two sons are going to be
able to go to school and they're going
to be on a completely different
trajectory from join me I'll back in
Beijing you know when we look at China
into the future we're kind of at a fork
where we're gonna go one of one of two
ways you know either this gap is going
to continue to grow to a point where it
basically becomes irreversible
and more of more than half of the
population gets stuck in a permanent
cycle of poverty we're gonna have to
make a change and begin reversing this
cycle tools like microfinance in other
ways empowering people to build their
own rural economies are going to be key
in this process
thank you guys for coming out today if
you have any questions feel free to ask
them now or email me at Casey Wilson at
whoa Qaeda or can you help so there
there are many ways that you can help
through what I specifically one way that
you can help is you know going online
and sponsoring a loan it can be with as
little as $25 another way you can help
is I mean with you guys all being on
engineers here at Google we always
appreciate development support we have
about 200 volunteers around the world
both in our chapters holding events
giving speeches in 15 cities around the
world including here in the Bay Area as
well as volunteers doing everything from
engineering to online marketing and then
finally just helping spread the word
simply like you know putting in your
facebook status update or telling your
friends about what I we completely
depend on viral marketing to grow our
outreach so those are all great
questions to answer your first question
of how do we decide we loan to basically
our model is that we try to find the
best microfinance institutions in China
that are that have strong track records
that have a strong impact on poverty
alleviation transparent management teams
and the desire in the capacity to scale
say from 3,000 borrowers today to 50,000
in the next few
and so we do rigorous due diligence on
them doing five-day on-site do diligence
trips and once we partner with them we
go on the ground every three months and
we assume that if they pass those those
evaluations they're the best ones to
choose their clients they really know
the local context the local markets and
so we kind of rely on them to select the
borrower's they're also maintaining
99.5% and above on timer payment rates
so they've really refined the idea of
kind of screening those clients so to
answer your second question about women
this actually kind of falls into your
both of our partners we have two
partners right now one in Inner Mongolia
and one in Sichuan both of them started
out using the Grameen model that was
started by Professor Muhammad Yunus in
Bangladesh and that model is based off
of serving women and using the group
guaranty system where basically five
people come together each guaranteeing
each other's loans if one person doesn't
repay the other four have to step in to
repay that person's loan and it's worked
incredibly well with our partner and
then rangoli a-- they serve only women
it really helps the women social status
like a lot of the borrower's we've seen
you know started out and they were at
the lowest level of the social hierarchy
in their village and slowly moved up and
like one movement woman I met you know
ended up being the mayor of her local
village and so it both helps the terms
repayment because they're most much more
likely to you know not gamble not drink
or do out or do drugs and then also to
use the income to support their families
and that not to mention how it helps
their social status and then looking at
our partner in sin it's the population
so different so in Inner Mongolia it's
basically desert and so you live in a
village where you'll have like a hundred
people that you'll exist with for your
whole life and sich one your only you
know ten kilometers away from a town
with about 10,000 people and so you have
people who kind of coming and going a
lot more and a lot more density of
population and so they're men and women
usually work together and their
businesses and so they found that it
really wasn't that much more effective
to serve women versus serving men and
because they're not as isolated that
idea of kind of gender call
our inequality wasn't this big of a deal
and so they just decided to open up to
serving both men and women and so it was
just interesting to see like how much
the geography and the culture really
determines what model works best and
then just expanding out of China I think
for us like our focus was really China I
mean on one hand you have you know 200
million people living on a lesson dollar
25 a day and so there's a lot that still
needs to be done in China and with
China's microfinance sector there about
20 years behind countries like India
Bangladesh countries in Latin America
there's a lot that needs to be done on
that side on the other side you know
there's just this massive population
around the world of people that are
connected to China whether they're you
know Chinese living outside of mainland
China maybe they've lived in China
studying in China or you know people in
China's major cities and so we're
focusing on China but there are other
organizations doing many other countries
Kiva that organization I mentioned is
doing person-to-person microfinance
throughout Latin America Africa and
Southeast Asia and then their
microfinance institutions now almost
anywhere in the world they even started
recently in Los Angeles in San Francisco
two questions first one is how common is
a microfinance Center or sectors in
China on second one years who mentioned
the status of 99.9 percent oh yeah great
so how is that compare with the world
could you repeat that first question
first question is how common is it you
can find on microfinance in China oh
that's that's a great question um it's
really interesting because China has the
second largest microcredit demand in the
world basically almost no supply of
microfinance and that's for a few
reasons one is because it started much
later in China it started in China in
the mid 90s as opposed to say Bangladesh
where it's started in the mid 70s the
other reason is just because of the
development of the financial sector more
generally you know over the last even
the last ten years you've been going
from base
state-owned banks to a growing kind of
private financial sector but it just
hasn't penetrated to the point where
it's gotten to the actual pour and so
because of that the entire say nonprofit
microfinance sector in China is about
two hundred million dollars large if we
compare that with India the first
largest microcredit demand market in the
world they have a microfinance sector of
four billion and another comparison is I
was recently in Colombia this summer and
I think the Colombian population and
please forgive me if this is wrong as
around 50 million people and they have a
microfinance sector that is four billion
dollars large so fifty million people in
four billion compared to you know 1.3
billion and 200 million so it's almost
non-existent
but hopefully will develop pretty
quickly over the next few years so over
the past few years I think there are
about four or five major the
peer-to-peer lending websites in China
like the the equivalent like the zone of
prosperity in the u.s. hmm so how do you
compare this peer-to-peer Linde website
with the with this or the world can I
see that on your side you said that the
source of the sound meaning comes from
the donations is because of the charity
finance regulations and so before
compared with the donation with the
income of the norm so the incentive is
different so how do we compare there is
two kind of company that's a great
question so in China over the last few
years as you mentioned the kind of
person a person financing sector has
been emerging pretty quickly and you
basically have about three camps you
have some groups that are doing online
and offline person-to-person lending
models where say you or I go online we
set up our loan requests for our
business or for some other reason and
then someone else goes on and funds our
loan interest rates for those loans can
be anywhere between you know eighteen
and twenty plus percent and so that's
kind of the most traditional for-profit
sense of person
person lending and so they have those
boats online as well as offline because
for China finance is very difficult
companies can't lend to companies and
even banks have regulations on who
they're allowed to lend to and so
there's this kind of loophole in the
regulations where individual lending is
legal and so from the for-profit side
organizations are kind of popping up
where for you know for-profit individual
loans it's a great way to get into the
financial sector so that would be one
circle there's another group that's
doing student loans and so connecting
individuals with individual students so
that they can get loans to go to college
and then finally we're the only
organization that does enables and
people internationally get to get
involved with microfinance on the ground
we've had one organization that was
doing more of the traditional prosper
type for-profit individual lending
that's done a little bit in the
microfinance fear they charge interest
and are only working with people
domestically I have a question from New
York can you hear me yeah sorry it's
like from the void God is speaking I'm
just kidding so first of all I just want
to say this is so cool and I just heard
about you today even though I've been in
lending you know peer-to-peer
microfinance for quite a while so I'll
definitely be investing I think on your
website in fact I just I just came back
two weeks ago from a fellowship with
Kiva in Costa Rica and my question is we
with Kiva one of the questions that that
I always fought with with microfinance
is you know like how big of an impact
are we actually making like on an
economic level like quantitatively right
it's a very difficult thing to measure
when you consider all the different
variables and so one thing that Kiva is
trying to do it while I was there in
Costa Rica as we were doing making our
best effort attempt to measure
the social impact of these loans right
so you mentioned that one of your loners
is now like the mayor of her village or
something and I saw a lot of cases like
that too when I was in Costa Rica
working with Kiva so I was curious your
approach to this economic and social
measurement problem because it seems to
be that you're not there yet in China
but as microfinance markets get very
crowded like as you mentioned in
Colombia
I think Bangladesh is certainly reaching
this point it becomes very difficult for
you know like microfinance companies
competing against each other and kind of
causing like maybe even an adverse
effect in the marketplace where you know
like two microfinance institutes are
competing for loans for the same person
you know like and and then the quality
of these loans slowly approaches like
loan shark status like you see this a
lot in I don't know if you've read it
but the case is in Poland for example or
getting really bad in this area so
coming back you know what is your
approach to making sure you're measuring
the social and economic impact of these
loans appropriately and what do you see
you know going forward in China like how
do you see that market evolving uh
excuse me that's a great question for us
that's still a challenge anecdotally I
would say that we get we get qualitative
updates every quarter from our borrowers
and at least eighty percent of them are
using their income to send their
children to school and see you can
qualitatively see that impact one thing
we'd like to add is ways of kind of in a
more numerical way of measuring that
impact and seeing it not just over a
year but kind of cross sectionally over
time and honestly we're actually
learning from one of our field partners
on that they're they've been really
engaged in the idea of setting up their
own social impact measurements
and so what we're going to be doing is
working with them to see how they're
driving that initiative and working to
scale that out to our other partners but
also the idea that you brought up again
of kind of the loan shark community and
and competition on the financial sector
side of things is really interesting in
China you're having the situation where
the government is kind of hastily trying
to support the development of
microfinance knowing how important it is
to enable more financing for rural
economies and small to medium
enterprises and so what they did was
they set up the ability for individuals
to set up microcredit companies
so basically lending companies and the
idea was that this would be an answer to
microfinance and what happened was it
was in pilot stage for about two years
where it was just about 12 institutions
throughout the country doing this and
then they opened up in May of 2008 to
local governments to allow these
licenses and between May and August it
grew from these 12 institutions to about
1500 throughout the country which on one
hand sounded really exciting but in
reality what happened was people use
this ability to get these licenses and
then provide basically very lucrative
for-profit rural loans of you know
anywhere from about $10,000 but usually
closer to $25,000 to over a hundred
thousand two hundred thousand three
hundred thousand dollars and so there's
been you know really interesting kind of
debate over the last six months about a
lot of reactions negatively to
microfinance whether they're talking
about how they're not serving the poor
or it's Ussery or even kind of critiques
on on Kiva and I think it's part of a
really good negative kind of we were in
this honeymoon stage where when Muhammad
Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize
everyone thought microfinance in itself
and just the term was the blanket answer
to poverty and I think what we're
realizing is that
microfinance isn't made equal and you
could provide a loan that's basically
like acting like a loan shark to a
client or you could really support them
to lift themselves from poverty and that
you kind of have to define those things
so social metrics of measuring that'll
be really important for us and for
microfinance generally in the future
Thanks
thank you couple questions so one is a I
went to your website it's mostly English
based do you have any plan to expand to
non-english space because China is
growing very fast a lot of wealthy
Chinese population on the East Coast
part of China so how would you what's
your business plan of involving them to
make donations and second question is I
noticed you said there's a lot of field
agent kind of write-up updates and seems
like a lot of manual labor
how would you expand in a business sense
to cover more regions so far you covered
in the Mongolia and swine there's other
region China or other parts of the world
how does that if it's more
labor-intensive how does that process
more scalable that's those are two great
questions
one two I guess to answer your first
question we do have a Chinese version of
our site and we need to make a better we
need to do a better job of making it
clear that you can just click and it all
turns into Chinese so that's good
feedback and but kind of to answer the
larger sense of your question when we
first started we really want to have a
China helps China model where eventually
it was people in China City supporting
people in the countryside and bridging
the rural urban divide and what we
discovered about four months into it was
that being an international nonprofit we
couldn't fundraise in China and so we
thought okay well let's take a step back
and first prove out our model with
international donors before launching in
the China market and having kind of a
proof of concept and about a year ago we
really took off in the Chinese media we
were in this Beijing News Daily
newspaper they got picked up by Sina
calm and with
24 hours we went from 200 visitors a day
to 10,000 and then we ran everything
from Phoenix TV to CCTV to China's Vogue
and Marie Claire and it was just amazing
to see how passionate kind of young
urban professionals in China's major
cities are about this model and so now
like kind of you asked about our future
plans we're actively looking for a
partner that we can work with to launch
in the China contributor market and you
know when we look into the future of
work I I think the majority of our
contributors will be coming from
mainland China and then to answer your
second question about kind of the
provinces we're operating in and is this
model scalable I would say yeah so our
field partners on the ground that are
the ones that are doing these profiles
posting them online and then it's our
role to translate them and and do kind
of quality control so from our end we
depend on volunteer translators and so
that side of things is pretty scalable
from our field partners and it is pretty
scalable as well and the reason for that
is if they were going to say access debt
capital to expand their loan portfolio
they might be paying say 2 to 3 percent
interest and given that the time cost it
per loan for these profiles and the
updates and whatnot it cost maybe about
0.5% and so for them it still is
something that is worth it for them to
take the time to do it and then finally
to kind of answer your question about
expanding provincially once we start the
process of getting to a higher level of
scale in terms of our contribution
volumes online will definitely be
actively working to find good partners
and more provinces and so our
bottlenecks on that side is just finding
enough good nonprofits to work with on
the ground
that can kind of pass our due diligence
and have the ability to scale with our
capital thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
