you rich for the introduction and also
thank you to google for letting me come
to talk about my research I really
appreciate that it's a lot of fun and
I'd also like to just quickly thank
Dalhousie University and Halifax Nova
Scotia Canada my institution for the
great support they give me it studying
the impact that the internet and the
world wide web actually has on things
like our culture and our society in
particular on religion so thank you also
to Dalhousie University now the talk
today is called turning cyberspace into
sacred space in it my my focus of
research is really looking at how people
are using the religion are using the
Internet to do religion on the internet
it's a very particular type of study but
I'll start out just talking about it
generally this is an article that was in
the local paper a little while ago by
jaunt a tree I thought it was very
fitting since I'm at Google that I would
bring up this article he did on my
research he called the googling for God
and basically he wanted to know about
the impact that the internet and the
world wide web actually has on religion
and people's religious beliefs and
religious practices and it's a very
broad phenomena at its most basic level
we know that when people want
information nowadays when they want to
get information about something whether
it's about you know the writing a paper
for university or they're taking a trip
to South America they turn to the
Internet to try and find their answers
and what's interesting we've seen now is
that when people have religious
questions they're also turning to the
internet to look for their answers and
that's having a huge impact on things
like religious authority and information
seeking behavior when it comes to
religious practices historically they
would have to talk to a priest or they
would have to go to a temple or they
would have to somehow talk to a
specialist and they don't anymore now
they can go into the internet and that's
really changing a lot of the religious
environment in our contemporary society
but what I'm particularly interested in
is how people do religion on the
Internet in particular how they're using
that technology to facilitate religious
practices now just to put it in context
I'm religion on the internet is an
enormous phenomena if we look at the DM
0 Z or Google's open directory project
looking at the number of websites
dedicated to religion and spirituality
you can see there's about 110,000 it's
usually between about 100 710 and
religion and spirituality is a
subsection of the society group so it's
just a subsection
of the society group but in the entire
science group combined so all the
websites on the world wide web dealing
with science there's only about 102 or
104,000 so we have more websites dealing
with religion and spirituality than with
science which shows you how prolific
religion is on the internet at time
warner did a study in 1996 and they're
sort of looking at the entry or the
world wide web was an interesting
phenomena and they started to look at
the types of sites that were showing up
and they found there were three times as
many websites concerning religion and
spirituality than there were concerning
sex so right off the bat you can see
there's a lot of sites dealing with
religion now the interesting thing
though is that this doesn't actually
tell us what these sites are for or how
they're being used so I'll I'm going to
focus a talking and looking at how
people actually use this medium to do
religion and the best way to do that is
really to start from the beginning wait
you guys recognize this the super
computer you know of the 70s and the 80s
there when we talked about religion on
the Internet to understand really how it
appeared there and how it started to to
function you have to go to the start and
and that really happened with the
development of the modem program right
when people when the modem was developed
and people could have public access to
the internet system religion appeared
online and that was very interesting
because most academics and most people
studying religion thought that religion
was disappearing a religion was slowly
leaving sort of the public sphere and as
people became more technological or more
scientific or more modern there would be
less religious but we see in the very
first use of modem the very first
bulletin board systems we see people
talking about religion so this shows us
that these computer hobbyist these
people that were very advanced very
scientific advance technologically for
their time we're still talking about
religion and using the Internet to talk
about religion and it actually got to
the point that in 1983 and the early
usenet system people started to complain
about the amount of religion that was
occurring on the internet I remember
reading some of these posts and there
was one complaint someone said you know
I have to sift through God knows how
many but doesn't care articles on
religion every single day so 1983 very
early in the Usenet system hundreds of
posts are
are dealing with religion at this time
and there was a real debate on usenet
trying to determine if religion should
have its own group because people were
paying for this service some people
didn't want to read about religion or
didn't want to you know engage in that
type of dialogue but there was a big
debate over whether religion should have
its own group and it was started in
February of 1983 they decided to have a
separate group for religion and people
started to use this environment to talk
about religion and to share their
religious beliefs and to engage in
religious based dialogue now although it
was a an area for talking about religion
it wasn't really a religious environment
if anything if you express your beliefs
if you expressed your personal feelings
about religion you're really exposing
yourself to a lot of ridicule into a lot
of criticism and often you'd have to
defend yourself against an onslaught of
people challenging what you believed and
it could be a very difficult thing to do
when you're talking about faith based
dialogues have to defend yourself
against an onslaught of criticism so
even though they're talking about
religion it's not really a religious
based environment and we see that within
about a week after the religion usenet
had developed enormous numbers of flame
wars started to happen in this
environment a lot of tension this is one
of the early ones I think it's a very
interesting one and that some of the
early Christian members of the Usenet
group started to complain to the Jewish
people saying you know we accept the the
Old Testament as being accurate you know
sacred scripture so why don't you accept
the New Testament you know it's only
fair you know we accepted your
Testaments yours sacred scriptures you
should accept ours and it really
escalated in it it got very
controversial and I like the way it
ended with someone from the Jewish
community is participating on the system
he said while we are civilly considering
what Jews do not accept the so-called
New Testament why don't we also consider
why Christians don't accept the later
revelation the Book of Mormon for
example surely everyone is always
interested in the latest update on the
Holy Word or don't you all have a
loose-leaf Bible it's so enormous amount
of tension occurring in these
environments and it I should like to the
point that I think a lot of people were
afraid to share their beliefs afraid to
share their their religious concerns in
these environments where they had to
defend them and it was actually the
Jewish members of
usenet that said that if they wanted an
area where they could really talk about
their faith and they could share their
faith and they could express their
religious beliefs openly they needed a
separate system they needed their own
usenet group just for talking about
Judaism and they put forth the argument
in in early nineteen eighty four that
they should have a separate section
called net religion Jewish and there was
a lot of controversy because using that
it's expanding people are paying for
this service they don't know should
there be all these separate groups or
not but they made a very good argument
they said that basically there has to be
a safe area we can talk where criticism
of Jews for being Jews would not be
welcome so let's create a safe area we
can talk about our faith and talk about
our practice and in many ways by arguing
for their own online community they were
arguing for their own online identity
you know where they could have a safe
environment to express themselves from
all over the globe certainly a people in
diaspora could come together now in this
new network and they did get permission
to start net religion Jewish in February
of 1984 and very quickly this became a
very engaging environment where people
could share their faith and they could
express their feelings and they could
talk without any fear of being
criticized or any flame wars breaking
out now although there was some tension
over you know between the conservative
and the Orthodox and reformed members of
the Jewish tradition on the Usenet for
the most part it was a very dynamic
environment where people were really
free to share and it got to the point
that a lot of other traditions saw how
how beautiful this place was for talking
about religion and they tried to copy it
the Buddhist members of the Usenet group
and the pagans and the some of the
wicked groups also petitioned for their
separate usenet network but because the
system is getting so big they were all
declined but about a year and a half
later the Christian group got its own
network so they were actually ended up
being three religion Usenet groups that
dot religion which is just sort of
general discussion about religion net
jewish and the net religion christian or
yeah doc christian where four people in
the christian community and again as
soon as they had a separate group for
the christian people on the usenet
network people really started to share
faith they really started to express
themselves they would
qwest prayer and interestingly enough
again this is 1985 so it's very early
when people would sign off on their post
even though they were from Bell Labs or
some of these great universities where
their cutting-edge technology is being
used in the Internet medium they would
still express a lot of faith they'd sign
off you know in Christ or God bless you
and may the spirit be with you and there
was no fear of any repercussions for
expressing their faith in this
environment now as far as doing religion
on the internet goes at this time a lot
of people going into this network we're
doing things like asking for prayers
prayer support prayer requests talking
about their faith but it was limited it
is a text-based interaction it is a
bulletin board and and some people maybe
for doing religion that's not
necessarily a good way of expressing
their religious belief so they were
limited when they tried to do religion
on the internet but with with the
religious sort of desire to use this
technology for religious purposes the
environment did change fairly quickly
and people sort of show excuse me
socially shape the technology so that it
could meet their religious needs which
is a very fascinating thing instead of
letting the medium limit them in the way
that they could communicate in the way
that they could do religion they
actually altered the medium a little bit
so that they could use it for religion
and then they altered their beliefs a
little bit so that they could somehow
incorporate that technology and we see
things like this early online ritual
which was actually facilitated by north
of North adducts priest a minister for
IRC so people could login at the same
time synchronistic Lee from all over
North America in this case also from
Australia New Zealand and they could
actually participate in an online ritual
I think it uses technology to do a
ritual and there was a facilitator there
was a priest in charge and people would
log in you could lurk but he encouraged
people to actually take part in the
ritual itself where they would meet
different people would do different
parts of the service and then they would
share and there would be prayers and it
would be quiet time and then sharing it
was actually quite an interesting
structured ritual so people could get
together online and actually do religion
again that the technology itself may not
have been created for that if you think
about it you know the internet wasn't
when people envisioned it I don't think
they thought that this was for doing
religion but people wanted to do
religion on this me
so they certainly developed it for that
purpose and with the great renaming in
the late 1980s and early 1990s when they
use that system sort of opened up for
more groups and the alternative Alta
network was developed that there could
be a lot more groups religion just
exploded it completely exploded into
this medium where we get hundreds of
groups tens of thousands of postings
each year and this is the 1990s you know
where gopher you know you're trying to
find out if the library has a book and
it's going to take you a half hour on
your dial up modem to find out you could
have caught the bus down and checked
yourself but it was fun to use you know
the internet so these are computer
hobbyists it's sort of awkward
technology still at this time and you
had tens of thousands of postings each
year dealing with religion and so
fascinating expansion and with the
development of the World Wide Web then
it's no surprise that all this sort of
religious activity quickly seeped into
the world wide web and and exploded in
religious representation on the world
wide web really took off very quickly
and again as I said earlier Time Warner
found in 1996 three times as many sites
concerning religion and spirituality
than there were concerning sex so
prolifically expands into the world wide
web and in the world wide web in the
early web we actually find that some of
the best websites made were made by
religious organizations so something
like the Scientology website are the
Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day
saints are the Vatican they created
these enormous great websites very early
on on the World Wide Web to talk about
religion or at least to share their
religious beliefs the Vatican site is a
good example of a very advanced website
for its time it was actually hosted on
three supercomputers that they named
Raphael Gabriel and Michael so its
enormous complex environment beautifully
done available in six languages and just
an absolutely incredible website that
gives you any sort of information you
would want to know about Catholicism
their teaching their beliefs or dogmas
anything you want but they did a mistake
in some ways or at least someone like
zalenski an early researcher of the
internet environment said that they they
did something interesting and that there
are no bulletin boards on this website
there are no chat rooms on this website
you can't email someone you can't
request the Pope to pray for you can't
use this technology
in any sort of interactive way so if
people wanted to do religion in that
environment they're really limited all
they can do is get information and what
most people want to do religion they
want more than just information they
don't just want to be receiving
information about a belief system
actually want to be engaging the city of
the belief and and somehow participating
in it so this is certainly limited and
that it's one-to-many communication good
way to think it would be like a
hierarchy you know top-down
communication to the world below instead
of interactive many-to-many
communication which was what the
internet was really designed for so
although it's limited again if people
want to use this technology to do
religion they're going to shape it so
that it can meet their religious needs
and a good example that at this time is
someone like Mark pecci and some of you
may be familiar with him he was a
co-creator of the virtual reality
modeling language so he had a huge
impact on the world wide web as we know
it today I mean he's also a techno pagan
he's a neo-pagan that believes that
religion can happen over the Internet
and that cyberspace is sacred space and
he did develop a number of online
rituals to be conducted actually on the
world wide web and these are two of them
that he did for religious purposes in
1994 he did a celebration at cyber
cement and then when his friend died he
did what he called the long night at
ye'll ritual that he used the internet
so that he could do this religious
activity and the way he did that is he
actually set up computers in different
directions of his room in different
areas and people logged in from all over
the world participated in the ritual
that everyone had parts and they did a
very complex ceremony but for them it
was a very authentic form of religious
practice and you can see that they
actually socially shaped the technology
so that it could meet their religious
needs but then they also had to adapt
their religion a bit so that it could be
used in this environment but a good
merging sort of can happen in these
online rituals and we see that very
early on in a lot of the wicked and
neo-pagan and techno pagan groups that
they actually believe that you can do
ritual on the internet and we start to
see a lot of websites opening up and
allowing for that so unlike the Vatican
a number of organized religious
traditions some groups start to allow
for people to interact and allow for
people to develop online
ritual areas this is a good example this
is the dance Wiccan pega haga and sort
of neo-pagan website and again though
they had to develop their religion to be
able to accommodate this new environment
because what are the rules for doing
online ritual you know how do you how do
you do ritual on the internet right it's
very complex and they actually had to
figure out how to do that so they
develop things like circle a ticket you
know telling people if you log in at the
time during the ritual how to how to act
in the environment things like that but
if we started to become popular and a
lot of different sites started to host
online rituals this is another example
this is the dance and these are some of
the rituals that they did so certainly
there were people engaging in online
ritual activity at this time here's
another one online we could Wiccan
rituals and people would log in most of
these were held in sort of IRC chat
areas where it was synchronistic and
that you had to be there at the right
time at the right place and then
everyone would have their part in and
could participate in the ritual and
although this is going on at the time
and it certainly is a good example of
people using this internet technology
and the world wide web to actually do
religion it was rare for people to do
this type of practice so number-wise not
a lot of people doing online rituals in
the in the 1990s early 2000 where we see
probably the most religious activity
occurring on the world wide web in the
early years of the world wide web was
actually in online virtual pilgrimages
that was one area that developed quite
significantly quite early on where the
different people of different groups
actually wired sacred sites so that you
could login and you could have a virtual
sort of pilgrimage at a sacred site this
is 1998 it's part of a durga puja and
calcutta and the government helped
sponsor it so that they could wire the
festival so that people wherever they
were in North America are great britain
pretty well anywhere in the world they
could log in and they could see this
online the pilgrimage as it was
happening through the internet and it
was very popular some of the papers and
magazines writing it about about it at
the time said you know it's not the real
thing but if you're in north america or
if you're in die ass
it's the next best thing but if you live
in North America then you had come
overseas there's no way that you're
going to be able to participate in Durga
Puja you're not gonna be able to watch
it on TV you know there's no way to
connect with it so they actually started
to do these online virtual pilgrimages
for people in two aspirin and they could
log in they could see what was going on
they could get sound they could hear
about the festival's they could leave
messages on bulletin boards in and watch
all this sort of activities so for a lot
of people it's not the real thing but it
was the next best thing for them and
certainly a way for them to connect to
the space in many ways the internet was
shrinking the space so that they could
be there they could at least see the
rituals that were going on and that was
1998 it became so popular virtual
pilgrimage became so popular that a
number of sacred sites have been wired
this is a good example this is the
goomba mella 2001 it's the largest
pilgrimage that ever happens on this
planet it goes on I think every 10 or 12
years and again it was wired it was live
word so that people could login anywhere
in the world and see this pilgrimage
happening without necessarily having to
be there but very successful for
bringing people to from anywhere on the
planet to these sacred sites and it
became very popular cyber pilgrimage has
become a very popular sort of thing this
is the golden temple where they put in
special camera so you have a feed coming
in you can get sound you can get the
messages you can in many ways you can
sort of participate with the with the
environment here's some of the feed all
right so you can travel around in the
temple see the sacred place and do that
through your computer at home no matter
where you are in the world you could log
in and do sort of a cyber cyber
pilgrimage so that's very popular cyber
Hajj or virtual Hajj is also becoming
popular the hatch within the Muslim
tradition had to something you should do
once if you're Muslim and that is you
would travel to Mecca and Medina and you
would go on a pilgrimage virtual hatch
has become very popular for people
because even if they've done it once
it's nice to be able to redo it every
year and sort of relive the experience
and they there are a lot of websites now
devoted to presenting live had your
virtual Hajj and again they say even on
the website they say you know it's not
the real thing but take the virtual
it's the closest thing to being there
all right it's the next best thing so
they're they're shrinking space and
they're allowing people to be in this
environment or to at least see the
environment through their computer
here's another one and this one they say
if you're not able to go to hatch and
experience the next best thing the
virtual hatch all right so for people
it's not the same but it's the next best
thing and certainly becoming very
popular virtual pilgrimage is becoming
very popular there's another the virtual
one and as far as virtual pilgrimage
goes you can also go to sacred sites
that you may never be allowed to see in
the real world some of these sites might
be off limits because of restoration
reasons or they don't want tourists in
because it's such a sacred site this is
a good example this is a chapel you
can't just go there and walk around and
see it but through virtual reality you
can now go into that environment you can
see that environment and participate in
the environment there are also people
doing virtual pilgrimages and places
that have existed historically or may
never have existed at all so you see a
lot of three-dimensional virtual reality
images of things like Stonehenge are you
know sacred sites the Second Temple
Jerusalem has been rebuilt and you can
actually go there and many ways on a
pilgrimage and travel through the Holy
of Holies and see this place in virtual
reality now the issue with virtual
pilgrimage is that there is a disconnect
that occurs though between the person
who's watching it on their computer
screen in the actual pilgrimage itself I
mean to be a pilgrim means to be far a
foot and usually when you're a pilgrim
there's some sort of sacrifice its
required so that you have sort of a
spiritual give-and-take there's a reason
you go on the pilgrimage and when you go
on the pilgrimage you get some sort of
benefit now when you're watching that on
your computer it's it's it's certainly
limited but again with the social
shaping of technology can never really
underestimate how people's desire to do
religion on the internet will sort of
push that technology along so that it
can actually meet their spiritual needs
this is just an example this is the
virtual pilgrimage of a krogh patrick
which is in our mount in ireland and
wreak Sunday's coming up it's in July
and about 25,000 people will go there to
do the pilgrimage but to do the
pilgrimage properly you have to do it in
bare feet right so you'd walk up the
mountain in bare feet and you would
leave your blood behind and you
when you finish the pilgrimage you would
go away with the clean slate you would
be forgiven of your sins or you would
lessen your time in purgatory however
you want to see it so there's a real
spiritual give and take that occurs in
pilgrimages but how do you do that in a
virtual way you know how does it happen
how do you have that connection with the
real place in a virtual way and it is an
interesting issue but it is also
something that a lot of people have
tried to overcome by adapting the
technology one example is Lourdes right
Lourdes is wired with web cams are a
number of web cams at Lord's live feed
24-7 so you can go and see this very
sacred place you can have sort of a
traditional online pilgrimage which is
very nice but then you can actually do
something more but you can actually
interact with the environment instead of
being just a disembodied avatar where
you're floating around space and no
one's there at Lord's you can request a
prayer and it's not just that you
request a prayer you fill out this form
but when you submit it you actually get
a response saying that they've received
the prepetition it has been received and
the nice thing about this though is that
it will be printed they will be taken
they will be given to the priest in the
chapel and during a special service he
is going to read them and you can watch
that live from your computer so you're
not just a disembodied Avatar anymore
you're actually interacting with the
environment you're actually manipulating
the environment and you're having a real
effect you're having a real effect on
this place where you've submitted a
prayer they've received it and you can
actually then here it being being said
given it during the service so you've
really interacted with the environment
when we Sears the the sacred grotto
another good example of interacting with
the environment is the the Wailing Wall
the Western Wall in Jerusalem right you
can set that as your screensaver and
it's nice to be able to watch you know
live feed of the Wailing Wall
particularly if within your tradition
that is a very sacred place for you but
to be able to do something more is
important for a lot of people and what's
happening at the Wailing Wall there it
is there is that you can place a note
you can have a prayer placed in the wall
for you so as an avatar you login you
can see that you can see the site and
then you can enter a prayer request and
you will type it up and they will
receive and they wait usually about once
a week and then they print them up very
small font to roll it up on paper and
then
we'll take and they will put it in the
wall for you so again as you're an
avatar but you're not disembodied you're
actually interacting with the
environment and leaving even proof
tangible proof that you have been there
your presence has been there you've had
an impact on the site and for many
people leaving a prayer in the western
wall is an incredibly powerful religious
experience I mean that's one way of
coming close to God the tabernacle the
Holy of Holies was in that area and it's
one way by leaving the prayer there that
you're actually leaving your prayers
very close to to God so a very powerful
thing but facilitated through the
internet now what we see probably the
most kid the strongest connection of
this type is in within Hinduism I'm very
early on in 1999 this site surinam calm
made it their mandate to be able to
offer people in diaspora Hindus in
diaspora the ability to connect with any
temple in india and have ritual
conducted for them specifically for them
so they set up the website so that
people could log in and they could
request a prayer or ask for prayer to be
done in a certain temple for them they
even offer something like a puja wizard
so if you're not sure what would be the
best you know ritual to be done for you
can you can go in and it will calculate
it so if you have a job coming up or
something like that you're going for a
job interview you can put in career and
it will calculate all these things and
it will say well if it's a job interview
the best place you could do that temp
you know that sacrifice would be in
northern India at this particular temple
at this time of year to this God and
that's is the absolute best ritual you
could ever do now if you wanted to do
that in real life you'd have to travel
there you have to go in this enormous
expense this great pilgrimage to
northern India but through their company
you can just log in they'll contact the
priest everything will be done for you
and they will guarantee that this
service was going to be done in your
name at that place and at that time
until you log in in some ways it's more
than a virtual pilgrimage because you're
actually requesting the ritual and it's
shrinking the space it's as if you're
there to have this done for you and when
it's finished in many cases they will
have a video of it then they will send
the offerings back to you you can pay
extra if you wanted send-ups you can get
it within three days back from these
temples in India but you've had a real
interaction with the environment even
though it's just a virtual connection
so you will get back these offerings
will come in the mail the video CD and
you've really connected with the
environment you've had a real connection
to that place here are some of the most
popular temples again some of the most
sacred places in India have been wired
so that you can do this service and
historically there were issues of gender
you know some temples were restricted
just to two men in other cases there's
cast issues whereas people a certain
cast may not be allowed to go into a
certain temple but again through the
internet now those restrictions in many
ways are being bypassed and people can
log in and they can request these very
sacred things to be done for them at
these very sacred temples here's another
example where you'd log in you request
the prayer or the ritual then it's done
in your name for you and then you get
the offerings and things left over ship
back to you at this time it's it's hard
to say how far this technology would go
I envision that that in a very short
period of time many of the temples will
be wired 24-7 with live feed video
cameras but it depends on the type of
ritual being done because some temples
restrict things like photographs so if
they're not allowing photographs are not
allowing the people to come in and
record the ritual and upload it to the
internet or send the tape back to people
but some temples dual out and some
rituals do allow it and I wouldn't be
surprised if in the very near future
that these temples are even more were
than they are now and they allow for
instantaneous interaction or live feed
video so this is a very important ritual
practice it's being facilitated through
the internet thousands and thousands of
people are taking advantage of it is
becoming very popular and what's
happening is that it's shrinking space
all right it's allowing someone who's in
North America was in California here to
actually in many ways be in that temple
or be in that place so that they can
conduct that ritual they can contact the
priests have this sacrifice or ritual
done for them and in many ways shrinking
space so that they can be there now
another type of ritual practice that's
occurring is transporting people instead
of to a place that's on the ground or a
real sacred site is transporting them
into cyberspace where people have
actually engineered sacred space and
they've created sacred space for people
to go in and do ritual and this is an
early example of it this is alpha world
and now
1996 there was some researchers started
to look at these virtual reality
environments to sort of see what was
going on there's a fellow named Ralph
Schroeder and he started looking around
this environment and he actually found a
church had been created in alpha world
for people to come on a regular basis in
worship and when he studied this entire
environment he actually he saw that this
church was probably the most dynamic
strongest community place in the entire
Alpha world and that people came on a
regular basis a they respected each
other they would do these services and
it was a very strong interaction there
was even a virtual wedding that was
conducted in 1996 I in alpha world this
is a some of the pictures of the virtual
wedding you can see that they programmed
in things like the flowers they made it
into an open-air you know beautiful
place to have a wedding and they
conducted a real ritual it was a real
wedding ritual where people logged in
from all over the world the different
users came to the ceremony they had the
person in charge who facilitated and
then you had the bride and the groom
here's the the ritual that went with it
they say even when we were worlds apart
just keep this promise in your heart and
sickness and in health for richer or
poorer I do for a richer poor as long as
you live I do a little emoticon right
smiley faith I now pronounce you man and
wife and this was a real ritual it was
facilitated happened in a virtual
reality environment but it was a real
wedding and for these people it was the
real deal there's a picture of the the
groom there and and to facilitate it
they programmed in things like the smile
all right so that the groom would be
smiling the tuxedos the flowers they
created they put all those things within
the environment to show that this was a
ritual an important sort of event for
them there's a picture of a bride and
groom and so that was 1996 and at that
time you have to remember sort of the
processing power of computers was
limited internet connections were slower
and yet still a lot of people were using
this environment for religious activity
if we go to today ten years later this
is alpha world now I'm you see a lot of
tourists and here just sort of checking
it out but with the increase in
processing power of the increase in an
internet speed and also the decrease in
the cost of compute
there's a lot more people online
participating now in these virtual
reality environments and there's a lot
more people doing religion on the
internet some of the good examples that
we have come from the number of the
games like EverQuest and final fantasy
these online virtual reality
environments we're getting hundreds and
thousands of people participating on a
regular basis and we see that some of
the groups that are forming some of the
clans are some of the groups have formed
to travel through these online
environments are basing their themselves
on their religious beliefs so you have
Christian groups that are in there I
have wicked neo-pagan groups and they
will do things like ritual but for the
most part they will use it for sort of
trying to convert other people to their
belief system so there will be the
Christian groups that will be going
around they will actually help someone
and then they'll talk to them about
Christianity at the same time and there
are also rituals being facilitated I'll
just show a more recent wedding ceremony
that last one was 1996 this one is 2002
this is final fantasy and again a very
real wedding they've adapted it so that
they actually have wedding rings so they
could choose the wedding rings here's
this this ceremony it was October
Halloween on 2002 so you had the Rings
the vows the person the priest in charge
was actually a non-player character one
of the programmers from Final Fantasy
volunteered to be the priest to
facilitate this ritual and they had this
this real wedding ceremony for these
people in this virtual reality
environment now the question comes up
though you know is this a real ceremony
is this a real ritual is this can you do
something like that in cyberspace is it
even real space and one of the issues
you have to deal with when they're doing
ritual is that well what is sacred space
anyways right is this real spacers at
sacred space and is that possible in
something that's just created by
programs so trying to answer that
question the easiest thing to do is to
think about what what is sacred space
but is sacred space if we went this is
just a picture of a church I had wished
I had uploaded some of the ones i had
from the Stanford campus a beautiful
environment for today's lecture but this
one will do for a lot of people this is
sacred space and if you went to this
church and you ask them you know what
makes his space sacred is it the
building is it the bricks they would say
no you know it's not the things that
built this space that make it sacred
well
is it then it could be the symbols
involved it could be the rituals that
they have in many cases is also the
rules in the regulation so you know you
know you're not supposed to talk you
know there's a separation you're not
allowed to walk up to the altar you
can't just go into this environment and
sacred space though is very subjective
there's no sacred space meter like I
don't have a thing where I can say well
this is a seven on the on the scale of
sacred space it's actually a very
subjective thing for the for the
participant and we know that because
what one person sees the sacred space
like a mountain or a tree or a spring
you may bring them here and ask them
well this sacred space that will say no
no this isn't this is definitely not
sacred space and you could take someone
from this environment where this is
sacred space to them and take them to a
place like ayers rock and say well you
know do you see the sacred space here
and they would say no no this isn't
sacred space my church was so it's a
very subjective thing but first and
foremost it's not something that's made
are created from the building blocks all
right so it's not because of these
bricks that they built this building
that they have sacred space now if we go
to somewhere like second life the same
thing is happening there and that is not
the code that's making these
environments that can make it sacred
it's just like the bricks that made the
building it's irrelevant it's the people
involved that view it as sacred space it
actually then gives it its meaning and
they view it that way and it's sacred
for them and we know that because there
are a number of churches now that have
made it their mission there are offline
churches that have real churches in
particularly in North America but
they've made it their mission to also
have online churches where they've spent
the money in the time in the programming
to actually create an online virtual
church or a virtual representation of
them and if you ask them if you ask the
ministers is this a real church they'll
say yes it is even though it's in a
virtual reality environment it's a real
church and we have a real mission here
and this is a real sacred space to us
and they will program it or they will
broadcast in their live services and you
can certainly see there are a lot of
sacred symbols therefore when people
come into this environment a lot of
people would say that this is very
sacred for them even though it's a
virtual reality environment and here's a
good example this is my friend john
bilodeau he's finishing up his PhD at
concordia university of montreal and he
and I are doing a research project
looking at second life in the religious
environment in second life and
surprisingly enough there are a number
of cases of people taking the time to
create sacred space all right and
they're doing this on their own but
they're creating a lot of sacred space a
lot of sacred sites within Second Life
this is a good example this place there
is a gate there so that sort of
separates out this space the person that
created this environment says you know
what's behind this gate is special it's
different it's it's set apart from
everything else but that gate opens its
not locked you just go up to it and they
touch it and will open and you can go in
and then when you go in you've got a
very sacred icon within this environment
so you can go up and you can actually
get a visual contact with the icon which
is a very sacred way of worshipping
certainly within the Orthodox tradition
but many traditions just seeing the icon
is a connection with the secret so it's
there it's in this place they put things
like candles a lot of symbols have been
brought into the environment so that for
people participating it actually is a
very secret encounter even though it's
in a virtual reality world this is the
same church what they've also done when
you go into these environments I mean
it's a beautiful environment a lot of
work went into creating it and when you
go into these environments they have
little packets for your avatar that you
pick up when you go in the temple so it
will give you the ability to do
something like prey to kneel and pray or
to sit and meditate or things like that
now the big question here though is this
you know is this is it's a real sort of
religious practice you know is it a real
religious practice and I think the best
way to think of it is it like all these
other examples I've given earlier when
people talk about it and they say it's
sort of the next best thing and I can I
can explain that in one way I like to
golf I'd like to go golfing and when I
was in Toronto a little while ago
actually went to a golf simulator and
it's a very complex room you go in and
it has Doppler radar and you have a big
screen and you have real golf clubs and
you hit a real golf ball and there's all
different types of grass and you know
depending upon where your ball lies you
set it on the on the grass and you get
to play golf and it's a lot of fun now
it's not the same thing there's no
question that's not the same thing I
mean I like golf because you're walking
you can smell the fresh grass you can
hear the birds you're in the open air
and that's a lot of fun and this was not
like that but it was the next best thing
you know in Canada when it's winter time
you don't get a golf you know so you
don't get a go anyways and it's an or if
you want to go it could be expensive
there's all the hassle with tee times
you know if
want to get your friends together to go
golfing on the weekend you can have to
meet at seven and four and sometimes
it's not that much fun and the simulator
though the golf simulator was the next
best thing and you have to remember that
people in our contemporary society a lot
of them might not go to church on a
regular basis all right what if you work
on the weekends can't go to church on
Sunday if you're working but if you're
in second life Saturday night you could
go to a church you could pop in or a lot
of people don't even go to church anyway
so for them it's it's it's certainly the
next best thing that they can at least
go into this environment they can see
the church they can see the the icons
and they can see sermons and get this
sort of religious information that they
may not get elsewhere so I would say it
is it is the next best thing and here's
another example this is a Hindu temple
in second life and for a lot of people
being the next best thing might be the
only thing for them I mean most people
would be intimidated to walk up to a
Hindu temple and knock on the door and
say well can I come in and can you tell
me about your belief system and what are
you doing but in second life if you're
traveling around this is a big beautiful
temple you can spot it you can fly down
to it you can go into this environment
and then there are the gods and there's
there's their way of worship and again
you can get a package so that you can
worship also or you can get information
and for a lot of people this is really
the only contact they're going to have
with Hinduism but it's going to give
them information they're going to see
the statues you're going to find out how
people do it so it's the next best thing
and certainly a very interesting and
dynamic environment and we see that with
things like Buddhist temples where those
are real icons and you can go in and sit
and meditate or look at the look at the
icons and get information about the
belief system there's a Zen temple right
so for a lot of people though they may
never get to a real Zen temple all right
they may not they might they may never
get there but in second life now they
can now the truth is though with second
life I mean there's millions of people
signed up a lot of people participating
on it as far as the number is actually
doing this type of religious practice
it's hard to say it's probably in the
thousands all right it's not it's not a
huge number of people at this time but I
think that it is expanding and more and
more people are starting to use it for
this activity but it's hard to say we'll
see where that goes that's one of these
things that's just developing even as we
speak and it's a new
way that people are socially shaping the
technology so that I can meet their
religious needs I mean creating that
type of environment is quite fascinating
and it certainly is an example of the
social shaping of Technology I'm running
low on time but I'd like to talk about
just two more areas where religion on
the internet is actually having a very
significant impact where a lot of people
are participating and that's involved in
crisis ritual when we talked about the
internet being able to shrink space and
bring people in virtual pilgrimage to
close to a site that also seems to be
happening in terms of crisis and
particularly when something happens
something bad happens often people will
do some sort of spontaneous ritual to
deal with it or somehow to connect with
it a good example was a tsunami in
December of 2004 when that happened I
mean it was an overwhelming event it was
a horrific event and a lot of people
were very moved but how do you connect
with the site you know in this case how
do you do religion if your religious
beliefs are to help others or to to
somehow do charity work or to you know
if that's part of your of your doing
religion how do you connect with the
site how do you actually do that when
these type of things happen and it seems
that the Internet is facilitating that
and is actually a very powerful tool for
connecting people with places where
things like disaster have occurred so in
this case this was within Hinduism a lot
of local temples use the internet so
they could tell people about what was
going on so they could generate funds
and then they could distribute that
money and for a lot of people that
became a crisis ritual when that
horrific event happened and they were
moved and they felt to do something they
actually got up and they went to their
computer and depending upon their belief
system they may have gone to the Red
Cross or they could have gone a number
of different organizations but they went
to these sites where they can get this
information and pulled out their credit
card and gave right and in many ways
that's a crisis ritual they're trying to
facilitate a religious activity but
they're using the Internet to do it and
it brought them close it brings you to
the site it connects you with that
environment so in many ways you can be
there and you can see what's happening
and and also impact on that environment
you're really doing something even
though you're an avatar and you're 3,000
miles away you're really connecting with
the place and you're really helping
you're really doing something another
type of crisis ritual will skip through
this
but with something like 911 and and
crisis and memorial so this is probably
one of the most powerful spiritual
environments on the internet right now I
would say are the online memorials I
mean when you encounter them if you're
looking at different types of religious
activity that's going on the internet
and you can look at the religious
rituals and they're very interesting and
some of these beautiful sacred spaces
are overwhelming almost in the
complexity that's created them but if
you want to talk about sort of a sacred
feeling or and in your gut sacred sense
when you go to the online memorial sites
that's where it really hits you and this
was after nine eleven very quickly after
nine eleven as a crisis ritual a lot of
people had to do something you know they
had to do something somehow to deal with
this this event and and most people when
they're trying to deal with crisis like
that turn to religion in this case they
went online and they lit candles it's
actually lit a candle in to very many
ways that's a very religious sort of
activity but it was facilitated through
the internet and a lot of people came
together they rallied they did these
sort of online quick crisis rituals to
be able to deal with this issue so in a
very short period of time those about
six hundred thousand candles had been
lit as a crisis ritual and the other
thing would just skip through that the
other thing is the online memorial sites
very powerful places I mean
traditionally when someone passes away
you get a memorial and obituary in a
newspaper and there's a you know 40 in
them a day it's a little tiny few lines
and that doesn't do justice to anybody's
life we all know that it's not really a
satisfying way of communicating about
someone and what what's developing on
the Internet is that people are allowing
for online memorial so you can create a
site where you can upload audio and
video you can have a message people can
actually come in and leave messages they
can like virtual candles they can leave
virtual flowers so that this person's
memory is maintained on the internet and
these are very powerful places and
certainly a very sacred site when it
comes to religion on the internet a very
sacred place when it comes to religion
on the internet and these are becoming
much more popular this is again I would
say one direction that religion on the
internet is going so I burned through
that talk pretty fast will end up where
we left off
this is just sort of one aspect of some
other thing you know an introduction to
some of the things that are going on
online as far as religion the internet
goes so I hope I didn't overwhelm you
with too much material but if you have
any questions I'd be happy to take any
questions at this time so thank you for
listening thanks yeah
right is it up
the religious violence
mrs.
grabner stuff
it would suck what's the
that's Rebecca
but I mean as a ton of there's a
question real world what makes you a
breeze
not much but sure as caninus appeared in
the room
I mean that's a very interesting topic
and it has to do with religious
authority you know who's really a priest
online or who has authority online and
particularly for doing facilitating
rituals and things like that we see in a
places like alpha world people would
literally take turns and so there was no
real leader they're very non
hierarchical we're different people
could have different levels of authority
in the Usenet groups and different sort
of organized or online religious sites
it often has to do with the people that
have been there the longest right
they've established the most cop
cultural capital in the group they're
the most respected and they sort of
become the default leaders but they'd
have no real authority no real power
other than what the group respects to
them and what the group season them as
far as the authenticity or the legality
of something like an online wedding it
you know it's a ceremony for the
community so that that online community
can participate in it the you know when
that person up there says I now
pronounce you man and wife if everyone
respects it then it's a performative
utterance within ritual so that you know
the social reality has transformed but
as far as the legality of it goes
outside of Second Life then they have to
follow through with that and get a real
legal certificate and things like that
so
you can imagine service like the coming
one have
you been
right left
I mean it's that's it's I haven't I'm
not aware of any case law but certainly
you see that in a lot of official
organized religions they are extremely
cautious about how authority works
online and that's why they're many cases
aren't bulletin boards or there is a
bulletin board is going to be censored
in many cases they would if they would
have a prayer request would you would
have direct contact with them almost
like an email so you don't you know you
know what's going to them and you know
it's a sort of an authentic site but
it's it's really gray area and that is
challenging religious authority because
you know someone puts up a site I've
looked at a lot of online religious
sites and sometimes people will create
these magnificent sights and often
people would think well because it's a
good-looking site and it's very
user-friendly and it's beautiful it must
be authentic it must be real unless this
guy must be a real religious expert when
really know you know they're not they're
12 year old kid who's decided you know
for whatever reason they want to have a
religious website but that doesn't
necessarily give them authorities
sir Sir there you go thank you yeah
authorities actually possible
yeah I mean and certainly the more the
the traditional religious communities do
not see I mean the issue is cyberspace
is cyberspace real space and if it's a
real space and can you have authentic
religion there and most of the earth
sort of official organized religions
would say no they'd say you know we can
use the internet for giving information
and it's it's good for communicating but
that's not real space right and if you
want to do religion you come to church
and that that thing that's on that
internet you know that's not that's not
Church it's not the same so you do see
tension there but what happens then if
the official Church doesn't allow for it
you know that Catholic website is very
good example where they're not allowing
for chapter not long for our prayer
requests are not allowing for
interaction and not allowing for online
religion then people will just keep
looking until they find a place where
they can do it so if they're Catholic
and they can't get that type of
interactivity the Vatican then they're
going to start looking around they're
probably going to end up at a non
official site that might not even be
recognized or sanctioned by the Vatican
where there will be sort of this
Catholic environment where then they
could participate or talk about you know
share prayers things like that so
ah
Islam can be some certain stuff to do
absolutely i mean it's recommended to go
on Hajj that's right but if you can't
afford it or if you're not able then
that's fine
we have any
and the ocean
that's somebody's you know at least has
song I think so and even I mean the Pope
the last Pope the last Pope did do
virtual pilgrimage and he had allowed
when he was actually on a pilgrimage for
it to be broadcast live and so that
people could sign in virtually and
virtually watch this thing go on so in
that sense they recognized that maybe as
a tool for shrinking space it was
effective or was a valid I don't know if
he got penance for you got like a less
purgatory you know officially recognized
last purgatory like doing the rica cote
prac craig patrick where you climb to
the top of the mountain you know that's
official you may even get a document
saying that you know this has happened i
am not aware of that type of level yet
but i wouldn't be surprised I mean you
again this is very new and as people if
people really desire for that then the
technology I think with social shaping
of Technology sort of the spiritualizing
of the Internet where you know they're
adapting the technology so that I can
meet their religious and spiritual needs
and if they really want that I would say
that that's going to come you know that
they will at least make it or make that
available for people yeah yes
but there's art right
but I mean it's it's a very yeah it's a
very powerful tool for that and teaching
scripture meeting online to do to you
know for things like bible study prayer
meetings prayer gatherings also we're
very common as far as biblical studies
go it's actually been an enormous
resource because you can go and get a
number of different copies of the Bible
are available online for free and you
can compare pieces of different
Testaments and different scriptures and
see different versions and a website
that is an official site of the LDS
Church of latter-day saints actually has
a huge section on bible study and you
know a lot of material online so that
they're making it available to people
for that reasons that you can use it
another good example though was in some
countries in some Muslim countries
you're not allowed to bring certain
scriptures so if you are in diaspora
your hindu and you're working in say the
Middle East you can't bring a copy the
Baghdad Geeta in with you in through the
airport security and you cannot read it
in that country not allowed to worship
that way in that country because it's a
Muslim country and the rules and
regulations and the laws are structured
that way so it's not allowed but what
happened again to social shaping and
technology to facilitate people that are
in diaspora is that there are websites
where you can log in and you can say you
know I'm working here but I don't have a
copy of the Gita can you you know and
they'll send you different scriptures
and you can talk online and you can meet
with priests online and do all that sort
of thing even though in the offline
world you're not allowed so you know
providing that type of Sacred Scripture
even though in that case you're not
supposed to have it but I think for a
lot of people you know as information
seeking behavior it's really affecting
them you know if you have a question
about something a religious question you
can turn to the internet now and you can
try and get answers you can look at
different sacred texts you can look at
things that you may not have had access
to before you know and that is affecting
people i think it is affecting people so
it could
alright well thank you very much for
your patience I hope you enjoyed the
talk thanks thanks rich</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
