they like or how to have a calm line
today it'll be given by our Trini
Lausanne Jimmu rinpoche well I think
you've been introduced to through his
vile here your interpreted today will be
a lot more fulsome Grondin charts he
founded in the 1400s by Limoges in Coppa
on a hillside at 16,000 feet I think
about day away from Lhasa by by foot at
times garden and the to colleges held
over 8,000 months in our half there were
80 survivors that came to South indeed
the late 60s begin camping in advance
they even pulled the plows with their
first crop of rice with their own
shoulders he couldn't even afford County
today it's a city of thriving city of
over 5,000 monks in the two colleges the
general course of study is 25 years six
days a week 5 a.m. to midnight and this
progresses through five major texts the
six perfections text on Buddhist logic
text on emptiness emptiness doesn't mean
nothing it's more like how things are
fabricated on parts earlier I was saying
well where is Google are you Google it's
a computer Google is the table booth is
the building Google where you can't find
Google there's many parts also the eye
is fabricated on many parts than me
once we grasp think the eye is
self-existent
then all these minds come like anger
hatred desire attachment jealousy etc so
this is a little just a little over play
about emptiness how it it's about how
fabric phenomena are fabricated by the
mind these three classes also requires
six hours of Socrative eight every day
for 15 years and we heard today that you
have a little debate session once a week
I love I thought this this will keep
this place depression a lot so I think
this is wonderful that you're able to
challenge the company challenge the
management this is how it is in the
monastery you can challenge any test you
can challenge the blue team talent
any teacher at any time during these
debates sessions also a lot of
memorization takes place all these five
texts are memory memorized the primary
parts of them are memorized after that
we study cosmology two or three years
presently Quantum's and physics quantum
physics and Buddhism look almost exactly
alike for some reason about the
generation of galactic systems the
particle in structure phenomena the
Buddha also taught about these things
very unusual we also study our moral
behavior our precepts there are 12 253
steps we take to protect our actions
with living beings in the environment
for we cannot break killing lying
stealing and sexual misconduct those are
out if you break we take any monk from
any country any race there's no tuition
the schooling is free your whole life
your clothes are free your food is for
your room is for your text and freedom
and how we make this possible presently
is by touring the planet we usually have
different tourists on different
continents on the planet
two meals a day are still kyun bread
this is a refugee camp we live in but
it's already transformed itself from
tents into a huge University one of the
purposes of this tour is the new debate
courtyard it's a building nearly two
acres inside can hold six thousand monks
in debate we had to have a construction
film firm build it because that we
couldn't handle it ourselves so we need
to pay for this so we're trying to raise
funds to pay for our new debate
courtyard it has open walls in fact it's
functioning right now we also wanted to
build a hospital it's been finished
faculty it was promised somebody
promised to fund it but they had a
problem on the stark market or something
happened to their money and now they put
that on our shoulders on this tour also
to pay for the hospital we have a new 30
room hospital so if one receives a
gaseous degree and room che here is also
a Geshe I guess you means the
concentration of virtue then once that
is Tantra I want the topic universities
boots after for three to five years as I
always say Buddhist chapters vary or any
time for this very miss
in the West it has nothing to do with
the physical body in contact between
sexes it has to do with the mind at the
time of death generating a new body
speech in mind may delight
I want a whole life to light him so they
usually don't hear about this sometimes
hear about River Jays that when you hear
the word room chair this means the one
this is precious this is a being that
already has the capability I'm going
life to life whatever they wish
we can take care of a monk for about a
dollar a day even the monastery gives us
money every week to help with our
necessities they were also very wise
they have three restaurants and five
stores in the monastery that they run
where we spend all our money so the
money's kind of making a big circle I
think I'll just step back and have the
Trinity or drum Chino thank you for
inviting
first of all it's it's so nice to see
you all in working such a big companies
like a kind of first visit and see so
many people in one office and I really
have we really appreciate inviting us
here and giving us an opportunity to
share what we practice what we do in our
daily life so thank you and we agreed
with a dividend greeting called
Tashi Delek which means peace and
prosperity and what I see here people
are very fortunate because first of all
we conserve our being born into a human
rebirth is as a fortunate because we
don't have a problem in our faculties
like we are capable and at the same time
that you are working in a global like to
benefit in the world so that makes a
more special so I really appreciate that
whatever you're doing to promote the
happiness of this whole world thank you
the periodicals are no simple sum
no additives so today's topic is on how
to calm down or mine in this busy world
especially to try to generate more of
peace and happiness or love and
compassion inside although they are
gonna suddenly artemon
come on yeah how are they simply are
coming towards you do ad hoc a social
social gate and talk what would the
attention to deny that the true mentor
somebody mine is something it's somebody
kitchen somebody Jackie
somebody in the kitchen cognitive others
remember to do this via what is your
power I make it but in each other's so
people to coming oneself first of all we
have to know what are the those things
that bring distraction to us we have to
know first of all about this because
without knowing those things we cannot
calm down or consciousness or to bring
peace in mind so according to the our
philosophical way is to like all the
suffering all the problem or challenges
that we face is not from outside until
the outside own do anything are not
doing anything but all the problems the
distractions are problem more negative
it is a this all come from inside it it
is all from inside and who is that
that's all starts from me called I when
we have a strong grasping towards me
that means I or me or I want that I
don't know want I just like it so in
order to like when we have a strong
grasping to yourself as super
call ego approach or jealousy so the
moment we have a strong grasping to a
cell called I then anything that
contradict that brings suffering
anything that want to fulfill that bring
sufferings so the major one is called a
beginning as I called I we call
ignorance or grassroot yourself as
suprem so that is the major key to
bringing depressions problems or
transaction all things distractions and
not another thing suju's a shillelagh
panache oh yeah yeah topology so then
and I'll put the whole is impairment to
be in Utopia
okay you're messing with some pop up
your mother baby continuing them not
away now sometimes need somebody but if
somebody somehow get on somebody by
Georgia Wanda I can't use you nobody
says you cannot later
I'm meeting to the media to do totally
to to drop one members your time machine
or sequela Tea Party the chances are
somebody you do we use a little comma to
judge okay now move over things so we
are the cousins
so therefore like it so in order to
overcome those are grassman to a sound
like an ego or
i we have to know that how that we are
relating with the kindness of others
like briefly is about our parents right
now we are working whatever we're in the
position right now it is because of the
kindness I want some parents that's why
we are here in two dispositions so every
is start from two drops actually two
dots and then because of their love care
then we are here so and like how that we
perceive in a different way because how
that it is all because of inside that we
make a difference between the other
environment is for example that though
there are lots of examples but like a
one small example is like a friend like
a best friend like within one day that
when you really like that person it is
your best friend then because of inside
like you have a desire inside then you
will see all the best quality from that
person that you like the most
you you see the good qualities all the
best quality from that person because
you like it and the same day because of
some misunderstanding or some problem if
you general anger towards that person in
the evening then immediately this will
change the perception will change that
means you won't find the same qualities
from that person instead you will get
angry even you don't want to see that
person like it be lot of distraction
inside like you will be bawling inside
human you're missing all the negative
words relating all the negative things
even your body physical reaction may
change absolutely but the person that
you see in the morning
the see in the evening is the same
person but how we generate motivated
work from inside the moon the moment it
changed the motivation you see perceive
a different object immediately so that's
how that the object is not the one but
from inside that how we perceive whether
it is motivated by desire it looks
different
if you're motivated by anger it looks
different if you met it a bit by
motivated by ignorance it looks
different so it's not from outside but
absolutely from somebody to judge happen
and then for somebody a somewhat reacted
earlier in the messages so that means
like if we really analyze carefully to
bring peace or happiness or prosperity
it all comes from inside that means one
has to generate the good motivation
because the warm heart warm heart
because once we generate the warm heart
inside then whatever we look at through
you will appreciate that you will see
the qualities from outside but the
movement we generate the negative
motivation inside negative a lot of
desire attacks with hatred then
everything will make a difference that
means they'll be always thinking about
negative even one may try to do a good
thing also because of jealousy you may
look think it differently even someone
is trying to like you all right benefit
or doing good things
it will perceive in a different way and
instead of finding the good qualities
from others who will find all all the
negative qualities and when we see those
kind of differences then it obviously
distract our emotion and that brings the
suffering to us oneself and create
suffering it was a problem to us others
so first of all to to generate peace
wooden was one side or others we have to
transform him problem wooden in to
generate the good heart or the womb
another community really achieve illa
good is it - computer leveraging so
Google Madhu Dodger
Naja computed the achievement of a
combative judgmental silicosis I think
exists here Paula Zahn kombucha Lake
Okoboji birthday Silverman 2000
combination with us about the park
illness somebody so it's like a sometime
when we don't analyze carefully but for
example working in a computer so because
of Miss typing or something it even went
wrong one may like to express all the
anger and you may blow it everything and
hit the keyboard is like as strong as
possible like you're so angry with the
the computer but if you really analyze
carefully it is because subtyping
differently it's inside like you make a
mistake not the computer actually
computer is responding whatever you
created you do it so if you carefully if
you analyze is all inside that means all
the problems that we see through all the
destruction we see through it is like we
create ourselves not from outside so
that's how that we have to transform
inside some of the samples work I do so

union community among potato in earnest
if I'm a didn't cut in the front on 2q
judgment that is not it it's in
government the gyms you told us so now
the the how to bring how to change
ourselves like to generate a warm heart
a good heart is we have to know that
right now that for example I am
surviving I'm alive it is because of the
kindness of all the living beings and
environment
it is because of the kindness of every
living beings in environment I am
surviving so for example like from our
parents like to consider me or I as the
we we have a greatest misconception that
we call this mean as if that I have
existed without depending on anything
like this is me I did it this is me but
if you really analyze carefully it comes
from the true drops the father's wire
cell and the mother's red blood and from
that that the parents has to take care
of that giving all the the love care
protections even doesn't mean the moment
we are born means we are right away
grown up and educated even the moment we
are born they have to give us all the
love and care and everything education
and guidance buying all the giving food
and clothes everything without letting
us fall into fire and water or anything
so right now we are into this position
it is because of the kindness of our
parents that I'm surviving
so that's how that their parents are
kind and we have to know that how they
are kind to us until July significant
Italica the temples so to pooches yoga
done again I can talk well the kids are
the color time what does hometown today
month by for instant like when we carry
a small pack in her bag how we try to
show how I'm tired are we carry heavy
things but the parents when they look at
once on children 24 hours for until
they're grown up but they have to take
care without using the word tire and I
don't want like they tirelessly like
raise us like that so if we look at that
way that how parents are kind to us what
the day is inevitable papa I'm Mika do

ditch a given one to church cuisine
unity Tatiana Papa making women and can
go that apology about my sorry
money we are cutting the universe up to
you my show
dijanna there so there somebody tell ya
two days so therefore now since like
once you know that once on parents are
kind and obviously we have to know how
to repay the kindness so when you know
what to repay the kindness is you
general good heart that means like if
once on pattern is alive like to visit
them try to keep in touch with them and
pay respect to them and if you can serve
them try to feel this is the greatest
opportunity to repay the kindness by
serving them because this is the right
way and if once or parents are living
far away even by keeping in touch with
them calling or writing even this will
also will make you feel better person
even with one some parents is already
passed away even try to include in your
prayers making a wish that I want to
benefit I want to repaid highness to
Austin my parents even if you have a
positive intention even once an parents
already passed away even keeping in your
positive motivation it will help you to
transform into a better person it will
generate a good hearty designed Michigan

and of course an Obama may give them

similitude of us like for example like
sometimes we are so like our feeling is
so strange like for example a strange
person that we never saw before we never
met before we never knew before all of a
sudden a strange person when they gave
us a cup of tea then one may likely to
express all the best word all your kind
your knives your beautiful is very good
is so kind to me just by giving a cup of
tea one we like to express all the
formal would just by offering one cup of
tea but sometimes we forget to pay
respect to his parents who has given us
thousands of tea and thousand things
like that but even we don't pay respect
to them so that means we should not be
those kind of things because if a person
a strange person who deserves all the
formal word by just giving a cup of tea
of course one some patterns will deserve
the most and that's why I like like even
from now on was like a forgiving a cup
of tea when we when we met in future
also there was some kind of gratitude
like you'll feel like oh you will talk
with them you will speak nicely so this
is something that we should not forget
about it and pay respect towards
patterns it's combining it's about the
mirror patching immediately added source
of contention for him earlier today the
accompany manner through the legacy are

so people can share your mother is a
contributor to layer your money no
control condition but they are a source
of potential but they are under you
really told you to mother earth on
vacation come with the card in Toronto
so after chanting does the tours want
some patterns then you can generate was
others like for example like company
here the Google company because each and
every person within this company has his
own individual responsibility to make it
happen this one so that means one cannot
say that I make it happen
every person has its own individual
responsibility to bring success how many
prosperity so that's how that like it is
because of the kindness of each and
every person within this company that
bring this successful so that's how that
it brings like highness it being respect
with each others to create this to grow
this company so that's how that every
beings within this whole company or kind
and you respect them that there are
social some dollars
dinner medium and a security knowledge
area mothers so company a woman is so
cool
the Apache game bus the Kentucky
Cattlemen's in the Cumberland so
yeah booyah Amanda to do country also
what we did about a turn I'm Jeff from
whether they are coverage for the day I
imagine other the two hundred some of us
have other cultures so because if
there's only one person in the Google
company then it won't happen that means
one person cannot make it happen because
it needs everything the causes and
condition to make it happen this so each
and every person in this whole company
is kind to each other so kind to me
so that's how that the moment that when
we begin to understand that we are
surviving because of the kindness of
everyone here I cannot one person cannot
make it happen
so that's why every beings around is
kind to me and in order to repay the
kindness you really appreciate and we
really talk and try to to bring harmony
respect so that's how that we can make
it peace and prosperity but it is I'm
not no soldiers somebody is from which
is somebody so much happen in it
socially are simple do you know your
mother then they come back they would
America my your mother
seems like it's somebody's tears in the
Samba song which is refer to that so
this way when you analyze everything
then you'll begin to understand that I
am surviving it is because of the
kindness of every beings in the
environment around me that means like
the food clothes the road house air
water element everything is because of
the kindness of those things that I'm
surviving and if just knowing hunt is
not enough to repay the kindness then if
you respect those things if you respect
everything so it will bring you more
inner peace that means you will be
concerned about everything around you
that you will use economically and even
when you work yourself in the office or
house you'll be peace in your mom
that means you'll be always like their
kind and you will be very relieved like
you'll feel peace and calmness whatever
you do whatever you do wherever you are
it will give you peace inside I think
there's some thought I'm not a Bellini I
didn't she do manager model my own
budget should all my own shop Tinnell
mundo my embouchure say I get in a
filial son Thomas somebody really
determine me and then they're
comfortable today which Ana ee na they
are attended to love my Allah they will
make us some little sound with the
cabina so there is a vacuum on this so
then followed by this a company then you
think about the other wall like if
there's no then you can make a prayers
or you think about them to bring the
prosperity and harmony within the whole
world like even making a wish to
overcome the like a violence or hatred
or war even making a wish to overcome
the natural disaster of water earth to
like earthquake or fire or wind so even
when you have a positive part to
overcome those even in including in your
positive part this will give you like in
like inside value the qualities inside
so that rate because if there's a lot of
violence all around even this company
won't survive so in order to promote
that like even if you have a positive
intention inside then obviously it will
grow it will make it happen to bring
peace prosperity and to connect with the
whole world with peace and happiness so
that's how to help us to generate the
right motivation inside today I'm giving
somebody a Ganesha puja to judges in our
theatre to teacher education guitar
shingle color rather that questioned or
not in a said it or this Kalama didn't
tell you
she was damn good chill chill
she wrote the song about child origin
Azam could somebody imagine what is it
she'll go cardiologist additional health
additional seven then they could it does
my I'm sorry why didn't somebody made it
pay to join us
it's nobody did not your mother's so
sometimes one may like you bring some
like a misconception or some difficulty
or problem like for example usually
sometime of mind will wander towards the
wrong path like for example a bird for
example like a big tree and bird is like
on top of a tree and lots of proves and
because the wind is blowing constantly
be thin are the daily life the actions
of her daily life is like flowing like
like a win and because of the wind blow
constantly the tree moves back and for
the that the birth cannot eat the food
like properly so sometime because of our
evil mind is like one may think that
however if they cut down the root of the
tree so that I can eat without
distraction so sometime like one may
like to think that we also like
sometimes because the wants a negative
intention like to to bring success to
oneself we don't care about others and
work when it may likely to end up with
doing a lot of negative action so this
kinda thought may like to mislead
oneself or bring lot of distraction so
we should not want you know generate
those kind of like a selfish like a
achievements like this make we'd like
you to create a lot of destruction
towards oneself and others in a time
where somebody loves you don't have
somebody que tenia digest your asana
lavona and over you can repent over
suzhou layer paint over there so they
give us from this don't there somewhere
become Buddhist so therefore like
alimony
when you wake up if you try to try to
sit down and try to motivate like I want
to make this my day beautiful generating
good heart I will try to respect the
whole environment and every beings
around me
and if you take the try to generate
those intention and even if you come to
work or so you feel the energy you will
always have a lightness you will talk
nicely with your friends you will type
to go for likely and respect so it will
make your day beautiful and need to make
this possible also so that's how that if
you can do generate those intention like
every morning before come to the like
office or I keep in your daily life this
will make your day more meaningful and
beautiful some tombow delay our losses
somebody I was cutting so two toes
always somebody with your tuna never
catch every American a marathon becomes
a two varieties in charges so the sum
but it is so that's why I like if you
think that way in how the every beings
and environments are kind and if you
generate a good motivation from inside
then it will bring happiness to as
oneself or the success and also it will
create happiness twas the whole
environment so that's why we call like
once you have a good heart and Noble
heart your path and your like the work
will be successful like it will make
your life meaningful in a torrid
innovation to the power power I'm in the
kitchen potatoes Taniya bomb Aliotti
you're not into your shoes
Oh Todd and boy your money are they also
to watch is about making watch others
can watch are you know there are
somebody or capitalist
amiable two-volume among each other some
searches in the name of our motto
cutting from the hospital with each
having a photo and it's cheap teaches me
to
so that's why I like my final word is to
repay the kindness to us once on parents
because of the kindness of parents that
we are into this position right now
so that's why there is a to repay the
kindness
so if one's of parents is still alive
and take this opportunity to repay the
kindness because like when the parents
grow older they have a different view
because like if you don't see them then
they have some kind of feelings that I
said that they are like a negligent from
the society I said that they are
different war like I said so it brings a
lot of sadness to us them too and also
like when we try to disconnect from
those it brings that we don't have a
human human value inside the humanity
inside so that's why to bring this new
humanity to respect and repaying the
kindness to us once on parents is the
beginning so that they will be happy and
your life will be happy because it comes
with the cycle of aging because one will
take time one day and of course we to
one someone to take care so that's how
that it wants on parents is to live far
away keeping in touch with them also a
good way even once and parents already
passed away making a wish in prayers
also it's a proper way to generate good
intentions so then I do harmonized
within the company and office so this is
my final word to us you all and if you
have any questions please feel free
tardes ok
the ups and the downs and you're trying
to be more even keel perhaps more stable
in does that take away from the juice of
life itself does not take away from the
ups and downs their value in the
synthesis of the new totem is it enough
the mechanical Ukrainian booze I have -
are you good with chocolate your chances
I share yeah Daniel I pick this because
it's a mouthful to greet you in your
monkey so the letter I would say oh
maybe I need to show which others join
your materials and how much a service
attorney Java charges today sometime
especially nothing sometime a minimum
Sonny and I are never today in Brasilia
Campos mission done so - I am so those
are the materials generally they'd like
to balance everything to make a neutral
we cannot make it happen because
everything that we face anything in our
daily life it has to come from the
impedance from the past its increment
from the past that means someone will
born and they will be educated and there
will be a multi millionaires someone
domi the one may have a lot of education
but may not have anything someone one
may have a lot of physical problem and
disturbance
sickness things like that so - to make
it equal by like the other the help or
from one side
it won't happen but to balance that
right for example if one has a sickness
or things like that but if we have a
spiritual background like the
understanding about the law of cause and
effect then this will help you to face
easily instead of running over from
those difficulty and problem and
challenges but we can make it easy
because once you understand about the
law of cause and effect then it will
make you easy to face that the same
problem same disturbin same emotional
but if one has a deeper understanding
then that makes easy to face so that way
like if you know more more about the
philosophy that would make it easier to
face there's a beautiful example
actually how you know a person having as
are the the understanding or the
spiritual background or without helping
those can make a big difference even the
same problem will make a big difference
like if a person for their practice of
patience and tolerance a person who has
had practicing good heart loving
Compassion's this will make a big
difference so this is how that one can
make it easy like it's like a oceans
like the one who don't understand about
those it is just surfing on the top so
where we will come and goes but those
who understand the bought the the coffin
effect it is like a deep down the ocean
so where is this on a surface there is a

poor chicken when you're my lady I'm
having dinner
chanting other two didn't someone to
achieve job each other's when you vomit
in a quinion butter layer who taught you
to deliver like how the karmic imprints
from our past how it relates into this
life is like for example our multi a
rich father a parent has two children
and of course the father and the parents
will obviously had a great wish and hope
that both of the children would be more
successful well-educated will rich and
wealthy but it has to go through their
own individual imprints from their
parents so that's why I like the one
made by the father of the parents may
try their best to help them but because
of the individual imprints so one may
become the richest person but one may
become the most real person also so this
is because of the influence from the
past this will lead differently so
that's how sometimes like if you don't
understand about these the law of cause
and effect it brings a lot of
misunderstanding but a lot of
misunderstanding that why I am facing
this problem though I haven't done
anything
sometimes this brings a lot of more pain
and suffering and emotional distraction
because of the lack of misunderstanding
or lack of the understanding of what the
law of cause and effect or karmic
actions yes so there may be more
enthusiasm more opportunity for
challenges but if you want to be like
maybe you want to be Paris Hilton maybe
big problem coming okay do you follow me
I have one have big eye and maybe a big
problem coming okay
so on the thing that gave me the most
sense of appreciation and reverence for
my parents was having children of my own
and realizing just what they must have
gone through when I was and now sort of
as my comeuppance
my greatest source of all sake non
tranquillity is my own two children who
don't quite have this appreciation and
reverence for their parents I was
wondering if you had any suggestions or
guidance for how to become accepting of
our children being children Tony I'm not

I mean the Jerome kinetic I DeMarco
level of amateur Antonio approaches yeah
it is a challenging the best way to help
once on children for the
generation is to express from one side
the qualities that is good hard good
character and then spend more time with
them so this way and like prom once on
site you do your best to bring their
bright future and you do every angle
through spiritual means or in this daily
live so try to show the true example
from your side to be good patterns so
these are the things that they they are
the younger generation other like the
reflections from the mirror
so you'll be the mirrors so whatever you
try to reflect they will copy that so
this way that by showing every past from
your like saying nice work teaching
about the Attic the moral about what is
good what is that what is negative what
is positive what is the like a
generating good Hartman's so if you
constantly just not the same but you
apply that and if you express that wave
also one of the great benefit for the
for the children because they can really
see that and feel that from your own the
practice and like from my own point of
view of my own personal because I
visited like more than seven cities in
the United States what I feel about the
younger generation is actually the
parents has to take the responsibility
because from the very young age the
woman they're grown up are born like
parents are like titled train them to be
more desire training because try to give
every best toys and clothes and so many
stuff it is like even they don't know
what to say a tappa see parents are
trying to train them how to be more
desire giving everything and when they
have too much everything things doesn't
appreciate and if they because the when
the desire grows stronger
nature of design is never says fine that
means is like you're adding more fire
fuel in the fire it will only grow so
one is trading that giving everything
and if they get it
desire will grow more and more if they
don't get it the anger will arise
because wonder if you don't get it anger
so to balance that even from the very
young age teach about the contentment
teach up of the contentment of course
good food good shelter good clothes give
them but don't give two months because
even you might be having a difficulty to
wear which clothes in the morning so
that makes even the destruction just in
a mind even in daily rise also of course
you are training that way from the
younger age of course this problem will
face that so this is something that if
you can help them to be contented even
showing them to appreciate whatever one
has because like you can always show
people in somewhere where there's no
clothes no food no shelter even if you
let them feel that they will really
appreciate so this is something that I
saw in my order just mom I like to like
when so many things are happening in
this world so this is like to start from
our side as a beginners inspiring
oneself by even making a wish to
overcome those like a violence war and
once you have generated those intentions
stronger and stronger then you will have
an ability like I can actively make it
happen to stop that means you are
generating the energy inside by making
more wishes and when you have are such
an intention strong wish you generate
more and more then you generate that
energy and it will make it happen that
means first you inspire that to not
happen and once you gain an energy you
actively engage into an action to stop
that so this is how that of course like
having war is not a good sign but it
doesn't mean that I have to step back
and just blaming and like oh they are
not doing and by moment when we complain
those means we are participating into
that we are participating so that means
if we see those things feel bad about it
and
to make a prayers and send them those
that means we have tried to promote that
to overcome those so that's how that
like we do in our prayers look at this
about people 50 years lady for the
return of their country not fighting
back so they're practicing patience and
practicing compassion so this way slow
but long-term very good but if we react
in the opposite way of angry then we get
a like a problem in the Middle East
where people take turns striking back
each day there's no chitty chitty chitty
somebody somebody somebody finish every
church every ananda come to be energy to
mate with my other channel imbricated
monomial karna whatever way she the
Commission general who's actually the
most question that we receive from
others in the United States is how to
bring peace in happiness and how to
overcome the this problems this is the
the major question that wherever we
visit people are asked even the youngest
boils so like and how we respond about
road to general peace is like every now
and then every instant moment once on
time that if you have a fully full
intention even including in your prayer
even by promoting by saying awards and
expressing them to to be a good heart -
Jared good hard wooden inside and tied
to to feel the kindness of every living
beings in environment so in order to
repay the kindness they shall recall the
repaying the kindness is - wishing every
beings to be happy
wishing every beings and environment to
overcome from the suffering so this is
something that we instant like every
time that we think about ourselves our
biggest
su camino de l'automne teacher so
 chair so become generation
dollar today in the company of my mother
come to love house become a your two
thousand it is literally like for us is
like like like the patience is the key
to to apply in our daily lives
so whatever though we face problem
because we are same human being maybe we
have more time to apply practice so
patience is the things that we try to
practice because we face part of
difficulty because see we are on the
road for more than seventeen months and
then like every new town for about a
week then we drive to other place so
loss of effort we have to use a lot of
energy and if you don't have those
patients inside we cannot make it you
cannot make it non stopping so that's
why even like even people when they have
some kind of like a difficulty in
patience so we try to express that like
we have so many better way to overcome
that so best way is to practice patience
so this is something that even we
seventeen months no argument okay not
one that doesn't put eight of you people
in the car may be lasting two hours okay
