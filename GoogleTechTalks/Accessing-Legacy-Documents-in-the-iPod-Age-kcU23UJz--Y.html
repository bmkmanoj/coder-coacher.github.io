is Bob Aires I've been in the computer
business looking around maybe not the
before many of you were born but getting
there and Silicon Valley I've worked for
Xerox and foredeck research and for
Adobe and I just retired from Adobe and
I've been interested in documents ever
since basically the era of the Xerox
star workstation which may ring a bell
with some people which was approximately
started in 1975 as an outgrowth from
Xerox PARC in their workstations so I've
been interested in you know displaying
documents on screens and looking at him
pretty much since then and most recently
in Adobe for 13 years I was it was very
interested in Adobe's Portable Document
format and how that relates to
displaying documents and some people get
lessons faster than others I got a
couple lessons really really late in in
my career and I'm basically going to try
and make to my two main points in this
talk and they're sort of mundane points
but maybe they're interesting because
they sure didn't didn't come to me early
it took me a while and while I was
making this preparing this talk I
noticed that I was pushing into the area
that TV Raman is very interested in with
accessibility so I'm going to give this
talk really fast and then then raman can
sort of move it into the era of of you
know not of access media other than
display devices
so legacy documents everybody's been
saying the printed page is going away
they're not going away they're even
being created I can remember 15 years
ago people insisting to me that text
books were dead that every student would
have ebooks and they'd be wonderful
because they're be physical I'm sorry
I'm still waiting so all that stuff is
still there and you can wait for the new
era or you can adapt and you know
Adobe's made quite a lot of money by
betting on what amounts to old book
formats and old paper surviving no
matter what anybody wants to interrupt
it anytime and ask questions feel free
so what's what did like it see documents
look like first of all there they tend
to be paginate they're not HTML Scrolls
the idea is you're looking at a page and
then you look at the next page etc that
may be structured that is you may have a
file that's got interesting stuff like
paragraphs and sections or you may have
a really old legacy document which is
basically just a you know scan um the
for the drachma was formatted okay see
some process decided the picture of the
dog goes on page five probably because
the description of the dog went on page
five that process could have been
completely automated like what happens
if you press the print button in HTML it
couldn't put in completely manual like
all books were made up to like 1975 it
can either be sort of interesting or it
can be absolutely vital if the text
reads you know the equation on the
bottom of the page will show you that
then the equation better be at the
bottom of the page
so there's been whole history of how to
deal with legacy documents in the
computer age I'll just put a little idea
from Adobe because that's my most recent
thing though we started out reproduce
the sheet of paper feed me eight and a
half by 11 sheets of paper you get eight
and a half by 11 pseudo sheets of paper
out and you know Adobe's had a lot a lot
of bad press over the last dozen years
Oh PDF is just good for legacy document
so i can't read PDF on smaller on the
other hand they've done pretty well in
that business as soon as adobe acrobat
was launched with PDF everybody realized
an eight and a half by eleven document
on five by seven screen wasn't the
world's best thing reading aids came
came in kept getting added to adobe
acrobat which is now probably 20 times
the size that it was one when it was
launched and these have taken various
forms there's scaling they're scrolling
there was a feature that probably nobody
in this room has ever seen that that
would that would that would run you
through to column text by running you
down the first column and then down the
second column if you had if you hit the
arrow keys if the document was
structured right there was word
extraction there's reef on ting for
better better visualization there's
various form of linking they're
searching okay all things that are you
know dynamic computer-based stuff
operating on what amounts to legacy
pages then more recently Adobe did
simple dr. simple page relay out which I
actually did which is in current Acrobat
some people know where it is some people
don't wear Acrobat will actually attempt
to take a legacy document and turn into
eight and a half by 11 inch page single
page into a page that's as wide as your
screen without scaling which probably
means since you know or less
concentration of area if your screen is
is five inches wide you'll end up with a
five by 22 inch page which may not be
wonderful but it's a lot easier to read
than one that we have to scroll left and
right Wow and the next obvious step
forward is document
where you relay out the whole documents
so now the pages are quote the right
size and the first thesis of this whole
talk is that whole line of reasoning
works for screens that are more or less
the size of pages and fails on small
screens and I'll pursue that in next
slide so there's been a lot of research
in relay out I've done my share the most
public stuff was done by David's Allison
at Microsoft you have a document you may
have metadata you may not you might
think that if you had all of the
metadata that you could do a perfect
real ale that is supposed that you and I
know that the document was originally
laid out by a computer program looking
at this collection of document metadata
and these environment facts like what
kind of those signs of pages are you
might imagine if you could just if you
just could get that program again and
change those little variables say no
it's not an eight and a half by eleven
page it's a a four page and press the
button you get quote the right answer
for the relay out process because that's
how the first one came my thesis is
that's right if you're converting from
eight and a half by eleven days by ten
maybe even seven by five but it doesn't
scale now
why doesn't it scale down and I say it
doesn't scale down not to any theoretic
sense but from trying to read stuff on
small screens it the first main reason
doesn't scale down is because the whole
notion of page layout implies there are
multiple things together on the page
that are arranged in some beneficial way
as your scale move the size of the page
smaller and smaller fewer and fewer what
you might think of this document atoms
fit on the page what only one document
Adam fits on a page you're not
positioning things anymore relative to
one another and we can debate about
whether the atom is the word or the
paragraph but at some point the whole
idea that you're looking at a collection
of atoms that are that are arranged in a
matter which is both aesthetically
pleasing and also beneficial for the
reading experience falls apart oh my
what are we going to do about it well
the color see is we have a dynamic
medium here so that we don't have to
just relay out we don't have to create
the visual experience of we reprinted
Moby Dick but we printed it on one of
those little bitty books you can buy it
only has 2 by 4 inch pages right or Moby
Dick's about it that might actually work
but physics textbook on 2 by 4 inch
pages with lots of lots of illustrations
so you step back to say oK we've got a
problem that is we can't scale things
down to the kind of portable devices are
coming in via the what the historic
layout process the good news is we've
got a dynamic medium there so we have an
escape hatch
so that was the first thesis you can't
just keep scaling things down if you
write a computer program that does a
marvelous job of relay out and you rely
out under 2 by 3 inch pages and in fact
you get the correct answer you know your
your your algorithms you know did a
search of giant space and use all the
facts and got the right answer it's not
what the user wants because he doesn't
want his physics textbook scaled down to
2 by 3 inch page circuits what he wants
is a dynamic medium oak today we can see
that there's lots of things you can look
at not particularly physics textbooks
but there's some of them on the web that
are quote dynamic and don't have page
break problems what they do have is a
different problem which is you lose
context I mean every day I read and I
look at a page and it says click the
photograph and make it bigger and I
click the photograph and what happens
Wham i'm looking at a very large
photograph if i'm lucky it's captioned
but i'm just looking at a photograph
it's not like the experience of looking
at a textbook and say moving it closer
to look at the make the photograph
larger the whole context has gone away
so that's the second point that I see
along with the dynamic medium we need to
find a way to retain the context in the
same sense that people did with old
legacy documents where it was really
easy because you couldn't go wham and
find yourself with page 87 you know
there were times when you had to like
look in the colossi and stick your
finger in between the pages okay people
are used to that but you don't sort of
suddenly not suddenly sort of reading a
physics textbook and then you say where
am i how do i turn the page backward to
get where I was okay you don't have that
experience and you have that experience
all the time
on the web cut why well I think it's
because it was sort of the cheap answer
in an HTML 1.0 so I bring back the
layout issues and I say what should you
do when you're looking at a printed page
of something like a physics textbook and
you want to take advantage of the
dynamic medium you don't jump to a
bigger copy of the picture enlarge the
picture in place what do I mean by that
I mean go back to the example of we
imagine we can we can perfectly relay
out things imagine that we took that all
that example I use of the we're going to
reel out the book by appealing to the
original layout process and changing the
page size imagine going back to their
changing the page size and then scaling
the photograph and then saying process
really out the page suddenly what would
happen to on page 57 you get a bigger
picture of a dog but it would still look
like a laid out book and the dog is
still in context and you can get to the
dog by moving forward or backward so if
the guy says make a picture bigger and
he's looking at a web page you shouldn't
jump him to a bigger copy of the picture
you should create them a web page where
that picture is bigger but not
impossible to do and the same thing
holds throughout don't jump to a
reference I see that every day on the
page to you it says you know and
so-and-so claim that one and you click
one Wham you're back there on you know
what amounts to page 657 looking at one
two three four expand it in place you
have a dynamic medium you've got an
optional exposition somewhere you know
you don't want to put a big
parenthetical phrase in fine put an
empty parenthetical phrase in hide it
and if a guy clicks it don't go win
expand it out in place and do the relay
out your computer's fast okay you can do
that you see actually a little bit of
the show/hide thing
in blogs turn invisible bits you know
people put a little quiz in and say
click for answer that's the expansion in
place kind of thing I'm talking out but
that's just sort of mundane
one-dimensional stuff but there's no
reason why you can't imagine really our
real laying out the entire page or
document with slightly different ground
rules hey the references they are the
footnote is there whatever so that's
basically all i want to say those are
only two points the real out with a
different page size works fine if the
page is more or less the same area and
when the page size is small it stops
working and if you're in the business of
creating marvelous layout algorithms
that define wonderful information from
the legacy document and then think deep
about what would have happened with the
layout program if item really said the
pages two by three and push the layout
button you may get a mathematically
perfect answer but it's not the answer
the user is going to want if it's like a
physics textbook taking advantage of
dynamic media is I hope the fix but the
dynamic medium has to retain context it
has to retain the simplicity of the user
experience and how to do that's
interesting because of course at some
point you can't expand the picture of
the dog in place and keep a lot of
context if the bigger picture the dog is
exactly the area of the users ed BD
screen so there's a lot going on there
but I I claim that the answer is not
going way in with hyperlinks it's not
even forward and back buttons it's
probably not even keeping a little
representation of the tree of how you
got to hear up at the top of the screen
I have trouble to go screen with those
trees and I'm a computer nerd okay so so
those are my twink to only two points
and you have sort of background
questions or whatever on that I'll take
them now otherwise all that we're on to
explain to you why this is even more
important when we're
I'm talking about this place yeah quick
question why not assume the picture dog
in place
relay any other thing what do you what
do you mean you mean like zoom the page
picture the dog appears in some area
page yeah so you want to figure so it
zooms within that area
because if i went and and obscures the
text which used to be merely to its
right whether the frame stays the same
so you have to scroll around okay
because if you if you like zoom the
whole page and then recenter the image
then you have a problem that the caption
says and then the dog and it's off the
right-hand side of the screen what I'm
saying is you ought to really out the
page so that they solely so that so the
caption wraps effectively
Robin
okay so I started thinking of these
problems many years ago when I was doing
my PhD work where I was actually asking
the question what did it mean to
effectively read documents and that work
actually led to building a system that
red fairly complex mathematical
documents wonderful piece of software
that served a marketplace of one of
namely me and then I moved on to other
things such as you know making feeding
things effectively on the web but a lot
of this thing self comes back to the
mobile space in a much more interesting
way because at the end of the day after
you used your mobile phone to do
something you actually want you the goal
is to finally read the right information
right you don't pull your mobile phone
out of your pocket for the pleasure of
clicking radio buttons or checking
checkboxes what you are doing is you
want to read the train timetable or you
want to read that quick thing that you
asked wanted to check in a reference or
whatever so if you ask those questions
of how do I take documents and then read
it on a small screen of this whole space
becomes very interesting because just
step outside the computer interface and
ask all the questions about what
documents work well for you so
newspapers work beautifully right you
can fold up a newspaper so you are
reading the sports column and that
picture of these lines up with that
thing and there's a lot of context
happening then similarly with the
textbook with table of in the contents
and indices and so on so this whole
question of how you take contact and
then leverage a dynamic display and
hypermedia but then take into account
the fact that you have a small display I
believe is an area that we are all
beginning to just crash the surface on
we essentially sort of God in a way to
some extent on the desktop by not fully
leveraging the dynamic nature of the
display because it displays big on the
small display it becomes very
interesting and similarly when you are
doing spoke and output it becomes very
interesting because what you have
there is spoken interaction is
essentially temporal so you now have a
one dimensional time-bound stream of
content that's flowing by you so you
don't have the luxury of moving around
it and browsing so you are sort of there
as a passive listener listening to this
active stream flowing by in contrast to
the paper world we're used to this big
display sitting there and you're I can
look at up to the left corner and down
to the bottom right corner so for
instance one of the things that was very
effective in the system I built for my
tastes um you could actually give
meaningful labels to things so in a
printed book the following works very
well right you read a proof and it says
by theorem 7.5 and lemma 8.3 we get
equation 9 and hence the result now
admittedly this is not the most
user-friendly presentation of any
content but you will see this in
mathematics box and physics books all
the time now this works well in the
printed world it does it sort of is
suboptimal in the online world and it's
completely unworkable in the spoken law
and what what I had built in this book
in the speech interaction system was
when you read equation theorem 7.3 and
as you understood it um you could label
that Fermat's Last here and then all
references to that thing would get
replaced from being 7.32 formats last
year of the step back and ask why is
that thing 7.3 that act of numbering
that equation 7.3 and using it in a
reference as boy equation 7.3 is an
artifact of the batch oriented
typesetting formatting printing process
and when you are in a dynamic world that
can get lead bout so a good list Packer
good Python hacker I go your immediate
reaction is to say let me use late
binding to solve this problem and late
binding actually solves a lot of these
problems that Bob Bob was talking about
both in terms of making very late bound
decisions
as to where you place things and also
how you name thanks so if you bring up a
webpage and you know you're looking for
well the weather forecast if you go to
weather com weather com will try to tell
you a lot of things is wonderful content
there but how do you narrow it down to
the one thing you want is your challenge
and a lot of these things get addressed
by dynamic resizing what I call dynamic
labeling and then dynamic 4matic so Bob
you want to take it back or what is it
mentally into the bank some sounds fair
so so there's a bit of time here so like
to expand on one of the things that I
that I wrote down in the notes they're
sort of you know more story instances
about what I was pushing a little little
war story the first time I realized how
important context was was at Sarek's
park when the Altos were replaced by the
Dorados much faster computers at the
time the Bravo text editor was running
on the Altos which turned into Microsoft
Word give you a flavor and they were
fine text editors and they had a scroll
button just like everybody does today
and so you hit this you know you could
get the scroll button and sort of scroll
the page up say half a page if you had
in the right place and on the Altos
scrolling worked fine you could read
pages and you could scroll them up and
keep reading the page and then they move
the entire software system to the DRA
tow a much faster computer and reading
documents got much harder
and I couldn't figure it out for five or
ten minutes what happened in the days of
Bravo if you scroll the page up half a
page what happened somebody bit bleed
the entire screen effectively up halfway
cleared the bottom half of the page and
then wrote the new text in it of course
exactly the same thing happened on in
Toronto but in Bravo if you scrolled up
roughly half a page the line you were
reading at the bottom jumped up half a
page but you could find it again because
for like a quarter of a second it was
the last line above the white space on
the Dorado they jumped it up and
repainted the the succeeding text all in
a refresh time and so when you scrolled
up half a page you didn't know which was
the last line you read you had to go
find it again okay simple little thing
you just lost context because the page
jumped up Kabam as I said earlier you
know and you had to go figure out where
you were so there's a similar breakdown
that happens today on the web so if you
look at what you would think of today as
a slightly old-fashioned web interface
of you and think about an email
interface for you know a web interface
for any email the the old-fashioned web
interface would go reload the page and
so if you're listening to it you are
listening to the new message and life is
clean but it looks ugly because there is
this visual refresh flickr going on if
you look at a new what i would call in
more current day web interface where you
essentially update the contents of the
innerhtml of a dev through script and
the whole pace is the same and a small
part of that page strangers the visual
experience is good if you are listening
to it you don't know what to listen to
again
so you get the same context break that
walk talk to your God and a low vision
users are not just to speech user will
run into the same thing because you have
a big display there is a whole male
somebody over there you can say all of
this stuff and then the one frame that
contains the mail message that you are
looking at changes you actually have a
hard time telling what change unless you
are actually completely capable of using
that interface and so the context the
context break happens in many many
situation is it sort of always
interesting to see a technology
generation Fleur and then to that a
certain DC book that's why it worked in
the old one and that's why it breaks and
the new one yeah I think one more point
about displaying things in context so
when I bring up in the original slides
was there are some good examples of this
in sort of the simple layout mode of
source language editors some people call
it progressive revelation okay you can
tell your source editor for instance
that you don't want to see anything
that's indented more than more than more
than four spaces collapse the whole
structure okay so suddenly your for loop
not only you know only is signified by
the four and the whole loop content
isn't there and you can click it back
and expand it back out in in place okay
this is really too ma'am I a vital
concept that shouldn't just be relegated
to the issue of to the popular thing of
source editors now it's really easy to
do with source editors does the whole
thing is 1d we're talking about lines
and there is sort of no no layout
problem involved you can you just you
know kill off the line to display them
but you can move that whole structure
okay I can you know I can take my source
program and I can say eliminate all the
nested for is ok now eliminate all the
fours now let me everything except that
except the you know except the procedure
declarations right
what is it like when you say everything
except the procedure declarations you
like you're looking at a table of
contents of this source module so you
can imagine that whole thing applying in
a book I open up the book I see the
table of contents I've got a dynamic
medium now I'm not restricted to what
was going on in in you know hundred
years ago so it in table of contents it
doesn't say you know the beauty and the
beast page 11 says the beauty and the
beast the entire chapter is there it
just is invisible so I can double click
it and the chapter appears and we can
carry that we can carry the entire
structure through mapping it from a
progressive revelation source editor you
know maybe all of the pictures are
thumbnails until I click them the
footnotes there isn't the foot know that
quote the bottom of the page anymore
there may be a little one but you don't
have to have a one at the bottom of the
page click the one and expands the in
line okay you know and you can carry
that on for yourself but you can imagine
a situation where you know the entire
document the entire presentation
whatever it is is a tree but instead of
having to tree navigate and you know put
up to the user what amounts to the path
name or how we got to what he's looking
at now up in the top line you can expand
you know there will be expand it in line
click anything that's expanded to make
it go away and you know you know I open
up the book I see the title i click it I
see the what amounts of all the chapter
titles i click the one I want you they
are you know you get the flavor
sometimes when you see these kinds of
things and tools like source code
editors because those are tools built by
software engineers for software
engineers and they might actually be
further ahead in terms of exploiting all
of the facilities of this medium then
say things that be a software engineers
are built for the rest of the world
because of age as Bob said you know hide
everything after beyond indentation
level for right my
it's a metaphor control x dollar that's
what you do an evac side right but if
you think about it there are two things
that actually drive that a programming
languages are very structured because
they were designed to be passed by the
computer their structure and human human
consumes documents for human consumption
don't necessarily have that clean of
structure but there is also the other
half of it which is sauce quorum editors
have always done this because they were
designed for programmers and software
engineers always build waters good for
software engineers because it makes our
life easier right and I do that and I'd
have the one thing I material also
because it's strictly 1d in line or if
it also is very easy problem that's it
yeah questions doing so I have a
question your premise is that the
screens are getting smaller yeah here at
Google the screens are actually getting
bigger
no we're software engineers so maybe
what to do for ourselves and not what we
do for the people out there the three
two are walking around with icons and
cell phones
I out just as as a as a user of
documents much rather have a larger
screen than technology that's that
somehow lets me read text on an ipod
screen because even with the best
technology that you're describing here
there's nothing of information that fits
on the page just a number of bits it's
pretty amazing legit that you know not
knocking big screens I think some of
this generalizes even even to big
screens like which is why I said about
expanding the table contents in place
instead of affect me to jump to page 9
but I think that there are large trends
that are going against big screens in
particular you know you know
businessweek or something will tell you
that you know the computer interface has
arrived and it is the cell phone just
because empirical observations the
computer observation says says people
walking down the street you know just go
out there and walk down the street you
will not see the majority of the people
carrying a laptop you will not see the
majority people carry a notepad you will
not even see the majority people
carrying and carrying an ipaq but you
will see the majority of people carrying
a cell phone you know people have people
have voted now I know that's strictly
true or not but but it's certainly true
that the computer the guy has with them
is the one he's going to use other
things you could say there were ten
years ago i suddenly realized when I was
leaning Charles Dickens all those books
are you know stage in England
if you read those books you observe
something fine people can candles and
lanterns approval nowadays we don't
carry candles and lanterns into a room
we walk into a room and flip the lights
so at the time I wrote something where I
said when you carry the laptop to the
display the 20th century is they were
carrying and candle into a room with a
19th century and we wouldn't be doing
this we should be carrying a portable
device like a phone walk into a room and
use whatever big displays me I believe
that vision will happen so you probably
will not be squinting at your life on
screen because that said even if you
have a big screen now this is the this
is the part of me that is greedy better
speak so you would say well if I have a
big screen I could just do what I do in
the print world today and layout and be
done with it but the greedy part of me
says if I know how to do dynamic layer
and do dynamic expansion and collapse
and collapsing and I can make that work
on small screen with a legacy dr then
with the big screen i can consume 10
times as much information effectively as
i do today with say a big screen in the
negative of it so they could be value in
it either way sure
because it's what you know clearly all
of the layout Prix me know to do on
people have developed over 2,000 years I
mean did you took a big jump after
Gutenberg but even before that he sort
of you how to do someone i'm sooo what
does it mean for enough i think now you
have the computer disney now you have to
pick this land you have the ability to
render to every rapidly but what can we
do in terms of rendering that makes your
whole class of consuming information for
and you can also i mean i give with
robin it says at some point your walk
into a room like this you'll expect that
there's some nice interaction medium
around on the subway maybe not but you
can also upscale it is wrong i'll
suggest it which is today on your wire
screen between tea room what do you see
you see 35 fairly small icons and you
double click one lamb as i said earlier
you know the other icons are gone right
you could imagine something more clever
like it expands in place and pushes a
little icons out to the edges so you see
the relatively the same layout the thing
you want to read Fickell's eighty
percent of the screen but all of the
other icons are still there they've been
pushed out to the margins but they're
still sort of in their same relative
geometric orientation so if your mailbox
was way over there on the left your
mailbox is still way over there on the
left glad I could rescue guess
some of the stuff he does is very
text-based where you just actually jump
around in in the document could someone
be understand I believe that
he's done sort of suggests 3d interface
is like what you're describing Lee
you always will always keep context but
sort of different sections that you're
interested in grow relatively in size
I think is your main interface book as
an interesting example of
hospital information system navigation
it doesn't seem to get long traction
with the big software
talk about the since you know we you
know the GUI hasn't really changed in 20
years in terms of terms of its
expressive power even though the
computers 100 times faster profession
but but that's a second talk okay yeah
so oh did you mess up your video just
hand you the mic over over this hack and
so yeah sorry I still like to see this
this point I grieve you about the large
screen but I say yell if you grow the
screen and some says I can grow the
problem space to bring up the icons
bring up the icons and whatever so so
I'd still like to see it I mean in some
sense display sizes like memory and
cycles on a computer right i mean your
handheld now has more cycles and more
memory then a then a desktop machine say
10 years ago but and you know in the
mid-90s and the smaller devices were you
know getting popular like the pilot a
lot of the old programming tricks of how
to program on small footprint devices
suddenly became relevant now the small
devices are no longer that small
footprint you just need to be able to
build software the way you used to in
1992 be able to program on those things
and it but the target is still moving
right it's and I can you know you guys
are you guys are probably probably
follow this through it or whether but I
can I can narrow it down to google and
say why is it the one I'm looking at the
first 10 hits in my google page and i
take the fourth when i click it why is
it that the all the 10 Google hits
completely vanished why don't you know
the first we get pushed up and made
small on the bottom six get pushed down
and made small and the one I wanted to
see occupy the middle eighty-five
percent of my screen I claim you know
its work and you know in in some case
unfortunately it's work that
one group can't do because it percolates
over in 20 variety variety of other
things but I'd sure like to see it in
terms of the in terms of the context
gmail is doing some of the things you're
proposing some of the time
at least in when you want your view in
one thread yeah but the message expand
skin in the contacts that's a good
example and they actually they have a
couple of levels where they compress the
context more or less depending on how
much there is and then they allied the
thread contents and clear what the
previous person said gets alighted as a
bunch of dot yeah yeah so I actually
that makes me think I'm hopeful that
this these kind of ideas will become
more available as certain people figure
out how to do this in a checks for order
browser technologies
it gets much harder when you hit the the
end of one domain and you you sort of
have to you know talk talk to the next
guy over but effects of senior power
well google images already displays the
page containing the image with some
other stuff next to it so
that we have the technology
you'll actually spoke about how content
is displayed can you speak a little bit
more about the problems in manipulating
or interacting with the content of the
screen feed a handheld device or be the
big screen oh yeah that's an interesting
area about you know you know I said
blithely you know that you asked to make
something smaller you asked make
something bigger without at all going
into the into the gestures and that's
certainly interesting in interesting
area because after all something might
not be both small small bowl and bigger
bowl at the same time depending on
whether I wanted to go down one more
level or or pop it up so it's not just a
simple gesture but I claim I claim no
expertise in this area but Robin might
have some more insane um I mean most of
what I've worked on in the space has
been around consuming content as a Vista
producing but some of the stuff that you
do in order to consume content in a
clean way like this which is to sort of
leverage the structure and then do
progressive revelation also then helps
you in manipulating things because once
you have so you know you're sitting well
yeah so you're using the structure of
your code say to do progressive hiding
and expanding then you often end up
using that strain structure to refactor
code you can given that I've always
written all my documents and markup
languages I sort of end up doing the
same thing on manipulating content which
is I end up manually manipulating
structural blocks where I believe some
of the interesting stuff needs to happen
is between marry a clean simple to use
GUI that they know the rest of the world
that doesn't like programming languages
can use while sort of retaining
structure I mean there have been
products and the past that have tried to
do that that have been you know very XML
sgml oriented like framemaker plus HTML
comes to mind but I'd given that those
things weren't as successful as struck
rad fans what I wanted it's unclear
whether it was because the user
interface wasn't perfect or because too
much of the world's information is more
semi structured than structure so there
is a continuum there then you have to
find the right sweet spot because to
make the manipulation easy you want good
structure but if you put too much
structure then you end up getting too
rigid and the thing that guy wants to
create doesn't quite fit that structure
and he completely escapes that model and
goes to you know totally unstructured
mess let me uh let me let me add a PMT
vomit so there's been a history of we
might call to view editors okay I can
remember some from IBM long while ago
where I not only reveal to you the the
laid-out final result like you'd expect
in a book but I reveal to you the markup
and the idea is you can then navigate in
the mark-up okay the market was
effectively manifesting you the tree
over there and in the other window XML
spy okay such such products such
research experiments have sort of worked
in the sense of they did what the
authors said they were going to do but
never set the world on fire so I suspect
that's not the right answer from the
actual yeah human beings point of view
yeah I suspect that is there that's why
I said there is a sweet spot that hasn't
been discovered in that space that
I think you hit the nail right on the
head when you said that there's a lot
more seven structured of structured
information
and sort of i remember my phone has a
predecessor named ABC and it had a
built-in syntax directed editor and it
was too much in the direction of total
structure control and I sort of I had a
very strong negative reaction to death
piece of code so for Python I sort of
went the other way I didn't have
anything built in at nowadays of course
their support in in Emacs and other
editors that is definitely of the
semi-structured basis because it
recovers gently when yeah well well it
when the structure is is sort of broken
yeah you more that's not it you know
between the spot say you wanna cut yes
the end is what happens right most of
the world's authors will never give you
structure if you tell them give me all
the structure because they're lazy right
at the same time in fact what happens is
most of the time you realize there is
some structure in one thing that you're
doing only after you have done it three
times so if you have to sort of first
figure out what the structure in him
what you are doing it is even before
you've done it once you never do it so I
suspect my gut feel about where that
sweet spot is is that you let people do
things and then as they are doing it you
let them discover that structure and as
they discover that structure they tell
you about it and that's what I think of
as the semi structured so you know
you're writing a document but as your
document when you do have a set of
numbers that is you know n equations or
something you get some extra brownie
points for saying it's an equation
because it just works better and then
therefore you do it and then that world
works because you progressively build it
up we're getting a bit into sociology
here but I green Romany time death I
agree with wrong with it you know the
idea that you tell offers how to write
their documents never worked in the past
and it's much less like it work in the
future because you know just read blogs
these days there's 50 million authors
out there
but on the other hand if you think about
it blogger blog authors are in some
sense more structure than the previous
generation of HTML authors at least they
tell you what the block that is what
they are commenting on which you know
you didn't have in a flat HTML page
because they all use movable type
exactly how do you blogger com or
whatever else yeah okay thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
