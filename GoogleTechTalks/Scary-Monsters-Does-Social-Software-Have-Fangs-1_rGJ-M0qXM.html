an expert on social software and does
lots of consulting with large companies
helping them implement it and bringing
blogs and wiki's and the kind of tools
that we take for granted into ordinary
companies and she's going to tell us the
problems that people have their and lots
of other interesting things I'm sure she
lovely thankee um okay so I've been a
social software consultant for about
three years i started off calling myself
a blog consultant and when i said i was
going to do this for a living people
kind of laughed and went how can any how
no one is get really needs to be told
how to blog you know this isn't going to
work but it turns out that it's a bit
trickier than it seems when you're using
blogs in business so i'm going to talk
primarily about using blogs internally
because our blogs and wikis internally i
think the the external stuff the
marketing stuffs been fairly well
covered but what I focus on is helping
companies understand how they can use
blogs and wiki's and what happens what
you can do when things go a bit wrong
what I tend to find is that companies
will install the software because it's
very easy to install a few people will
start using it but then they won't
actually be able to get the wider
community internally to use the software
so much of what I'm saying is from
experience of working with clients and
the problems that we've actually seen
and the way that we've dealt with them
so just out of curiosity how many of you
are already using blogs and wiki's
internally how many of you would if you
thought they were any use right um
because i think the the main difference
between blogs and wikis and the way that
they use internally rather than
externally is basically wiki's for
collaboration blogs for publishing and
it's fairly kind of clear if you're into
this whole to like tech stuff how how
the technology works but it's not always
clear why some people don't adopt social
software so even if you have people who
understand wiki's and even said active
on something like Wikipedia they don't
necessarily like using this software
internally for work and as there's a
whole number of reasons why this is that
we've come across firstly it is kind of
slightly odd very low level fear of
social humiliation but people get really
quite concerned sometimes about how
they're going to come across to their
peers and particularly their bosses
they're scared of saying the wrong
saying of making mistake and looking
like an idiot quite often this is kind
of a very low level fear that they don't
even realize themselves they just feel
kind of uncomfortable with the idea of
talking publicly to their colleagues
people feel quite comfortable with email
because email is essentially a
one-to-one communication or many to many
but it feels private so even though your
emails are going to be stored on servers
even though they can be forwarded and
printed out and all the rest of it it
feels like private medium like you're
not exposing yourself so people will
send email to happy to see see others in
and BCC and all of this stuff but when
you're actually giving people what is a
very demonstrably public place to work
then this kind of shyness sets in
there's also a lot of people who
actually aren't very comfortable with
the idea of writing it seems kind of
like slightly weird to say that in a
highly literate society but people have
different comfort levels with the way
that they express themselves some people
are much better talking to others and
actually having conversations other
people feel very comfortable writing
rather than
using the phone but there are there is
always a subset of people who just feel
uncomfortable using the written word in
a kind of what seems to them like a semi
formal environment and again you see
with email you get a lot of very
informal writing so no one really minds
if your Spelling's rubbish no in really
mines if your grammar is a bit off if
you're very writing very brief emails
very to-the-point emails that's kind of
all acceptable within the email culture
but the perception of blogs and wiki's
is that it's much more formal that it
requires a much higher level of skill
with with writing again this is
something that people will never admit
they'll never kind of actually say oh I
feel really uncomfortable writing in
public but there's a lot of this is kind
of just bubbling underneath the surface
other issues is it particularly it this
varies from organization to organization
if you have a very open organization
where you can kind of do whatever you
like then this doesn't I think isn't so
much of an issue but within hierarchical
organizations unless permission is
explicitly given to use specific tools
that can really get in the way the
people feel like well maybe I'm not
supposed to be doing this and if my boss
sees maybe this will be a problem and I
really don't want to have that
confrontation so unless there's explicit
permission to use social tools then then
there because I think they have the word
social in and blogs are seen very much
as I will their Diaries and they're kind
of personal so there's a sort of
psychological mismatch between what
people think the blogs and wiki's should
be used for what they're actually used
for 4 in business there's also a level
of trust within the tool do you trust
the tool to do what you want it to we
see this particularly with wiki's of
people when I've been been in in in
organizations showing people wiki's for
the first time and you go through that
enlightenment process
so this is a wiki it's a web page that
everyone can edit and the first thing
they say is so you mean other people can
change my stuff yes other people can
change your stuff can I stop them and if
there's this sort of idea of kind of not
feeling quite comfortable that they can
trust the content that's put on a wiki
or the content that's on a blog and that
they don't necessarily trust the tools
either because well what if it loses
everything and I think this is something
I do very much whether you have that
issue here because of the culture that
you have here but I see it a lot in in
other organizations and finally well not
finally trusting the tool to still be
there in a year or two years time I mean
this has been a big issue I worked with
one investment bank and they already had
a small wiki that was being used by IT
and they installed a company-wide wiki
and a lot of people like well you know
if we put all of our data in this is it
still going to be here in ears time are
there any guarantees from management
that this is a secure place for us to
put stuff it's not just gonna I'm going
to wake up one day get into work and
everything that I've written is going to
be gone the biggest barrier for many
people it's actually they just don't see
the point they kind of look at social
software and they see it as an overhead
something they have to do in addition to
all of the work that they're already
doing so they look at it it's a bit like
knowledge management software that was
promoted as being divid wonderful way to
gather your company's knowledge and and
manage it and no one really ever figured
out what the hell that meant you manage
knowledge but what happened with lots of
companies spent lots of money on these
big huge systems and then said to their
stuff right we want you to put all of
your documents in this and their staff
just comment why they couldn't see any
benefit to them there is a definite you
can see the benefit to the business if
all the documents and everything's all
in some big workflow and categorize than
that but the overhead for the
individuals was just way too high they
didn't get any person
benefit out of this at all and the
biggest challenge that I have when I'm
explaining this stuff to people is how
it can help them and why it's actually
useful so let's say that you've got
you've decided that you're going to use
say wiki for product documentation or
product specs or for logging constantly
changing information or you're going to
use a blog to publish stuff that maybe
you've been sending up by email on a
regular basis or to communicate with
your team or to keep your own notes or
whatever and you actually want to start
getting other people involved in in what
you're doing and using this software at
same time there are kind of two basic
routes for doing this it's kind of like
top-down and bottom-up and the
traditional way of getting people to use
software is to go here's the software
you will now use it it's sort of
top-down command and control approach
and that kind of works all right firstly
if you have that kind of hierarchical
organization where you have managers you
have control over what you do and
secondly it works if the managers
persist in forever saying you must do
this otherwise you're in trouble as soon
as managers stop saying you must use
this otherwise you're in trouble people
will just kind of like if they're not
convinced it's useful they'll just stop
using it it's amazing how quickly people
will abandon software that they don't
find useful the bottom-up approach is
kind of like your grassroots sort of
organic approach where people will just
start using stuff because they think
that it's it's interesting it's useful
it helps them so I've seen in a number
of companies it's kind of like Trojan
mouse projects where somebody somewheres
got a little server that they can just
like shove a blog or on shove a wiki on
there you tell IT they just kind of get
on with it and it kind of spreads
through the organization and eventually
someone kind of goes on
it didn't realize we had blogs didn't
realize we had a wiki where did that
come from and that kind of grassroots
effect can be very powerful in getting
people to use this kind of software
because the only people are using at
people who see that it's useful but it
does risk firstly having multiple
centers multiple installation so maybe
someones you know using mediawiki and
make someone else is using tiddlywiki or
whatever and you end up with these silos
where you've got one group what using
one working one group using another and
they really need to be talking to each
other but they're stuck in different
software the other issue with this is
that sometimes when management finds out
that you've been chronically using a
wiki or a blog somewhere without telling
them that they come along and say we're
not having that we're shutting it down
so ultimately what you really need is
kind of like a sort of middle way so you
have the support from above that says
yes you can use this this is good
software we encourage you to get
involved in this but you also have
buy-in and support from below that the
people who are actually using the
software find it useful and decide that
this is something they will help each
other to to use when you're looking at
sort of the bottom-up way of fostering
adoption there's a row to an adoption
strategy a while back based on some of
the work that I've been doing and I just
want to like run through it because if
you're in a situation where you want to
use wiki's and you have colleagues who
aren't really so sure about it this is
it right good set of steps to go through
to get them involved in what you're
doing so the first thing that you need
to do is figure out what who your users
are so it's very easy to kind of think
about users in on
mass and kind of say well they're people
who are working on such and such a
project but within that you have small
discreet user groups of people who have
shared needs and shared actions so this
is all about what people doing on a
day-to-day basis so if you have project
managers that are kind of working on
different bits of the same project or if
you have you know in a lot of
organization actually secretaries and
pas are really good people to focus on
say will do roughly the same thing
roughly the same way and you can get
them talking to each other get them kind
of adopting the software and then they
kind of spread it out but you have to
understand what they actually do every
day a good place to start with this is
look at how people using email email is
one of the most abused bits of software
that we have in business we suffer from
occupational spam the stuff that you're
cc'd on that comes from somebody in the
business it's kind of official but it
had there's no real relevance to your
day-to-day action people just letting
you know stuff just see seeing you
because they think you ought to know
what's going on stuff from departments
that have accidentally sent it to the
wrong mailing list we get a huge amounts
of email that cut don't really need but
we also use email very badly for things
like conversation so the CC list it's
very easy for you get started on a
conversation with your colleagues then
someone gets missed off the CC list and
then the or someone just replies to you
and not to the whole group and the
conversation starts to fragment across
different inboxes and you can't access
other people's inboxes and just start
reading their mail so you don't
necessarily not aware of all the little
sub conversations that are happening
once that's that's that fragmentations
occurred the other thing is that people
particularly when writing documents so
new product backs meeting agendas this
sort of thing they will send out
attachments
you half dozen people get half a dozen
sets of responses back and then you have
to sit in hand merge so these are kind
of specific behaviors that you can look
at people using email for where you can
say actually you know there are better
places to do this there are better ways
we can do this at a less overhead and
you much quicker so once you've kind of
identified these groups identified what
they do identified who who's influential
within your area because we have the the
organization chart I don't even know
does Google have an org chart probably
somewhere but you always have an
informal organization within any
business of the people who know each
other and the people who maybe they
aren't you're marking together but you
know they talk a lot the exchange ideas
so identifying people who are these
collect little super nodes you can
abridge different communities different
parts of the company and who can
actually help you to you spread adoption
of any particular tool is quite
important these are people that can
really push at all from being something
that's used locally to something that's
used business wide and then sort of
think about what is it that you're
actually doing for them how is this
going to make part of their lives easier
so we own identity I worked with an
investment banking in London called
Resnick line was a Stein and one of the
things that we did was look to how
people were using email what they were
doing and then figured out how they
could do it better on the one in this
case a wiki and some of the use cases
were really really small simple use
cases it was nothing particularly
impressive it was things like doing
presentations collaboratively so one of
the managers needed to suddenly was hold
you have to give a presentation in four
hours on your project had to come up
with his powerpoint slide
I mean I personally don't leave in
PowerPoint as you can tell but they will
use they basically had to come up with
this whole presentation and they did it
on the wiki they broke it down into
sections they're kind of brainstormed it
on the wiki and then once they had
enough ideas they come as separated out
gave each person responsibility for a
given chunk of the presentation they
worked on it simultaneously brought it
back together in the wiki and then final
edit and at that point it was put into
PowerPoint for the presentation doing
that by email just would never have
worked not in a four hour time period it
just would have been really painful the
other thing was really really caught
caught on and again it's incredibly
mundane some of this stuff was meeting
agendas and meeting notes so instead of
sending in a gender and people were
sending agendas around in PowerPoint in
excel in word army all sorts of
different ways and sending these
multiple attachments out getting
multiple ones in and having tan merge it
all and then someone somewhere would
have their bit missed off and will be
kind of like well you know my singles on
the agenda and then the meeting minutes
again would be sent round in a word
document or something changes would be
sent back individually and it's these
kind of patterns they're sort of like
looking for where conversations and
where behaviors are fragmented and then
bringing them together in something like
a wiki with blogs a lot of this stuff is
kind of anybody that's publishing
something on a regular basis newsletters
once a week or whatever and they were
very small tiny little use cases but
when you sat down with people and said
you know this is how you can change what
you're doing now and make it easier they
would then take that get get their heads
around that adopt it and then they start
to generalize out to other areas of
their work because one of the things
that I learnt was that people are
actually quite bad generalizing from a
very high level view so when you say
wiki's are about collaboration locked
her up publishing it's all about
conversation you can work with your
colleagues and discuss
things and they kind of go well why
would I want to do that when you say you
can take the pain out of doing meeting
minutes they kind of go oh okay that
makes more sense so it's been quite
specific the other thing that we found
was that you really don't need to do
huge amounts of training or anything on
these tools most people pick them up
really quickly it really is about giving
them context and understanding about how
this helps them and we got a bit old
school with some of the stuff that we
did we obviously had pages on the wiki
and that saying this is how you use this
tool but if they weren't comfortable
with the wiki anyway kind of not the
right place to put the material to make
them comfortable with the wiki so we
just printed out sheets of paper little
tri fold sheets that said this is how
you do it this is how it works how you
do bold and all the rest of it and that
was really effective because it was
something that was very easy for them
and they didn't have to go and find the
page ironically i found you i think one
of the big strengths of wikis at their
aflac architecture they don't have a
hierarchy but again people are so used
to hierarchies within websites it's kind
of like ingrained in everyone now that
you start at the home page then you
click a link and then you see some more
links and you click that one and we
found actually people within the wiki
instead of leaving it flat and using
search they created their own
hierarchies regardless of what you did
so we had the front page it had a list
of departments within the departments
had a list of teams within the team's a
list of projects within the project's a
list of pages and so you end up with
this kind of like you know five click
hierarchy of navigation that they've
created because that's what they feel
comfortable with so again it was kind of
like you know if this is the behavior
that they feel comfortable with and will
enable this and we came up with naming
schemes for each page so that people
understood you if you've got a half a
dozen projects and they all want the
page faq then you can only have one page
on a wiki that's called back
so it was like okay we'll have the team
name project name page name in the title
so that it differentiates you could
immediately see all of the pages how
they were grouped together and it gave
people the kind of structure that
they're used to make them feel more
comfortable with the tool the other
thing that we did as well was actually
be very open to letting people use these
tools how they want to so there's quite
a lot of kind of social stuff that went
on people would be introduced to the
wiki or the blogs via say the coffee
wrote a page where it was like what he
wants cut what coffee this morning and
you know whoever's turn it was to go and
get the coffee sports pages this sort of
thing so that people had a fairly gentle
in route into using these tools and then
what we also found was that as we were
introducing this to normal people and
sitting down with them and figuring out
what they need and giving them that kind
of really personalized help we started
to see a real drop off basically can a
support request kind of want rows and
rows and Roses adoption road and then
just kind of fell off a cliff and
suddenly literally over a period about
two weeks no more support requests at
all and it was like whoa yeah this is
quite interesting what was happening was
that there were enough people within the
business who were using the tools and
understood well this is useful for this
and this is useful for that and this is
how you do all this stuff that they were
actually acting as little sort of
localized trainers themselves so there
was no need for them to actually ask us
for help because they were doing it
within their own groups and at that
point is come out right we reach
critical mass and at that point I
basically got fired job done essentially
to do so in terms of kind of like
top-down stuff I'm much more in favor of
the kind of bottom-up approach but
sometimes you need to kind of marry it
with the top down stuff as well the
important thing was having managers that
accepted the tools and within a really
big organization I mean d RK w six
thousand staff spread sort of in half
dozen time zones and it was quite
hierarchical business and so if you had
one middle manager that basically went
now and sorry this is a waste of time
none of myself for using this it can
write blacked out whole pyramid of
company and we did have this we did have
people actually saying you know there's
over my dead body is anyone going to be
in my team going to be caught using wiki
and this was a bit of a problem because
they were these things are political
yeah as a consultant it's very difficult
for me to actually look at this sort of
politics of a company like I can look at
them and I kind of gay you're trouble
you're gonna be really good you're going
to be paying the arse I can figure out
from accelerate its its kind of laid
bare if you're an external consultant
internally of course it's different kind
of fish you're so caught up in you know
what's going on and who knows who and
who's difficult and who you've got to
keep happy that these people that can be
blocks can really get in the way of one
of these sorts of projects the way I
cannot deal with it was you wherever you
can just ran them but you can't convert
everybody some people are always going
to turn around again you know social
software we don't have social in our
business so when you do get kind of the
managers that have the foresight to have
that buy-in for this in KY say yes fine
we'll we'll encourage our teams to use
this the ones that were most successful
we're the ones we're very active so
active themselves using the tool so they
were blogging they were using the wiki
so it's kind of leading by example
active in encouraging their staff to use
these tools so there was one guy who
every time someone asked him a question
replied with a one-liner that just said
see this link to the wiki he refused to
enter into any discussion other than on
his blog or on his wiki it was like he
was stepping away from email and going
she's not interested and that had a
massive massive effect because suddenly
you know people who wanted information
out of him whereas previously he would
have gone okay you want this document
here it is here's an attachment he'd put
all of his documents up on the wiki and
it was like it's there you don't need to
ask me for this anymore you can just go
and download it so if you keep losing
your documentation then it's always
there for you also it's very easy I mean
so when I first started but I started
blogging as a personal blog at five
years ago my blog is called chocolate
and vodka if anyone's interested and I
count the first sort of three or four
months were really gappy so I would blog
furiously for three or four weeks and
then kind of like a busy and then
nothing for a month and then I can't go
oh now I haven't gone away home died and
my blog again and then there'd be
another gap and exactly the same thing
happens in business that people will
start doing something and then they'll
give up for a bit and then you can
encourage them and keep keep going and
it's this whole kind of like you never
give up restarting doing what you're
doing is very difficult to change habits
and it's it's it's very easy to kind of
slip back into the old way of doing
stuff and that actually doesn't matter
if that happens fine just keep
encouraging people to keep going but at
the end of the day one of the most
important things to remember and this
was something again with the management
had with some people had difficulty
understanding is an adoption and usage
is not the goal it's no point I mean you
can say yeah we've got X number of staff
and
you seventy percent of them are reading
the wiki and thirty percent of them are
using it and that's nice but adoption
isn't the girl getting your job done its
goal preferably getting your job done
easier and quicker and no less painfully
so I think that that's sort of an
important one to remember because when
you get really focused on the wrong
thing and the wrong goal then it has
diverts you from what you're actually
trying to achieve which is an easier
life as far as I'm concerned yeah a job
that you enjoy and doing it as best as
you can as efficiently as you can so
that was basically kind of what I wanted
to talk about that I hope some of that
was useful I'm quite happy to answer
questions if anyone's got any or two
equally if all of this is stuff you
already know I'd like to know that too
we see i did this i wrote this some
social software adoption strategy it's
on my blog and it basically outlines
most of this stuff and i was a
conference last week and i had several
people come up for you that post is
fabulous we've been doing this in our
business so now everyone's using the
wiki and i did think to myself you know
what I'm really doing myself out of a
job here but there are just more
companies out there that yeah they will
read this and go this it makes sense but
we really don't know how to actually do
it so I think neither that as far as I
the way that I look at it is I like to
go in help people leave and let them
sort themselves out I don't want to
perpetuate that I hate the word
consultant because it has all these
connotations of people who perpetuate
their own employment by creating
problems whereas i like to shorten my
employment by making people happy just
means i get to do more different things
like the broader social net
vs like within the company
firewall around so like you know their
dimension financial types services
you've got a lot of secrecy and stuff
like that so they'll say this is a wall
normally people inside but like okay
companies are deportation that actually
bind kind of into usable form
interacting partners interacting
it so there's kind of muddle that you
have your internal within the firewall
social software and so in financial
services you have these Chinese Ward's
these regulatory rules that say you can
these people cannot talk to these people
until this event horizon has passed and
with wiki's it's actually quite easy to
create little walled gardens but only
certain people have access to you can
actually kind of seal things off you can
also create areas that cross the bridge
the firewall so that you have access
from your people internally and access
from your clients and you can control
who gets out access and one of the
things I found quite interesting was
that the regulatory side of things the
compliance officers love wiki's in
particular because there's a pure edit
history every edit is that's made is
logged and who made it and when so they
actually prefer wiki's than something
like email if you have to do compliance
on some email conversation that's a
nightmare do it in a wiki it's pretty
easy blogs are kind of like slightly
halfway house because you can go back
and edit blog entries but there's no not
necessarily any record of that but blogs
tends to be a lot more static that once
you've published them they kind of stay
published but certainly for compliance
they love the wiki's I thought it was
great
a bunch of users
and
without going into too much detail
they said
a need for sort of a canonical
and
have to actually email
so the organization of information
within the wiki is interesting I've seen
I said a lot of people who actually
create their own hierarchy so they're
faced with a flat space and they create
a hierarchy of links so then traditional
style navigation a lot of this is
actually about how good the search tools
are within the wiki and some about than
others if you have really good wiki
search it makes it a lot easier to find
what you want
a particular long talking thing
repetitions on another topic
you get
a lot this is about the culture and how
well people engage with the wiki so when
people view a wiki as a publishing
platform they slap stuff up there and
they never look at it again then you get
these these issues around duplication
out of date material and that's exactly
the same as an intranet so you get these
like dead intranets that have been
around for years and no one's actually
bothered to look at the data and color
and part of that is because yes they
overheard on actually finding the page
and going to whoever looks after the
internet and saying can you change this
and then by the time they've got around
to changing it what you wanted to change
it to is actually changed again with the
wiki yes you can end up with like dead
pages but it's far easier to go in and
deprecated things ago this is out of
date and one of the things that we did
was take the idea from Wikipedia of
having stubs and notices so you could
put a little stub page up and say we
need information on this and that acts
as a kind of prompt to the people who
have the information who perhaps
previously didn't feel confident enough
to put that information up there because
maybe didn't think it was that important
but it gives them the kind of cultural
impetus to do that in terms of you know
the mythical wiki gardener and this is
the idea that some people published up
and some people go around tidying up
afterwards use go gardening we actually
did have these people who were obsessive
really obsessive about making sure that
everything was up to date and you the
ratio of people putting stuff up and
people being obsessive about it can be
you don't need very many gardeners to
have a healthy wiki but it's encouraging
people mean again here one of the
hurdles that we had was people will just
kind of go oh that's not my page so I
can't edit it it's like well the whole
point of a wiki is that you can edit any
page it's collectively owned this isn't
about you having responsibility for this
section but being unalaq's section and
that was a cultural issue
and most of these things it's not really
about the technology it's not about yeah
WYSIWYG editor helps massively but it's
not really about that it's how people
react to the environment and the
comparison between the sort of social
environment and the hierarchical
permission basin by environment people
are used to you
I think the wiki site is quite odd in a
way when you compare wiki tools and
blogging tools or the blogging tools are
generally much more well developed even
though they haven't been around so as
long I mean wiki's been around over 10
years and I kind of it's only recently
in the last two to three years that
they've actually started becoming
appropriate for business use in terms of
you to recommendations are very much
depends on who who you're going to use
it so things like mediawiki is really
nicely developed open source really
lovely you put that in front of a
business user and they just run
screaming from the room because it's
like there's all this like weird wiki
markup stuff it's complicated it doesn't
look like word so then if you give them
something like on social text or there's
a new one called sort farmer which is
like a structured wiki and these are
much much more familiar paradigms it's
very much like WYSIWYG editor i click on
the bold and it looks bold I don't have
to deal with this whole last is it is an
asterisk or a whether it's a Lynx are
done with brackets or several brackets
or negotiating different types of wiki
markup because people like they have a
comfort zone that comfort zone is
generally MS office and this is what
they know this is the paradigm they're
used to and the tools that replicate
that most closely at the ones they feel
most comfortable with but of course near
when you're dealing with the techies you
need the IT department they'll do
whatever they like so we use have this
big row about transclusion because we
were using social text in dr KW and
there was a whole bunch people who want
to choose mediawiki instead it so she
takes doesn't do transclusion i can't
have this template thing here and then
use it on all these other pages and it
was like yeah educates majority people
probably not going to do that so yeah
and within blogs as well as like
different levels of it depends on how
how you want to run your blogs so I did
some work with did a case study of a
pharmaceutical company in Europe he was
using blogs for
competitive intelligence and they had
six blogs and they were all Chinese
walls between all of them but certain
people had sort of multiple blog
privileges so if they had one item they
would have to post it on multiple blogs
where it was relevant and they were
using traction team page which allowed
them to have basically I mean it was a
blog version of transclusion they had
one entry and they labeled it with the
different blog names and it showed up in
four different places other people you
know use WordPress because it's free and
it's quite nice and it all very much
depends on what level of granularity do
you need you need ldap sign on do you
need at what kind of integrations you
need can this actually just stand alone
on its own little server with your own
little login is it that important that
you have integration because you know a
lot of the tools just don't play well
with enterprise level systems so it's
really about figuring out from that
point of view you know who are you users
what are they going to find comforting
and how does this fit in with your IT
infrastructure that exists and yeah I've
had one company point-blank refused to
install a linux server because they did
everything on on don n was like nope
this is it we're not having Linux over
our dead bodies and it was like hmm okay
you know that's that narrows down your
options but that's your decision so you
know I T in that point that company were
less and flexible but they made their
decision so you know fits they want
everything to fit together and I can
understand that
Oh
these values
that often
right
and to me it seems often the information
between our groups and how
and the uglier the better shot basically
the the most successful the I even had
like there was no sorry there was not we
had like a broken image and I think
we just get broken because every page
look like a draft so people would feel
free to post to be between even though
they haven't quite finished at texted in
jumping up as we still always everything
that was black bar but it was a really
useful with because that was the one
place that
it's about your constituency whoo yeah
if people feel happy with Sammy broken
ugly wiki then given what they're happy
with I think that there is a or they
just seem to be a separation between the
more technically minded people who are
happy with that kind of a scenario and
business focus people people who are
basically used a word and they really
like stuff to look kind of shiny so when
you have a year you present to them a
titty wiki or something like that and
they just run away you present them
something that looks a bit like the
corporate intranet the same branding and
logos and stuff then they immediately
just curve you're lowering a sort of
cognitive barrier for them yeah you're
kind of taking away something that makes
it seem other and making it seem same
and they're comfortable with saying so
if you're in an environment where people
are used to our very bare ugly tools and
that then that's for them is same so
yeah I think it entirely depends on who
you're dealing with things that certain
circles are for like if you were
speaking to an audience of a lot of
bright engineers
with wiki's they need to deal with
contention better that's one of the
biggest pains in the neck is when you do
a nice big edit and some other buggers
come along and changed a full stop and
you lose your edit granularity in terms
of being able particularly in
enterprises is important being able to
actually pass the law areas of wiki
without actually having to do multiple
installations and the stuff like social
effects does that fine but a lot of the
wiki is doing one thing I would just
love to see would be sub either edit
style simultaneous editing so that you
could actually see in real time the
other person typing and that way I mean
I think sub-ether edit is a tool that
actually steph and i have used at
conferences to take conference notes and
it's fabulous when you've got everyone
on the same network and you've got you
three or four people in sudbury ether
edit and we're all kind of taking notes
and someone's coming along behind and
adding in URLs and correcting typos and
at the end of the talk you've got this
fabulous near-perfect transcript of what
we said with additional points and URLs
and the whole thing and when that works
it works fabulously one of the issues
with um wiki's even the ones that show
you when I mean you with google
documents and have a glee has this whole
kind of when you hit refresh your save
it kind of shows you the other person's
edit but you can't see what they're
doing at the time that they're doing it
so if you are editing together you still
end up with the same contention like
issues of you well I just deleted this
bit and you just edited it so I've just
deleted the thing that you edited in
there are better versioning so edit
histories are too clunky if you have an
edit history I want to be able to say
this this whole user session of this
person
making these edits and these are exactly
the words that they added into account
and a better display at the moment a lot
of it is just kind of like per paragraph
this paragraph change well that doesn't
help me skim through the paragraph and
see what was changed and multiple
comparisons so that i can say i want the
version 12 version 24 and version 6 d
side by side and see between all of them
which ones change and who did what so
you could actually tagged the changes
with the person that changed them rather
than tag or as well as have the version
tagged with the person who changed it so
you could actually look at multiple
differences I think wiki's need the most
development blogs when you look at stuff
like WordPress they is really nicely
thought through and I'm looking forward
to playing with movable type for which
actually haven't you exit sounds like
they've addressed a lot of the issues
but within the enterprise again
granularity and permissions are really
really important being able to say this
group of people has access and this
group of people doesn't and I think new
scalability is also huge wiki both
wiki's and blogs have issues with
scaling once a wiki gets past a certain
size it can start to get incredibly hard
to find stuff your wiki search namely
sucks and you wiki search from outside
of the tool I don't even know if that
actually even works me that most wiki's
that have such it's all internal and so
you're stuck with is that wiki's sucks
it sucks blog search varies from yeah
oddly enough
hey
it's basically with weekly series it's a
flat flat data it's just all big pot
it's all big mush and people
automatically add in a hierarchy because
that's what they call comfortable with
because the search doesn't provide them
with they don't think Google when they
see wiki search so you know when people
get to come to google search and they
know how it all works and as a parent
I'm they understand but they didn't map
that paradigm across to something like a
wiki or blog it's not an instinctive
thing so moving people from hierarchy to
search is really really difficult
because they're just they have this
mental block because I don't think they
really I don't know do people see Google
search as search or is it just location
finding things which is sounds slightly
stupid thing to say but when people want
to find stuff in a wiki they just click
through links even if it's a half-dozen
links they'll just going to go click
click click click click because they
expect hierarchy so ya better ways to
move people from the hierarchy to search
what else that's just off the top of my
head I'm sure I could come up with a lot
more if I thought about it harder
things
season one was
mark babe
can't you think it's hard attraction
it's one of the weird things about blogs
is that blogs suffer from the social
part of social software that people
firstly think that blogs are Diaries and
it's only recently in the British media
that they have stopped banging on about
blogs as Diaries because as soon as you
get into this you know personal
expressions staff people in business
immediately can I go this is scary i
actually don't want to have a diary in
my business and i don't want other
people doing either so I'm the
interesting use cases of blogs some of
them are again very mundane so um Disney
used blogs for event logging in their
broadcast department and basically they
took out a custom-built database app
that really was a bit rubbish and they
replace it with movable type and every
time something happened it was blocked
and you had you know search which they
didn't have before army had archives
which they didn't have before you had
ability to comment which they didn't
have before so they actually went even
though if their previous stage race was
custom-built it sounds like it was a bit
rubbish and and that was kind of a nerd
the adoption issue for that was just
non-existent because they basically went
throw that away bring this in this is
all part of your job just get on with it
quite a few people i know have used
blogs for kind of personal knowledge
management if you like so keeping track
of you calling vendors talking to
clients just general information that's
important so they can find stuff more
easily one guy I know actually he was
working on a project where he had to
report every month but he didn't really
have any colleagues so every month he
would have to go through all of his
email and write this report for his boss
and say this is what I've been doing
when he started blogging he just stopped
doing that and if his boss said how he
doing he just had read the blog
everything's on the blog the whole thing
is catalogued so
that kind of became a reporting tool for
him and sort of tracking and reporting
tool I'm competitive intelligence one we
see lots of kind of knowledge sharing
around that sort of area of kite you
how's the market developing what ideas
have we got what's happening out there
what's happening in here and just random
kind of that some companies actually do
allow can't random social blogs where
people just kind of go oh this is
interesting and this might be something
on YouTube or whatever and interestingly
that seems to really counterintuitive to
let people blog about social things and
non-work related things internally but
it turns out to be a very good way for
people to get to know each other and in
very large organizations you end up with
lots of small communities based around
you know your colleagues and the cool
people that they know you might be
working on something that someone else
is working on but you may never actually
find out about it and what blogs have
i've seen do is actually bring people
together because people decided kind of
going oh I i saw this article about such
and such and meow doing this and they'd
start to talk and then figure out there
working on similar sorts of things in
one case you know one guy in London one
guy in Tokyo they would never ever meet
turned out they were doing basically the
same thing and then that opens a door to
a collaboration and smarter working so
there is actually value to having that
kind of social stuff of yeah one right g
RK w didn't know his boss had never met
his boss for like six months after he
started and they were talking on the
wiki on the blogs and then when they did
me they just kind of like hit the ground
running there was none of this awkward
sort of like oh man you've also huh it
was all they already knew each other and
there were only knew what was happening
and on all the rest of it so these i
think you we underestimate the
importance of social relationships in
business businesses are made of people
people have social relationships without
those it's very difficult to function
properly so use allowing small talk is
beneficial
allowing these social relationships to
to form and to be strengthened is also
important anyone anything else I think
we're actually done anyways 12 slow wow
