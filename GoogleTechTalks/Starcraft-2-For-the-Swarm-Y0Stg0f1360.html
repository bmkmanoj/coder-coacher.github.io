format of this we have
about an hour and a half in the first
half Alex until you're going to just
talk a little bit about eSports and
starcraft 2 of course and answer you
know basically just informally a bunch
of QA from the audience and then for the
second half we actually have a bunch of
games that they're going to cast live
here that are the finals match of the
ongoing saga eternum that we've been
having a google for the past month and a
half or so we started with 50 people
we've been running five rounds of swiss
to top 80 limbs and all the way down to
finally last night the finals were
played between Adam who's an intern here
I don't know where he is and Ryan who's
a yeah and and Ryan who is 8x top
administrator in 43 and I'll trophies
here you're welcome all right so without
further ado our two guests today Alex
hdstarcraft do is you've probably all
seen his youtube videos he's got over 57
million views on YouTube on a channel
he's been interviewed by NPR he's hosted
the Invitational HDH tournament during
the beta which was a huge tournament
he's probably got a bunch of other
accomplishments he can tell you about
Taylor pain user Parsons is also here
and he is one of the top players in the
world actually I think last night you
were ranked 9th in the world and he's a
diamond level turn player he's been
featured a PC gamer as well as several
high-profile tournaments including the
HDH Invitational and into extreme
masters qualifier and so help me give a
warm welcome and welcome guys
hey guys just want to thank Brian here
for setting this up and inviting us out
to come out to Google's headquarters
I've never been here before and I just
went came from the dining hall or the
cafeteria and I was blown away by how
much food you guys have that was really
awesome anyways yeah I'm Alex I'm also
known as HD and this is my very tall
friend Taylor yeah I guess I'm Taylor
and yeah we're here today to talk a
little bit about competitive starcraft 2
&amp;amp; eSports as a whole which is something
very near and dear to me and which only
recently we've been able to do pretty
much at a professional level pretty much
my entire life it interfered with school
work anything like that but now I'm
actually able to fly around the United
States and participate in tournaments
and it's it's been a lot of fun so yeah
thanks for having me
so I guess we're gonna go ahead and
answer a couple questions that there's
this laptop here with a bunch of
questions that I guess we can yeah I
guess some a lot of people out here
maybe you guys aren't familiar with
starcraft 2 or east works or i guess
electronic sports in general it's kind
of a fast-growing thing that started
first in south korea and the game that
was primarily featured there with
starcraft brood war which is the
predecessor to starcraft 2 here that's
on the screen and that game has grown
over the last decade to become one of
the most competitive video games in the
entire world with the release of
starcraft 2 it's grown outside of south
korea and there's a lot of thousand
dollar tournaments hundreds of thousands
of dollars that have been poured into
starcraft 2 around the world and
basically i guess we're here to talk
about that eSports and we think that
it's got a huge potential grow and it's
already grown quite a bit there's been a
lot of tournaments for example Taylor
and I just came back from Raleigh North
Carolina where I casted and he competed
in the tournament there and it was a lot
of fun so it's it's worldwide its
worldwide phenomenon uh yeah and
especially lately in the United States
it's really been taking off I think one
of the large problems here in the US was
just it was a culture thing in South
Korea the pro gamers are actually
revered they're kind of like nfl
superstars they're on commercials they
get endorsements and here it's like
there's a huge cultural barrier between
professional gaming and like real sports
and a lot of people really don't
consider competitive gaming to be an
actual sport and I'll argue with people
till I'm blue in the face but it doesn't
really make a difference and I think now
it's it's really coming into the light
and a lot of companies like Intel Dell
HP nvidia ati they're all starting to
put a lot of money into these
tournaments and they're realizing that
it's actually a good investment they
actually get a lot of viewership out of
sponsoring these tournaments and they
make products for gamers so it makes a
lot of sense for them to do that
and it's getting bigger in the US if
you're on remote please mute please mute
um it makes a lot of sense mm-hmm um for
us to be doing this now and it's only
gonna get bigger so I'm really excited
for the future of starcraft 2 and yeah I
think we're gonna take some some
questions now from I think they're
collected in in-house so they're all
from they're all from google employees
and also if anybody has any questions
for us feel free to just step up and ask
questions at the mic alright cool so I
guess while we wait if anyone wants to
go up and ask us any questions will be
happy to answer it um I guess one of a
really good question here is how do we
think starcraft 2 is going to evolve
differently from starcraft one and what
do you really think is new and different
about SC two I think starcraft 2 first
of all there's a lot of different games
that can be good in eSports but there's
very few that actually get to that
competitive level there's games like a
mean Taylor okay a little bit technical
difficulties but I think there's there's
a lot of different kinds of games that
can be good but there's very few that
can actually excel in eSports in general
Starcraft counter-strike I'm sure a lot
of these names ring a bell quake those
kind of games have the potential to be
competitive and really they require a
high skill ceiling to be good there's
other games as well that can be good but
they just don't feel that that
competitive scene they're not as
competitive and interesting and exciting
to watch so that's why I starcraft 2
it's just it's this new kind of plateau
it's this new game that's come out that
I think has a huge potential to be
competitive to be it's very exciting to
watch even towards the casual viewer
even if you don't know what's going on
like a couple of my friends back home
they never watched starcraft 2 they
don't even play the game but when
watch it when the firt for the first
time when they first watched it they
liked it a lot and it's really easy to
get into so i think starcraft 2 has a
huge potential to evolve and even become
better than its predecessor brood war
and I know Taylor you have some things
you want to talk about that so well I
think if darts and women's pool can be
on ESPN I think starcraft 2 definitely
has a spot in the future I think they're
a while back there was a organization
called the championship gaming series or
the CGS which was a company that
actually tried to do direct TV based
tournaments with counter-strike 1.6 and
quake 3 and those are the games that I
used to play I used to play quake 3
competitively but they actually went
under because there just wasn't enough
of a buzz around those games in
particular and I think starcraft 2 is
going to be great for the scene because
it's able to unify people from all
different walks of gaming people who
play FPS realtime strategy first person
shooters role-playing games you see tons
of world of warcraft players playing
starcraft 2 now and people who just
haven't gamed in general before are now
taking up starcraft 2 trying to learn
how to get better approaching the game
critically and i think it's just really
good for everyone in general it's a it's
a tough mental game it really sharpens
your skills as a gamer you have to be
really intelligent you have to think
very quickly and actively and make
intelligent decisions while you play and
and I think it's probably one of the
harder sports out there and I really
don't see a skill cap for the game I
mean there's people that I consider
great players but they're constantly
getting better they're constantly
evolving and I've never seen someone
that I thought was at the peak of the
game or that I thought couldn't get
better and the same goes for myself like
I'm constantly looking at flaws in my
own game flaws in my own skill and
constantly trying to improve and I think
that's what makes it such an awesome
spectator sport if you truly understand
the game and even if you don't it's
really fun just to watch because it's
exciting and they've
to the graphics a lot with a new game
and it's it's just a really fun game to
play in general so it's my two cents on
starcraft 2 &amp;amp; eSports they actually we
have a small nickname we use in the
community and we usually tell me so it's
kind of like chess on steroids starcraft
2 it's just you have so many maneuvers
just like you can move the pawn you can
use Bishop and all those moves I'm not
that great with chest but basically in
starcraft 2 you don't have the time to
to think about your moves everything is
operated in real time and you have your
always presented by millions and
millions of decisions and it really
comes down to how you play strategically
as well as how you execute your army and
control your economy if it's really a
great game and I think that's one of the
please mute noise return like you please
mute thank you thank you Brian so yeah I
guess someone has a question so one
interesting difference between computer
game watching and sports wash eat hot
cheetos with sports there's something
obvious to look at with a chess board
there are there's a board that you can
bet where the game is pretty much
focused and with sports you're following
the ball even whereas with computer
games you could be jumping all around
this the map right so is there some
barrier to whoever's narrating for that
I mean is there some skill level
required to actually an array in a game
to introduce to people what's going on
as opposed to just I mean you can't just
leave the camera in one place you have
to write you have to follow the action
the action could be going on in multiple
places so did you talk to that a bit
yeah well just like in football like you
said there's always one ball and you
watch our basketball there's a ball that
you essentially focus on and if you
think about the casual viewer if they
don't understand the rules of football
then when they watch the game they can
kind of grasp the idea you get it to the
end zone you get six points and plus a
field goal and you start to learn as you
watch along
obviously if you play the game then you
understand even more and the real beauty
about this starcraft 2 in general is
it's very easy to understand big armies
clashing against big armies somebody has
more units at the end and that means
that they're the winner you know so
they're going to push forward and win
the game and obviously it's it does take
some time to I think get used to but for
the casual viewer if you start to watch
a little bit it's very easy to get
hooked and that's how it started with me
and a lot of my friends as well indeed
and also to that effect there are I mean
I know in Korea they have a professional
third-party guy who actually just
operates the camera and that's all he
does and the casters just cast what they
see and then also that's pretty much
what Alex does pretty much for a living
he he dictates what part of the game
you're watching and he shout casts or
broadcasts that specific aspect of the
game and he understands and if I were in
his shoes and doing the same thing I
understand that there's a lot of people
who aren't at the super high competitive
level so you try not to jump around and
be really aggressive with the camera you
try and move slow and pan around and
make sure you your very like slow paced
with it and cover things that are not so
much obvious but cover things that
people might not be looking at during
the game so point out things that people
might be missing or simple strategy
stuff like that and then obviously the
big battles anything like that just make
sure that you have your camera on that
and you don't miss it it's pretty
important not to miss those things so
yeah we're going to go through a couple
of these questions if anybody else has
go ahead another difference between
traditional sports &amp;amp; eSports like
Starcraft is that there's that element
of multiple people on a team in
StarCraft it seems to be solo player why
do you think's starcraft hasn't embraced
the multiple players with shared control
on the same team sort of play
we actually do do that a lot work almost
all of the top competitive players were
all on teams and we have teammates that
we practice with regularly we have a lot
of camaraderie and we do to clan wars
versus other teams like organized clan
wars and I guess the closest analogy I
could draw to a real sport would be
something like wrestling where you have
a team but people compete individually
for points and then your total team's
score dictates who wins the match and I
know in Korea it's it's the same way
they have professional teams that are
sponsored by a company and everybody
represents the same team and they
practice together they live together eat
sleep and breathe starcraft together so
yeah we do have teams but you're you're
actually right in the u.s. it is a
little bit different the major
tournaments don't really embrace the
whole team aspect of it all the all the
major tournaments are just one-on-one
competition and that determines who wins
the the big pot but we're trying to push
for it to become more of a team-based
thing because that's the format that we
all enjoy the most it makes it's much
more fun that way and you also have
teammates with you like I know when I
was competing in the MLG it's it's
incredibly nerve-racking to not have a
team and just to be out there by
yourself running through all the games
in your head like going over the
different matchups the different
strategies not having a team not having
that support and I would really like for
it to be like that in the future but I
don't know if it's going to go that way
in the US but it's like that in Korea
they do have teams okay so yeah I think
that'll be a it'll be a big step if we
can get some more team orientation in
here in the US that would be really the
ideal the ideal stepping stone but um
for those of you guys who don't know
much about starcraft or starcraft 2
there are three races and that's
basically three teams that you can be
its as Erick Protoss port erin and zerg
is the buggy race kind of like the
insects from starship troopers the
Terrans are basically the the rico
Roughnecks like you like to put it to
they're the humans and they're basically
just like redneck outlaws that got sent
out in this space think of space like
Australia but Protoss is the Protoss are
the the I guess they're kind of like the
advanced telepathic race and there they
are kind of like the unknown the
mysterious enigmatic race and that
basically when you play starcraft 2 you
pick one of those races if you play
competitively multiplayer you pick one
of those you master it Taylor is a
Terran player so he plays the humans and
I'm a third player so I play the bugs
and yeah there's three races and I think
this question is asking about it seems
like there aren't as many rows as
opposed to Terran and Protoss and the
question is asking do you think do you
believe Zerg is an underpowered race or
that they're being misused and since I'm
a zerg player I have to say that um I
actually play it I play at a fairly
decently competitive level around like
you know 1,000 diamond I don't think
zurich is it was unbalanced right now
and of course since this is a video game
the company Blizzard can always patch
and make updates and changes to the
gameplay but as of right now I think
that the gameplay is fairly balanced I
don't really have any problems with it
as a Terran player I I feel like it's
pretty easy to squash Zergs I don't know
I think Zerg could definitely use a
little bit of love if you look at like
the top 30 on ladder there's like threes
if you look at like tournament results
for like the last couple months I mean I
drew the foreigner pros org who lives in
Korea is like the great white hope for
zerg he's just like the only player
winning anything and he's just
incredibly talented he's remarkably fast
he plays a really smart and I just think
it's because he's better than everyone
as and he sticks with zerg more power to
him he actually played Terran in the
original starcraft brood war and like
every time i play with him he's just
constantly complaining about zerg and
like how underpowered they are and
everything it's like you've given me
more Zerg tears I just can't take it
anymore because Zerg was super strong at
the beginning of the game and then
Blizzard obviously patched the game and
they changed the balance which is
something that's also really important
in starcraft 2 and it's something that
Blizzard as a game development company
does incredibly well they balance all of
their games to a level that makes them
almost perfect like in starcraft
broodwar the original i think in in pro
korea which is the best example because
these guys play 12 hours a day they get
paid hundreds of thousands of dollars so
the competition is just on a whole
nother level and I think they got it to
the point where with three unique races
in a game they had the wind percentages
at 33.33 across the board which is like
unheard of in any game in any other RTS
that you look at or play I've played a
bunch of RTS is from other games and
stuff and they're just so unbalanced I
mean blizzard just puts all the other
game development companies to shame they
have a much better development team and
they're really good at balancing the
game so I think in the future regardless
of what happens as far as balance is
concerned the game will be balanced it's
just a matter of time and it's a matter
of top level players exploiting specific
strategies and then Blizzard seeing oh
hey look this guy's winning every single
tournament doing the same thing every
single time and then eventually they'll
patch it but sometimes it takes a little
longer than I'd like for them to respond
but any kind of changes they make to the
gamer are major and they're permanent so
they have to be really careful so there
are some units right now that Terran has
that I do not like like Reapers and
hellions I don't otters I don't like
those when they're in my drones killing
my economy
yes yeah all right the next question is
from your experience with SC game
dynamics what are some of the lessons
that can be transferred from that
environment into a real-world incentive
structures that we have four people skip
are you interested in establishing an
Internet star craft school EG one dollar
per video lesson if blizzard is ok with
it is such an idea viable the idea is
viable and I actually work for a company
called skill capped that flies me to
events all over the nation and they pay
about four dollars per minute to the
content providers who make videos and we
make instructional video on demand for
any any level Starcraft player any race
and it's all from top tier players
there's about ten of us right now making
videos for them so there are videos out
there that like instructional and
educational videos that I think you pay
like a six dollar monthly subscription
and you get access to over 600 vods or
something like that so it's very cheap
and it's well worth it in my opinion and
there's also tons of free stuff out
there like my friend and I are working
on this project right now called the
strategy bunker or the strap bunker to
youtube.com slash strap bunker we have a
bunch of guides vods I've put up a bunch
of high profile matches of mine
important matches where I'll just give
audio analysis of what I'm thinking
during the game my thought process how
to approach high-level play stuff like
that and then we also give lessons to
more people than I would like sometimes
I hard to balance playing and giving
lessons sometimes but I can't complain
about the demand and I'm really happy
that the demand exists for people who
are actually willing to a top level
players to get better and there's
actually
this guy's I think he's the Prince of
Dubai he flew out a couple of the guys
from team evil geniuses and paid them I
think like ten thousand dollars apiece
for a week's worth of starcraft 2
instruction so I'm trying to get on that
level yeah whenever I come over to his
house he's always giving a lesson never
has time for his friends anymore but uh
uh I like this question right here since
he was talking about youtube.com slash
the strat bunker you guys all know I
have a youtube channel to where the
casual viewer can go and just enjoy some
starcraft two matches youtube.com slash
hdstarcraft and the question here is how
important was YouTube for your success
and are the other features you'd like to
see that could enhance the starcraft 2
viewership on YouTube and how about
things that would make my own YouTube
experience better and since of course
Google owns YouTube I guess is a great
question I think YouTube was huge for my
success I mean it was a great video
platform obviously that millions viewers
watch every day and it seems that
there's a huge gaming sent like there's
a lot of viewers on YouTube that love to
watch video games I mean why not and the
cool thing about starcraft 2 is that you
love to play the game but it's almost
like you prefer to watch better players
play because it's very stressful to play
I mean yeah even for myself when I sit
at home and you know I want to play some
ladder after a couple I'm like man I'm
pooped I don't want to play anymore it's
too stressful so a lot of viewers like
that they love to just go on and watch
other people play the stress is on them
and they get to sit back and popcorn
drink soda watch watch a good cast so I
think YouTube was huge for for the
success that we're at right now and as
far as features that could go to enhance
the the viewer experience I guess some
may be some kind of a live chat system
or maybe some way the YouTube could do
some kind of a live stream setup because
right now we're forced to use live
stream or Ustream and I'd like to
YouTube to have maybe some kind of
YouTube live system I'm better support
just for gamers in general because not
only is YouTube a film &amp;amp; animation kind
of thing because if you guys look on the
categories
film animation they have news education
entertainment but gaming is often kind
of overlooked but it's huge there's so
many viewers watch gaming videos in
general it's it's in the millions per
month I think like 20 million 30 million
so it's really quite really quite a good
platform i really like youtube so yeah
where we are right now go ahead yeah
else have any other questions yeah is
anybody anybody have any questions
before we before we start casting some
games go for it hi um so you know I'm
sure lots of us to like her gamers and
we all you know probably had some
friends we played it when we were
younger and somebody was the best one
right and like I thought I was like
pretty hot in high school and then
I went to college and I met a lot more
people and I realized why I'm not nearly
as good as I thought I was but it's like
like how did it actually dawn on you
that you like had the potential to be
one of the best in the world um it's a
good question when I was growing up two
of my best friend's a guy named well
doesn't really matter but Ryan and
Garrett I grew up with them they both
play starcraft as well and we played
games throughout our entire youth we
would rush home from school every day
and just hop on and start playing with
one another and we were all really
competitive and we just kept pushing
each other and we all considered
ourselves pretty intelligent and we
would approach games like very
critically from a very young age when we
were like 14 and we just wanted to be
the best and I think one thing that
really catapulted us was when we started
playing games online and just realizing
how terrible we were when we played
multiplayer and just getting stomped
repeatedly and then from that you start
to realize that losing really isn't that
bad of a thing as long as you have that
bitter taste in your mouth and you want
to get better and you don't want to lose
any more you take every loss as like a
learning experience and then you just
build on that and eventually you get to
the point where I mean we competed in
all kinds of different games but we
always played RTS game realtime strategy
games like starcraft 2 on the side and
for fun we would constantly compete with
one another and then when starcraft 2
came out or before starcraft 2 came out
we all actually played i seek up for
about six months which is like it's just
a program that allows you to play on
man with starcraft brood war and a bunch
of the koreans play on IC cup and the
competition's real thick and we started
from ground zero which is d rank I think
a thousand points and I ended up getting
c plus B minus rank with Terran and zerg
after about six months and I was just
grinding out tons of games and that's
when I knew that I could probably do it
because I was competing with some of the
best players having come in at six
months when these guys were playing for
eight nine years and that's when I
really gained the confidence to say like
hey you know I might be able to do this
with starcraft 2 I should probably give
it a shot and then I just played a ton
of starcraft 2 during the beta and now
I'm here ok cool so if nobody else has
any questions I guess we'll go ahead and
get to the featured content today the
main presentation which is I guess you
guys here at Google had a starcraft 2
tournament which I think was 60 players
so we're going to go ahead and cast the
the finals which features I think an
intern and an employee I might be wrong
so we're going to go ahead and get into
the game how many of you actually play
starcraft 2 yeah right on how many of
you are gold league
how many of you are platinum how many of
you are diamond oh wow right on how many
of you have never played okay so only
about ten percent of you this is like
okay we've been talking like this is for
the casual the whole time but there's a
lot of diamond players here so yeah
that's pretty cool yeah cool so yes i'll
be doing spectating goonies all right so
is it a you're all stand up here is it
Finals game away think so yeah
did anyone in your other than Adam
compete in the tournament aw do you did
okay awesome okay
can we have the finalists just stand up
real quick so everyone knows who they
are due and vitas oi so that's that's do
and his opponent is his opponent here
his opponent has a flu okay alright so
this is the first game we're gonna go
ahead and load it up and I think do is
going to be playing the Protoss race so
I'm not sure what is opponent place it's
my mind okay alright so this is the
first game and this is the final screw
this crap yeah alright hopefully you
guys can hear me
oh there we go so we have a green
Terrence pawning it looks like they're
playing on the default napped Lost
Temple and Venus oi here is going to be
dark green turn this pond at the nine
o'clock position there are four
positions you can spawn it on this map
and so that is going to be our human
race here at dark we turn and his
opponent is going to be the pink Protoss
older players making shoutouts to their
local tech stops
okay so yeah Protoss vs. Taylor sure
you're very well informed about this
matchup you played this several times so
you
I about what you think indeed I have
experience dealing with protoss gum so
looks like a pretty standard opening
from our Terran player here he's opening
with what is that a 12 Rex yes indeed I
think you might have done it on 11 but
no big deal getting his gas up as well
so it looks like he's probably gonna
open into a factory or he might just get
one marine out and then switch directly
into some Marauders go to our Protoss
players base he is making a gateway and
getting some early gas kind of
interested to see where he heads with
this but looking pretty standard so far
from both players
it all happened
just put it put it up to your put it up
to your mouth it works all right so
there we go cool so these are the
mineral patches that the players collect
to receive money to build different
things these are the best this is the
best peen gas which allows you to tech
to the higher level unit and essentially
starcraft 2 is a game of war and
strategy the beginning of the game
typically revolves around collecting as
much money as you can in resources and
then checking up and out thinking and
out playing your opponent this is
definitely true and he is opening with a
factory so it looks like we're going to
see some mech play out of our Terran
user which I am a huge fan of I love
meking vs protoss which is basically
using factory units units like siege
tanks and slowly pushing your opponent
and constricting your opponent it's it's
it's a very meticulous style of playing
it looks like we got something building
in the bottom of the map we go we got a
proxy pylon in the bottom of the map and
look for some kind of building like a
star gate or a Dark Templar shrine or
whatever it's called basically buildings
that I don't like to see and it's
probably going to catch the Terran user
off guard especially if he makes a
Stargate it's really difficult to deal
with quick void rays in your base void
rays are essentially these flying
chandeliers that shoot like a blue beam
of death that kills everything they're
very nasty to deal with yeah they're
really good I don't know what the deal
is Lloyd resins man Blizzard if you're
hearing us right now please fix the void
ray
alright so at the Terran players because
he has opened with a very fast starport
here interestingly enough he hasn't
lifted it off and added to any of the
tech labs or any of the add-on said he's
got so he's just got a star port kind of
chilling they're also producing a
secondary barracks but we have some
units pushing across a map for our
Protoss player and it looks like oh
really wants to add some pressure right
now and let's see how effective this is
gonna be I think more skill is going to
be very key here but that force field uh
it's not really going to allow him to
add any pressure in fact that kind of
helped the Terran player and I think
he's going to be forced to fall back
yeah he basically created a nice little
wall for the Terran player to keep his
Marines behind and prevented his own
zealot from getting up there what you
want to do in a situation like that is
try and split the Terrans army in half
or trap about half of the Marines on
your side of the ramp resolution let's
see what the proxy building is see
what's going on we've also got a
scouting Factory
oh no don't you laugh this is this is
fairly standard actually oh I do this
all the time we do have a boy Drake
coming out of the Stargate oh man he is
supply block though so the void ray is
gonna take a little while to get out the
scouting Factory is actually a great
scouting maneuver it has pretty much
infinity hit points and you can get a
full scout on the entire Protoss base
which is really important because if you
burn a scan that's essentially like 270
300 ish minerals and you're not
necessarily going to find the buildings
that you really need to see in a Protoss
players base so I like to fly a factory
in and see what's going on all right so
it looks like we have the Protoss player
oh really trying for a second attempt
here to add some pressure to the Terran
player what the temperature still
doesn't realize is there are void rays
kind of building up towards the south
side of his basement these could be very
deadly if the Protoss tries to go for
that two-pronged attack he also has a
pylon warping in and something that
Protoss players can do is actually warp
in units through the problem but it
looks like we have a banshee also trying
to add some pressure to the economy of
the Protoss but that's going to be
watered away by those two stalkers and
the Banshee is going to be forced to
fall back it's too bad he didn't have
cloak right there huh he would have yet
cloak he could have done some damage to
the economy of the Protoss but look at
this another force field two
himself entering the Terran players base
place doesn't want to go I get what's
going on here this is like the whole I'm
gonna pretend to run up your ramp and
then force field so you can't get out
without my void rays secretly the void
rays are coming in there these are
already charged up there in super saiyan
mode nothing can stop them now and as a
Terran player this is pretty much the
worst possible situation you can be in
this is where I'm like banging my head
against the keyboard and talking about
how ridiculous this game is this is this
was some pretty sneaky play by the
Protoss player now it's forcing the
Terran to pull all of his scvs off to
try to repair the bunker all the forces
have walked up into the Terran main
right now and they're inflicting heavy
casualties on the Terran bio and all the
stds force the flight into the stalkers
as well not a good position to be in the
command center also dies from the void
rays I think this might just be good
game for Vita soy ah great game
good game indeed so as a rule of thumb
now I've pretty much just been making a
single Viking first against all Protoss
players just in case something like that
is going on because if you don't have a
Viking it's it's pretty much impossible
to stop that like if you guys saw he
what do you have like maybe 10 Marines
with stimpack and once the void rays are
charged to level 3 the marines just get
liquidated that's life here they're not
a viable counter to void rays unless you
have like 20 plus or something like that
yeah it was a bit of a difficult
position if you're a Terran player even
as when I'm assured if you was on
there's no Protoss player putting a seat
somewhere very hard when they come so i
usually cares what poor obviously that
game yeah we campaign what this mute
remote people mute are they like tuning
in as we go like hopping in okay that
makes sense alright so that was the
first game and this is the best of three
so if all really wins the second game
and he is the google starcraft 2
champion of the world of the world so
well google is the world so indeed
google owns the world's information here
we go so game number two between vita
soy and oh really vita soy it looks like
they've decided to play on Xel'Naga
caverns which is an interesting map very
wide open natural expansion hard to hold
on to beat us all here going to be
spawning as the green Terran at the top
right hand position and his opponent who
won the last game oh really going to be
once again Protoss pink Protoss down in
the bottom left I find this map very
difficult to play vs protoss on just
because of all the wide open areas at
the natural and then if you go to the
middle of the map at the epicenter
guitars go check it out real quick for
me sure thanks if you get like right
here if you look at the wall to the
central area in the middle of the map so
like from the zelnoc
it to mid right there Protoss can force
field really well right there and just
like split your army in half and create
this death trap in the middle of the map
and a lot of Protoss players will bait
you they'll like lull you into a false
sense of security and you're like okay
I've got this I'm winning I'm winning
you push across and then they just force
field your army in half well that's one
of those tactics that can be really
brutal if they cut your army in half and
then you're forced to basically fight or
retreat lose half your army yeah that's
against protoss it's really hard to deal
with and I mean maybe if you have like
ultras or Colossus or Thor or something
to stomp on the force fields that would
be great but I never have that so I'm
always in a situation where my units are
just stuck for like ten seconds alright
so vitasoy opening one barracks one
refinery relatively standard not walling
off his frontal door and the enemy
Protoss is going to get his scouting
probe inside keep in mind that in
starcraft 2 you do need to have vision
by sending an unit in otherwise you're
completely in the dark and any good
Protoss player will always try to harass
those SUVs that are constructing those
buildings always a nasty thing to deal
with your Terran yeah it's super
annoying and the shield regeneration
rate in starcraft 2 is a lot faster than
it was in brood war so probes can
essentially get i don't know i'm at five
if they're my crowing perfectly a
Protoss player can get about five scds
to half if not kill one of the SC vs
that's building a building and it's just
frustrating to deal with absolutely
that's kind of why I enjoy walling
because really walling off against
protoss I think it's pretty essential
otherwise they can chrono boost out that
first zealot and just send it straight
to your base like for instance if he
just sent this one zealot straight to
his base it would probably show up at
around the time there were two marines
and as a single zealot can kill two
marines very easily if not just run
straight to the mineral line and kill a
few SC vs and it's pretty much free to
wall off so why not do it now I'm
curious to see what oh really is going
to try to do this game because the last
game
you tried to pretty much cheese his
opponent through a proxy Stargate which
a you know also known as throwing that
Stargate in a very hidden location and
what do we have here this game a pylon
all the way in the bottom right-hand
corner of the map aney is warping in a
gateway this is actually no we're really
barely helps the distance between his
gateway all the way to the Terran base
so I'm really interested to see why he's
put this gateway up out here but of
course the Terran player doesn't see
this so this could be a surprise attack
there's also a second gateway coming in
for oh really meanwhile back at the
Terran he's got a factory up getting a
tech lab on that Factory and tacking
straight up to that star port once again
last game he made pretty good use of
that Banshee but ultimately was not able
to hold off the void ray attack I
actually really like this play from the
Protoss player um basically he's
building two gates in his main and then
he's proxying the other two gateways so
like in the event that the Terran does
Scout his main or scans his main he's
only gonna see those two gateways so
he's not going to think that there's
some kind of really aggressive for gate
push which is what's coming to his front
door in about two seconds I really don't
think he's anticipating this and he also
opened with the 111 which is the
barracks into factory into starport
build so he's not going to have many
units to deal with an all in rush like
this and I hope for his sake that he
builds a bunker at the front door
because that would help him a lot
speaking of which he is getting a bunker
at the front door paint user and I think
this will help to bolster that ramp when
the four gate attack does come these
gateways not the fourth one not warping
into warp gate quite yet we should see a
pile on going up there we go this is
going to help the Protoss player bring
in reinforcements right away right
across the entire center of the map and
nice force field derek all walking off
this is going to be able to take out all
those Marines these stalkers are fairly
good three stalkers versus three Marines
a good trade if the stalkers don't dine
there we go now the Terran player and a
lot of trouble yeah he's in a ton of
trouble if he had I don't know why he
pushed down his ramp like that that's a
super risky move especially when you
know that there's a century like sitting
right outside your ramp and you have a
bunker up you might as well just load up
wait until you get that Banshee out and
then see what happens and I think he
might be scouting these proxy gay boys
just a she right here oh it's gonna be
so close Oh every guy I think daddy not
season on my target that that's such bad
luck I had any one soda like that
happens yeah he has no idea where all
these forces are coming from because
right now he thinks only two gateways in
the Protoss main is oh really cheating
how is he doing this bring in so many
forces and he is going to get this
Banshee into the Protoss base but is it
too little too late just like the
previous game we'll have to wait and see
because this is a very menacing Protoss
ball right outside the Terran front door
they're just cannolis walk up a little
yeah the toss is coming in with a ton of
stalkers here and his pan she is just
attacking the assimilator he hasn't
killed a single probe well and yeah it
hasn't zero kills and it's getting taken
out by stalkers now so that's just too
bad um yeah GG markers to deal with GG
from the Terran player so the Protoss
player oh really congratulations for
winning the Google starcraft 2
tournament work wait 20
alright so in anticipation of the quick
games we also decided to go ahead and
cast a higher level game no offense
we're going to go ahead and cast a
special game that end user has cooked up
this is one of his games against cats
who is a very very good sir player so
this is going to be a high level of
starcraft to match terran vs zerg which
is my favorite matchup it's like the
epitome epitome of starcraft so here we
go we're gonna go watch a two-part game
both of them gonna be pretty good
hopefully it's also my favorite matchup
in starcraft oh I bet I enjoy cbtl I bet
I bet you do CVTs a lot of fun I think
there's a lot of different stuff you can
do a lot of different openings Taylor
you are so friendly in the beginning of
every game sup dude yeah here we go so
Taylor going to be spawning Taylor the
tall guy right here as the red Terran at
the six o'clock position also going to
be on Lost Temple I'm assuming this is a
ladder match is it not yeah we queued up
twice on ladder and then he immediately
posted the replays on his clan website
so I think you beat me in one of them
I'm not sure which game it is but that's
pretty standard when people beat you on
the ladder they go post all the replays
everywhere and talk about it but uh oh
EpiPen use it yeah I would post that
everywhere Phi beat you alright so let's
talk a little bit about the Zerg player
here often times Zerg this is a race we
haven't seen all day today the buggy
race what they like to do is really pump
that economy up because the Zerg player
typically vs terran and vs protoss if
they're even in terms of economy and
keep in mind that these are the
harvesters these are the guys that get
you that money if you're behind or
you're even with the terran protoss
you're really behind you have to be
ahead you have to have an extra
expansion and you guys can see that
there are extra expansion notes where
you can build those bases and start to
double your income and zerk really needs
double they need to at least get that
income a little bit higher if they want
to be even with the Terran player very
brutal if the chair comes in with those
units and they're not ready uh yeah for
surrogates it's really important like he
said to get your economy going extremely
fast and then also Zerg is the only race
that can make multiple mining units out
of this same mining unit producing
structure naturally so yeah the hatchery
they can they can produce multiple
drones at once and that the key to
playing zerg is just to pump drones when
and where you can if you're if there's
times during the game where you feel
safe and you have a window of
opportunity where you can pump multiple
drones you need to take those
opportunities and pull ahead of your
opponent in economy otherwise you're
going to lose the game because surg
units in a one-on-one situation or even
in a groupon group situation don't fare
too well against protoss or Terrans so
you need overwhelming masses of units
that you can freely throw away and
replace that's basically the whole
philosophy behind zerg the units are
really expendable what cats wants to do
this game is really try to control the
entire map as zerg you want to be able
to invest and control as many resource
locations as humanly possible or zerg
Lee possible and what cats is doing here
I really like this he's actually got a
fairly early second guess and he's
pumping that metabolic boost right away
this is fairly standard nowadays in cbt
get speed before getting that fast
expansion hatchery down because speed
for your zerglings really helps deal
with any kind of fast small Marauder
marine attack or heli and speed links
are very good against just basic one two
or three hellions and pain user maybe
you could talk a little bit about what
your strategy was at this point in the
game yeah sure if you're on remote
please mute and also do we have game
sound we should have game sound we do
okay that's on yeah um at this point in
the game I pulled all my mining units
off of gas because I wanted to get up a
really early expansion and I don't know
if I've dropped the command center yet
checked them check my phone real quick
um I think yeah so I've I've got to
new barracks coming up right now in a
single factory and I wanted to do a
marine Hellion timing push really early
on in the game always that see ya with
your dirt it's always generally pretty
good usually you can pick off an
overlord on the way at the very least
kill a couple servings but I saw his
base and he's just on one base with a
really quick layer coming so I was super
thrown off by this he also has no
fighting units to speak up he has a
single Queen so I got a full scout on
his pace and at this point I was just
thinking one base muta that's really the
only opening that I could think of him
going and I was just trying to get in
there and do a little bit of harassment
but he popped out speedlings at the
perfect time right as my first Hellion
got in there so I was unable to do any
damage with that and now I was just
focused on getting an expansion before
he got his up and I do have a command
center building in my base safely behind
my wall in Oh Hellion gets taken out
there by the speedlings right as it
approached the safety of the Marines on
that high ground a little bit of a loss
air for pain user and cats now is going
to be able to take map control with his
speedlings and the unfortunate thing
here for Zurich against terran is oh if
user doesn't lift up that supply depot
that is a frontal door right there those
Earthlings could get in there and do a
lot of nasty damage but it looks like
ping is now gonna move out gonna try to
secure that natural going to throw down
a bunker and as well as add a reactor on
this barracks because he is anticipating
that muta attacked fairly soon also
getting tech lab here before those
upgrades and is now going to try to
secure that frontal expansion this is
going to be a key part in the game can
he secure it or are the zerglings going
to flood in and do too much damage it
looks like the heli in there with that
flamethrower roasting away one zergling
and back inside the third base we do
have a spire coming up and I love the
placement of this spire away from where
the COMSAT would technically scan it if
pain user had scanned already this is
not going to be seen by pain but I think
he can anticipate the medalist coming I
actually scan his base at one point and
I completely missed the spire because
of the location what he's doing right
there is he's using the Overlord ability
to drop creep on the ground and it
enables you to builds or buildings like
in random places I've seen people put
them like on top of their legit their
natural just all over the place and it
makes it really hard to anticipate what
unit they're actually using but judging
from his opening I figured then no
another hÃ©lÃ¨ne gets picked off right
there judging from his opening I fig
tree alee with these hellions that I'm
sending out all I'm really trying to do
is figure out how many units he has what
kind of units he has and what tech
buildings he has and he's pretty much
denying me from doing that but I'm more
than ready for the new lists when they
come in i already have missile turrets
up in all the key locations and I'm
starting to get Thor's out as well and
mixed them in with my army so I think
that a one base muta liske opening like
the way he did it can be really
effective but you have to catch the
Terran off guard and I think it would
almost be good to drop something like a
roach warn or some other type of tech
building just to make me think that
you're doing something like that and
then drop the spire afterwards and just
completely switch it up on me great
positioning of the turrets here by pain
user which is going to ward away those
air units and the Marines also can shoot
air as well fending away those medalists
once again the nice thing for the Zerg
player right here the blue player is
he's got complete map control against
the taran taran is pretty much walled in
because they're they're fearful of
moving out for those medalists which
control the skies right now and what
cats can do our Zerg player is grab a
third expansion looks like that's what
he's planning to do is harvester count
is significantly higher than the Terran
players 44 / 33 and now he's starting to
secure this gold the gold minerals give
a little bit more increased income than
the blue and we should expect to see
pain user he's gonna have to push out
soon he just needs to bulk up that
Terran ball move out and make something
happen but right now cats controls the
sky and he's getting that baneling nest
which is very brutal against terran bio
those things just roll in explode and do
so much damage yeah they really do
they're tough to deal with
and they're really under used a lot of
zerg players don't really use banelings
too much I think they're one of the
better units that Zerg has especially if
you use burrow and wait for people to
walk over your banelings and then just
blow them all up kill their whole army
that works out pretty well and a lot of
people don't keep mobile detection with
their army well at least Terran you have
to get a raven against zerg and that's
your only form of mobile detection so I
don't often get Ravens against zerg
unless I know that they're going for
some kind of burrow play or broad
roaches or something like that it's very
rare that I actually get a raven
absolutely that's not often that sir
clears go for invisible types of units
it looks like this is the push we've
been waiting for and here's the key part
of the game kenseth or do enough damage
the mute as thor do splash damage to air
looks like some mute is taking hits
right there but I don't think any fell
the one thing cats wants to do here is
spread his meters outfly them above the
thor and then engage but he's also got
to be careful about those Marines
especially with stimpaks which AKA drugs
makes them shoot about two times faster
for a temporary amount of time so what
cat's needs to do is get his mainly
these are the banelings ladies and
gentlemen and they do a lot of damage to
infantry what they just roll in there
and they take so much away from the
Terran forces so if we look at the
income tab we still have cats ahead 1800
to 14 it looks like pain is going to try
to secure that gold expansion and this
is wise play slowly push out to the
Terran slow push control the map and
slowly increase your territory but these
investors could prove to be a bit of a
problem problematic for the Terran
forces especially that fungal growth and
bailing combination the fungal growth
and banelings both go together really
well they're very synergistic
combination of units the fungal growth
routes all of your units in place so
that they can't move and then the
banelings just roll in and blow
everything up and it makes it it makes
banelings of that much better because
you can't run away from them pretty much
and that's really the only counter to
banelings is to run away and right now
I'm just trying to fortify the middle of
the map
and make sure that I have a secure
position there which will allow me to
safely take my third expansion so if you
see I'm dropping a bunch of random
bunkers and I'm doing that because I
know he has a bunch of banelings so I'm
really worried that he's just going to
try and attack me during a timing window
when I'm not paying attention or try and
do something sneaky so I'm just forward
flying up the middle of the map and I
know that I have turrets at my main and
my natural so I'm not really worried
about muta lists harassing my main or my
natural my natural expansion which is
one right outside my main base and he is
actually trying to trying to harass me a
little bit with the mule escs right now
but largely ineffective with this her
ass he hasn't really managed to do any
critical damage to me throughout this
entire game and now I'm gonna go for a
little bit of a drop but if I remember
the same correctly I think he shuts down
my drop pretty pretty well well let's
see the drop ships are going to come in
right into the main and drop off these
Marauders Marauders with stem take out
buildings Mary bad but those feelings
going to skate right on the creep and
try to engage and fend off the Marauders
an evolution chamber gets taken down but
there was no upgrade being researched
there at that time or perhaps there was
there was an upgrade and the fungal
growth also stopping the dropship I'll
just barely gets out of there with to
help meanwhile the medalists engaging at
the center of the field but those
Marines are going to repel it away lots
of action currently in the game but
looks like we haven't seen that massive
battle that we've been waiting for quite
yet that's a lot of paintings to as a
fourth hatchery trying to come up this
marine is like oh god it gets taken out
right there and the zerk here trying to
secure his fourth expansion and he's
also getting corruptors I love this it
looks like he's going to try to tech up
to the nasty nasty brood lords he has
the greater Spyre out which does unlock
that technology route and brood lords
are so powerful against any race unless
our Terran player here pain user gets
Vikings he could be in a lot of trouble
it's me right now 129 and dessert
players at 167 and doesn't look too good
for you pain yeah brood lords are
amazing and I had absolutely no idea
that he was switching to brood lords he
totally caught me with my pants down on
that one I probably should have scanned
his base a couple more times yeah
because he was on three base and I saw
that he was only making banelings
roaches and Ling's and he only had the
fume util escs that he made earlier so
it wasn't massing them so I should have
I should have known that something was
up but I was more worried about those
green glowing like explosive things that
I kept seeing everything so very very
good and we hadn't engaged at this point
yet so I haven't whittled down his
baneling numbers at all so there's
basically just this giant atomic bomb
waiting for me in the middle of the map
and I was really worried about pushing
into it so I was trying to play passive
and the only way to break a passive
Terran is to siege them with brood lords
and reloads are essentially flying siege
tanks I mean they can shoot really far
right here I actually managed to do a
little drop on the top of the map and
pick off his fourth expansion without
losing any units which was really good
for me that kind of brought me back into
the game oh if you lose these two
dropship so that could yeah I did a nice
equalizer for the desert cats takes out
one dropship the force is trying to
evacuate the helicopter before it gets
taken out that dropship gets taken out
as one the Thor's gonna rappel away
those meters so oh here comes those
frugally so those are so nasty they are
just going to force these siege tanks to
unseat and fall back the Marines here
valiantly trying to port it to the
frontal lines to take out the blue boys
but the banelings taking out a couple
but it looks like they're cats lost all
of his brood lords that's pretty huge
but he's gonna push forward anyways and
try to make this game his and he's gonna
throw down
on the growth huge battle here and it
looks like a Terran mech mind says get
penetrated by desert forces today I
think it comes down to like 14 wonder
like where my force away from the
roaches so that he can't get the one
that's in red oh and my to Thor's
managed to hold off everything thank God
but the thing that is so weird the Zerg
player can macro very quickly oh my
goodness look at this do these to know
these overlords don't not have load yet
so they can't pick up these banelings
and circlings but cats is going to hide
them amongst the bushes here when
there's late have it coming cannot see
the production tab is showing ventral
sex on the way so I think cats is just
waiting to get that upgrade for his
overlords and then very soon he's going
to drop the speedling banelings there we
go the overlords are loading up these
atomic bombs and they're going to go
straight into possibly the main or just
drop them onto the Terran forces right
here this could be very brutal what his
paintings are going to be able to do I
think this might just be a diversion
right here as he's dropping off some
speedlings into the barracks gonna try
to halt the production of the Terran
player what are you thinking right now
Taylor I was just reacting he's
attacking my friend right now
Oh Mike yeah it's ax me with a bunch of
ultralift semi front right here I was
not ready for that text which either I
would have had a lot more Marauders and
I known that he was going to switch the
ultras like this but right now I
literally have like three units I have
two Marines and a medevac and he has
like a bunch of ultralisks running
around my base and he's also dropping my
main which i think i fended off with my
vikings i picked off a ton of overlords
with these Vikings and right now I'm
just pumping units like crazy and adding
production buildings and building
planetary fortresses lying to effort
leads to survive yeah I'm coming zircon
slot more speedlings coming in Taylor
here can you hold it off you looks like
you take out that final ultra list with
the speedlings coming in doing
significant damage to your
reinforcements it is looking very bad
for you you've also lost all your
harvesters that's a gold expansion I
gotta say this is not a good day for the
Terran Confederacy yeah we're not doing
so hot right now he really has me on my
back foot right now he's forcing me to
react to everything that he's doing as
opposed to me dictating the flow of the
game and me imposing my will on him he's
just imposing his will on me right now
but a lot of times in the late game like
this especially against surge if you can
just weather
storm and deal with everything they
throw at you sometimes you can get into
a situation where you can bring the game
back into a stable situation right now I
have a planetary fortress up in the
middle of the map which cuts off his
Avenue to my fourth and fifth expansion
so if he wants to fight me in the middle
of the map again he's gonna have to
fight me at a planetary fortress which
is good for me not good and now I'm
trying to go on the trying to establish
a little bit of a position past the
halfway mark on this map which I haven't
crossed once this entire game because
he's been attacking me the whole time
and dropping me and just doing all kinds
of other really annoying stuff but I
think I caught him in transition right
here he's trying to go in the range
rolls and he wasn't really ready for me
to push right now oh my goodness this
could be very bad for the Zerg player
I'm not sure what's happening here it
looks like and you know what you weren't
as bad off as you thought you actually
had two paces to the other side of the
map and it looks like you could possibly
take out this gold expansion what a
brutal come back if you could take out
this hatchery and the remaining cut off
desert reinforcements I mean one thing I
got to fall cats for is he's not
spreading the creep as well as you
should be you guys can see the creep is
just isolated to each hatchery nice
fungal growth to help I guess little
downloads force a little bit but these
Marauders here going to go in and engage
the ultras ultras are fairly good but
Marauders can micro way from those uh
lyst another Zerg attack this is cat
last stand here he has to hold this off
surprisingly between users somehow
making a comeback attack could he take
out all desert forces I think that's a
lot of carcasses on the ground
is going to push forward and possibly
secure a victory out of Hell's beach
yeah it what happened was basically as
he launched that really aggressive last
push or possibly what happened so we
have some zerg tears the trail of tears
coming coming down GG game it's called
we had the one on well played Taylor
well played indeed I think he might he
definitely gets the best of me in one of
these games so I don't I don't remember
which one it is but I think it might be
the other one that we have all right so
here we go we're going to go ahead and
load up the final game that we're going
to be broadcasting tonight here at
Google it's going to be another rematch
between Taylor and cats paying user and
cats and here we go it's going to be on
metal opolis cat spawning as the red
zerg at six o'clock location and he is
going to be here on metal opolis his
opponent and user going to be the blue
Terran over at the eight o'clock look
location on metal opolis one thing that
are you feeling about that last one man
that was a huge comeback for sure that
was a very I was out of that game the
whole time I was not expecting you to
come back out of the blue I mean you
were down an economy he took out several
of your harvesters and somehow you just
came in there with a final last hoorah
last push and you took it indeed and one
thing that it's really tough playing
against cats cuz he doesn't really play
like a lot of other zergs out there he
launches these like random aggressive
attacks and he doesn't there's no
precursor he doesn't Telegraph it at all
he just like masses up a bunch of units
and then just like rolls to your base
and says what's up and it's it's really
hard to deal with because um most circs
drone up very aggressively throughout
the entire game they just try and play a
very macro oriented game and I think a
lot of that has to do with the way I
drah plays whoo he's basically the
number one zerg in the world are the
number one foreigner Zerg in the world
and when I say foreigner I mean like us
like to the Koreans we are considered
foreigners and starcraft is their world
they are so much better than we are it's
remarkable but right now actually there
is a tournament I think for 150 thousand
dollars u.s. that's going on in south
korea right now and it's one of the
first tournaments that's it's called the
gsl and
it's the global starcraft league and
it's one of the first tournaments that's
actually been open to foreigners
normally you have to obtain a pro gaming
license in Korea which is something
that's very difficult to come by you
have to win a tournament that's held I
think by yearly that like 10 to 15
foreigners have entered and they haven't
made it out of the first round except
for one person Nonie who is he's from
the United States I think he made it to
the semi-finals of one but ended up
getting knocked out anyway so yeah no
foreigners have ever obtained an
official pro gaming license by winning
that tournament so it's very difficult
to get that pro gaming license but like
you said it's nice that they have the
gsl now wide open for any kind of
participants to come in and compete
hopefully we'll see you there in the
next the next competition it's stiff
there's a lot of good players out there
there really are um I mean yeah I would
probably have to win a few majors here
first before any kind of sponsor would
be willing to commit that kind of money
into me to send me to Korea there's
always hope man yeah I'm hopeful I'd
have to I'd have to pull like at elo and
like new crush somebody and like the
finals of a tournament people people
love the spectators love watching
interesting and creative play and for
those of you guys who don't know if you
play terran you can go for nukes which
you know nuclear missiles which are very
hard to use but they're always a crowd
pleaser and TLO the little one uses nuke
so effectively and that's one of the
reasons why he's become so successful
but he is a great player great player as
well yeah he's really good yeah so
anyways let's go ahead and talk about
this game trailer uh looks like you're
coming off fresh off that victory come
back out of nowhere cats got to be a
little bit annoyed about that so it
looks like interestingly he's uh well
he's opened with a pretty standard
hatchery first spawning pool later
getting a roach worn out he's pumping
out for roaches he's only got one
extractor this is all you need to feel
your Roach economy and I think what he's
doing here is just getting roaches to
possibly deal with hellions that might
come out because you do love those
hellions and there's one right there
the flamethrower on the on the turret
does a lot of damage to drones and you
know roaches hold that off quite well
yeah roaches do very well against aliens
and this game I really wasn't
anticipating his kind of early
aggression he played like a very all in
style this game and really aggressive
usually players who early expand and
switch into roch they don't pressure you
this early and he came straight to my
base oh I think I losses yet was out
which kind of hurts cuz I really have no
units to speak of to deal with this rush
that he has coming and he has a bunch of
speedlings and roaches queued up he's
getting circling speed so he really just
had me on my back foot and I'm trying to
take a really early natural expansion
right now I think I'm have a command
center about to go up but I do manage to
get up a bunker and hold this initial
Roach push of his with Marines and
hellions but that definitely wasn't the
right unit composition to deal with the
units he's making and he was going
speedling Roach and I went pretty much
predominantly Marine Hellion and Marines
and aliens do not do very well against
roaches and nor do they do very well
against speedlings hellions with pre
igniter which is like the damage upgrade
for hellions it makes them much more
effective against zerglings but without
that they're only good in large numbers
against zerg links really oh absolutely
Marauders especially unless they're
large numbers they fail to zerglings
quite easily especially if cats can get
that surround off looks like a unit
they're getting taken out and any of
your going to try to secure that natural
front door gonna get his economy running
right now one thing that pain user I
like what you're doing here is adding on
those barracks this is going to help
secure that front door you're going to
need forces and bunkers of course
because the Zerg right now is playing so
aggressively he's got speed just kicking
right there that really increases the
speed of those speedlings as they
traverse across this one lane highway
across the map and we also have roaches
coming from the southern road as well so
this could be some kind of a dual
pronged attack the speedling is going to
run into these Helens got us around them
opinions are not controlling
allows them to die could have ran them
away possibly and this is the first
person view of a teaser we were watching
right now not a good sight to see force
a pool his harvesters off the line the
fight that's never a position you want
to be in those harvesters need to be
mining and not fighting and if we take a
look at kat's first person view you guys
can see he's struggling to make what he
can't he just built a spire right there
on the creep and he's forced to pull
back his roaches as well from the Terran
advance so really as you guys can see in
that first person view both players
really controlling the their units and
bouncing around the map as much as
possible very difficult to play
starcraft 2 at this high high level of
play also he really wasn't droning up
nearly as hard as I thought he was he
was making a ton of military units when
I thought that he was making a bunch of
economical units and he kind of catches
me off guard a ton of speedlings and
roaches that I just did not anticipate
coming not good right there getting
surrounded paint user by all those
roaches and links that cancer felt good
no not at all and I think that's one
thing that can put his repair ahead a
lot as if you just like crushes one of
your initial pushes just kills
everything you have it makes it really
difficult to recover from there because
it's taryn you never really want your
army to wipe I mean if if your reserve
player and you lose a majority of your
army it's okay you can rebuild all those
yes right here he's going through the
runway and he's also trying to take out
my bunkers he's playing super aggressive
I'm forced to pull off and repair my
bunkers with a bunch of SCV's i think
still manages and I think I there
even hold this off I don't think he
kills a ton of SUVs right here the SUV's
by the way are those harvesters they're
pulling off the mineral line to fight
the roaches once again if we look at the
harvester count though engines are still
ahead at 42 harvesters so he's really
been pumping update economy whereas cats
has been pumping out fighting unit still
has three roaches here trying to force
off the Terran a defense and it looks
like I think being users gonna be able
to hold on throwing out to new bunkers
to fortify that front wall where oh my
goodness we have needle is flying in
right now for cats and this has got to
be bad for you yeah he's just like not
making harvesters he's just like
switching from unit to unit and just
being really aggressive and I found it
very hard to deal with and it comes back
to my front door again and I don't
manage to get anything into these
bunkers I don't think well you have
nothing to shoot the air we at these
medalists are flying so I've added doing
though anti-air right now damage to you
right now I'm in a really bad situation
I think I'm forced to lift I have a
couple missile turrets in my main I
think that I can fall back to but yes
they do have one yeah I've one missile
turret I don't think that's gonna stop
him oh this is so brutal you're losing
all of your harvesters those blue STDs
are all getting taken out the muta lists
and the zerglings still rampaging at the
tarrant natural rubber burning down and
the command center lifts off that's one
thing that chair players can't do is
their buildings somehow someway to Phi
the laws of physics and just fly up in
the air and float cats here now gonna
secure his third this is where I think
the Zerg player he has a feeling of
confidence in control he can start to
pump out a lot of drones and catch up or
actually his way ahead only 45 233
mm-hmm he actually in a great situation
right now I'm in possibly as bad of a
situation as you can get to I've been
forced to lift off my natural expansion
pull back into my main base I'm
trying to recuperate here but I really
just don't have enough units to deal
with what he's throwing at me and as
soon as he takes that gold expansion
he's just going to skyrocket ahead of me
and there's really no way for me to deal
with it well right now you're only on
one base whereas he is about to get
three I mean yeah the third is just
about to get saturated by the drones and
there's another attack coming this is
constant pressure from the Zerg player
yeah it's a style play then I am really
not used to and I think it makes him a
pretty unpredictable and good player
like a lot of serves the way they play
is so much more predictable they just
have like standard evolution of tech
they have standard attack timings not
aggressive yeah they're not aggressive
and he just goes like you know all in
speedling to Roach and then straight
into muta it's just very difficult to
deal with because I'm forced to build
units that shoot air I'm forced to put
up missile turrets around my base to
defend it I'm forced to switch tech as
well and if I don't anticipate what he's
doing and stay one step ahead a
situation like this can present itself
well right now you're playing extremely
defensively you have no options to be
aggressive save this dropship this might
be your saving grace Taylor if you can
get these for Marauders into the third
base and inflict some damage to the
sword then perhaps you're back in this
game because right now things are
looking very very bleak 40 harvesters
under 55 55 tell me about these
Marauders pain user are you gonna be
able to do any damage with these I don't
know I'm trying to just pick off any
kind of tech dealings that I and I
managed to force a cancel on the
baneling nest
I think I also forced to cancel on this
upgrade only transfuse is the evolution
chamber but I think it goes down anyway
he's actually really quick with those
trans fuses whenever I start attacking
one of his buildings that's up he always
transf uses it great control from the
Marauders but the middle is coming in
overhead pick off that dropship and that
for Marauder paratrooper party dies in
parishes in the zerg main not a good
sight to see for our Terran pain user
you're trying everything you can to get
back in this game I think you really
need a third expansion here you need to
secure this resource node to get back in
this game whereas cats has got the gold
up and running he's looking very strong
economically he's got a fourth base up
as well and you've got some hellions
running across the outside perimeter
outskirts of metal opolis perhaps you
can do some damage with this yeah when I
get there I realized that he really
doesn't have any drones at his at his
30s like a three drones i was- be
choosers yeah I was I was hoping for a
bit of a gold mine here I don't barbecue
yeah didn't didn't get it it was like a
pig take what you can and then of course
the Queen there punching away at those
aliens it looks like the mutants and the
roach is gonna fend on that Hellion
attack boom gets up another drone right
there and there's last Hellion trying to
run away it gets taken out oh and he's
also getting baneling speed now and I
think that that's pretty much what does
nyan once he gets a ton of banelings I
was after I drove his baneling nest I
was hoping that I would have a window
I'm to push with a bunch of Marines
would be that window of opportunity
though here comes the feelings trying to
get on the marine Oh half the Marines
getting taken out these herbal or just
kind of floating in i'm not sure what
they're there for it gets just to
distract and it looks like cats here oh
nice gonna push back karen it man out
he's picked off two roaches take what
you can Milan is it I amazigh fighting
the roach they're also getting taken out
enriched read the overlords here
actually are spewing creep that which
does help desert player get a little bit
more of a speed bonus the families are I
love that control from pain user getting
the fragile Marines those small guys
away from those green little rolly
pollies which do so much damage and here
the overlords are exposed to all of them
getting taken out by the Marines but
this Earthlings gonna surround and take
out oh nice control these are loading up
in the dropships and runs away and these
forces cannot attack the air nice
control right there from Taylor doing
whatever you can to get back in this
game because of course things aren't
looking too good yeah I needed to take a
third at some point if at all possible
and I was unable to do that because of
all the pressure that he had been
applying this entire game sweet has made
it really difficult for me to get back
in this or make anything happen but he
does throw away a lot of units towards
the end of the game here and out of
points I thought I thought there were a
couple points at which I could climb
back into this but I just was unable to
inflict any critical damage to his
economy he's pretty much shut down all
my drops all my Hellion run buys haven't
really done anything substantial and
income tab he's also got alt roasts on
the way which resorts ultralisks and
brood lords very nasty he's got all the
Zerg top-tier units which I mean it's
very difficult to deal with with marines
and marauders these are the final
evolution of desert forces this is the
epitome of cert these brutes are so
powerful as flying artillery the Marines
desperately trying to get away from is
earth they do not want to allow them to
surround the Marines this is going to be
so close great control for pain user you
might even be forced to load up into the
drop ships but as he retreats he has
lost so many of his forces this is what
remains most valiant marines and
marauders now only three remain free are
running away from the constant Zerg
pressure and this is so brutal the
Terran forces diminished at these three
Marines are gonna run home and tell
their buddies how how brutal the war is
out there did you guys see what happened
to chin hahaha baneling rolled right in
his face we're not leaving the base
again hahaha so these Brewers coming in
taking out all my production here I
finally did get my third up and running
and really really trying to climb back
in this economically but he hits my
third right now
feelings and he's also hitting my main
with these brood lords just hitting me
from all angles making it very difficult
to deal with and I just don't have
enough forces to deal with this one of
the great aspects of a high level
starcraft 2 players being able to attack
from multiple angles as you guys can see
here the Zerg attacking whip through
Lords into the main killing off the
production facilities and he's also
attacking this third expansion for it's
all the harvesters to run away once
again the command center lifting off and
that is going to keep it alive for now
but there's just too much Zerg if you
guys look on the mini-map it's all
dominated by red eric has infested this
entire city area on metal opolis and
pain user is just trying to recuperate
and regather possible to scrambling at
this point trying to make you oh my
goodness and now the ultras are out when
I saw these I was like oh god facepalm
that's not not fun do you never want to
see ultralisks and their tiny little
heads zoom in on one of those tiny
little heads they are so small I mean
they they have the brain of like a
dinosaur day he brain it's all good they
have the the giant plate to just
headbutt things in the face with a new
80 damage to buildings and whatnot but
anyway he's pushing right now to try and
end this game I actually have my forces
out of position right now I'm waiting at
the middle of the map I was hoping I
could catch him on his way across but
he's already across yeah he's he's
already way up there I don't think you
noticed this and you're like staying
just outside of the range of my sensor
tower that is true and here he comes
gonna barrel up this ramp and this is
not looking too good for Nero not at all
you never want to let your stds get
caught off guard like that oh this is
destroying my rota why now oh my god
also stopping the retreat of the MER of
the s CBS but rotters here coming from
the south to try to save this expansion
but the damage has been done as can be
seen by the litter debris on the ground
and all those harvesters dying and user
1 lambda temp fungal growth holding
those units from retreating yes fungus
so until they're close but I think that
cat is going to a sure victory here and
users still in this game though hasn't
tapped out quite yet so gotta give you
some credit there for hanging on with
alcohol is definitely lost I mean I just
played that last game right so I thought
there was a slight chance i could be
able to crawl back into this but there's
no way GG well you wait late is called a
good game alright so yeah thanks
everybody for for coming out I hope you
guys enjoyed the talk as a pleasure
coming here and seeing everybody and
hopefully we can come back sometime in
the future thank you
