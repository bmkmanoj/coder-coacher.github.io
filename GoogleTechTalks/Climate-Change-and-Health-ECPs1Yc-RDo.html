of introducing Paul Epstein to you
before I do that let me just say that as
I think all of you know Google org is
involved in three areas the global
climate crisis global health and global
poverty these are very iterative things
as people emerge from poverty as they
have in China they use more electricity
as they use more electricity then the
energy thus consumed creates more carbon
as that carbon goes into the atmosphere
temperature rises as the temperature
rise those places that are amongst the
poorest in the world get inundated with
water so if the climate crisis continues
China has remarkably taken 300 million
people out of poverty and thrust them
into the middle class unfortunately
there's another 300 million standing in
line behind them another 300 million
behind them if they all go in the same
way consuming the same amount of energy
Bangladesh will be underwater and
there'll be a hundred million Muslim
Bangladesh ease who become refugees in
Hindu India and then to China and the
same thing is true with the relationship
between health and climate places in
Africa that were established at 6,000
feet because the anopheles mosquito
which carries malaria couldn't go to
that height now they can go to that
height so you're seeing a total
interaction between the climate change
between global health and poverty each
feeding the other and I'm so pleased
that Paul is here today and Paul Paul
and I have known each other for I won't
tell you how long but but Paul and Fitz
Mullen who's over here who's at George
George Washington fits Who Sheamus
mcmanus Mullen the three of us were all
interns together back in nineteen
sixty-nine that's how far back we go and
Paul now is at the epicenter of all
things that Google org does he is the
head of the associate director of the
Center for Health and global environment
at Harvard he is working on the
interface between climate and health he
lived in Mozambique for a long time
speaks Portuguese travels back and forth
to Africa has worked with Brazilian
immigrants in Boston is a physician is
an epidemiologist has a master's in
public health and is one of the most
widely respected people in the world at
the interface between the climate crisis
and global health so please join me in
welcoming Paul Epstein turned on okay
your quilts it hello
well thank you larry and it is a great
pleasure to be with Larry and fits and
with you all I was going to start with
1996 when we started our Center because
of this confluence I'm going to start in
ninth 1854 just for a second where
Rudolf Virchow who is a physician and a
surgeon took to the streets as an
activist and said cholera smallpox TB in
London you know the story with jon snow
but behind it there were some physicians
medical people nurses I'm sure who were
talking about the social and economic
and environmental determinants of health
and that helped create this whole
movement which actually led to a
leveling off of those diseases so that's
the good news about an intervention back
in the 60s we were active in the Student
Health Organization medical community
for human rights and I could go on and
on about our work but I do this
introduction because our center was
founded by myself and Eric shivian who
came from the inter government inter
national physicians for prevention of
nuclear war I might take this off and
the IP P&amp;amp;W physicians for Social
Responsibility had the position that the
health consequences of nuclear war could
help turn public opinion policymaker
opinion and that played a strong role
they got the nobel peace prize for that
work to stop nuclear testing later with
the Montreal Protocol and ozone trouble
stratospheric ozone depleting chemicals
physicians also played a role dermatol
out dermatologists immunologists talked
about the health consequences so all
that is to oh my gosh
all that is to say that we've started
this Center at Harvard Medical School to
look at the health consequences of
global environmental change biodiversity
climate change as a way of communicating
the direct issues that have come to our
backyard it's not just about ice polar
bears it's also about our health and
since we are waiting our Center is
founded on three pillars we do education
primarily for medical students where we
draw from the School of Public Health
and Harvard Divinity School Business
School Kennedy's government school Tufts
fletcher school journalism students and
that is on the web broadcast free as you
do things to 65 medical schools and some
overseas we also do education for
policymakers in DC we do a two day
course for legislative aides and give
them a condensed view of this course and
we have two briefings on climate and
health and agriculture climate and
health and marine systems finally we do
research on climate change and
biodiversity and we've done a number of
experiments with folks at Harvard and so
I won't go on about that but that's our
center and we're celebrating our 10th
year this year we have a global
environmental citizens award and last
year was Al Gore got our ward from Meryl
Streep so that's our claim to fame okay
I'm going to talk about something in
three parts and I'm going to try to talk
pretty fast so we can have a discussion
climate basics climate and health and
then talk about solutions and how we can
think about health in terms of which
energy solutions we need to adopt back
in 1991 there was an outbreak of cholera
in Peru so those are algal blooms
Galapagos are about 500
lammeter's off turned out that warm sea
surface temperatures and extreme events
which flush a lot of nutrients into the
environment helped create these algal
blooms they were nidus for cholera that
was the work of Rita kawa who later went
on to run the National Science
Foundation and so that cholera came in
three different places and those
connections between climate environment
and disease began to be made we went to
the rio summit 1992 I was telling Larry
we presented this people said what are
you doing here physicians medical people
this has nothing to do with the
environment well no one got this no
journal published it except one general
there was the Wall Street Journal shrimp
exports tourism and so this is a theme
that carries me through this work that
leads to our report which I will tell
you about the moment of Health
ecological and economic dimensions of
climate change and indeed this is a way
of looking at the results the court the
downstream consequences of the upstream
conditions and causes and the downstream
costs that can help think about
development as well as health and
climate and how energy is key to all of
those okay this much we know is true the
IPCC the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change third assessment report
was five years ago climate is changing
humans are contributing biological
systems are responding on all continents
and in the oceans and weather is
becoming more extreme so that's five
years ago since 2001 we've learned a
great deal more carbon I don't know if I
have a pointer here but that's all right
carbon dioxide is now up to 380 parts
per million in the atmosphere oh great
this is it thank you what this is is an
ice core record that was back to 420,000
now it's back to 750
probably 2 million years ago when the
Panama isthmus clothes off the Gulf
Stream started we started oscillating
between large ice caps and medium-sized
ice caps between 280 and 180 reversed
that 180 was the Ice Age the large ice
cap we are now outside that envelope
that we've been in probably for two
million perhaps back to the dinosaurs
and fifty sixty five million we are
pushing the envelope as it were on the
feedback mechanisms the ocean sink the
lansing that has helped stabilize
climate for two million years clearly
for the last 10,000 years that's our
whole scene that's been so hospitable so
hold on to the Holocene is our cry hold
on to your hats we are pushing this and
this is weirdly where we were and I must
say this cycle of earth around the Sun
and its tilts and its wobbles and
eccentricities is what has driven these
cycles the latest calculations are that
we were about to come we were not about
to come out of this policy neni time
soon so we really are changing what was
the trajectory Pollard mountain glacial
ice is melted accelerating ocean
temperatures are changing and winds
around both poles becoming more forceful
like that's probably the scariest thing
I'm going to say what's happening with
the ice this is a a slide which shows
you the difference in the type within
the melt during summer over this ten
years what we're now seeing is an
acceleration some of these outlet
glaciers are melting at 14 kilometers a
year eight and nine miles a year five
years ago they were going at seven miles
seven kilometers in here we're seeing
now melt of Greenland ice three times
what it was between the 1997 and 2003
period it's 250 cubic kilometers it was
80 so we're seeing rates of change
change is the derivatives this tells us
something about systems and so just to
look at systems for a moment this is the
kind of issues that now the IPCC and
scientists are dealing with it's not
just numbers of 380 parts per million or
450 or 550 we're talking about rates of
change volatility novel events anomalies
and changes in multiple components
because it's really the bathysphere the
cryosphere that's the ice it's the
biosphere the atmosphere of the
stratosphere that we are playing with
here and that means that if we all SAT
around this table and pushed it's more
apt to go over so we're looking at how
we look at change change can be abrupt
it could be stepwise we look at also in
this report this climate change futures
report that we did with Swiss
reinsurance company and the UN
Development Program look at impacts and
how they can change abruptly and this
here this is perhaps the main
contribution of this kind of thinking
about forests about our health about
marine life okay couple more on this
climate stuff this is the pictorial of
what's happening for the tropical oceans
are becoming warmer and saltier because
warm water evaporates and up north
because of all that melting and rain
falling and high latitudes we're seeing
cooling and freshening now there's a
pump up there when it's cold and salty
as it's been it sinks and that pulley
system pulls up the Gulf Stream and that
sets in motion this conveyor belt that
has helped stabilize climate for this
10,000 years and forth during these
periods of change we see a change in
that conveyor belt what's happening now
is that because of that freshening it's
layering across and we're seeing a
slowing down of that pump that circle
that you see is a gulf stream coming up
and going around it's the same as the
tray
wind brought ramen this way and slaves
this way and the whole triangular trade
from our 12th grade that was driven by
the trade winds that drives the oceans
we're seeing a thirty percent decrease
that's the kind of projections that were
made for 2100 we're seeing storms like
Katrina that are the kind of storms we
were projecting for about twenty eighty
we are seeing changes that we projected
later on in the century happen today and
thank goodness they we had a very nice
calm season and we in the public are
sang giving out a sigh of relief as are
the insurance company companies here's
what happened about 12,000 years ago
there was so much warming and melting
that the Gulf Stream shot straight
across to Europe the ice returned for
about thirteen hundred years that's the
day after tomorrow scenario it's the
Pentagon scenario it's the National
Academy of Sciences abrupt climate
change inevitable surprises all which
led to those that movie and that
scenario can this happen well it 10 and
I guess the most positive scenario I
want to remember to give you is that
maybe this will shut down but was have
so much warming that we're not headed
towards an ice age so that's my company
word for you okay all right what does
this mean for bottom lines and we're
going to come to health in a moment for
the financial world we see a change in
the catastrophic weather events and
these are primarily those there this is
from the IPCC and I it's in small
letters but mostly weather-related
events we saw a change of one order of
magnitude from the 80s to the 90s in the
last two years we've seen another
stepwise jump but a half a log this has
been enormous for the insurance world
they've seen this stepwise functions
again and indeed insured losses go up
about two hundred fold because of all
the storms in Europe the US and Japan so
we've seen a
actually in extremes from Mozambique
Honduras Venezuela and the 90s to now
more extremes occurring in the north
because of all of these changes in the
North Atlantic so we can tie this to
climate in a really plausible dynamic
way well all those losses due to climate
change whoa yes we're living there the
coast in the Gulf yes real estate prices
are up yes insurance penetration is up
and and and that's the key word there
are more extreme events more different
kinds of extreme events so it's not an
either/or issue climate change is
playing a role as there are economic
vulnerabilities as well let's look at
Katrina Rita Wilma this whole episode
for a moment the lake was having waves
come across it there were much higher
than the levees as we look to rebuild
these levees we're in a quandary because
these this is the power of the storm was
greater than the levees those coming off
the Gulf were much higher than the oil
rigs and knocked a lot of the oil rigs
it's still twenty five percent down in
terms of oil and gas and the Gulf think
vulnerability of the energy sector
between the refineries the pipelines and
the oil rigs they're still down life and
health property and casualty forgive me
this is insurance speak but these are
the folks that I'm working with now to
talk about the implications of all this
but we're seeing a new disease of
current Katrina cough you've seen people
with masks toxins oil oil spilled the
size of the Exxon Valdez 11 million
gallons we're not even thinking about
this but it's in the wetlands it's a
Miss and mold floods Foster fungi one of
our mantras food security was affected
circuitous Lee it was sent from Southern
Africa to Asia but it got hung up on the
barges in Mississippi energy prices and
political instability and I'm not a
betting man but I would bet that the
price at the gas stations will go up in
about a month
to get my drift we're seeing changes in
we've seen changes in for many countries
and just as in the 70s when oil went
from three dollars I don't know if you
did get my drift but there was I think
there were there's been manipulation of
the oil prices that has been in the new
york times editorial i'll quote and
whether that will change after the
elections we don't know but it's
possibility i don't want to give any
hidden messages it's all out transparent
so in the 70s the oil crisis three
dollars the thirty dollars it went in
several years gold went from $38 the 600
that probably bought apartheid regime
about 15 years longer than it would have
had because of the price of gold and
they were such a source of gold well it
destabilized many countries and there's
a wonderful movie life and debt if you
haven't seen it i recommend that talks
about that period and the debt that
began in the 70s led to the petrol
dollars and the investments and then
inflation in the 80s and speculation
specula in the 90s it all started with
that loosening of Bretton Woods rules
and we can we'll come back to that in a
moment but the price of oil had a lot to
do with the instability and failed and
fragile nations that are faithful face
today affected our image and it
certainly will affect our attorney our
politics if not this election next
election but clearly Energy and Climate
are key to our development and our
healthy development this is one number
that I want to leave with you in this
talk is 22 this is work about the heat
in the oceans as compared to the
atmosphere done by folks at your
department of commerce toodle evidence
at all NOAA national oceanic and
atmospheric administration tim barnett
out here at la jolla and scripts what
they found was that the heat in the
atmosphere is dwarfed by
heat that's accumulated in the deep
ocean this is central for this
understanding of the changes of the heat
budget on this globe water is warming
ice is melting water vapor is rising a
hydrological water cycle is accelerating
it is affecting land areas in terms of
greater evaporation and more intense
droughts it's also getting more water
vapor hanging up there and what it does
cool and condense it comes down and
dumps downpours which is lovely in st.
John in the afternoon but not so good in
California and it's also what
contributes the more precipitation
falling during the winter as rain and
snow because of the warm winters and you
are well aware of the issues of snowpack
ins in in your Mountain closed mountains
here so this is what's key it's the
jewels the heat in the deep ocean that
is driving the changes in weather and
this is what's central to understanding
the dynamics behind the storms the
droughts heavy rains that's its so on
okay health issues and please throw your
hand up at any point if there's
something that you need clarification on
them malaria is clearly one of the key
health issues and I don't need to
belabor this but we've looked at the
economic dimensions as well as the human
costs and so on and clearly needs
interventions in terms of defense public
health as well as how we look upstream
this is what Larry alluded to what we're
seeing is a change in the mountains in
Africa and Asia and Latin America where
glaciers are receding plants are
migrating up we're seeing that in the
Alps as well we're seeing in the Sierra
Nevadas here and mosquitoes are
circulating at high altitude so Nairobi
which is a mile-high city now has
malaria circulating in it and we're
seeing this in Colombia with a DSO
jipped I we're seeing it in Papua New
Guinea we're seeing it in Nepal and this
shows is consistent picture of this
change in the isotherm in part
frost that we're also seeing in terms of
latitude these are some projections with
Lyme disease now Lyme disease is a
complex disease that you don't have in
this Coast because of ass of a a lizard
that has an antidote to it as it were so
there's biological diversity issues
there are deer and lots of mice and few
predators dear so there are ecological
issues there are social issues we're
living in suburbs and sprawl warming is
also it changing the latitude at which
this these ticks can circulate so
there's the projections with a computer
of what can happen over to over this
century in terms of the expansion of the
area conducive to circulation of line
and this is an issue in Europe it's an
issue in the Midwest and we've seen this
year you I don't know here but we are
full of squirrels and full of acorns
it's a mast year it's driven by climate
signals at any rate this is a big year
for tix so there are a number of reasons
but warming allows the overwintering of
these tanks asthma is an issue that in
medical school we learned was
socio-economic perhaps some allergies
indoor pollutants there's a whole range
of issues of air quality issues under
the radar that are all related to fossil
fuel combustion but you just look at
that for a moment I'm not going to go
through all these issues in detail ozone
you're well aware of study in LA showing
that that can start initiate asthma not
just make it worse floods and fungi I
mentioned in the Gulf Coast and so on
diesel part what I want to call your
attention to is this tree and weed
pollen we did experiments in greenhouses
with ragweed double the co2 so this is
forget climate change from mobile
warming all those conclusions just co2
there have been a number of skeptics
that have said that will green the
planet it's going to help agriculture
help for us take it up
well what we hadn't foreseen is that the
weeds love this stuff this is a
perturbation stress for them and they
like to put this carbon dioxide into
their pollen which is their male part
territorial seeking part spread their
wings this is happening with poison ivy
poison ivy is getting a boost from
carbon dioxide and getting more toxic so
if you've noticed poison ivy can blame
it on climate and carbon dioxide and
burning fossil fuels we're seeing this
with agricultural weeds were seen with
some soil fungi and this of course is a
major source of illness it's the sixth
leading cause of chronic disease in the
u.s. there's a co2 dome under the cities
that mirrors the heat island effect and
I put this up here because it also
begins to look at solutions so seven
degrees greater co2 gets trapped in
Phoenix in LA for sure or New York and
so there are issues of abandoned watts
and ragweed etc but this also points
toward solutions of green buildings
rooftop gardens tree-lined streets
pedestrian bicycle paths Smart Growth
all of these issues are good for our
health in the inner city in terms of
diesel and so on that actually helps
deliver these arrow allergens of their
Synergy's but it also begins to drive
the markets for these energy efficient
and alternative energy technologies dust
storms from Africa and I'm winding down
on health issues here but stuff storms
the size of the US are coming across
each year they deliver dust they deliver
some fungi to the fan Coral kids in the
Caribbean kids in Florida are getting
asthma at rates of 25% they used to be
one less than one on some of these
islands global change over grazing
drought in Africa some of which is
climate related there's really been a
drought in sub-saharan Africa
since nineteen sixty-five these are
enormous vast changes that also affect
us from China was in the scum fee or
Coast and affect air quality in
California and in Denver I don't know if
it's making it over the Rockies okay one
of the issues is heat waves clearly this
2003 was a major outlier six standard
deviations from the norm lots of deaths
lots of issues for the environment for
crops for livestock nuclear plant
shutdowns and we'll come back to that as
we come to solutions alpine glaciers
lost ten percent they've been losing
about point seven so this is not just an
event that's a blip on someone's chart
it's something that lives on in the
history of the lakes and the water and
for Switzerland wildfires is clearly
something we're seeing here today so I
guess we talked about this but clearly
arson is this park but we're seeing more
wildfires more areas that are fire-prone
because of warming because of low
snowpack and so on one of the hidden
issues is that the BOK people said you
have them right here this is mentioned
in the New York Times piece about this
the other day and before I forget New
York Times today as a major article by
Andy revkin about all the solutions that
out will come tell but here we are back
with the bark beetles and as we think
about health we're thinking about the
health of wildlife livestock forests
agricultural systems marine life here's
a pest that's here's the agent here's
the host here's the environment if
you're familiar with that
epidemiological triangle the hosts are
getting emboldened they're going to
higher altitudes higher latitudes
overwintering sneaking in an extra
generation each year the hosts are
getting weaker by this alternating
drought and then heavy rains drought
dries the rasen in the bar that drowns
the Beatles as they try to drive through
the bog so the hosts are affected by the
extremes
the pest is affected by warming those
are the two parts of climate change
warming and more extremes and here we
are with fires with injury respiratory
disease etc and a carbon pulse this is
the Kenai Peninsula so this is from
Arizona through California to Vancouver
to Alaska this is an issue and on the
East Coast we're facing wooly adelgid
it's affecting the hemlock trees that a
lovely trees with a moose breed and why
during the winter these are the
umbrellas and in the Midwest as an ash
tree tis we're seeing this in Europe
this is more and more an issue for our
habitat and assets as it were but right
now before we think about money just our
habitat that is also being affected and
I should say that this battle between
insects and trees is much older than the
battle between malaria and dengue fever
and us this is about 325 million years
when the trees started growing on the
earth the insects started rebounding the
trees started to defend themselves with
chemicals like cyanide and bark and then
birds came along that was the
carboniferous period where all the
fossil fuels buried because of the dying
of the trees in the battle with the
insects that was fortunately one by the
trees but what I'm hinting at here is
that this battle may be more crucial for
our livelihood our public health and
underlie our oxygen and watersheds this
is something al gore seized upon him and
when he came to visit us and looked at
this destabilization of the battle
between insects and plants
microorganisms and us and so on that
climate change is contributing to okay
to end this part about health with the
next couple extreme weather events this
is just a mapping exercise we did with
extremes and floods and droughts where
hand the virus dengue fever malaria this
was in science and 99 and I'll make
although this will be all on the web
if we look at oil and its lifecycle
costs we look at refining extraction
exploration and transport and clearly
there are developing nation
vulnerabilities but as we saw this no
nation is immune and this isn't just
from Mozambique the floods in night in
2000 where malaria spiked fivefold so
again streams may be more crucial than
the warming itself and for us
variability freeze-thaw cycles well
that's important in terms of migration
of birds that carry avian flu and we
want to we can talk about that but
allergies we saw last January and DC and
New York people who start a veggie is
around january and maple syrup was
falling so food security Lester Brown is
concerned about these mismatches of
pollinators and so on and so finally
these are two slides to summarize this
climate change future study with Swiss
reinsurance that ensures the insurers
and the undp looking across some of the
costs again asthma four-fold increase in
the US since 1980 and many developing
and underdeveloped nations then we step
to the other side and looked at the
streams the floods and the droughts and
how they might lead the clustering of
rodin bought water boy and insect-borne
disease and then here was the central
part that linked us to industry because
we looked at these diseases pests and
diseases of these natural systems and I
won't belabor all of this and this is on
the web but just call your attention to
coral reefs 800 billion dollars is what
the estimate is per year of the goods
and services we're talking livelihoods
fisheries hotels that are buffered on
tourism and so on twenty-six percent are
lost because of warming bleaching and
disease over harvesting and nutrients is
a multi causality but warming is clearly
what could knock this off and this is
the kind of abrupt
impacts to forest the marine life that
actually contributed to the stern review
if you look in any paper today I think
you'll see a report of the stern review
which advising Tony Blair and we briefed
them they look they're looking at the
costs of inaction they estimated could
be up to twenty percent of the global
economy as opposed to one percent if we
tackle its clean energy transition and
they were looking again at the potential
for Brooke changes in impacts okay this
is the last the energy sector just to
say that that is also vulnerable we
mentioned the Gulf there's also
blackouts and heat waves cooling water
they want to drill an N waar the in
Alaska well the pipelines are really
fragile they're getting undermined by
the melting that's affecting communities
and livelihoods and alcoholism all the
rest of the stuff that's in the the
Arctic climate impact assessment and
I've mentioned to you lightning and
warming we learn from the Hartford
boiler inspection and insurance company
that warming actually makes more
lightning so wild fires again and then
there of course feedbacks this is a
major one in terms of firewood being
used for the energy for indoor cooking
and health all the health issues related
to that and the deforestation and carbon
sink and now in Peru they're planning
for some Luke leisure some new
coal-fired plants because they're losing
their glaciers and hydropower all right
lots of but lots of bad news my friend
Richard clap oh I know Fitz knows has
subtitles talk it's it's worse than you
think so let me go to some solutions
here and I do believe there's a
confluence of forces that are going to
lead us to deal with this and a
convergence of adventure agendas climate
instability we've talked about peak oil
is the other thing that you're hearing
about it may not have peaked but it will
pick this is finite it's finite resource
and limits to growth may have been three
years ahead of its time in the 60s or 40
but there are limits to these finite
resources energy sector vulnerability
environment we talked about we could
talk about the Nigerian Delta and all of
the issues of the environment here all
these conflicts that one could tie to
oil and I must remind us that even our
president has said we're addicted to oil
so i like to say that's the first of a
12-step program all right these are the
levels of response and for Public Health
we look at defense and bed nets and
treatment and malaria treatment with
medicines and and so on these are the
digital Public Health defensive we also
look in public health it how we can add
app have adaptation whether they're
early warning systems using El Nino
forecasting or climate so on how
deforestation makes you more vulnerable
to floods and so on and then we look
upstream the real upstream we can look
at the energy system as one of the key
first not sufficient but necessary steps
towards clean development and
sustainable development here's one of
the ways that we're thinking about
solutions is this wedges effect this is
work of bakkalon Sokolow and actually
Andy rivkin's piece today talks about
this how do we bend the curve of the
carbon emissions by 2050 how do we not
produce another billion of Gigaton as a
billion tons how do we get seven billion
tons less to stabilize the
concentrations so we have to we actually
have to stabilize the admissions to wait
to stabilize the concentrations but this
is a first pass at seven kinds of
solutions all right here's the 15 that
are put forward in this science piece by
these prints and folks and I'm just
going to put this up here and give you a
sense of how we in public health and
ecology and economics might begin to
think about this and this is something
that I take into
Citigroup asset management and Moody's
and Standard &amp;amp; Poor's and talk about
where do you put your money now and
that's true for Google as well how do we
think about the health dimensions of
solutions so here we are is a rating
system and I'm putting this up in a
group cafe standards doubling the 30 to
60 miles per gallon we could have
plug-in hybrids you're all moving
towards that here faster than anybody
demand side management and how we look
at efficiency work we use twice as much
energy as Japan and Europe for all we
knew Green Building so on when well
citing is an issue how we do that that
you're very aware of PV well that's
clearly it's all solar ultimately that's
where all the energy comes that's
clearly so the thermal sold so on forest
management that won't say but nurturing
conservation tillage well we already got
seven here if we move the head we begin
to really approach this model then we've
got a whole bunch that a fossil
fuel-based carbon capture hydrogen fuel
cells we've got to study these we can
put a lot of the lot into the ones with
no regret but we need a lot of R&amp;amp;D for
the others and then nuclear fission I'm
just going to put a 3 s's on oh good go
ahead I collect good life cycle analysis
so just as for oil exploration
extraction refining transport and then
combustion all of which lead to problems
for public health and the environment
for nuclear this is very apropos we can
look at the life cycle from the mining
and the dangers there from the transport
and that's what the Germans are on the
road trying to protest and so on and
then you come to milling and then you
come to the plants and the use and then
you come to the storage and the storage
you all know Yucca Mountain we've been
studying it for years 60 billion dollars
we haven't solved it
in order to make one wedge from nuclear
we would need a new Yucca Mountain every
three and a half years we haven't solved
one the French haven't solved the Swedes
think they might have found a clay place
to tuck their stuff this is I actually
talked before the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission a week ago and until we slide
they were all with me and then it was
like who left this person I got it was
like a booty butt so 3 s's storage
safety and security is clearly a big
issue in England anyway we have multiple
problems that I was going to mention sea
level rise because all the nuclear
plants are on the coast there and the
insurance world is worried about that at
any rate I think that these are issues
that we're all going to have on the
table but I just came from the SR I this
socially responsible investment group in
the Rockies there too there's people are
questioning whether we should do nuclear
I think for my health perspective
environmental perspective we have to
take a strong position that this is
something we should we should not
replace carbon salute carbon pollution
with radiation pollution I'm not I'm not
including it just because it's yeah I
mean it and this is from the paper by
pakala sokolow the 15 wedges and how
much land that would take for biofuels
and they look at and they don't have
fusion I don't know right
fusion we can talk about it in a glass
Fleischmann and pons I don't know if
it's if we can create the Sun in the
glass where it's not really that hot I
don't know what what that'll start so
anyway that's my physics background
thinking about that so green buildings
just for a moment part of the solution
clearly many health benefits many
economic benefits worker satisfaction
you have lovely light here and lovely
building I'd like to learn more about
what you do here kids do better in
school zante with tests people's buy
more in stores with sunlight that should
move the wall street and patients do
better when there's better ventilation
and so on for developing countries and
this is the penultimate slide the vert
we can think about all of these
distributed local development issues
that need energy and solar and wind and
then you could hook a wire around there
and get a bicycle and using when the Sun
doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow
get folks to ride around on a bicycle or
run around or horses there are ways of
having distributed generation with clean
energy this can on port a purify water
it can cook it can drive small
development this is something that
groups like eco and co and so on that I
just saw it the SR there are groups that
are pushing this because clearly this is
an issue for poverty for clean
environment for energy this is a
precursor so finally I believe that we
need to think about the policy issues as
well and this is what Amy and I were
talking about and businesses are
beginning to think about this wall
street's beginning to think about what
are the you naveen enabling financial
instruments policy instruments and
framework so just to put out a potential
way of thinking about a framework here's
the carrots here's the sticks incentives
want to lead with those we need
to line our rewards and regulation
systems from our own walking and biking
to our what we do in our communities in
our churches synagogues and where we
work and so on with what companies do
what the government does we need a new
energy plan that deals with all of the
issues of transport and housing and
utilities this can be the engine of
growth for this 21st century this can be
jobs put people to work with the right
international framework and funds it can
be a spark for development with removal
of the perverse incentives and
disincentives so we're talking about
rules here and that I want to emphasize
that word lead with the carrot get the
horse moving this clean energy
transition and change transformation can
be good for public health it can be good
for security it can be good for the
economy and we certainly hope it will
stabilize the climate these are our
websites and I thank you very much
thank you Paul I think you've
crystallized a lot of the thinking that
we've been doing here at Google and
Google org are there any other questions
we've got about time for two yes
Matt can I ask you to say that again so
NSA can hear you at the start of your
talk you mentioned that the
strengthening of the polar winds was the
one of the most disturbing things to you
can you please briefly explain why
that's so disturbing well it's a good
question because gradients is really
what we're talking about again back to
the systems thinking and if we're
getting cooler up there and warmer down
around the tropics we're changing the
winds winds float and hot air rises and
creates a low system and weather flows
downhill as it were from high pressure
systems the low pressure system so as it
cools around the poles because of this
melting we're getting changes in the
gradients it's changing the winds that's
changing the weather so pressure
temperature pressure win whether tpw is
basic physics and we're seeing
windstorms go deep into Europe they had
three and 99 Lothar and so on they had
one last January that knocked the years
worth of forestry out of Sweden we're
seeing deeper penetration of some of the
winds as these polar temperatures and
pressure gradients change wind is
concerning when does that element that
calls you warms your it's your friends
it's your enemy and it drives trade and
so on so if we're changing winds that's
pote that's disturbing and what I do
want to remind myself to say systems
like stabilization they like
equilibriums so I do believe that we can
go towards a new equilibrium well we've
got to back off the pressure we're
putting on this system some sixty to
seventy percent terms of greenhouse
gases to stabilize the concentrations
that was the comment that I was to make
because in not engulfs in our girls feel
and in your lecture tours emphasis on
the nonlinear aspect of climate change
and you know I think people have this
feeling that yes we will start to do
something and then things will start
reversing fast as they did with the
ozone hole where we see some signs of
improvement now that after the Montreal
protocols but I think and what I've been
taught that's cool like the climate
system is much more complex than that
and you don't like the warming of the
ocean may actually be a barrier to going
back into this stable state we had pre
co2 level pre height to co2 levels so I
would encourage you like everybody
speaks on that to to really emphasize
that point I mean if we start doing
something now that's not gonna change
anything because like these systems may
settle into an equilibrium state and
then stay there for a longer time
absolutely agree with you and I that's
fundamentally had large ice caps medium
sized ice caps we're headed towards
small ice caps I did want to present
this in a positive light then that there
is a potential that we could stabilize
at another state that gives us a
chilling off period as it were so go
ahead quickly with this clean energy
transition I it's possible we've headed
towards that no one understands what the
heck happened this year with no
hurricanes it may have to do with some
of this ocean circulation melting and
cooling off and convection and varying
some of the heat my question belts on
that general point um given that nyx
turns report has also confirmed the fact
that we need to act now and not later in
terms of economic costs how do you think
we can incentivize governments to put
the incentives you alluded to in place
given that sometimes political
motivations conflict with those goals
good that's a good good huge question
and what is the framework for
sustainable development that we
all cherish there are three things that
are in the way so we've really gotta
before we think about all the incentives
we got to think about all the incentives
that are leading people to take down
their forests to send for timber or
clearly grow cows for hamburger for
McDonald's etc so the debt is key the
debt that we got into from the 70s based
on oil in large part is driving much of
this fragility in terms of states and
failed Nations there are perverse
subsidies for oil and coal that are
clearly larger and we are wars and so on
are I think about a trillion dollars is
what Tom Friedman and the times
estimated was what we're spending on a
rack already so what we do 24 wars as
well as oil lines so there's a whole
four verse subsidy issue that's driving
this and then the fundamental one is the
terms of trade something we don't talk
about a lot of what the Rwandan czar
getting for their coffee is what they
got in 62 what they pay for for a
hamburger or a tractor is what you and I
pay we've got to equalize the terms of
trade to get so it's not just fair trade
now it's real doing the rules and the
agreements of trade is to make it fair
so those are three obstacles and then
we've got to provide large funds that
are global funds for adaptation and
mitigation and here clean energy i want
to emphasize is an adaptive measure
because it's distributive it prevents
the text when there are storms and
blackouts and heat waves and so on so
it's part of adaptation that isn't
usually talked about and mitigation and
then we need to provide some
institutional framework for this so we
need those three sir we need the carrots
the funds we need new rules and
regulations of rewards and we need some
new institutions beyond the Bretton
Woods ones which is the last time we
came together in 44
Keane's got the brilliant idea we didn't
need a change thing if you figured out
we didn't need to figure it all out we
needed just change the rules change the
financial signals and it was fixed chain
fixes it was liberal trade in goods but
fixed exchange in capital you can't just
move it from sold Thailand and I know we
have to stop and finally the extent the
fixed exchange rates at thirty-eight
dollars that was all abandoned 72 so
anyway we've got to come back to new
rules new incentives and new kind of
institutional framework to move this and
I think you're in a wonderful position
to think about the new technologies and
to think about these framework and
policies and how businesses and
environmental justice groups and so on
can all get behind something that can
provide jobs and development as well as
a healthy future before we thank Paul
when Amy and Kirsten to stand up just so
you see them if you have any follow-up
questions on the environment please
speak with them on climate change I
don't think rachel is here so maybe
katie if you'll raise your hand if
anybody wants to follow up on issues of
economic development you should know
that the most recent g8 round of debt
forgiveness provided less than one-third
to the developing countries whose debt
was forgiving than the negative impact
of the increase in oil prices so in
other words it cost them three times
more for extra oil then they got back
for all the debt repayment that we saw
heard so much about so if we needed any
other indication of how interconnected
all this is Paul thank you very much for
coming to Google I think we'd all like
to thank him for coming we hope you come
back again
