attention
so today we have get guests Karen
Appleton and Andrew Martinez fonts from
prosper calm to talk about the prosper
lending market place and i will ask this
tape this is being videotaped so please
keep any google confidential questions
um to yourself until after the
videotaping consists hi everybody how's
everybody doing today good excellent um
has anybody heard of prosper yet Oh
excellent okay that's fantastic I'm so
glad to hear that okay so then you you
know kind of the the basics we can spend
some time on the on the more fun stuff
but I'll kind of go through the
presentation please feel free to ask
questions and you know as we go along
although if we get you know kind of a
whole lot we can save them till the end
but feel free if you have a you know
clarifying point you'd like to make in
the beginning we can go for that prosper
as you know is is an online marketplace
it's like an ebay for money bringing
together people who want to borrow money
with people who have money to lend in a
safe and trusted marketplace we handle
the administration and all the
processing including payments
collections verification and validation
of individuals and do all the credit and
anti-fraud checks it's a positively
disruptive technology and it's disinter
mediating the banks so it's pretty fun
pretty fun marketplace prosser brings a
sense of community to lending by
leveraging the power of groups to
improve borrow repayment under the key
premise that people act more responsibly
when their actions have group
consequences the benefit is higher than
average repayment of loans due to lower
defaults and better return on investment
for lenders prosper represents the first
time that people can participate
directly in the lucrative lending
markets and empowers individuals who are
looking for alternatives and personal
finance can earn higher returns and in
money markets and CDs and create a
highly diversified portfolio so and
there's also the benefit of this great
lender community that has emerged that's
really enrich 'as the whole process
the just a touch kind of on the history
of the of the credit markets you know
through centuries and generations
there's been community based lending in
villages and towns between friends and
family and more recently the community
based lending model has has evolved into
credit unions and savings and loans and
in these models we see strong borrower
loyalty and low acquisition costs but
there's a very low lender
diversification today credit markets and
banks credit cards and banks are the key
sources of credit and while they
experience excellent diversification
there is little loyalty and very high
acquisition costs so in the prosper
community we see excellent lender
diversification due to the one-to-many
approach the cost that it takes a credit
card company to actually convert you to
be a client you get the mailings and the
the advertising and everything else
that's an acquisition cost so we see an
excellent lender diversification here
due to the one-to-many approach that
lenders take when bidding on loans low
default rates from borrowers due to the
strong sense of community that is
established and the low acquisition
costs because we're using groups as a
leverage point to drive borrowers to the
prosper site the loan listings when they
come onto the site they're catalogued
and it's it's a it's a pretty eBay like
approach to to listing items and we kind
of have the borrower's as the items or
the or the objects for sale or basically
the borrowers that are requesting credit
and they're shown in a summary format
and in addition it's a very searchable
database where you can look for a
variety of characteristics that you
might be specifically searching for and
you can look by credit grade and by
other characteristics and pull those
borrowers requests that most match the
strategy that you're going to put
together as a lender we show the the
scale of credit grade and corresponding
score when a borrower comes on to our
site we we take a lot of data from them
to verify
I'm validate that they are who they say
they are in addition we pull an
experienced 4x plus credit check which
we then assigned that score which is
much like a FICO score to a credit grade
which is how lenders can then evaluate
the borrowers who come to the site this
is an example of a borrower listing and
you know we have we've had every type of
listing so far that you can imagine
everything from breast enhancements to
breast reductions in plastic surgery and
credit consolidation and startup
businesses and this one is an example
for a documentary film State of the
Union you can see that we provide a lot
of summary data so that the lender can
make an evaluation this particular
borrower is looking for ten thousand
dollars and what he does when he comes
on yes do we met credit ratings to
default rates we we provide both data
points for you to evaluate so you'll see
that I believe in the next screen you'll
see what that how that appears so the
borrower will state the max interest
rate that they're willing to pay on the
loan so the borrower's coming in and
saying hey I'd like to borrow ten
thousand dollars and the max I'm willing
to pay for that is thirteen point seven
five percent in addition we show some of
the other core metrics there are times
listing so you can come on and you can
you can create listings that will go
from a range of three to ten days or you
can request an automatically funding
loan which means that as soon as it's
funded you're closed and you're good to
go on the right hand side where you see
the borrower information this is the
borrower's user ID on the site this
particular bar was a member of a group
and I'm going to talk about the group
again but the groups are what drive the
sense of community on the site and some
other key data points we've got the
credit grade this person is an a rated
score and if you looked on the last one
you can see an A has a FICO of 722 759
so you get a good sense of that person's
eat both ability-to-repay and desire to
repay because you can measure both from
the kind of the key metrics this
person's not been delinquent you can
kind of gauge this this person's
credibility by some of the metrics that
we provide in addition we allow the
borrower to state and is with as much or
as little details they'd like
the purpose of this loan so the lender
then has almost everything that they
would need to know about this particular
borrower to determine if this is an
investment that they would like to make
you can see a rate of thirteen point
seven five percent is a pretty darn good
return on your investment ok so you
we're kind of living on the spread that
the credit card companies have always
taken so you put your money in the bank
you're making two percent the banks are
lending it out to the credit card users
at you know 1929 something like that and
they've got that spread which is how
they fund the acquisition cost of
getting all their clients but we're kind
of taking that out of the equation the
spreads are now given back to both the
borrower and the lenders on return once
you decide that you want to make a bid
on a particular loan request there are
two ways to bid this is an example of a
manual bidding process and what we show
you is kind of that summary data again
what you're bidding on and then the bid
details you can bid in increments of
fifty dollars one thing that we strongly
recommend to all lenders is that you
create a very diversified portfolio it's
very rarely recommended unless it's
perhaps a friend a friend situation that
you bid large increments of money like
you would never come in and bid that
hold ten thousand dollars on that
documentary unless maybe you knew the
guy and you thought it was a great idea
but typically you'll come in and with in
increments of as little as fifty dollars
so that you create for yourself this
very broad-based diversified portfolio
of loans but we're showing you here the
Experian historical default rates so on
all the A's that we have in this this
massive Experian database and a is
likely to fall at point nine percent
what they had yes so the question is do
we show prospers default rates at the
moment we are we're creating a bet data
right now we've been live since februari
the 13th of this year so our data is not
yet as rich as the Experian data is but
as as we build our files and we develop
that information we will make it
published on our site we intend to have
a completely transparent site so you
will be able to know what were the
expiry
and default rates and what have the
prosper default rates bin so yes you'll
be able to see that all of our loans are
36 months terms mm-hmm fully amortized
no prepayment penalty okay so that's
just the one that's the one package we
have right now but over time of course
you'll see the expansion of the set of
products yes all of our loans are
currently unsecured okay so and then we
have we have a
twenty-five-thousand-dollar max so
basically all states are different we
currently operate operate under
individual state charters so so
currently we have to adhere to whatever
the state requirements are and typically
in general general terms there's a
minimum of a thousand dollars and a max
of 25,000 right now on the salons and
they're all unsecured yes the question
is are we do we intend to have an API
our API is set for launch at the end of
the summer can you be beta testers
that's up to andrew anderson bed i'll
take your business card at the a fine
either way okay so so again here at the
moment we have the experience oracle
default rates you can see there's a
point nine percent so as you bid you
want to keep that in mind because if
you've got this diversified portfolio
and for the sake of easy easy math if
you've got a hundred loans in your
portfolio and they're all kind of in the
same bucket as this you can expect to
have a point nine percent default rate
if you're making 1375 cross for charges
a half percent servicing fee and there's
a point nine percent chance of default
you can kind of get to the point of
understanding what your returns are
going to be and I I don't know whether
anybody's got a stock portfolio right
now it's returning at 13.75 but if you
do then you're doing the right thing and
if you don't you should be on prosper
yes
yeah yeah this is the the historical
default rate is based on two years of
experience data it's an annualized rate
but it's an annualized rate it's so
unbelievable yes
or any other this is the default rate
this is not the return the return you're
going to the amount at which you're
lending is thirteen point seven five
percent and the expected default on that
is point nine so you take the 13.75
minus the point nine minus the point
five servicing fake so you're left in
the neighborhood of 12 ish so your
return would be about twelve percent
well okay but it's over there their
two-year lunge it's it's you're right
that it's not an absolute sort of the
math is not perfect on comparison but
but it's it's fairly close because the
because of the amortization schedule the
loan if the loan defaults in the 34th
month you're losing a lot less than you
would in the middle of the second year
so
basically they're busy so I'm blending
right so your question has to do with
balance on the you know how do you how
do you balance the number of borrowers
on the site with the number of lenders
on the site well yeah that's that's what
our whole purpose is to sort of you know
build this marketplace and again you
know we draw a lot of comparisons to
ebay because they had the same same
situation is it is it the products that
drive the business or is it the buyers
that drive the business and you know in
our case of course the the borrowers are
the product and the lenders are the
buyers and we have to manage that
equation very very very carefully and
yes we are working on a lot of
initiatives and programs that seek to
balance that equation I don't think
either hard to get really it's been
surprising I think it's a matter of
keeping keeping everything kind of
moving forward at the same pace as
opposed to getting one or the other it's
a pacing issue lenders tell me borrow is
currently how many lenders and how many
borrowers we since we're a private
company we were only about six months
old we don't release data like that but
I can tell you that it's been it's been
imbalance so far but relatively speaking
i think as much as we can expect so far
and the growth has been incredible I'm
driven a lot right now by the press we
were just in Business Week last week as
the IT in the IT 100 and we've been in
the wall street journal three times
we've been you know in the Economist
smart money and many many TV shows
including ABC world news tonight and
that is driven a lot of the you know the
kind of the initial visits to the site
and then it's our responsibility to make
conversions
yes currently on the site we've got
anywhere from saying 900 to 1200
listings and since they fluctuate you
know they kind of are flowing in it out
at any given time some are closing and
rolling off others go unfunded in the
sense of a true marketplace we do not
sort of qualify the borrower's in terms
of you know what they're requesting and
whether or not it makes sense we allow
the marketplace to make that final
buying decision so you could have a
borrower who comes on the site and says
you know I'm a high-risk borrower and i
want you to lend me $25,000 a five
percent well the markets not going to
bid on that so that type of a loan will
just expire unfunded but we won't want
we don't want to step in and say hey you
know you might want to change this or
that or we just don't want to
micromanage the process we kind of want
let the marketplace drive the flow yes
what happens 11 for itself is it what
happens if prosper goes out of business
we have initiatives in place that people
would step in and take over the loans
these loans actually become assets to
you so at the it you you actually
technically are not a lender on the site
we technically are the lenders what
happens is in the you know the
regulatory environment requires that we
when the when that loan closes and
originates we technically owned it for a
nanosecond before we then rida vided and
technically resell it to you it becomes
an asset to you so it's yours and it
would it would then be just a matter of
servicing it if something should happen
to ask but we're not going anywhere yes
prospectus people who are equal here in
person I and muscle member at least we
didn't I information about the
world after their weapons some crazy
cases thought I've got a good super the
guy doesn't get the 90 and its lair
early and engine room so in fact you I
suppose not disclose days and they are
legally applied to the to try to get
nine yourselves right so so are you
trying to disclose more information
having a writing person
well I think that you've got lots of
questions within that that that question
I think you're asking a question about
safety trust and and verification and
our responsibility to sort of validate
whether or the information that a person
puts in their listing is actually true
or not and how we will then provide that
information to the lender to make as
sounded decision as they can write is
that about that's about kind of the gist
of it those three points okay so with
respect to providing more information
yes we are going to we're continuously
sort of driving through what is the
right balance of information to both
protect the borrower's privacy and allow
the borrower to reveal as much as they
would like to reveal but also to be
certain that we are giving as much data
to the lender as possible so that they
can make a sound decision themselves so
yes we're currently kind of taking a
look at the next generation as you
remember maybe it's been two months now
that we released the key metrics those
those six data points under the credit
information and that was really key cuz
that then gave the blend or the ability
to see what you know what was delinquent
has this person been doing before
because you know that's going to be a
big driver if they're late every single
time well what's the possibility they're
going to be late again it's probably
much higher whereas you know this guy's
never never had a delinquency well
that's a pretty good bet that he's going
to be a solid repair right so so some of
that information is going to be revealed
and we're you know just just kind of
stay tuned for some of that we're
balancing that now in in respect to
contacting borrowers who don't pay
through the site you can technically do
it we don't recommend it we don't
recommend that you get in touch we've
got state-of-the-art technology in place
we do in-house sort of follow through on
our end if someone's late on a payment
and then we've got three of the best
credit agencies out there who operate
just like a credit card company does to
go out and we say let the professionals
collect the money oh hang on so we had
two other points or did you want to
touch on anything else well i think that
i think the overarching answered here
sure
I think the overarching answer to your
question is that is we approach the
marketplace in the sense that we want to
give the left we are truly a marketplace
we want to give lenders the ability to
see as much information as they need to
make an informed decision while still
protecting the borrower's privacy so we
don't want a situation where lenders are
knocking on the doors of people who owe
their $25 right because they've gotten
halfway through a loan and and they're
still at $25 at the same time we
recognize that it's important that we
provide lenders with enough data such as
credit information information that for
example this guy has had four recent
listing so you could look at those past
listings and if you represented himself
as a woman or talked about his surgery
and on this one he doesn't mention it at
all that can be part of your vetting of
this borrower so so that's going to be
overall approach that we have is we've
got on this data let's just present it
in a way that makes sense let people
search on that and make their lending
decisions based on that data across
questions I use this tamala first five
possible 12 blocks so let's say I have
200 loads outstanding and your company
was that business do I didn't have to do
the neighbor work on 200
no will will consolidate and aggregate
that for you you won't have to you won't
have to manage two hundred dollars we
haven't we have an arrangement with a
loan servicing company and so we would
basically transfer servicing of all
those loans to that loan servicing
company for the loans are still held in
your name so effectively you own that
yes prepayments are allowed the
questions are prepayments allowed yes
they are recovery rates I don't have
data on recovery rates at the moment
we're you know we're kind of just moving
moving to that stage of the game I'll be
able to release that and that'll be on
the site when it's available
any up ways cell
intuition
mortgage place how that's good
well okay so the question is how do we
create how do we continue to make the
market more and more efficient one is
API certainly that's going to help a lot
the second you're referring to is a
secondary market for loans and that's
coming as well we expect that to be
available q1 of 07 where we'll be able
to take packages of loans and auction
them just like we do with the individual
borrower requests so those are it'll be
like a bond market it is well this is I
mean it's like another app this is a new
asset class it's it's you know it's
consumer bonds it's investing in people
you should also mention a standing
orders because that's effectively at
automated yeah let me let me go let me
go back to the presentation for a minute
because I think that when I when I
mentioned to you that the process that I
just showed you was how you make a
manual bid and this is what it looks
like when you have have made a manual
bid you can bid of increments of minimum
fifty dollars again up to the up to the
top of the loan if you'd like and you're
making a bid at the rate that the lowest
rate that you're willing to accept so
you may bid while it should make up on
the screen is as eighteen percent you
may actually have been 15 but you'll
hang in there until that auction process
kicks in when alone is fully funded this
is what it looks like so you can see as
you as you take a look at the to the far
left the bidders there are lots and lots
and lots of bitters at varying amounts
at the rates that they're going to
currently be available at and then the
amount that they bid on an individual
basis the red X is at the bottom of the
folks that have been outbid and then the
checkmark means that you're still
currently in it here's the way to make a
custom portfolio this is an automated
process for bidding so you can either go
into make a manual bid some folks
absolutely love that because they've got
the ability to read through and they
love the human contact that that process
gives them in a custom portfolio or a
standing order you've got the ability to
state the exact criteria that you want
to match and then we will automatically
go out through the borrower database and
find those requests that match exactly
to your payment and you can set almost
any type of criteria that you want for
example you could bid specifically on
certain groups that you like so there
might be a group of schoolteachers that
you think are a perfectly good
investment in you might select to have
funds diverted
any loans filled in groups like that you
might say I only want to bid on loans
that are currently 75 percent or more
funded you can set various minimum
credit grades that you'll accept a
minimum rates that you're willing to
accept within those credit grades and
then we will you know flush that out
into the overall database and match you
up with those requests so I have I've
touched on groups and I think that
groups are really important to note we
believe that you know the groups are
kind of at the foundation of the prosper
marketplace groups can be any any
selected group of people who share a
common interest it can be a large group
they can be huge we've got a group
that's well over a thousand right now
we've got other groups that are five or
six and they they come together based on
whatever their common interests may be
may be investing or boating or maybe an
ethnic background or it may be just a
core belief they don't have to know each
other but they have to share a common
belief or value system and borrowers
join specific groups to boost their
reputation so groups are joined together
so that there's a sense of community
around the borrowers in those groups
borrowers join certain groups to boost
their reputation and two overall achieve
lower interest rates from those lenders
so individual lenders do exist you do
not have to be part of a group to borrow
on prosper but we recommend to those
borrowers that they join a group so that
they have the benefit of the community
and the sense of reputation the group
leader has a responsibility as well the
group leader can accept or reject
members into the group and they also are
notified if a borrower is delinquent on
a loan so that they can kind of touch
bases with them and say hey you know is
everything okay is there anything I
could do to help you know they don't
carry any of the burden or
responsibility for the repayment but
they do drive that overall sense of
community and runs responsibility and
the shame that is also associated with
not paying back there alone can you mean
can you be voted off the island if you
if you have a loan in a groove if you're
a borrower with a loan in a group you're
it you're kind of stuck
that group there is the possibility to
for a group leader to take members out
yes yes tarantella father we groups are
working so far and also the herbs are
exceeding house on the address you gave
to get manicures
there seems to be that these except
ethnic groups for
right okay so the question is about
groups how do we think the group model
is working right now and and you know
kind of what I guess what i can tell you
right now is a lot of what we've been
focused on in the past couple months in
terms of our our strategy has been
focused on the lenders making sure that
the lender experience is is rich
provides enough data to kind of to kind
of keep moving forward so we've been
working on several enhancements with the
lenders we are currently kind of turning
our attention to the groups and we are
giving a lot of deep thought to how the
groups are are working right now what we
want to see what types of modifications
need to be made so stay tuned for that
there's a lot I don't know whether
Andrew might want to say anything more
about the group's right now but yes
that's an area that we're kind of you
know we've got data now we can look and
see how things have moved and now we can
say okay what what's our next step here
yeah I mean let me actually talk the
second about groups the idea of being
groups is really providing reputation to
the borrowers who are members of those
groups and in the same sense that the
group provides a good reputation to the
borrowers the lenders will have more
confidence in them borrowers by making
repayments can also provide a reputation
to the group that this is a group that
has borrowers who make repayments what
you're seeing on the site right now is
really weak in that sense there's all
you can see is that this group has 20
loans and they're all current or there's
one late or there's one that's two
months late but eventually will actually
roll out a rating system for groups and
it's based on the group's ability to
improve expected default performance so
you remember the chart about you know
A's are expected to default at point
nine percent if a group drives a better
default rate for their A's they'll get a
five star rating which would be the
highest rating if they're if they're ASR
defaulting it one-point-two percent
they'd probably be below average 2 star
1 star group for example that should
give lenders a better sense of what does
it mean to lend to this group you know I
like I'm Vietnamese I really want to
lend to this Vietnamese group but
they're always late in their rating as a
result as zero stars or one star is that
really a group that I want to be
involved with and and some lenders
inevitably will say yes I really believe
in these people I want to help
we haven't quite gotten to the point in
prosper where people are doing charity
loans but I expect that if Hurricane
Katrina had hit around this time this
year this year or if it hit this year
it's possible that people would have put
up listings I need some money to make my
rent in Houston or whatever the
situation was where lenders could
actually help people and maybe not even
expect that's my next slide prosper and
socially responsible investing which is
I'm sure you're all aware there's been
just huge budget buzz in this
marketplace of socially responsible
investing double bottom line
microfinance and we believe that prosper
is a fantastic platform and we have in
fact talked with with many organizations
on both sides of that equation
organizations that want to lend to
others in need and and organizations who
help those in need who want to open up
their borrowers to the marketplace of
lenders so we think this is a huge
market for us we also see that there's a
need to sort of have a double portfolio
perhaps on prosper that allows you to
have one portfolio of loans that's
that's here to you know to help
entrepreneurs or others in need and one
portfolio that's gent that's in that's
geared towards making a good return so
that's kind of the balance that we're
trying to hit on on that side as well
yes you just learned that doing it to
the draw and something like it happens
this any can see that you'll probably
have lots of mistakes of people say and
how the vibe that we people we love
sympathy and they've all given my people
who just managed how do you do it well
the question has to do with fraud and
fraud prevention here's a slide we have
on security and risk management I think
that maybe maybe what happened in
Katrina were that maybe documents
weren't required or things like that but
it on prosper marketplace we require
that the borrowers provide us with all
of their key data points their drivers
license some of their social security
number we access their credit history we
ask them the questions that only they
would be able to answer and we do we
have a very stringent and automate
an in-house system that is you know
rigorous tracking and management of the
individuals verification validation
close interaction with the credit
bureaus and an individual's repayment is
then tied back to the credit bureau as
well so we're I mean that is a that is
at the heart of providing a safe
marketplace and that is one of the
commitments that we have so not only do
we have the technology in place to help
us with that we also have people who are
just you know managing and monitoring
the overall process it's a it's a very
safe system right
we catch most of the folks that come in
and are trying to you know kind of do
piss temor something like that but since
we're requesting bank account
verification and we do the challenge
deposits like PayPal does they have to
then report back to us what those
deposits were so they'd have to have
access to the account and in addition
right so we also have we have other
other things at play in that system okay
so we're checking that you ever applied
for credit online and they ask you
questions like you know during the years
of you know 1995 to 2000 where did you
live what street did you live on so we
have systems like that in place that are
designed to I mean nobody would know the
answer to that of the heck I can I have
a hard time remember I was living the
1995 yeah can I sure um yeah so to be to
answer your question directly we have
had incidents of identity that identity
thieves come to the site set up a
profile setup banking paths an attempt
to transfer money in all of those cases
we have certain rules in place that
effectively say if you're doing this
this and this we're going to check you
out a little further and we actually
have a fairly well although although our
technology has a well-developed risk
model in it we also have an identity
verification team who reviews documents
we actually request faxed social
security numbers bills will talk to them
from from people so so there have been a
few incidents where people have tried
this and we've been able to catch them
and all in all those cases
well not not that we know if we think
that by we think that by now we would
have known if there was someone who was
trying to use someone else's bank
account to get the money and transfer it
out and the problem is that there's a
huge paper trail in this system so if
you if you're really trying to get into
trying to get us you've had to give us a
ton of information and it's not just
your right you know your identity it's
your electronic paper trail as it were
also
someone like you need to view the real
yes
spectator getting money
so a question has to do with in addition
to validating the individual's credit
history do we also validate the story
yeah there are there are a couple if you
think about the prosper system as a as a
set of gates there there are a number of
gates that a borrower has to go through
before they get their money right they
have to verify their identity they have
to put their bank account on file they
have to get through lenders right
lenders have to have the confidence to
bid on them if they think that their
story is legitimate so before we've and
get to the point where we're thinking
about sending them money for a loan the
community of lenders has to have decided
that this is someone who not only is
credit worthy but is also seems to be a
Katrina victim for example and that
that's backed up not only by their
address information their listing
description potentially pictures that
they might upload their group background
so you could see a group that set itself
up as the New Orleans Red Cross and
actually you know says that everyone
they verify that everyone in their group
has shown them documentation and proven
that they live in New Orleans etc so so
that's another gate and then and then
when they get to the point of us sending
them money we actually will look through
listings and you know in a fairly
cursory way for some listings where we
have a high degree of confidence let
them pass through but for others where
we think the stories don't check out and
we have lenders report those stories to
us to hey can you check this out this
looks a little funky they said this in
this listing with that in this listing
and we actually will verify that
information we've had people send the
title for their car purchase and proof
of employment at certain places and
things like that so so we do go beyond
basic identity verification when we
suspect that there might be something
going on and the lender community has
emerged as you know just a very very
strong force and you know so you can get
into yahoo groups and things like that
that the communication between lenders
they'll vet these borrowers down to the
detail and you'll see somebody say you
know I called so-and-so and asked for
ask them to fax me their whole credit
report and their employment history and
I verify their email address was where
they said they worked and they'll go
through this whole process so there's
additional off-site betting that goes on
pretty you know it's pretty interesting
to see what emerges but then you'll see
everybody jump on you'll see like a
whole bunch of lenders kind of once they
all kind of agree okay this is a good
one that you'll go boom boom boom boom
and that loan just fill up the you can
communicate on the site anonymously so I
can contact if you're a borrower and I'm
a lender I can send you an email on the
site saying hey you know here's my
offline email address would you like to
get some more information before I bet
on your loan can you contact me so we
allow that to occur I've noticed is
there some others that are actually
borrow money to lend arbitrage right and
their kid Thank You building it up so
there's multiple you know they blend it
all their money when they ask for 25
thousand dollars for and they go out and
get off more lumps see if one compared
to the species because if they start
defaulting and that whole thing could
come crashing down is there anything
episode so we're talking about borrowers
you borrow to lend on the site you can
only have one loan at a time so you
can't you can't have you know ten loans
right now so you in effect that with
limit the ability so if they have to pay
back loan number one before they would
get low number two and you know if
they're if they're borrowing to lend on
the site their whole strategy right is
to say I want to make an enough back in
one month to cover what my loan payment
is going to be so because they're
getting paid back you get payback on
every loan every month right so that's
the strategy do we have you know
anything in place to prevent someone who
what might over expose themselves or
something like that no not really it's
but but the borrower does of course have
that responsibility of repayment and is
responsible for their own credit and
that's what it's tied to that's why only
individuals can borrow to
spread
I want it I want people to use the
platform for what serves their purpose
is the best as long as it's not doing
anybody harm or causing anything unsafe
to happen so yeah I think it's great so
since you can do about that process and
hope in security model where you tell
about what your are you going to take a
closer / security when I say we I think
we have a combination of both in place
and andrew might want to speak to this a
little bit more or maybe I know that we
have some technology in place for
security and fraud protection that we
don't talk about it's it's our IP it's
how we do it it's our secret sauce and
you can you know it keeps you safe you
know we you know that's that's just kind
of the way it is if we revealed it then
who knows maybe somebody would gain it
and we just don't want to take that risk
yeah we we may reveal that we have not
specifically discussed that but there
you know went in terms of a transparent
marketplace it may be something we
choose to reveal just don't know right
now
yes I agree so in terms of arbitrage
secondary markets would help because
someone who has built up this great
portfolio they can turn around and and
and flip that back out onto the site yes
I think that's a that's a good use for
it yes excuse me the regular popcorn
soup yes the minimum is a thousand yes
it's yeah however that would amortize
out because we take it from the monthly
payment yes the others the other source
of our income comes from borrower side
so the borrower pays a one-percent
origination fee at the time their loan
closes so we've got one percent on the
borrower side half percent on the lender
side yes ho yes
by our awesome sight man saying like
people thinking certain rules like for
bid on this interest rate for not having
birth rate and so on so far but do you
think that there's danger of that site
and people
thereby
I personally don't think there's any
problem with people using the site
through an API where they're not
actually participating in a in a in a
qualitative way on the site because
there's going to be there's going to be
plenty of community as it is there's
plenty of people who use ebay through an
API and never go to the website and they
they pump you know billions of dollars
our business through ebay so anybody
doesn't really have a problem with that
and they have plenty of community going
on with all those people who sell ten
and twenty dollar items every month but
they really maintain kind of that that
ethos that e they love so yeah yes oh my
gosh you want to go I'm sorry so there
gonna be some vendors were better able
to predict looking at all these
different metrics you know delinquencies
at the the pro the description that
they're right there there may be some
lenders are better able to predict who's
hopping default and so actually what I
sometimes do is I look at what all the
receivers
hang on right but there's no good way to
accept visually and whatever he fits on
your sheep is I've been on the kiss like
it seems like people who tend to look at
the same thing right so you're looking
for a follow the leader sort of lenders
are better able to pictures not your
fault they didn't allow vendors where
they share that information so they
realize a little research and one guy
figure out what excuse me that's right
these are great ideas yes we are are
likely to release sort of a follow the
leader approach to bidding where you
might say hey i love the way that cellar
door does this and i want to follow him
and we would of course allows cellar
door to say yes it's okay for me if
people follow or no it's not and then
they could reveal kind of their standing
order so to speak for how they bid on
the system so and yet you know lender
groups that's that's a you know another
item up on the table the other ideas you
know should lenders have the ability to
be anonymous if you're going to allow
people to follow lenders should you also
allow them to be anonymous to see these
are some of that right at but yet on
these on these smaller closed
communities of discussion they all
tagged together anyway so it's you know
it these are all ideas that are on the
table yes Boone they seem to have more
more trouble fighting for what are the
basement
not attention to every source is
fighting for a cascade of you of that
and what are you other than the things
you have in place this even working by
now how do you think you're gonna
struggle as you know fart it's just one
of those things I think you always just
have to stay you know one step in front
of you you know there's always going to
be new ideas there's always going to be
people trying to gain the system and if
your technology is always one step ahead
and you're you're on top of the system
you have a much better chance but as we
saw with paypal it's it's an ongoing
struggle and I do you want to see you
want to dress that any further yeah it's
it's it it's unfortunately it's part of
the world would i look forward to the
day when we get to paypal scale and we
have to worry about fraud mm-hmm yes
count as a club that was standing where
somebody sitting there for a while what
interested layering on that currently
you do not earn interest on the site
that's another area that we're seeking
to come up with the best resolution for
we you know we're registered as a
lending institution not a bank banks
can't banks can pay interest lending
institutions cannot we're working
through kind of what the best-case
scenario is and again you know it's kind
of what paypal had to determine for
themselves is what was the best model so
that's something that we expect to have
an announcement by i would say
conservatively by the end of the year on
but right now you don't but you can
transfer funds on a regular basis and I
I think relatively soon we're going to
have the odd an automated ability to so
you might say on the site you might say
I want to transfer you know five hundred
dollars a week or a thousand dollars a
week or a month on to the platform so
that you would have the ability to leave
the money into an interest-bearing
account having it transferred in as you
want to put it to good use
the same radius log out so that I could
just you know maybe a tip on the mound
you know standing order that's up to
five thousand dollars as those ones get
taken out you go my bank in full money
out so I don't ever have to have money
sitting around very generous
the Presbyterian
right now I hear you we're actually
almost there I mean at this point we're
about to build recurring transfers like
monthly transfer weekly transfer but
standing orders already work in the
sense that you could say you know I only
have twenty thousand dollars in the
system but the Standing Order has a
thousand one hundred thousand dollars
worth of capacity so that when any
transfer hits my account is
automatically going to get like that
through that standing order and whenever
enough funds are available from
repayment they will also get bit out and
to do bit so so the system is already
sort of fully automated and you have a
standing order do that created well it
won't start bidding until there's money
there to place the bed it'll stay in
place ready to fire yeah yes Oscar I
happy the motivation is right I think
they I can see them working in micro
lending and you know stays in countries
where it's been tried already because
you know people you've thrown up with
them they're from your Milliken song but
here you here I'm you know I'm gonna
stay focused mind 996 and other includes
your screen names people have never met
and so I'm wondering why you think i
will create some responsibility
some people might be in it just to get a
lot of membership as well and it's not
in different groups a few days
genetically they have seller groups a
seller will be very keen on being part
of group of the hydrogen possess that
sellers bread and butter to the seller
group from region falls then that's all
its crew if you're a people women touch
me five grand reputations got the hell
but I don't care all right and in the
same in the same way that I need a the
seller has the incentive is set up for
the seller to perform on our site it's
that the group leader is incentive to
perform it's not necessarily the
borrowers because the idea is that the
group leader brings borrowers into their
group that they feel high level of
confidence for that they will improve
the reputation of their group there are
a lot of group leaders who admittedly
are just just trying to sort of you know
what's it called just grow just for the
sake of growing / and burnt like they're
just grabbing all those borrowers out
there who don't have groups and they're
saying hey come on in and you know that
what the water is fine and ultimately
ultimately what will happen to those
groups is that they'll have really poor
reputations lenders won't lend to them
and those group leaders will be more
people leave the system so it's it's
that the problem is that there just
hasn't it's a chicken and egg problem is
I've been not enough time there's not
enough reputation available yet but
ultimately that's sort of these is it
there's a match reward fee so when when
a group leader brings in a borrower of a
particular grade they're paid a match
fee and then they're paid a percentage
of the repayment so for the life of the
loan so the group leader is incented on
the return so that drives it as well and
I think another thing is i mean this is
this is an example of a letter you know
an email that went up on the site saying
hey thanks if you've got a borrower who
literally didn't have other options that
were nearly as good they're really
grateful i mean there really is truly
like wow this was this is a lifesaver to
me i couldn't have gotten this or i can
solid i was paying twenty nine percent
and you know I was not making a dent in
the principal I was paying just interest
every month and now all of them they've
got a different opportunity there is I'm
not
that's the hundred percent of the
population but there is a significant
percentage and we knew there's someone
who feels so grateful you can bet that
if it's a difference between paying
their chase bill or their prosper bill
they're going to pay us I think what you
need is a network sort of a linkedin
linkedin that network testing so that i
can say here are my references and write
speed is my appear to borrow from other
people they're more like micro planets I
think we're village it knows somebody
else someone knows somebody else so
somebody's bow qing for someone else
that yeah that's good idea we're very
good at vetting so they stay at that
lender group and they say okay i love it
i love that yes why do you think that's
a big question why did wire banks not
doing this right now i think that you
know that it's so far and away from what
they've done in the past that it just
slips outside and they've got such
stringent barriers on the types of loans
that they make they don't look to the
person and this for the first time is
allowing lenders to look at the people
and say you know what it's okay you were
delinquent on one I believe you I
believe that that medical history
problem or you know the inability to pay
the bill because your father died or
whatever it is I believe in that and I'm
going to lend you the money a bank is
not going to do that so it's hard for a
bank to go from this model of here's the
framework don't deviate and you know
sorry that's what the book says we have
to do here you know to to this model I
just don't think they're ready to you
know they may get there but not today
but this is this is the right way to go
yes so
back to the grips one thing that you
said initially was that their
acquisition costs would be very low into
the group's now you started talking
about committing all these benefits by
basically giving the reputation for them
borrowed but this seemed to be a very
weird double row veteran of the glue so
what's the deal and in terms of it's
going to be too expensive to acquire
borrowers through the grape leaders
efforts or what's that is that the
borrower's actually pay the group leader
for the reputation so that that payment
in the beginning of the first or tickets
like you said that be4 prospers
requiring ars that's sort of the groups
will score it implies that it's the few
plans on with the group here is finding
and bringing in new bars and as i can
now get talking about that the point of
the juice is to validate and transfer
their reputation or to the bars and for
me that seems like a strange double bow
what's the deal well the idea is that
well the idea is that the the group
leader is earning money by bringing
people onto the platform right that
money is actually being paid by the
people who come onto the platform so
it's it's effectively as if you were a
group leader and i came to us borrow and
i said i'm willing to pay you two
percent of my loan if you will provide
me the reputation of your google
employee group and you'd say ok I you're
a Google employee and I trust you and
you know here we go so you I create a
listing every time I make a repayment
you you get two percent of my interest
rate right so that's
usually I think of the slide it was is
it that acquisition confer tomorrow
there you go head cold yes it's still
it's still low compared with the bankers
prosperous cost is acquiring leadership
necessarily borrowers right but Jordan
example just was that the prob be coming
to the Peter instead of the other way
around this acquisition cost example
just right now when I was talking about
acquisition cause I'm talking about
compared to what the banks pay to
acquire there and this is far less than
that is so yes yes it's reported back to
the credit bureaus so not only is it a
good way for an individual's for us to
sort of drive that the responsibility
side of it but it's also a really good
way for borrowers with either very thin
credit files or you know newly out of
school or new to the country or
something like that they can build a
credit file here as well yes so what
makes this work now is the time to
credit ratings but of course I mean you
guys have the right to long-term idea
about microcredit
probably really more people and of
course they're a lot more those in the
developing world so what are your really
loving stimulus and long-term to order
your visions of international expansion
and how the deal with the fact that
there are at least establish better
gradients out there right yes most most
countries don't have credit rating so
we're think we're on the rear houma on
the leading edge of that there's a lot
more do you actually suffer at the bar
right now I hear you when we go
international there's going to be all
kinds of issues to dress on all of those
friends how do we detail the credit in
the same way that we do here well we
won't be done in the same way it's going
to have to be a model that fits the
cultural dynamics of that country and
the group dynamics the group side of
that equation is going to has to also be
modified so I don't know the answers to
that right now but we know we know we
want it we'd love to go global we just
haven't even gone there yet
we will prove any will provide those as
we as we get them because again our key
belief is that in communities that have
the sense of responsibility and the
corresponding sense of shame that the
payments the repayments are going to be
higher and the defaults are going to be
lower but that'll be proven out when
we're able to reveal the rates we just
to be totally upfront about it we
haven't had any defaults yet because
default defaults are defined as a 120
days on the first due date of the loan
plus 1 month of lateness plus three
months of collections so we we're not
going to start seeing default if we have
any until mid-july and so at this point
publishing zero will be helpful well
we'll start publishing those days
delinquencies right because late
payments is a problem and and that it's
an indicator to you know to put your
calls yes
yes and English weights what grades are
getting one interest rate do madam we're
already showing that ok do you have
question yeah an early Leonard so
hottest music taking off on piracy
higher risk right right policing
you care more gambling
well it's true it's truly not gambling
because you are hopefully basing it on
the data that's provided and making up
you know well we have the experience if
all rights which are you know hope my
expectation my full expectation is that
they that are default rates are going to
be a lot lower than that and I'm that's
just my expectation I don't have any
proof of that at the moment but any
other incentives to I mean I think that
the best part of being an early adopter
here is that you're you're growing with
the with the community the rates are
fantastic right now and I keep going
back to where else can a private
investor get rates like this at the same
time they're part of a brand new
industry cutting-edge new asset class
and and and have the ability to be part
of the community and grow the the whole
thing and in the state at the same time
be earning this kind of money and some
people have strategies where they go all
high-risk that's all that's all they
want and their portfolio looks like a
hundred loans at twenty-eight percent
return well we know there's going to be
you know that the historical data says
well it's gonna be between fifteen and
twenty nine percent default rates on a
hundred loans so you know they're
they're still looking at you you could
easily say well why don't you just go
all double a's at eight percent and just
you know call it a day but the fun for
them the enjoyment of the whole process
is that they're vetting and they're
going through the process and they're
walking through and they're you know
taking a big hand and what their outcome
is my personal strategy is to kind of
spread it around I like a diversified
strategy that's got you know bits and
pieces in every bucket that will you
know overall purrs up provide you know I
have I've about 320 loans in my
portfolio earning about thirteen percent
return right now I like it it's all
mixed up it's you know I think it's
pretty safe it feels good so but
everybody comes up with what works best
for them
what fraction of the people are there
we can but it's actually pretty even the
overwhelming majority of listings are at
the lower credit scores but the actual
loans that are made are pretty even
across just distributed across</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
