Preston sandusky from Kestrel bikes and
also have John saint-denis also known as
JD with me here I have a quite a few
slides so I'm actually going to try to
go through them pretty quickly but my
background currently I'm the product of
managing director Kestrel I start out as
an engineering manager and I actually
was president for a while there before
we switch some ownership around so my
basic background is mechanical engineer
US Air Force Aerospace carbon fiber
stuff and we're really happy to have the
opportunity to come here today because
kestrels in Northern California company
and Kestrel made the first all carbon
fiber bike in the world for on a
production for sale basis and the
technology and the engineering to do
that came out of the bay area and the
Sacramento area aerospace industry you
know back back before companies like
this we're so prevalent here the
aerospace was really huge down here and
a lot of that early technology spent out
of spun out of that so let me just get
started like I said I I'm going to go
through some of these pretty fast just
want to give a brief history of one
Kestrel started we kind of already
talked about it and then we'll talk a
little bit about the materials
capabilities and why we use carbon fiber
and then kind of walk you through the
the the basic steps of the design and
development cycle on one of
products are a couple of our products
actually so like we've already said
Kestrel started in 1986 down in Santa
Cruz and what happened is the guys would
started trek bicycles about 10-12 years
prior to that got together with
aerospace carbon guys and decided to
make a full carbon fiber bike prior to
that there were bikes bike frames made
with carbon tubes typically glued to
aluminum legs even steel lugs early on
but but at the time the Kestrel came out
carbon bike was round carbon tubes
bonded or glued to aluminum legs so it's
very much metal bicycle technology with
just the tubes replaced by carbon so the
first the first Kestrel was called the
4000 or the model 4000 here it is here I
keep looking at the screen but it's
actually a friend of my face and this
bike this bike revenues revolutionize
cycling in a lot of ways actually I mean
the obvious thing is it was the first
full carbon fiber composite molded
bicycle frame but it also had things
like it was the first production frame
with aerodynamic tubing so and I'll talk
a little bit more about that when we get
into it but the beauty of carbon fiber
is its moldability and you can shape it
however you want we try to shape it in
ways it makes sense but it's it's
basically it's just infinite what you
can do with with carbon in a molded
shape once once the first road bike came
out we turned our attention to mountain
bikes and triathlon bike so in 1988 we
came out with a actually a full
suspension bike prototype and many
people regarded as kind of the bike that
helped kickstart the full suspension
craze that is now commonplace more
people ride suspension bikes than than
non suspension now and then as a result
of that bike
this is a here the Nitro show bike it
was actually a collaboration for those
of you who kind of know some of the bike
history or some of the bike names it was
a collaboration with Keith bontrager
from bontrager bontrager cycles Paul
turning Paul Turner who ended up
starting rock shox which of course was
in about 88 89 just was pioneering the
the suspension fork for mountain bikes
and of course testo with the with the
carbon fiber side we didn't end up
making this bike we ended up making what
we call a hardtail version which is
actually very similar design but without
the rear suspension because the things
like the brakes and the shocks didn't
actually actually exist in the market at
the time and it was pretty this bike was
pegged at about six thousand dollars in
1998 for a mounted bike later on some of
the other things we brought in with that
we kind of pioneered to the bike market
the EMS fork or the carbon fiber road
bike fork was a huge thing came out in
in 1989 and we also made a first all
carbon triathlon bike so triathlon is a
sport this that's pretty pretty big
these days and really growing fast and
at that time was really in its infancy
zai think we were maybe a second company
to make a try geometry specific
production bike and the first one to
apply carbon and aerodynamic tubing to a
triathlon or time trial bike for
production we also came out with this
bike in about nineteen ninety two this
is a 500 s CI I think the photos of 500
EMS but the 500s see I was this
predecessor and as you can see it has no
seat tube and this is a really good
example of what carbon fiber can do not
just for bicycles a bit but in any any
structural design because there's
there's no way you were going to take
steel or aluminum or
metal bicycle frame material and have
any kind of efficient structure by
removing the tube like that and what
this bike did this is actually a road
bike but it was used by a lot of
triathletes as well as you can see my to
set up in this photo but what it really
opened the door for was some aerodynamic
freedom with our triathlon bike designs
and you'll see some more of that and the
when i get to the the design process
this is this is a lot of words here
pizza basically the materials that we
use to make frames it comes straight out
of aerospace military and military and
aerospace industry so it's called carbon
fiber prepreg the prepreg means that the
fibers are typically aligned along an
axis and then and then coated or treated
with a matrix material like epoxy resin
so prepreg means pre impregnated with in
our case of the epoxy resin in I mean
literally we were specking taking
engineering material specs right out of
aerospace and applying them to these
bikes and in fact the it probably
probably the most important thing that
Kestrel pioneered back in the day was
the marriage of real engineering with to
the bicycle industry prior to that
nothing against those engineers but
actually a lot of the bike companies had
engineering departments that didn't have
engineers because mostly just drawing
tubes and and mitering drawings it to
see how that the two but the two blanks
are and how they come together to be
brazed or welded so this was a very
engineering intense project and I can
tell you that joining Kestrel in October
87 and going from there for composites
office in the aerospace side and then
watching them lay up a whole bicycle
frame within one piece with this
material is
thing where a train a trained aerospace
engineer would just say initially just
say you can't do that you know you it
doesn't work but bicycle guys are pretty
inventive guys you know I mean you're
talking about people like the Wright
brothers and so there's people that tend
to have some have some ideas or some
dreams and go after it and not worry
about what other people say can or can't
be done and I'm sure you folks here are
familiar with that as well so why carbon
fiber that the best thing about carbon
fiber in a bike frame is the stiffness
to weight ratio bicycle frames or what
we call stiffness critical structures so
in as many of you know we you get on a
bike and you don't want it to be
flopping and flexing around you want it
to be stiff but it's a two dimensional
structure the rear end is is a little
bit triangulated in the third dimension
but that main frame and that main power
transfer is is done in a two-dimensional
plane so stiffness becomes really the
issue in a in a bike frame and a lot of
a lot of bike components strength is too
but with with metals you sometimes have
the the condition where you have to
design something around the strength of
the material rather than the stiffness
with carbon because the stiffness is so
high usually once once you have the
stiffness under control the strength
almost comes it comes along with it with
the design we do have to beef up areas
for impact or certain really high
stressed areas in terms of strength or
structural testing but but stiffness is
the key and carbon fiber composites far
outweigh metals and I have a little
chart on that excuse me
so here's a stiffness comparison
specific stiffness I didn't really ask
how many of you folks are engineers or
material people specific stiffness means
stiffness to weight and you can see I
don't really have a pointer I think but
so you can see here down here the little
blue bars these are these are the
typical frame building metals steel
aluminum titanium those are the metals
that were being used when when Kestrel
came out and they're still the metals
that are being used in frames today
maybe not so much as it used to be
because carbon is is probably the
dominant high-performance material in
bike frames now but as you can see those
those metals have have actually
different stiffness properties and
capabilities but when you when you
factor in the density of the metals that
their stiffness to weight comes out very
much very very much the same as each
other and also a stiffness it's pretty
much regardless of the alloy of the
metal with strength varies more at the
ally but stiffness to weight is pretty
much the same and then you can see on
the far side the the type of carbon
materials that we use here can I don't
know if I can be here without being in
the way off the camera this is the
senator our 700k material or our quote
unquote standard material and then the
800 k here is our is our higher modulus
material or what we use on our SL frames
and you can see the specific I don't
know if you guys can read the quite read
the numbers but you can tell from the
the graph that the specific stiffness of
carbon fiber is that we use in the
frames is about five to seven times the
stiffness to weight of the metal frame
material so from a pure engineering stay
on point if you don't have a background
in the traditional frame materials and
you just look at materials
available it's just really obvious to us
that that carbon fiber composite
materials are the way to go the little
red bars next to the carbon is actually
the carbon epoxy carbon you can't build
a bike with just with carbon epoxy has
to hold it together so when you factor
in about forty thirty five or forty
percent epoxy but you still have a
stiffness to weight ratio of about three
to four times what the metals have and
actually more than that with with some
of the newer fibers strength away it's
the same thing there's a little more
variance in the in the in the metal
materials depending on the alloys but
they're heavy carbon fiber epoxy again
as you can see the it has even higher
strength to weight than stiffness to
weight and that's why I said if you make
the frame stiff enough the the weights
alma or the strength is almost always
already there for you so again the
fibers themselves that we use 11 12 13
times the stiffness two are the strength
to weight or specific strength of the
metal materials and then the the carbon
epoxy blend is still going to be six
seven eight times the strength to weight
it's an engineer's dream a couple other
things that weren't on the slide the
other big thing the main point there i
think is a big one that carbon fiber
epoxy composites are our fiber
reinforced plastic so the epoxy matrix
is surrounding all those fibers and it's
it's plastic basically so the shock
damping capabilities of the composite of
a carbon composite material is 10 to 15
times the shock damping of metals of
these traditional frame metals so
imagine if you had a steel bill and
aluminum bell and a titanium bill they
would all ring you hit them they would
ring you make a carbon epoxy bill and
it's like hitting a plastic bill so it
just doesn't ring what that allows us to
do is separate the ride quality and the
damping of the the frame or the
structure from the stiffness and the
strength and the performance the side of
it so if you make let's say you make a
titanium frame you want it to be
reasonably light and you want it to be
comfortable well if you make it very
stiff it won't necessarily be so
comfortable if you make it comfortable
you're getting the comfort out of flex
flex is bad in a bicycle frame so
there's that that balance with with
metals you try to balance it out and I
defy anybody to make a non suspended
frame out of metals that that is as
stiff as a carbon frame and still has it
kind of comfort you're looking for but
so with carbon fiber you make that
structure you say I wanted this stiff
I've on it it has to pass these strength
tests blander very two fibers and the
design according to the weight you're
looking to get and the shock damping is
separate from from those properties so
all of a sudden you have a super stiff
bike like well like these up here the
little one over there and very stiff
very very efficient and yet really
smooth really smooth frames now if you
if you hit a hit a go up against a curb
or something it's a stiff frame you're
going to feel it but that kind of that
rough road buzz and smaller smaller pot
holes and cracks and things in the road
it just gets rid of those you don't get
that bite through the handlebars and
that ringing in the frame
so a couple a couple general features or
general design approach in pretty much
all of our frames and products using
carbon and by the way we only make
carbon products the first one is a
modular module blah modular monocoque
construction and the frame there's
actually these are the solid models for
the various sizes of that frame that the
talin frame down at the end but way back
when we used to try to mold these frames
all out of one piece and it was great it
worked great this very complex very
expensive and very less repeatable very
much less repeatable so what about ten
years ago or so we've we've kind of gone
to this modular monocoque construction
and what that is is taking all the best
out of the carbon fiber design but
breaking it up into not a lot of pieces
but just a couple main structures and
for instance the main frame here so
that's a that's a solid model that the
that the the mold or the tooling is made
from but it shows that the whole main
frame is molded in one piece and then
after after the talk you folks can get a
better look at the bikes up here and you
can actually see where say the the seats
stay assembly in the rear is one piece
and then the chainstay and assembly in
the rear is one piece and then they're
all put in a bonding fixture and locked
permanently together the other thing
that's a really big part of our design
work and I think that the thing that
carbon is leaves you wide open to to
opportunity is in optimizing the tube
shapes and the junction design so
somewhat doable in metals but but
difficult usually there's round tubes or
near round tubes but in carbon and if
you look at some of these designs you'll
see that from from one end of a tube to
another can be a completely different
section it's all designed around the low
conditions and the structural
requirements at any given point in the
frame so also we can bring in
aerodynamics you see the aerodynamic
tube shape they're in the down tube
maybe it might flip it down to my flare
out to the bottom bracket to make it
stiff there some of the sections go from
flat at the front at the head tube of
say on the the top tube on the top of
the bike up near the front at the head
to they might be more of a vertical
section and kind of gradually morph to a
hour sorry a more horizontal section
gradually morph to a vertical section so
is its infinite it's it's anything you
can put in the computer which is pretty
much anything these days didn't used to
be pretty much anything you put in there
you can you can make with carbon fiber
the size specific structural design and
fiber layup again it's it's it's
becoming a norm now in the in a in a
bike frame with carbon fiber whereas
with with metals you might be able to
use a thicker tube or a bigger diameter
tube as you went up in size but
typically it was really hard to have a
consistent performance and kiss
consistent structural properties
throughout a size range of bikes but now
we literally we literally size every
tube of the bike proportional to the
size of the frame and sometimes more
than that sometimes even wheel sizes and
things are proportional to the size of
the frame but by sizing that that tube
it might look the same the general shape
and design might be same it's just a
little bit smaller a little bit bigger
for each frame size and that means the
hundred pound rider on the smallest
frame has the same kind of ride quality
and feel in response as the 250-pound
rider on the largest frame and that's
the gold there in addition to that the
carbon fiber layup itself we can put
more or less layers of carbon fiber
at a given in a given tube or tube
junction to to make the frame lighter or
to add material make it stiffer so we
can tune it the bonding the bonding
design and techniques we've actually
since casual started we've we've done
bonding with we as aerospace grade
structural adhesives this isn't so this
not so much a point for this audience
some some of the competitors use some of
our competitors use cheaper respect
materials like a one part epoxy we use a
two part epoxy they actually have to
squirt it out in production and mix it
up but that's what gets the best the
best results it has the higher strength
higher shear strength and it gives you
the better quality and product the other
thing that all our frames they were
going to have the ride tuned stays and
our EMS for technology so like I said we
started we introduced the carbon fork to
the world in 1989 and what we do now is
every model that bike has its own
specific design fork so if you look at
the the image here you can see the
mainframe in blue and then you see this
the the rear stays in the silver gray as
well as the fork so what we're able to
do these days is to is to match just
match the performance and match the
quality and design of the front end to
the rear end so you get a very balanced
ride in a very very balanced feeling
kind of a repeatable performance out of
the frame
no compromise geometry and fit that's a
that's just something we do as a because
we're even though we're carbon fiber
engineer guys were we're a bicycle
company first and so what we try to do
is not cut side not not cut corners to
make one size fits all frames it seems a
silly thing to do in carbon because
carbon is so light if you you know
there's no reason to make a tube a
little bit shorter to make a frame a
little bit lighter you know get the
geometry right fit the writer correctly
and design to that just as you would to
wait or stiffness grab a little sip here
the this picture to remind me that so
some kind of basics of what we do and
now this is a we have a couple frames
can't put my hand there a couple frames
that I'll show you some images of some
examples of the actual design process
that we go through one of them's SRT 700
which is our brand new road bike we have
a couple of them up here you can check
out after and then the other one is our
a real try race-specific bikes called
the airfoil pro it's very specific to
triathlon racing it's not legal actually
for any road racing or time trial use
but it's a very fast bike so I think
I've covered I think I've covered most
of these points we do all the design all
the engineering is done in our Santa
Cruz offices the frames are mo made
overseas like just about everybody as
these days used to we used to have the
factory in Santa Cruz so we have unlike
most most bike companies that go
overseas to get carbon we actually have
experience and the engineers who have
set up factories in
not only in the US but in other
countries as well so we can go to those
factories and we kind of know we know
how to lay up bikes and we know how to
how to to do the finishing work and all
in fact from the president of our
company who has set up carbon bike
manufacturing factories around the world
and on down the carbon I talked a little
bit but just to just to reinforce that
the carbon is infinitely tunable so it
comes in very thin sheets and what we do
I don't think I really show this I don't
really have the manufacturing so much as
a design stages here so what you can do
with the carbon it's usually what we
call unidirectional carbon so the carbon
is all going in one direction on the
sheet and then the sheets are cut to the
different angles that we need and the
different we use different thicknesses
of sheets that we need and then we stack
we stack those sheets so say oh we need
six layers in this big too but we need
five layers in this smaller tube of what
have you the different number of layers
the angles the thicknesses along the two
or at the junctions all that's tailored
to the particular design it's all
everything we do now is 3d solid model
CAD didn't used to me when I started
Kestrel it was joined center line
drawings by hand and working with
industrial designers and actually drying
this stuff drawing it on paper and then
the interesting thing when we got into
real 3d modeling is that the software is
really capable now but about 10 12 years
ago when we were first starting to do it
seriously even say we as pro engineer
software and we had designs that those
guys couldn't model so we we actually
had to have customized software made to
to be able to model the crazy compound
curves and shapes that we were doing but
this is how the design cycle starts out
we we actually work with some very good
industrial design firms usually local to
Santa Cruz area and we give them some
definitions on what we're looking for in
a bike and and start bouncing ideas
around and getting some sketches going
this is the this is the airfoil Pro tri
bike that I showed you once that once
that basic concepts done then we start
getting into the details okay how is a
cable routing going to work what's the
seed binder going to look like and so
they'll get into these multiple
iterations of these of these types of
sketches that this one looks to be
pretty far along in the process and in
terms of the hand sketches and sometimes
they by the way they sometimes they use
computers for their their their
conceptual stuff or sketch type stuff
it's a little cable port that came out
of probably a dozen concepts it's the
one we kind of zeroed in on the RT 700
bike once we have those concepts done
we'll start doing the solid model CAD
drawings and this one I like this shot
because it's this again this is airfoil
pro but what it shows is the solid part
there is the main frame so that the main
frame design was pretty much done it
that
stage and and so now they're building
the rear end onto the onto the bike all
the clearances is there laying out all
the clearances and try to put it into
the hard points the like the rear
dropouts where the where the wheel bolts
in and where the brake bolts in and then
a little further on same frame this is a
cool shot because you can actually see
those those those green and grey lines
that are going down the the main the
main big tube on the screen there the
down tube is actually some of the cable
routing so they're able to put in the
anticipated thickness of the carbon
fiber wall and and simulate the cable
routing through the frame make sure
there's no interferences the little hard
to tell but these metal you can see some
of the little metal pieces that are that
are bolted or riveted on to the frame
that guide the cables and things so
actually able to put those into the cab
model in and make sure everything's good
functions properly before we go to
machining CNC machine and very expensive
mold and by the way all this stuff we do
if we make five or six sizes of a frame
it has to be done for all the sizes here
you can see this is the RT 700 model and
obviously this is a fairly finished
model but you can see some of those
concept sketch pieces like the little
gold cable guides where they're actually
fitting them into place and designing
the frame to be molded to accept them
another one doubted that under the
bottom bracket cable guide piece this is
a little injection-molded thermoplastic
piece and it went from that I think
three piece concept sketch down to this
so basically there's a little little
ports yes I might have I don't know if
you guys can see if I let's see my
pointer here so this port area is
actually a hole through the frame and
the cables come out then you can route
them through the plastic piece
plus my marker again there it is and
then it goes into these holes here to go
up to the front derailleur and rear
derailleur this shot here I'm not sure
what the shots for I just think it
looked really cool so I put it in there
it reminded me of a terminator to liquid
man but it was the rear drop out of the
RT 700 at this is a problem we have a
little power problem up here I guess I
should have turned it my lighting down
more so and then actually a big part of
his checking all the clearances to
actually get the I think there I just
files from shimano or whoever and
actually put the components in and check
all the fit and clearances I'm going to
run out of power all done yeah yeah it
might be pretty done anyway and then we
can do finite element using the CAD
model we can do some finite element
analysis depending on what the frame is
and what the needs are this bike doesn't
have a seat tube so it's kind of nice to
put some loads into it you can do the
whole frame or you can do sections
sections are usually the better way to
go another thing we can do at the CAD
models before we commit to tens or
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
of machined metal molds is this is
actually a CNC machined piece of foam
actually several pieces of foam so they
actually machined a frame out of solid
foam assembly together we check it out
typically we change it we did change
some design details on this that used to
be really there you go thanks excellent
I can turn my lighting up here a little
that used to be really expensive stuff
to do is just the prices on getting that
stuff is going down like mad these days
and in fact this piece is actually done
in-house by the industrial design firm
we work with
and then boom you've got a prototype
once you want to check everything out
make the mold we go to the prototyping
phase and this is probably the first or
second main frame of the RT 700 you can
see my cursor shows up you can see that
a little port here so that's actually
the little metal port and that's
actually a stereo lithography prototype
part as well I don't know why my cursor
disappears back here you can see these
little tabs sticking out in the back
that's where the stays in the rear end
what is going to bond on how does it
time JD house at a time ok thanks
another little proto prototype not the
prettiest picture but I mean this is raw
right out of the mold there it is so
this is an SLA parter stereo lithography
part I don't know you guys are familiar
with how that works but that's basically
where they have a plastic solution and
they cross lasers to solidify it and
build this piece not out of thin air bit
out of thin plastic fluid plastic so
they call it SLA stereo lithography I
don't know what the a stands for is
maybe it's a Canadian process I'm not
sure stereolithography a and and then
you saw the mainframe here's this is a
bonding fixture part of the prototyping
is is figuring out that the tooling and
just proofing it all out so this is
actually the bunny fixture is quite
larger to hold the whole frame and bond
everything into alignment and one at one
time and the nice thing about carbon is
it can't be be bent or deformed so once
it's bonded in alignment in the fixture
it's in alignment for life and but that
means you better do it right the first
so that's actually where the stays and
the dropouts are being bonded into the
mainframe on this fixture not real fancy
stuff but it's effective and it's made
for production speed finally once the
the basic prototyping is done we do a
whole battery of structural testing I
think you know a Kestrel we pride
ourselves on on having really stringent
test requirements NOP I was concerned
with that on on carbon fiber products
and we actually agree so the testing
that we do is is the kind of stuff that
was done on nineteen seventy zeros
heavy-duty steel bikes and ten speed
type frames and so we surpass all the
different government requirements
whether it's US or Europe or Japan our
tests meet or beat all of those in this
case this frame is actually of course
that the test machine is kind of
vertically oriented so it's actually
pushing the frame down to simulate a
load at the front the front wheel axle
and just it so it's like a frontal
impact load it'll take a thousand well
I'll probably say 800 pounds and up to
cause any kind of structural damage to
the frame in that way on some bikes
particularly to try or they rode bikes
we also do wind tunnel testing from time
to time this is the airfoil Pro that we
saw some of the development images and
it's being set up at the low speed wind
tunnel down in San Diego here it is with
our this is our top pro triathlete his
name's Chris McCormack he's actually
quite a good trap lady one about three
or four triathlete of the Year honors
for his 2006 accomplishments and one
thing we did in 2006 was get him off his
his a more conventional
see-tube bike onto this no see tube
super super arrow airfoil pro bike and
what we found is that just the the frame
frame and fork when we call frame set
the frame and fork alone saved them
about 100 grams of drag at 30 miles an
hour which is basically if you if you
rode 25 miles or 40k in one hour it
would knock a minute off at that time
just the drag savings there the other
thing is that this bike is designed to
put you in a very aerodynamic position
and the position changed knocked another
hundred grams of drag so another minute
so say he can go away more than 25 miles
in an hour but say I was going 25 miles
in in a one hour right now it would take
me 58 minutes so it's a huge you know
aerodynamics in in triathlon and in in
Pro Cycling especially the time trial
state is that I'm sure all you all of
you folks have seen on TV and the
internet it's it's the time trials are a
pretty big pretty big catch word these
days you know it's exciting to watch and
the bikes are crazy and expensive so it
really is important what you do
aerodynamically the result he was the
way he was he was the best triathlete in
the world in 2006 he won I think all the
two races at he entered he got second
place in those two and and he really
proved that what we showed our
development in our wind tunnel testing
worked ironman hawaii the big race of
the year he got second it was one I
think he was a like a minute and 11
seconds behind the the guy who won so
one of the closest when I think the
third closest finish in ironman history
that we're looking for him to win the
race this year but definitely the what
we did in the wind Thailand his position
and has helped him move up from six
place a couple years ago second place
last year and breathing right down the
neck to take first this year
and that is the presentation we have a
few more a few minutes open for
questions you folks may have and feel
free to check out the bikes as well yes
how many frames that we produced in a
year is actually kind of confidential
information it's worth we're a small
company and you know we make we make
bikes now this year we make the bikes
from 1990 nine dollars an app but it is
a you know we're very much a specialty
manufacture and so it's it's really
competitive that information but we're
but we're we make in the range of like a
few thousand frames and bikes a year not
tens of thousands yes
I'm sorry why don't we see mountain
bikes yeah did you say there
yeah well I think the question is why if
carbon saw such a strong good material
why don't we see more mountain bikes and
I think the simple question is you are
you are going to see them they're more
companies are using carbon for mountain
bikes now and more companies that were
aware of are actually are heading that
way so if I talk to a company that just
makes mountain mountain bikes I say dude
you got to go carbon you know if you
don't do it somebody else is going to
beat you to it so it's actually a great
material for for mountain bikes but just
like in road bikes where it took a while
for it to gain acceptance it's the same
thing in mountain bikes and then maybe
then so be even more so because people
are worried about you know people crash
all the time or they're worried about
rocks and things kicking up and hitting
the frame we have made carbon mountain
bikes since 1988 and i can tell you
they're pretty bomber you know i mean i
say i'd say we tend to make them a
little heavier and a little thicker and
tougher but they've been very successful
over the years but it's it is more of
that acceptance thing another thing is
that with full suspension when full
suspension became really prevalent some
of the benefits of the ride quality of
carbon aren't is noticeable and because
you've got big fat soft tyres and you've
got suspension so you just want you want
it to be super stiff structure because
the suspensions giving you the comfort
and you tend to don't want it to be too
expensive so carbon fiber the price is
working down the design you know the
whole thing is coming that way and I
think just like if you watch the Tour de
France now and there's virtually no
bikes that that are made of metal in
there whereas ten years ago most of them
are more metal and twenty years ago all
of them are metal I think you'll see
that in mountain bikes
yes what is the disadvantage of other
than
what's a disadvantage of like why don't
all bikes not have seat tubes well
you're right i mean the biggest the
biggest issue is you see I / USCF
regulation you're racing regulations by
pretty much has to have a seat tube to
be legal as a result I mean that that
really limits what we can do design wise
because we can make the the triathlon
bike specifically for and not care if
it's UCI legal so we can do that and
make it I wouldn't say targeted to that
audience would actually make it for that
audience make those people as fast as
they can be but honor on a road biker a
bike for the general population it's
just the marketing of that and what's
accepted and what people are looking for
it you know it becomes very complex to
go against that it makes a great right i
can tell you when you if you have a road
bike and it's designed properly without
a seat tube like that one of those first
slides i showed you it's in a
phenomenally riding bike you know it's
actually at the time that that uh 500
series frames were made it was actually
the stiffest frame that we made in the
bottom bracket but also the smoothest
riding bike so you know it we have to go
with what what the market wants and
definitely the UCI rules do play into
that in terms of the structural part
there is that that frame also had
aerodynamics built into it there are
dynamic two shapes so whenever you go
for those kind of things you're going to
lose a little bit on the the structural
efficiency so I would say if you want to
make the absolute lightest stiffest
frame you're going to generally want a
triangulated frame but the frame i
showed you there that weighed two point
nine pounds in 1992 1994 so you could
get really close to two pounds just like
the triangulated frames are now thanks
yes
and what point
next
right his question had to do it
basically how do you tell if there's any
damage to the carbon frame how do you
how do you know and how do you know if
it's bad enough to be a concern and
that's that's another thing you know 20
years ago and Kestrel started it was
just this whole learning curve on all
that I mean we felt we were teaching the
industry the bike shops that consumers
about carbon fiber in general but I
think that and then over time obviously
we and then more and more people have
manufactured have used it so it's come
to be accepted and people have learned
how to identify those things i would say
that damage tolerance in a bike frame is
very dependent on the weight of the
frame not so much the material of the
frame so anytime you're pushing the way
way down the way to make a bike frame
light is to make the walls thin and so
when you start doing that it's going to
become less less damage tolerant no
matter what you do so with carbon you
know I've actually seen actually we've
actually seen things we're in a say a
criterium race and people have gone down
and 55 guys crash in a pilot they get up
three of them have a steel or aluminum
frame is bent and they can't keep riding
but the guy on the cast roller the
carbon frame could so what I see in
carbon is when it gets kind of generally
slammed it's really good because it
doesn't Bend but it is different than
metal for localized impact especially
sharp stuff is not so much the big stuff
because metal tubes dent too so they're
damaged by the same kind of things but
the damage is different so into to I
guess to answer your question is you
know usually you need to have you take
it to the bike shop that's qualified to
look at it and or send it to the
manufacturer well you know we'll get
people I crashed and they'll send us a
digital photo of some damage where the
handlebar came around
the tube or something start from there I
think that's about all the time we have
so thanks a lot for coming in for
opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
