surprised that this last minute Tech
Talk was this highest well attended and
we have quite a few DC's projection okay
well any now my name is Christine moon
I'm a manager of the International
engineering ops team so background on
this talk I'm gonna call from my friend
who's in DC last Friday asking hanging
we have dr. Kim coming into town are you
willing to close the top and you know
it's very last minute but we were able
to pull it off he found the rope and we
found people who are interested and
people who are concerned as well about
the talk so I'm very excited about this
talk because I think we have people from
whole different political spectrum with
interests on this topic but I do want to
remind you that this talk is being
reported and when we do go into Q&amp;amp;A
session or either the talk please be
respectful to your fellow audience and
also Smith speaker and rather than
making this a politically charged debate
or discussion I would really like to
focus on listening and learning and
learning more about what it is they're
trying to do so that's my only thing and
I just want to follow up that I myself
and the ignorance about what's going on
in North Korea I have no time I just met
dr. Kim today and I'm here to learn and
listen and you know I would love to hear
about what's going on so I just don't
want to go too much into his bio except
for the fact that he's a vice president
of Pyongyang University of Science and
Technology and you guys saw the
background on his educational background
but he's a longtime Silicon Valley
resident he still has a woman three
months and he's here with us today to
share with us what's been going on on
with the university
please welcome
thank you and again I was born and
raised in Seoul Korea and after my
college there I came to the United
States for my study in the Bay Area UC
Berkeley was my greatest studied
mechanical engineering after that I
spent up over 30 years before I decided
to go on my second career in my life to
make that decision I realized that I was
born in 1946 that's when I was 4 years
old then I was in that Korean War of
time and as you know right after the war
the whole country was torn off and I
spent three miserable things but with
someone help somebody's help and that
unconditional you know care in love then
how could be in the United States and
continuing my study and my career and I
thought I was successful in a sense so
there was a time to pay back to those
people who is needed so I joined a group
of people in northeastern corner of a
China where the borders to voters to
North Korea
there was a school teaching that Korean
ethnic Chinese for their college level
study that made their lives changed just
like me so though about 200 foreigners
including Korean Chinese Korean
Americans and all of the United States
and others about 13 countries over 200
faculty members is teaching and giving
their lives to those in their area
people who was premature deprived in a
sense no hope no you know education but
after that
interface a lot of a more successful
like us so now there was a very
meaningful life of you know my career so
I spent about six and a half years as a
teacher there and I also involved in
school administration as a vice vice
president to a young beyond university
of science technology all I was working
in that time I was asked to be a project
manager for this new school in Kenya so
I worked as the project manager the
reason was I was the project manager of
power projects in that terrible
cooperation and also Pacific Gas &amp;amp;
Electric Company in this area so that
was you know my brief background and I
have two kids living in san fran
freedman area and okay let's go from
here
so why don't I give you that my plan is
give you canvas video and I'll showing
young beyond university of science
technology and another part is a on
university of science technology and
historically we had a opening ceremony
or you can say building dedication
ceremony and president inauguration
ceremony in September last year there
was a historical moment the school is
open now we are waiting for the students
in at April that's where we are
so after this video clip then our give
you more teacher story
as a new chapter in the history of
northeastern Asia opens Korea and China
are coming together for a new level of
partnership for the 21st century Pacific
Rim era
China whose northeastern borders with
Korea is formed by tumen river'
originating from Peck du mountain the
entire nation of China is developing
rapidly to take her place in the
international community and Yan ji is no
exception and the myths of rapid changes
the ambien University of Science and
Technology stands as the first of
foreign Chinese joint venture
educational institution in 1991 even
before the International relationship
was formed between Korea and China used
was approved by the China Bureau of
Education and Jilin provincial
government and had its historic
beginning in September 1992 a unique
campus with unmatched qualities in China
East is a place of learning nurturing
the future leaders of China and Korean
Chinese community who will lead the era
of northeastern Asia engineering schools
focusing on the latest technology and
practical applications
School of Materials mechanical and
automation engineering school of
biochemical engineering
school of computer electronics and
telecommunication school of
architectural engineering
School of Business nurturing the future
CEOs of China
befitting this global University School
of Western and Eastern languages which
include English German
and Korean departments in addition
English conversation department and
general English education department
provide intensive English education for
all students the goal is to produce
future leaders who are multilingual
fluent in English Korean and Chinese the
School of Nursing science training the
future leaders in the field of Nursing
making it a total of nine colleges
twelve departments and thirty-five
research institutes at used
to most unique features of used are the
diversity and integrity focused
education
faculty and staff members from all
corners of the world
and Han Chinese Korean Chinese Russian
and exchange students from abroad
produced diversity through which
students benefit both academically and
socially all first and second year
students are required to live in
dormitories in order to learn the
community spirit
under the motto of creativity
cooperation and volunteerism students
learn the community spirit and practical
experiences through various internships
and community service activities various
student clubs also enhance the student's
college experience used graduates in the
world over 2,300 graduates in 12 years
working for leading global companies in
China while 15 percent went abroad for
graduate studies unlike other
universities used-- provides
opportunities for the graduates to
return to school than the need for
further education arises leaders who
understand and appreciate both Chinese
and Korean cultures will serve as a
bridge between China and Korea and it is
in training and educating such leaders
that used will make its contribution to
the 21st century northeastern Asia
chun-hyang University of Science and
Technology a project for the
reconciliation of the north and south of
Korea the campus of this exciting new
University is on a site of great
historical interest
in March 2001 dr. James Kim president of
used in China was appointed by North
Korea to be president of puste
and asked to build a university like
used in their country
watch me on the money would easily it
was a water hooked oh yeah and the other
want a car achieve of yoga to del Oaxaca
Tom did fotógrafo hungry cushioned
involved current - done
he's again and Johnny Velveeta
now all the basic construction is
complete with heat and electricity in
all the buildings on campus
in the first half of 2007 along with a
marble exterior put up on the IT
building and the multi-purpose complex
and the paving of the campus access road
basic construction was done on the
service centre research and development
center students enter in school garage
in addition student and faculty dorms
were heated and readied for interior
work
in the second half of 2007 we celebrated
the completion of construction work on
all of the main buildings and of the
enclosed hallway connecting the whole
campus we are on the verge of completing
all preparatory construction to open the
school on schedule we need your help to
purchase equipment prerequisite for the
operation of a world-class university
having waited and worked together with
you these several years for the
realization of this amazing dream we are
now filled with excitement to see how
close we are to the goal boost will be
the very first international university
in North Korea working toward the
reconciliation of the north and south we
invite and challenge you to participate
in this great historical event in the
history of the Korean people
the Pyongyang University of Science and
Technology first held its first Mays
building dedication ceremony on
September 16th various officials
attended the ceremony including James
Kim the founding president from the
Pyongyang University of Science and
Technology and members of the delegation
he brought with him to celebrate the
completion several speeches were
delivered at the ceremony after dr. Kim
was officially installed as post
co-president the whole delegation took a
tour of this newly constructed campus
well that
shows there two schools without
explanation of young beyond university
of science technology we call they used
without understanding we used it's hard
to explain the pushed which is in
Pyongyang Pyongyang University of
Science Technology so I try to connect
his post and used the word I'm going to
use is a dream one person's dream
becomes his no vision and lifetime
vision makes him work on such as yum yum
University of science technology so Kim
Jin Young one person's dream become the
rest of us especially working for
somebody else's success that's the main
reason we are there and that can be
explained by the unconditional love
toward the people there so later on I
would say why we do this in North Korea
to help the people there and youngji is
right above where that red God is and
also this is at about 24 years ago when
dr. King was embodied by so Chinese just
group to Beijing and he met but group of
young you know adults and he realized
that he need more good vehicle to teach
youngsters like a school so in that
region of young beyond history school in
a place really nobody thought about and
he built a school and in five years the
school head of shape and starting a
school in 99
- then in 1993 become a junior college
level the 1996 four-year college and you
can imagine about hundred people now
gathered there
some of them have a vision of the school
becoming like this in 17 years so right
now the school used has about eighteen
hundred undergraduate students and so
far about 3,000 graduates out of this
school and out of there about four
hundred students are advanced for their
degrees so they some of them in the
United States some of them in the Europe
and some of them in Korea out of that
about okay let me go back this community
in used right now 13 countries faculties
come from over 200 faculty members and
with their family 500 faculty you know
foreigners in the one location we are
happy family with the students and even
exchange students within the China and
some of our graduates got their PhDs and
a master's degree then came back to the
school to join us as a faculty member
there are about 20 used alumni working
with us as a faculty and another 20
working as a administrative staff so
that we feel very good about it so this
dream continues on to Pyongyang again
this is to help that you know people
as you heard that this project became
north and south korean cooperative
project and it was illegally operated
and with much you know difficulties the
buildings are done and ready to accept
the students right now we're gonna start
with engineering school and business
school and also school of a global
education when it you know fully in
operation graduate study will be around
six hundred students and undergraduate
will be around 2000 and but initially
this spring we will start with sixty
graduate students and 150 undergraduate
students in three schools and faculty
members eventually would be 250 from all
of the world but initially around 40 to
50 this year teaching language will be
English that's something I want to
underscore that and this school is
different from the other universities in
in North Korea such as internet will be
available for the students and faculty
members so upper top right side is aware
the used is the left bottom this web
post will be the school was designed by
Chungnam concho which is a reputable
company in South Korea which designed
the Incheon International Airport which
is pretty good design know I was told
out of this nice buildings the phase one
consists of these seventeen buildings
is completed and will be used for first
phase of class just you know quick
history of the buildings how we went up
and right now he's ready and ready for
students coming in by the way do you see
the apartment behind the school
that's where southern part of up you
know I'm talking about yeah between the
buildings you see the what you call that
about those buildings that were 25 30
stories of apartments which showing the
skyline of a southern part of opinion so
in September last year group over people
from all over the world join the that
building dedication ceremony as you saw
tape cutting and it was published in
their official newspaper so the school
is official in North Korea and also
internationally the reason this is
significant moment was so far I've been
working on the six and a half years you
know I was asked is it gonna be really
in operational after we complete the
building it will be taken away by the
North Korean so why you do that that
question really brought me but finally
you know North Korean came out and
saying this school is an international
school and President Kim was installed
as a operational president that shows
the world this is not their school this
is international school in addition to
that we are reapply for EA our export
regulation it as administration is the
right word
your ei are to Commerce Department to
make that more complete application we
asked a North Korean to make sure this
is international school so they were
told this is one of international school
and all the equipment we are bringing in
inside of the school will be property of
international community and if there's
any question misuse then you can come in
and inspect anytime will cooperate so
that is the spirit of the school the
school now we say this could be
different from the rest of the
universities inside of North North Korea
whereas we tried and we have a track
record of making used different from the
rest of the Chinese universities in
three areas practicality and creativity
and global minded so outcome is honest
sincere and the students alumni with a
global sense so they are very good at
working with others and international
community
so with that you know track record we
are going to go in and teach them in
North Korea on the register will be two
plus three meaning that two years
undeclared majors and three years major
area and graduate students will learn
one plus 2 system one you know
emphasis on English and basic science
than two years in their majors so three
years ago eight and five years in
undergraduate that's what we're going to
start with one more time teaching
language in graduate school is a fully
English
and great undergraduate we will teach
them one year very accelerated English
courses in the first year then second
third so that they can be taught by
English and third and fourth year
schools for three years schools will be
the one which we're going to start with
information and communication technology
and industry and management and
agriculture and food and life science
industry management is their tongue of
MBA but it not only MBA they ask us to
teach trade and you know tariff and
finance and banking and all those so we
are very excited about that and every
culture again you know we want to focus
on to be the people there so there is
our emphasis on that information
technology they need help outside help
especially you know South Korean friend
and brother and sisters they want to you
know get on the industry which they will
help
so not only the school we also designed
techno park like a Silicon Valley
eventually
so that South Korean and US companies
can come in in that campus so our
students can go the work there and also
that the businesses can utilize all
those highly educated people in
Pyongyang so we want to use the school
as a gateway for both sides
you know business and research centers
and all of the world can use this
Pyongyang University of Science
Technology as a gateway go in and work
with the people inside and also inside
you know opportunity can work with
outsiders through this campus and
facilities to make it happen we want to
make this school and techno Park as a
special district the district special
district concept is nothing new it is
guaranteeing the free in and out of
people and materials and information no
further down the road anything
invented or you know you know produced
the IP intellectual property has to be
guaranteed so this special district
concept has been communicated and in
principle agreed with them and so we are
looking forward to have this you know
special district right how to proceed
participate and we need a no prayer
partners and also financial partners for
the equipment and you know operational
costs and also educational partners such
as a volunteer work and also faculty
members this is something which I am
know coming here for we are looking for
a long term faculty member
spending two or three years in there but
short term meaning the one semester
which is four months or visiting
scholars of one month or two weeks or
even a day no that is a visiting scholar
even short-term if four months is that
not tough fun you know working people
like you probably to have a joint you
know lecture team so to two plus two
months type arrangement can be made so
if there's anybody interesting certainly
you know yeah yeah or contact us this
school took a lot of materials this
bricks twelve and a half million bricks
signifies how difficult it was and you
know with many reasons we had to bring
the bricks from China you know one piece
of brick costed about twenty cents but
after seven times of uploading
downloading from trucks and trains and
when it arrived at the site it became
dollar twenty cents so that is once you
know example of how difficult it was
however we ended up working with that
you know just people they are North
Korean soldiers but now I would say
their physical condition is really not
that don't fit that battle really type
saying yeah this their height is about
my shoulder and they look like about
1415 years old
boys and girls but actually they are 25
26 years old or thirds and according to
what you know some study it says it will
take another sixty years to have equal
physical conditions between South and
North Korean you know boys that is a
really sad story I always just remind
you that
recent the Haiti earthquake you know
this tragedy I was really shocked by the
you know the magnitude and the number of
people affected and I was moved by the
the way the world you know just try to
help them that was really good
but at the same time he reminds me of
Ethiopia and Africa a few years of back
now they were you know about same
conditions and all the community tried
to help them but it's ongoing
you know tragedy but there is a you know
one country a lot of people suffering
for some reason but we don't hear about
it we forgot about it
it's been over 60 years you know and
they made the earth this malnutrition
for generations and really this visible
and that's why we want to help the
people and that's why we are doing this
this picture is the same you know
workers it reminds us why we're doing
this do you see the bottom right corner
to soldiers wear the jacket the winter
jacket Don jacket really won't nice
manufactured by the creator of used that
Chinese University those great students
really loved President Kim and no matter
what he does their support and this
particular interpreter happened to me
she she just donated 800 copies of her
jackets for the good cause of helping
neighboring country brother and sisters
when he brought this 800 you know copies
really warm in nice jacket
giving to them and
made us common say you've been so good
and we appreciate that and even your
brother and sisters in China sending
this for you
I remember do the good job build this
school right because this is your school
I'm just quite sure some of them had
that you know thing appears in their
heart this is their school and when we
opened the school I'm sure I will see
many of them say yes I was there I got
the trip of years and your love yeah we
felt that I hope many many of those this
young soldiers would come yes this
school the city school and why education
and why North Korea and why science
technology past six over sixty years
we've been trying to help them by food
clothing and medical help and so on it
is necessary and we should keep doing
that but also it is Angeles you know
vicious circle we like to teach them how
to fish not only giving them fish and
education is very essential and we
experienced that in China that made
people changed and change their lives
and they become motivated and they
become the leader of their own family
and society and so on and another
example is Korea became very good
country South Korean became you know
very good country because of the
education educational institute which
you know those missionaries came in
early days
Peter to school and hospital and so on
so I think we owe them so much on that
great vision of school made the people
educated in right way so in addition to
all those humanitarian aids we like to
start this school so that not only teach
them the knowledge but also share the
you know our experience in the world
with them so that they can be a good
partner with the rest of the world when
they when the time comes such as north
and south unified and we should have
somebody who can communicate with the
South people or Western people
that's our goal of this school and
science technology why science
technology it's kind of a sensitive
issue certainly North is capable of
making nuclear bomb and missiles but
area of teaching
we certainly want to help the people so
the agriculture and the basic science
including IT and there's a certain grade
of knowledge which we all know
commercial grade versus military grade
and I'm a mechanical engineer working
the nuclear power plants so I know the
difference between nuclear power plant
and atomic bomb and I'm not capable of
making atomic bomb but I can teach a
nuclear power reactor and design and
that commercial you know usage of it
that's where we're coming from and IT
industry IT knowledge can be useful
weaponry thing however the professors we
have not in their area of expertise and
so on but we like to help them to be
able to work with the rest of the world
and we like to
use their highly educated people working
with us so that we can be a partner in
the you know earthly village community
questions we have about 15 minutes left
and also wanted to invite you guys to
stay afterwards for lunch if you want to
join doctor to get a couple of us thing
behind and we also have Mike and Neil
from the Trina compliance team question
about well it's North Korea as an
individual where as a Googler is it okay
for me to participate you know they'll
give you sort of a general guideline
what am I just add one more thing people
I forget cuz I forget this project we've
been reporting everything you know
regular basis to US government as in
fact I was in DC right before that
snowstorm meeting u.s. US government
state state Department officers and also
senator and cup our US congressman and
those people make sure that what we are
doing is legitimate in legal terms and
we've been reporting everything what
we've been doing quite regular basis at
least once a year so and also as I said
any equipment we are bringing in should
be regulated by EA are okay where the
money come from
mostly from the grassroot type you know
mostly Christians in the u.s. and South
Korea and all over the world one thing
in I've been working in North Korea past
six and a half years and I sometimes I
got this comment
you Christians are quite crazy however
we trust you they say we've been dealing
with so many different type of people
but Christians are only trustworthy
people who delivers what they say so
that's how they see us even though we
have a different idea and different you
know goal but uh that's how we they know
who we are and they know our goals and
the common ground is we want to help the
people there and we believe education is
something can achieve not only just bit
in a small area but broad basic you know
good cause
okay I'm great to take students we do
not get involved
selecting people students just like
China China or so why don't you come
over here and ask a question again and
China is China older student take that
SAT type test and by the score they
apply then government will decide who
they will go so in China we in turn
interview or we don't get it anything
involved we just get the students and we
teach them same thing will happen in
North North Korea they will do their own
you know selection process and we will
receive okay
like or there's a transparent process or
I don't know but one thing is that in
you know February they do have a period
but SAT type test for three days seven
subjects and all the parents go crazy
I can see that it's because that the
result of that test will be deciding
factor for their lives whether they go
university or working place or a
military service so they are very
desperate on that you know testing
that's alright yes participants will
encounter after going and participating
in north korea genetic for us um so
we're taking questions from here first
and then you can ask okay so the
question was for the volunteers who we
want to volunteer so the question was
for the volunteers
what's the administrative like these are
process like or anything else any
security issues without coming back are
there are numerous which would be
flagged apart
okay not at all that's why we've been
reporting and we've been informing our
government and even I checked with our
government say is it okay for me go in
and out for doing this project and I was
told that US government doesn't have any
concern on individual going for their
own cause not you know anything against
the you know US policy and so on so
going for doing this project there is
okay and as I said to make it more
secure and safe we are promoting that
idea of a special district they will
make the visa process more simple that's
what we are looking for so far any US
citizens the visa process takes about
four to six weeks and I would say from
my experience being there safe know is
it safe to go there when I come back to
the Bay Area I have to concern about you
know earthquake is it safe to be here I
want to get out of this place as soon as
possible out of mind being in North
Korea for the that safety concern you
know how many times I forgot but past
six and a half years about a month once
a month type but it is getting more
often than April and on I will be there
in a permanent
going to South Korea after having been
to North Korea issues no no no so North
Korea does not stamp your passport okay
is there any knowledge about whether
these students after they've graduated
will be allowed to work internationally
or okay so the question is the graduates
aren't they able to work internationally
or not I guess since the school hasn't
opened yet
I think it's TT beads will answer but
then you can comment on the Chinese
University right it's yet to be seen but
China in China used we do have a
exchange student program with about 25
colleges in in the South Korea and us so
we exchange students a semester basis
and also after graduation they go for a
greater study in all the countries there
is our hope you know we haven't come to
that point yet but in say our three five
years students you know freely exchange
and go abroad not only the students but
also professors can go you know as
exchanging professors that is our dream
not got any indication from from the
government or the
the higher-ups as to whether suspension
I don't want to do that
no fish okay
other than us going in you know you know
do a lecture is there any other things
that we can help you know to help you
don't help what you're doing and also
let's say if we can travel to North
Korea for products like a week or two
for a quick lecture when is the best
time for us to go yeah not only at the
regular lectures are we organizing
number one international conference of
certain subject and you can join there
and also we have a ite program we have a
seminar series of seminars as an
introduction to the course and in that
we are inviting many frontrunners or
experts in the world so in that class we
will have a lot of different you know
wide range of you know experts in that
class and also I would encourage no
Google employees have a group just to
visit us and see us and also we will
have sort of a one hour special lecture
to the students that's what we are
hoping in China every Friday 3:00 to
5:00 we will have the guest speakers
from variety of you know
backgrounds students see the world
through the speakers like students see
the world through me me living with them
actually the students and faculty
members living in the same campus
in China and they visit us very freely
we almost like live like a family and
that's how we interact and that's how
they see the world through us so I don't
know I did I answer your question this
time I rather say best time is school
time and best time you know to meet your
you know recover any time is the best
time one thought one thing is summer
vacation we plan to have in China during
summer session all the regular faculty
members don't take any classes it is all
for the outsiders so all the outsiders
come in and have a classes for four
weeks to five weeks that's where the
students meet Outsiders so if you can
come in summertime for four weeks
they'll be great if you can come in or
if one week that's also fine and if you
can come only or three days that's fine
too
so just come and visit us a certain year
we like to have equipment right now we
need computers and desks and chairs and
in a basic you know kitchen equipment
for making food and so on so yeah
certainly we need your help support
donations and just ask your family and
brother and sisters actually when I talk
this to my church friends a couple of
months ago Christmas time there was a
mood about yeah why don't you just give
a Christmas present so someone who we
don't know but that's such a real help
so ended up getting you know our family
family or for we donated four computers
so that we're going in so nowadays I
believe
so how do they go about doing this
initiative any resistance especially
opening up what was the call tank no
okay
I cannot tell the exact but history will
tell us later on but it's my you know as
you know assessment is that since the
Eastern Bloc collapsed in 1989 about 20
years ago North Korea doesn't have any
of their brothers you know exist anymore
to send the students so my observation
is that there's a big vacuum in their
faculty you know demography and they've
been watching this school in China used
for a long time that in the beginning
they objected having this school in the
backyard of their country but later on
they said they saw young beyond universe
of science technology you know we do not
object any of that socialistic country
is a policy or anything rather we
encourage the students be more patriotic
and love each other and even encourage
them to be a communist party member so
seeing all this they realize that we are
not against that government we
therefore the people and the good cause
and actually help them to advance their
career and life and all those things so
it is them to ask us to come in and
build this school same thing in China so
why not so we are there but my you know
rationale probably they want they figure
out instead of sending their students to
abroad which they don't have any control
and some of them you know have a
different result than what they expected
now they asked us to come in and inside
of this fence they have a better control
over us and the students so that that's
what I kind of speculate that I don't
know but we will see how it happened so
even just a filtered internet access
will be a great thing to start with okay
we don't get everything at once even
China the first classes were monitored
by the official monitors sitting back
with a note but it has progressed quite
a bit so the real you know good thing is
internet access for the students that is
promised and it may not happen overnight
but no matter what the fiber optics was
installed from the school to the nearest
earth and actually I wanted to show you
some pictures
and this is our conference room with
this two screens so somewhat like what
we have over here so it is a remote
learning center and conferencing video
conferencing capability which you need
internet access and that's what we will
get okay okay
yeah so a couple questions first of all
you are talking about sending computers
to install it by politics
is there any problems with the sanctions
or is there any restrictions that are
imposed on couche with regards to the
functions of the u.s. asked to North
Korea and the second question would be
is there you know we're talking about
the special form of visa for people
going on first so I wasn't sure if you
are more lenient outdoors on being
detained by the North Koreans Authority
and
is that a possibility and the third
question is if that's all satisfied if
everything's alright on so that'll be a
question for a university but is there
anything living in US legally of this
perspective like to say opening up
something secondly is there any chance
of being detained are there any
restrictions for individuals
okay equipment certainly they are you
know certain equipment not allowed to go
into that country so that's what ei R
stands for and some of them are
applicable and some of not and computers
not all some you know low-tech computers
can go in but high-tech computers and
servers which can be can about dual use
say a military use you know they are
restricted so we are not bringing those
things so the answer is yes so we are
very sensitive to make that decision and
what was the other one
if you do anything illegal in the
country that you can be detained
okay so I'm not going to go in anymore
and what I still do okay yeah first
thing and just say check with us before
you do anything from the Google scam
from a Google standpoint as an
individual you know do what you want but
I advise you to check with somebody
before you go off and do something there
are heavy sanctions on pretty much
everything so even a lot little
equipment that you think you know this
is pretty low level we we have to given
the the goal of it we have to apply for
a license and maybe there's a
possibility to get it but even a
low-level computer is still control to
North Korea unfortunately because it
still is dual-use items so but we'd be
happy to work with people to see what we
could do about getting things there if
Google decided to want to donate things
like that there are other restrictions
on individuals there's there's something
called a deemed export rule so that if
North Korean citizen was in this country
there'd be limits on what could be
shared with that person it's true of any
country but because the controls are so
tight North Korea
there really are strong limits on
could be shared and likewise going there
there's certain limitations on what
technical data can be shared there are
some exceptions related to education and
then anything that's publicly available
but again I'd advise checking with
there's a export at google.com alias
we'd be happy to work with anybody who
wants to share just to be to be sure
that we don't run into any issues so
okay okay okay Gmail citizenship in the
US government the Waterbar other
restriction about the citizenship for
example like a Korean leadership when
Korean government because I'm Korean and
I work actually we had a you know
agreement in principle or this the
faculty will be coming from one third
internationally one third from South
Korea one third
Korean foreigners so South Koreans will
consist of around one third and another
one third will be Korean foreigners like
me US citizen and another one third just
like the rest of the world so this is
International University so South
Koreans will go but for the moment there
is a uneasiness between South and North
so for the moment I yeah South Koreans
may not go this for artists April but
eventually you know okay we hope they
will come soon okay I've never seen any
Kelly K P so the website is kr which is
South Korea site which we will get you
know we will have information for you
and we'll get your interest logged in
then we'll get you know notify so that
we can communicate and I do have no
email address of that kr and okay P but
I don't you know communicate easily we
you know using that so right now let's
stick with the what kr and the other one
so okay okay it's a North Korea under
complete embargo by the US government is
it legal to send that equipment at all
from the u.s. to north beyond you want
to come and steal my and I will just
take one more question after this and
then can go to launch and you guys can
stick around I wish there was a simple
answer but the best answer is probably
just to say guess you know pretty much
any equipment
be restricted going to North Korea
there's actually different levels of
embargo so Cuba Iran and Sudan or the
tightest level and then North Korea and
Syria are just a little bit above that
so but for all practical purposes pretty
much anything you should check first
anything would need a license there's
exceptions that's why we apply for a
license from Commerce Department that ei
R so that's what we do okay so you come
at this right and he's uh you know
definition is right and that's what we
are working on we are we have applied
that we have been looking at for a long
time and we are complying with US law
and international law is there a better
way
oh how do we get to North Korea okay
we're gonna assume that's the question
how do we what's the best way to get
best way to North Korea North Korea
Pyongyang there's a flight between
Pyongyang to Beijing and Pyongyang to
Shenyang from Xianyang to Pyongyang it
takes only 40 minutes flight and Beijing
one hour and 40 minutes and so it is
matter about you coming from this Bay
Area to Incheon then Shenyang and
conn-young is the shortest route or you
go to Beijing then go to Pyongyang from
Beijing is another route so I don't
think it will take $5,000 unless you
both of you going
no no we were looking for the the land
you know passage between South and North
Korea one day it will be done because I
didn't know but I realized that between
Seoul and Pyongyang is only one you know
130 miles away and the freeway is pretty
good and so you take only 2 hours but
right now from Seoul to Xianyang than
Pyongyang so one day that passage would
be open can you just read it yourself I
don't think anyone's here who can answer
that question and that's a more
complicated question
so let's pursue an individual level
first and then if you guys are really
psyched about this and you guys can
really email me I'm if you know maybe we
can get something going but at this
moment nothing official let's just keep
it informal any last little teaglass
comment or question from the room and
then we'll go to lunch okay I just have
a comment I've been to know for
everybody known for it for a long time
many many organizations are doing a lot
of
is there way in the middle of finishing
up a very large hospital it is donated
by the church in Korea in the middle of
it was you know as a beautiful campus in
North Korea and the whole idea is we
want to love on them and you know I
think Christine knows and I'm not a
communist and so I want to say thank you
dr. Kim and dr. kim ki-young for the
amazing vision and the most amazing
miraculous great foods you have to be
able to finish that building it's a
miracle
thank you so much for their hard work it
was a comment than it's a miracle that
doctor came and you were able to make
headway into North Korea some conspiracy
theories like our dr. Kim and I don't
know dr. Kim both dr. Kim's are the
agents of North Korea and you know
that's not the case you know but anyhow
let's end up that let's end on that note
and go to lunch thank you dr. Kevin
