strongly a picture of the day - sit here
so today's going to be - toxin one the
same price which is nothing so I'll be
alternating images of the best images of
our universe my opinion particularly
those for the past year with the strange
and richer history of the Astronomy
Picture of the Day so I at I am this
person but I run I am at Michigan
Technological University it's fine I'll
give a two-second plug which is a
smaller high tech university and also
salutes what Michigan it's a traumatic
engineering and science and surprisingly
good beside you know when I went there
and even care that when I'm up there but
there's a lot of pretty geeky campus
actually for the second campus after
account and like teaching Logan yeah
retirement so this is the abstract so he
tell me that all now so you should have
read that already so everybody can do
that here's the body should you read
that here we go so it was and so he was
rumored about there was this new program
first it sounds like a waste of time
sound like you might not do and what
you're about for though was AG but
people kept saying it was pretty cool
when I understand what mosaic was so so
I went there and I worked around and I
still didn't understand what all the how
old me was about but I did find to my
delight that
my wasn't invest ttk you know some MST
mystery signing 3,000 and it was Joel
Hodgman was all he's on it was really
about quote like and then I began to
understand the power of mosaic okay so
this is the best of all time yes it is
quite subjective so I chose this I'm
guilty and your favorite space image if
it wasn't loaded I apologized already
okay so I'll jump to this one this is a
my recognize it this is the earth and oh
did I think are described by Time
magazine as a picture of the century or
the last century was taken by the Apollo
8 spacecraft that's actually where I
live in the moon in 70s and here you see
the marble which is everyone you've ever
known has was there and that's sometimes
called the Big Blue Marble it was one of
our early images so here's the idea
here's the name that we gave it here's
the credit advanced best I could do and
here's when it when it appeared so hey
pod stands for sorry fiction today of
course 1995 this was a hosted on
December 25th ranked Democrat so if you
want to know more about this image you
just go to that in pod Asian so how do
you find it why'd you start one most one
was the first picture of the day okay
that was on June 1st picture that should
I repeat that can people hear your
question their starters did it I can
hear a bit okay so uh June 16 I've got a
bit of a history in there June 16 1995
was I was our first in mission and so I
will get it if I if I skip over more
than history coming and I'll go back and
do it so first some even prior history
for that so Jerry phenomena I had a
really great boss Jay Norris and so we
had a research group that NASA cons
let's enter we were researching
particular again reverse which are some
of the most powerful explosions the
universe and so we were happily doing
that but Jay was um Jason relatively
young guy but he's interested in
retiring he wanted a retirement ranch so
he bought land I believe it went it's in
Idaho I don't he went at first bought
land in Colorado but it's an item now
and so he would go away and don't his
match for like a month at a time usually
in the summer and then he would come
back with pictures of this open land
that had thrush on it he was ordering
logs and stuff like that but he was
building his retirement home from
scratch
year by year is really interesting about
I haven't done so myself but he when he
was away we were sitting around at NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center with
relatively powerful computers out NASA
Goddard he's a big place some people
might think Google is and people sitting
around in just a small office complex
but actually it's a campus so nASA has
many campuses as you know NASA Ames is
right here in NASA Goddard is a big
campus no 30
more than 30 buildings and so we're
sitting in you know one small part of
one building but still we had relatively
powerful computers there we had deck
alphas and we had what was considered to
be an unbelievable connection to the
Internet you did not have to dial phone
and hit the phone and put it in there in
here dude we didn't have that it was I
guess 71 lines and it was essentially
instant Internet as far as we can tell
we didn't didn't even know that existed
anywhere else so but well before that
back in 1994 some of the graphs we were
marched into the computers that were
sitting on our desks so we decided to
compute digits of irrational numbers
just for fun so the reason for that is
because we didn't Jerry but I want my
office me and I who are interested who
created a pod together I have some very
strange office conversations and one is
that
is there an encyclopedia of all the
information in the universe and so why
would there be well let's say you go
into a library and you say the first
book on the first shelf you give that
the letter you just if it's a yo one or
give it ASCII codes and then you they
make that book into one long ASCII code
then you take the next book you make
that along a secure you just put it
right next to it one so you have these
long screens of digits so then you take
the entire library you have this really
really rough on the stream of digits now
you look at that and you said now that's
obviously not the most compact stream of
digits this is an inefficient way to
have all the information in the library
so you can say well let's start if
there's lots of spaces in a row I'm
going to make this shortcut there's
we're only using letters the numbers
from 1 to 26 so we're going to make
better use of there's any number of ways
ultimately when you get to altima image
ultimate data compactification it looks
to people like it's just random so to
the uninformed i totally random digits
look the same as all the information in
the universe digits so where do you find
a lot on the stream of digits so we
decided that pi have a long spear digits
and we're going to look at the digits of
pi and see if it's a unit encyclopedia
university' so we started looking at
that and seeing if there's obvious
solemn repetitions and non-rem that's
another debate between us to us what's
the best random number generator because
obviously the random number generators
you're gonna Angela is obviously poor
wouldn't it be cool he found the digits
of pi to have non-random if there was
there's to these win-win-win situation
in the sense that either we found them
non-randomness
and that would be cool because pi hats
on and those before we found that it was
completely random then we'd be able to
use them as random numbers where we
found some way to find the keys and we
would be able to decode all the
information in the universe so we never
found out that it was unusually hard to
compute the digits of pi and there are
people out there with mouse key brothers
in
alum me who already did it and they were
making big illusions that there were
there were already patterns in there but
that we decided that the arctangent
functions were too difficult to generate
lots of digits but he was a lot easier
so also the square root of numbers digit
single integer numbers is a lot easier
to just scream out those digits and so I
started steaming out that Indus and Joey
started checking event to our almost
surprise we set the record for the
square root of two and number E you know
within a few months so we did eat you
ten million digits we never found any
any non-randomness so we don't know what
all the information is the universe
unfortunately is right now then J came
back insurance because I was ranch okay
so this is a picture of moon jumping
down to the other part the top the
Apollo astronauts landed on the moon
several times starting in 1969 the last
lunar mission of Apollo 17 and the moon
is can call the magnificent desolation
it's not really colorful it's not like
the Google logo with all these colors
it's almost it's quite blind it's sort
of brownish grey but somehow even in
those colors
it's obviously alien and somehow they
notice it and it was called that by
several the astronauts so here you see
Esther harrison schmitt with the lunar
rover on the last mission to the moon it
would mission to the moon for the
majesty of the mountains
okay so jenny was going to go away again
and build his ranch so that was cool so
Jeremy and I may be darkness are
speculative discussions and we decided
that we're thinking of ways we could
things we could do with this great
connection to the web that allowed us to
see the mst3k site for instance in
practically instantly so we decided that
one thing we could do is we could
designate popular websites they were
coming on with your favor this is the
golden site blank Records it's so
popular
you get a gold designation or this is
the silver site or a platinum site but
then we decided that we're not really
well connected enough to that we don't
how why would people believe what we say
how would we know that they went gold
other than thinking gee that seems to be
popular we just weren't connected over
two ignorant of the way the web work to
really go that way another idea that we
know about astronomy because we're a
service what about if we answer
astronomy questions people could send
them in my astronomy question mr. Lee
side that's just too hard he wanted
something easier because we were
inherently lazy this is our son I saw
his unusually constant stars is taken
from the Soho observatory that don't
orbit the Earth and continually monitors
the Sun time you think there's you can
see the latest images of them in every
few minutes this is a huge there's a lot
about something there's no the Sun is
unusually stable because if it wasn't so
stable it would be very hard for life to
develop on earth even though it's stable
it's kinda - cauldron bubbling of heat
it's not on fire there's not a lot in
fact that that position of oxygen going
on but it's constantly throwing off
promises and stuff like that like this
and so here you see does the active area
the province the earth can easily fit
inside this exceedingly clock and so one
of the great advances in modern
technology allows us to monitor the Sun
and try to understand the Sun so who
cares you understand the song as long as
it's constant and it comes up tomorrow
who are good but then again if the Sun
is now coming into a period of solar
maximum and they're worried that there
could be solar flares a lot more
powerful than the one you're seeing
there that could knock out communication
satellites and even cause you know power
grids to go down also astronauts in
orbit get splashed radiation and that's
not fun
so there's good reasons to try to
understand the song okay about this time
in Medicaid ninety five ninety historic
art everybody was including Jerry and me
was receiving email attachments that
said look at this cool image isn't this
cool
what it appeared to us what's happening
was that although there were press
releases there seemed to be a lot of
images that were going around the web
unexplained and we found that annoying
wouldn't it be a better web if when you
found images they came with an
explanation written by someone who might
know something about it so we didn't
know everything about all these daunting
images but we're professional
astronomers we know some about it and we
can we can research them in their way so
one of the motivations is let's not make
what the web throw up in your head let's
make the web into a better place where
things are explained also another
motivation for this is that I had a
graduate student friend when I was in
grad school at the University of
Pennsylvania in the 1980s and he had his
own slide collection so when people go
off on he just Ronna me classes many
times you want to show in your Kobach
slide projector you would get this
circular carousel so you put them on
there and click and the first one would
then get stuck and you have to give them
something in there here's something to
get it out but eventually get working
after half the class is over and you
would see these images of whatever was
topic or background emissions of Earth
it's things like that well they're kept
being new images but my friend Jeff
Goldstein in the next office had the
best light touch and he would spend time
creating this great site collection so
after a while even the professors at
Penn would have to go up to him
prompting saying Jeff you have that
really great slide on the Saturn and
stuff kid I just borrow that for my
class and he would take it a little bit
of a shall we go and pull it down and
say this one oh sure you can have it but
wouldn't be great if we didn't have to
grovel to to two people to find the best
images they were just more or less on
lines that was another of the underlying
thought that went into into
not okay another the greatest images of
all time this is the pillar sometimes
called the pillars of creation so stars
are being formed in the Eagle Nebula so
you can't sit there and watch a star
being formed it just happens way too
slow you might get what a lot to start
exploring the supernova or another but
here the reddish stuff are stars so you
can look in the pillars at the end so
the stars actually destroy the pillars
as they're formed but things happen on a
very slow timescale millions of years
although they do destroy them by usually
they're the winds the light from the
star so the very massive stars is so
energetic it's in the ultraviolet range
many times it just rips apart the dust
and the molecules there and the wind
pushes it out and then explosions from
them can actually rip these things apart
so our Sun was probably born in
something like this and these things
dissipate and eventually the stars that
are formed have no clear memory of it
remember okay so so back in June 16 well
after some discussions is how we can on
Jerry and I started he pod so I guess it
sort of started as discussions one time
in our office and also at lunch so on
June 16 I posted the first one and then
on June 17 there is not one and there's
not one on June 18 cuz you're busy doing
stuff you got your projects they got
your research stuff to do this is a
additional superfluous not not mandated
so but Jerry and I would talk and we
would have watched together and after
several lunch discussions it still
seemed like good idea so many times
people with me good ideas that sounds
good one day put something up the next
day not as good sometimes what was I
thinking
but this one continued to seem like a
good idea
several days later so so we kept it
going and I think the first day of the
Keeney was go
was 20 or 21st and so it's been doing
every day since June 21st 1995 which
raises the question is it one of the
longest-running blocks to which many
people who are about a pot say it's not
a blog let's stop that I don't consider
this a lot they think a blog is
something where people talk about what
happened to them yesterday or something
in the news and it's very personal so
some people might consider that a pod is
really not about us at all we don't
mention ourselves but um so we've been
going so some people though do consider
a blog because the concept of blog which
was coined after we started has
undergone revisions in several ways some
people do every now and then on our
Associated site discussion site gastrous
well we had a vote and I think non blog
the blog in it that was close that was
about two years ago so the site also
looks pretty much the same today as it
did back in 1995 all this new technology
to create web pages and stuff like that
has come out but we have a dollar sells
if almost none of it so a little bit
like for Volkswagen so the Volkswagens
look the same but it's still getting to
there so what we're interested in is is
the image everything else is so much
secondary doesn't have to be fancy we
frequently get enough from people who
spit on us didn't want to spruce up our
site for free we'll give you a dark
background we'll make it you can slide
your finger or whatever what we do
though back in 95 you couldn't Center
things the center command and exist in
HTML but when that came out we made
these that we now Center them
so on this is the nearest galaxy to our
Milky Way galaxy our Milky Way looks a
little bit like this is the analyses
this was taken not by professional
astronomer but by a physician currently
amateur astronomy has undergone an
explosion due to the ability of
the first discharge trouble device the
CCDs and CMOS devices to become
relatively inexpensive and be hooked up
with relatively large telescopes and
Surnow and amateur who have a little bit
of money on the order of a few thousand
dollars can take images that couldn't
have been done when they've had started
so this is just about a most spectacular
images and this is actually really wide
for professional telescope most
professional telescopes see relatively
small fields of view the Andromeda
galaxy is relatively wide field of view
and but with amateur telescopes they can
just sit on this with their their modern
ccp's in there and just and let the data
come in and eventually get a really
fantastic image on my galaxy depends how
far out you want to go I'm not really
great with numbers some numbers I am but
many numbers all embarrassed and they
won't know I think it's about a degree
on this guy so the moon full moon degree
okay so the first day we did a pod hit
14 pages and I don't know how they'd
know one of the most frequent questions
used to get was won't you run out of
images people were concerned for us
you're just gonna run out and just keep
running the same one or something so
even when we started it we knew that the
Ranger series of NASA's Ranger program
which crashed things into the moon got
hundreds of thousands of images of the
lunar surface hundreds of thousands so
we didn't have to repeat we just have
the next
inner crater image here you see another
crater which is gray also slightly
different so we more in dangers
repeatedly doing that but there were
lots of images out there and so we were
estimating how many we do think you're
really worried about this so there's
more in danger than a pug could become a
little bit boring last diversity and it
would run out of images so we're keen to
make that
in 95 there was a list of new pages that
would come on the web and that people
would go there and see what's coming on
now
ohoo what major revisions might have a
webpage now so once we were announced on
that we were really key to do that we uh
we we RPGs went up into that to the
hundreds for that so also back then
people have ideas similar to our gold
and silver idea and they someone group a
business call themselves point
communications I don't know what
happened to that they're not the same
four point communications around today
they were designating the site's top
five percent of the web who remembers
that will never see the top five percent
picture so they we were lucky enough to
be doesn't it a top five percent we're
very proud of that time yeah we don't
really see that so much okay this is one
of the greatest images of all time again
this is uh looking back on the because
earth is not taken from our current
space issues is taken from the mobile
phone near space station and we are
seeing the black tape is actually total
eclipse looking down on it so it total
eclipse is a shadow so if you're
standing in the middle of this shadow
looking out you're seeing the moon
completely blocking the Sun you're in
the moon's shadow if you're on the edge
here then you see the moon blocking part
of the stalks so I used to I like to but
I teach class I like to bring this up
because it really helps people visualize
what an eclipse is you must imagine when
you show them this angle this is going
to sit across the earth feeling quickly
and if you're lucky you can see maybe a
couple minutes of totality it's sort of
a game people pretty much people try to
travel around the globe and try to see a
total eclipse of the Sun and you can
lose neck in it as well because you can
be calm it out okay so we've Jerry and I
have been going since we're past our
sixteenth year anniversary
early well after we started 95 we
decided to ask NASA what kind of
regulations would apply to our website
and they told us
that's not the people in the
administration of NASA and NASA Goddard
Space Flight Center close and that's not
something they can tell us because of
the world wide web is for scientists and
it's regularly unregulated so they don't
have time right so we just kept trying
now they have a lot of policy and
sometimes I try to apply to us and
eventually run after - but we like our
old-fashioned look we consider that
we're sort of grandfathered into
wearable you might have to go back on
that at some point so here's another are
the greatest images in long time this is
a people think this is an image from the
space shuttle or the space station but
that can't be because it's always night
and early night on half gear at one time
so this is taken by the DMS P satellites
defense meteorological OSP satellites
and they take pictures of the earth
pretty much a lot of the time and he can
stitch digitally stitched together those
images that where there were no clouds
it is night and then you put them
together you can see that there are
people here for instance and people
definitely turn on their lights at night
so you can fool you can turn their
lights off but it's interesting cuz it
gives people perspective as to where
they live on earth and how what's
populated and what's not this was an
email attachment phenomenon and actually
it was really good advertisement for a
pod ones who realized how many people
were attaching this to emails to put out
an image that actually told them about
our website is that was our best
advertising mechanism just attaching our
are our address and name to this email
attachment I don't know the people would
say you know oh look at this it's almost
a matter where you are in the world
you're looking to see where with when
you lit up on that on that image
sometimes you can see the eastern
seaboard the United States and wise can
see where in Western Europe it's pretty
good tens but up there are places that
are not lit up so if you go to Amazon
for instance you're not seeing
or likes center desert not lots of
people that and the end of Australia is
kind of empty as well so there's we have
a saturated places to live on the earth
okay so we would have to research some
of the images that they came out with a
press release that was good but we we
pretty much all the words on a pod come
from Jerry or me German or me so first
we tried to wonder the reigning search
engine that first was Veronica saying
remember
Veronica I guess is everyone know
everybody without this is search
audience so then people said oh we got
try web crawlers what car was indeed a
big improvement over that site yeah who
was good yeah who was when he first came
out with their strong thing is that they
were done by people that was their their
mechanism people are gonna create the
lists and they don't have to worry about
the machines Alta Vista I remember when
I sell that list it came out I was very
very impressed
I probably proclaimed the Jerry and
we're all simplicity that that is the
ultimate search engine that has pluses
it has minuses it's just great I don't
see how it can be improved so we've
reached the limit of search I told you
this is it so kiss Maya so obviously we
will come a time once again I was wrong
about something those things obviously
he's most so now I'm going to jump to
the current age of images for the best
images of 2011 expected okay so this is
a there are lunar eclipses most years
notes notes so this lunar eclipse that
was caught from Austria so we get images
from all over the world so here you see
the Sun Rise in Eclipse I'm not a part
of it so it's a partial solar eclipse
that's a tower in Austria today the upon
has evil it is now arguably one of the
most popular sites a most popular people
voluntarily translate a pot into your
most major languages so we get email
from somebody saying that I'm from some
country can i yeah so we allow them to
do it so long but we have as long as
they don't violate the image copyright
problem so that some people mistakenly
assume that all the images we run our
public domain images because we come
from a NASA laqad gov domain are that's
not true only by the copyright owners so
to use those in a commercial setting we
believe we don't have the right to give
that permission we need the copyright
owner's permission to do that so you
know if they are relatively true trans
translation of a pod and they don't have
a commercial advertising we allow them
to do it so now our most major languages
so I guess it's an oppressor many groups
other than the goal group that every
major university domain acces to say pop
every day as far as we can tell and in
June 2011 a pod made the front page of
David well we only keep log files or a
lot of files are kept for us of what a
pod is doing every now and then there's
some email that goes around that were
copied on that shows what different like
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center what
percentage we are from that and from
that we can ask to make that work
we don't very well also no other page
from NASA makes the front page big is
often commuters not that big is the
ultimate in determining popularity but
it since more than indication okay so
this year well this was first thing last
year
Saturn is doing something unusual
there's an unusual storm and as
developed I was first team I think
semper of last year there's a Rossini
vision that you have currently orbiting
Saturn is taking pictures of it you can
see this from the ground this was
discovered by amateurs with their great
equipment and is constantly being tracks
of its storm now the belt that goes
around the around the whole pilots
Center so it's interesting we want
unexpected and pal storm systems develop
and evolve is important for
understanding Saturn and its winds as
well as hurricanes and things like that
on earth there's no similar thickness as
a hurricane market so another things
going on in modern astronomy astronomy
changes our equipment so may if you
teach for instance calculus it's pretty
much the same every year however it
teach astronomy like I do many times you
constantly have to update what's going
on so this is an indication of what
happened just in this past year that
created is not in publish textbooks
those textbooks don't have a turnaround
this quick way so we have the Kepler
satellite that started taking data in
2009 that orbits the earth and Kepler
looks at many a small part of the sky is
like one 400 from the sky and looks for
Sun type stars and looks for eclipses of
sunlight or or like the you saw the moon
going in front of the Sun a little bit
ago if a pilot goes in front of a star
it becomes slightly dimmer and Kepler is
so sensitive that he can see that slight
dimming so you know how big it was and
how long it takes to go across and from
that you can determine that there are
other planetary systems so one of the
four fronts of research astronomy is
discovering what else is out there in
the universe discovering other planets
in the universe discovering whether
those planets have any life on them
hopefully we can find someone you can
talk to you on that but right now we're
in the stage where were just finding
planets so Kepler has the most
sophisticated system known how there is
a it's a six planet system now as it
appears our solar system down here for
comparison the central star is up there
the same these planets
tend to be bigger than we see in our
solar system years mercury they're
gentle and most of them are in star
derivative record one of the problems is
that in order to find things in the
order of the earth that takes longer see
things very zips around the Sun so fast
that you can see it go in front and you
can verify what's going on in the time
scale of you know months but something
that the earth DB years 2,000 years to
go around the star for it to verify
what's gonna want to be sure
so as time goes on Kepler hopefully will
be able to see more and more just
resolves eclipses okay who is a pod
audience so a pod is designed to be a
resource for students and potentially a
lot of how we get every University to
the main you have teachers who use this
with their class because they know that
astronomy is not like activists and they
like to keep things up to date and also
a lot of astronomy stories are in the
news and sometimes the news people get
it right and sometimes they don't go so
right however since we're professional
astronomers who are descriptions of it
are usually better than we have a lot of
links so it's and yet no advertising so
it's something that many teachers prefer
and so many professors teachers in high
school they're they will use our site
and so students know we consider that to
be sort of a base that hopefully will
continue on for years to come so Islands
we're gonna remain relevant to teachers
and students and it will be lots of
students learning about our site and
many of them continuing on even after
they they finish their class
our biggest group Skype is yes just
people who are just interested in the
sky many of them I used to say many of
our professionals with computers on
their desk that's confusion or so more
prevalent nowadays is there and
everyone's got they've got computers in
their pockets so we get that's our
biggest group but Bill tb7
but still our biggest group of
professional astronomers surprisingly
just about every professional astronomer
is sort of a pod that's seen it on times
either they're teaching or they need
some images or they just want to stay
out so we do have relatively quick
sometimes a quick turnaround cycle as I
was saying many of our images are
written before had a few days beforehand
and the images come in but many times we
can sometimes we'll go in the night
before if there's a very newsworthy item
and we will report on the item and we
will give our you know our opinion as to
as to oh we don't say it's our opinion
really that that it's useful and
interesting so what if I gave us when
the Cassini Huggins orbiter landed on
Titan we were sure to get that in the
very next day because that was a big
news item so whatever was plan for the
next day was just pulled push drops into
the future and we load up something
right then but huh
okay so in modern times we now can
monitor the Sun and tell that ever
before by the way that we could get it
back in the Sun there are actually
clever ways looking at the front of the
Sun and finding out where from the back
of the Sun but this is a more direct way
there is two satellites out there now
called stereo satellites and they are
drifting around the Sun so a picture up
to the center this is the son of the
earth is at the bottom the dataset
lights are essentially drifting as
you're good round the Sun and I've now
reached a point where there on either
side so they can see the entire side so
now if a flower occurs if there is some
kind of active region since we're coming
into summer maximum where there's lots
of activity on the side we're going to
be well situated to see these things
happen no matter where it happens on us
not now even as these two satellites go
behind the Sun there's still the burnt
part about the earth part so we still
have satellites around the earth and
have actually ground-based solar
observatories that see what's going on
so just this past year we develop the
capability to monitor the entire monitor
the entire Sun that's one thing it's now
2011 new era
okay because a supernova that was
probably unseen 40,000 years ago it is a
one evidence that sent us this amateur
astronomer and it's a new bastard the
wide images of the professional
telescopes don't do wide so well and you
can see that a supernova explosion is
tremendously your talent in this one
that's left a stay a neutron star in the
center so one of the things amateurs can
do is they can burn the fuel they can go
very deep and they can see many more of
the filaments and textures that weren't
so so visible before actually helps
science what do you mean by burning the
field they can just sit on it their
telescope can can just sit on the that
part of the sky for multiple day yeah
well it can be for multiple days yeah
and they could just keep building out
that image whereas a professional
Observatory would never have the time to
do that and what you do is you pick up
some things that people didn't know
we're there
so they substitute time for mirror Suns
yes yes a big bucket a big light bucket
a big mirror ultimately gives you this
it's like making Ryder late that he
gives you the chance to see deep
relatively quickly but if you can
stabilize and you look long enough you
can think of smaller telescope and
eventually collect the same number of
photons
okay so every day we do a new one
although that's not completely to work
people are sometimes surprised to find
ones that have been repeated in
particular we used to do both Saturday
and Sunday but now Joey seems to be
putting new ones in on Saturday that's
his reboot back
I completed Sunday Monday Tuesday ready
to believe us Thursday Friday Saturday
and we exchanged email to see who's
least busy you get to do Wednesday so I
almost always though I will do a rerun
on Sunday now cheating well maybe a
little bit but many people haven't seen
some of the bestest our languages
time moves at any one time is the most
readers we have our new so going a
couple years back into the the archive
and saying here something all that shows
a great image set they'd overlook by
much of our audience also we can show it
in a larger format because we've gone to
a larger and larger image formats as
time is on glass they can probably put
on the larger image in better detail and
we can also update the text if anything
new has happened and update the lengths
of a lot of lace godet
as time goes on so we can refresh it so
I actually think it has some utility so
why I'm the upper right of all the
impact pages were say written by a
professional astronomer which Jared
thinks we should delete but I think is
is an indication that a good
housekeeping side of approval for people
who don't know what to believe so
knowing that we're professionals in the
field that were perhaps less easily
fooled in some so might do thanks
so how what software do we use to create
the HTML typically that's VI which is an
editor MINIX so we just take the old one
and we load it up and we hit the
backspace command and we delete things
that were from an old way plot and we
type in the new stuff and we you know we
just it's like blown out of form really
hypertext is so uncomplicated that it's
the easiest to do it that way we're not
doing anything casting do use a set of
command as I said so actually I don't
Jerry doesn't most offense on the I
actually just use any generic word
processor I can find and then I uploaded
it and when I find my mistakes then I go
with VI and change those mistakes okay
so our hypertext is what we call that
link I used to call full web hypertext
the idea is to explain that when you
write writing and I project this can be
different than just writing text because
you know you can link to stuff so if I
say redshift if I'm just writing in text
I'm going to feel pressure to explain
what redshift is to the audience but if
I'm writing in hypertext I'm not showing
that pressure because I know I'm going
to wake
to a description of what hybrid morgred
shift isn't people can just click it so
what that allows our texts to be is more
system than compact which is good
because it really gives just a paragraph
on what and if you if you're interested
you go if you know stuff if you're
interested you just read that paragraph
and then you got so most people don't
read the paragraphs they just like the
picture the next people read the first
line we try to draw men or the but if
you read it then you can go to almost
arbitrary depth because you can start
following the links it can explain
things it can give you background they
can say that we didn't just make this up
look at this it's this is from a the
press release or something else and
we're not just making this stuff so a
while ago in the late 1990s fox news is
one of the people who had their own sort
of mirror would they would get
permission to run the copyrighted images
and so I went to visit them once and
they one person told me that they didn't
like they don't use full web hypertext
because if someone follows a link
outside your website you don't know
they're coming back so they were
concerned that we're losing people but
that's not our philosophy our philosophy
is we want the most informative
description with the most conservative
if they go away and come back well don't
come back well okay but we just want you
know each one of a little bit of a work
of art assess that we love the best
lines possible so here's the best way we
know to explain this although sometimes
we'll go for diversity if we just keep
getting on the same length a lot I find
strange coincidence is probably helping
us with Google rank okay okay so people
are joined hold the bottom of the world
for astronomical purposes they're
looking for among other things neutrinos
so they melt these holes actually
they're melters and they go down several
football fields they put
ask a ball sized light detectors in and
here you see one being lowered down and
the idea is that if there's a pass
which we know coming tides and you hit
something and it's going to cause blue
light Trent pop variation it wouldn't be
seen by these these optical detectors
and and then you would know that there
are neutrinos going by so one of the if
you look at the universe every way you
look at it you see a different universe
if you look at it visible light you see
stars if you look at an ultraviolet
light you see something different if you
look at an x-ray light you see something
a little different and it just all tells
you about our universe well if you look
at it a tree knows something really
different again so one thing is people
thought they would see a really bright
Sun but it turns out fun isn't anywhere
near as bright as they thought would be
in the trio that helped us understand
all about neutrinos and the standard
from the mental physics so now we're
hoping that things like the ice cube
collaboration which is nothing holes in
in an artifice we'll be able to see out
further than this on it has seen the Sun
and hopefully we'll be able to see
neutrinos from explosions like super
novae and gaba reverse and there's even
hopes that I could test exotic physical
concepts such as unseen to special
dimensions and faster than light travel
I think the most conservative hope is
for supernovae and they do it there
because the face is clear enough yes yes
it's very clear very clear eyes down in
Antarctica that's one of the best places
to find a t-rex - so you can go on an
expedition for an article we can get
honest oh well the other thing sign up
for this then you go skating across the
blue ice and it's still looking for any
change in the blue ice you can find
because any rock landed there probably
came from space and so they have rows of
cinema Bueller's going across oh there's
one right here yes okay so this past
year was the first time that a satellite
visited an asteroid to comment twice so
this is the Stardust next case craft
which went by this past year now in 2005
another spacecraft was
and it dropped an impactor around here
and the character we're trying to find
out how dense this is is there is this a
rubble pile or just loosely altogether
is it like our moon what's it like
so what chemicals are there also so
they're looking now they passed by a
team of agency differences from when the
attackers struck here and raised the
food and they're seeing I think some
differences but there's a lot of work to
be done
it was the notable thing is we're now
actually returning to comments and
seeing not only how the impact or change
it but when this thing went past the Sun
it it changed its appearance how how
radically refinished came for
appearances we go back south this is our
International Space Station conveniently
growing so even one solar panels there
are number of astronauts that are there
pretty much all the time so moving the
era of a growing international space
station ISS house this picture taken
from the space shuttle
almost I have one that's not okay so a
pug rejects about ten to one images
right now the original audience do you
think they're chosen mostly the most
important thing is a historical
importance if there is a historically
important image coming up some
spacecraft landed somewhere some new
image of the skies with some something
and it's needs to be run as part of the
historic archive what you know as a
species so even if it's fuzzy and
Technicolor blob not visually
spectacular would run after that you can
usually count
second or two like oh that's a really
cool image it's not too photoshopped up
and will probably run it if it has my
news value it helps that I my
educational value
okay let's go a little faster this is
the microwave background so the
microwave background this is from the
very early universe seen by satellites
that orbit the Earth this is taken from
the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe
don't you know and we can tell a lot
about the universe from the different
way that spots appeared on the microwave
background these photons come to us from
just a few hundred thousand years after
the Big Bang they pretty much understand
why you would get these patterns which
Palestina versus 13.7 billion years oh
but here's a spot that's circled that
was causing some consternation it
doesn't look as impressive as the other
spot near the center but it is deeper
and that's been called the scene of the
cold spot so a lot of effort has gone
into trying to understand why that is
and sadly the current best guess is that
it's just a statistical anomaly and that
there's no big discovery there to be
made
here's Kepler all these all mean getting
lots and lots of stars here you can see
the realm of colors of the stars they're
little dots or furthermore planets so
you can see there's hundreds of
thousands of these things here you can
see the one that's all by itself is what
our Sun so I move like if there was
Jupiter and Earth II in front of and so
this black dot you see is actually two
three can't see there so this year we
put on humanity put a spacecraft in
orbit around mercury and this is a
picture of interesting crater on record
which let's not like the moon and so
messenger will be taking many of the
disappears to come and I'm gonna speed
up a little bit okay so let's see the
image selection so so we're saying I
said ten eleven which is mostly rejected
I perfect my typical use to look at it
that just something called image ready
which is I bought it in 1998 and I just
don't have a reason to change its ID OB
also what I like about it is that you
can
you can just hit one button and compare
images from so we reduce the image sizes
but if you can't tell the difference
then what does it matter it's the image
that appears the applaud from pages
sometimes the lowest lowest in terms of
bytes that looks pretty much the same to
my eye as the one that goes through it
it's going convene only convinces me
that the web is a relatively inefficient
place because we keep sending around
images will have way too much
information then that the human eye
can't discern most of the information
that's going around whoever else
the web is inefficient fifty years ago
this year Yuri Gagarin orbited the earth
to the first element is you look a lot
like that a large gamma-ray burst that
was any new type seen this year some
people think that it's a star's long
into a black hole and it's not been
proven it's trying to find places on the
moon where we can put astronauts in the
future where there might be water this
is a shadow ground taken over many days
or parts of the south of North Pole of
the moon that are continually shadowed
and then the Sun would not contact I
used to evaporate and so there's
indications that there is sufficient
water on the moon so you don't want to
breath glass the spacecraft off carrying
lots of water if you can get it when you
go to the moon so a pod does have its
own search engine it's something called
swish ie it's free it's open source it
has no pads we liked it because it
allows us to to tailor it to our needs
we have a little thumbnail when you
search for something
okay we generate we show we teach
thumbnail we have the full hypertext is
that and we can order it in Reverse five
knowledge or reverse kind of all don't
work so it does what we so this is the
eclipsed moon recently and this is a
satanic light reflecting dusted early
solar system
the Milky Way okay
gravity probe D determines that they
confirmed but it's a little
controversial going to confirm that
there is something equivalent to two
magnetism so electricity is the
magnetism as gravity as to what
something called gravida magnetism but
you don't see in everyday life but they
grab a new protein you think has
confirmed minutes back so there's a type
of force this is one of our most
spectacular it which is recently award
this is so a pod is known a lot among
the sky enthusiasts almost all of them
know which makes Jerry and I what we
think of as micro celebrities so most
people don't know who we are but
occasionally you run into somebody who
follows our web page and they think
they're kind of special or something so
yeah that's cool yes so there's a lot of
that going around people following blogs
these days someone follows someone's
blog and then when you were actually get
all nervous like oh wow so some people
in general public have heard of us so
we're not completely unknown riding a
pod Ivan voz a professor who does
research and generally hurts my academic
reputation reputation because I thought
pretty much by people some people you
know I work many people who don't know
my work might think of me as a fluff boy
because I must spend all this time just
popularizing science not doing writing
wheel grants and publishing real papers
however writing a PI housekeeping helps
keeping up with what goes on in current
astronomy and so I'm up to date so it's
easier for me to teach instructor
astronomy classes this is a space
shuttle rising the second to last launch
of the space shuttle take it from a
chase plane last image from the spirit
rover rolling around Mars I was
investigating this feature here I
thought to be some kind of volcanic
future a year old place called home
plate on Mars this it's other rover
Opportunity is still rolling around Mars
they've really done great the outfit how
long people thought they would be this
is a picture of the space shuttle I have
the space station together and how was
this image taken and another question
and the answer to that is there was a
one of the the escape shifts came down
and went back to the comics and I think
as it was going late so it's relatively
rare image of them both together a pod
has no business model originally way
back we started this with the huge
pension connection today
funding model we get money from NASA the
other NASA grant which which helps
travel around and and pay for things
NASA grants us the bandwidth of course
we worried that we're going to be
dropped by the NASA so we continually in
the back of our minds are thinking about
what we would have to do if that
happened you going with that commercial
offer there we have the zero funding
model we don't really need almost
anything to continue this on NASA they
don't have to give us money they just
have to keep providing us with a webhost
rustic you've got let's your average and
peak up going down with what we do about
a million page views a day and do you
have any sense of the crest factor he'll
punch it up there well it's pretty
uniform but there's more in the morning
and the average image size is maybe 100
K good out from that so like even going
to here's the recent lunar eclipse we
get set a lot of images about things
like eclipses from amateurs this is no
Calvin Ravenel okay this is a coaster
galaxies that has dark matter in it it's
interesting
so a pond is actually one of my things
I'm trying to do is pick a pot I have a
lot of sky lousiest song and build an
astronomy portal out of it I'm calling
it calling it starship asterisk has a
pot discussions if people want to see
images that are pea pod seeing what
might be coming up you can even vote on
them sometimes innocent images I put up
my courses which I do feel
vastra 101 isn't they called extra my
concepts in physics we're putting the
other source codes so we don't put the
observance but any other library of
source codes because there's lots of
source codes floating around on me and
there's there seem to be unregulated
images that we don't know what's going
on and then people write in and say oh I
think I know what this I think I know
what that may not happen so remember
some things is trying to build up start
investors and this is the space shuttle
rolling out for its a launch tomorrow on
schedule hopefully the last launch of
the space shuttle and I said I've had to
go straight on long stories Jack so
thank you very much I guess I think it
has the wrong one or what is it likely
would have changed it because the
picture is a more general term we've
shown artists renderings sometimes
that's not typically a photograph so we
just might want something that seemed ok
we didn't really baited yes you
mentioned that you sometimes change the
resolution of the pictures eventually so
do you ever do any other editing
krumping or change false colors or
thinking other changes yes we frequently
crop up because there's things on the
outside we don't think are interesting
we will sometimes sharpen them digitally
sharpen up the eye becomes annoyed by
fuzziness and sometimes that you even
better having squares that are have
crisp edges to the squares Pink's
lighting it obviously and having it
fuzzy
that's my opinion and
also we recompressed up right today
happens they have a smaller use less
bandwidth and so I will compress them
sometimes to the point where many times
highly released images are like
megabytes and they can be compressed to
know how to kilobytes and we can't tell
the difference I can tell the difference
so we frequently do that they let it to
having an opinion about a copyright of
images and I've seen some in the past
where you've had to take down images or
videos how do you feel about that so the
video that was so what we've been doing
is we don't post because we don't
typically host the videos ourselves we
link to either Yahoo or Vimeo I've had
pronounced that at least yeah I never
hear video and what happens is there was
a case recently when someone who posted
to Vimeo we thought it seems legitimate
and there was however they themselves I
think they thought they had copyright it
was a show in England the the people who
made the images into show in England
decided that they didn't want that or
maybe it was vice-versa
but we went off the people who made the
images but then the show said no we're
not gonna allow you to do that and so
they actually fold the Vimeo video there
during the day we're coming through at
the end of that and so we were somewhat
embarrassed
some people think as a discussion
session that we should you should host
our own material so we don't run into
that problem we're careful whenever we
sent an image and we check out that we
believe sincerely that we've been given
the vision from that image that might
addressing your question I think I just
want to take care of anything okay yeah
whether a thumbnail image needs to be
copyrighted or not we actually have been
following with Google does on that so
Google search throws up something else
we know at least so far just Google is
going
and haven't been sued on that yet we
have time so we should call her after
the audience at large but I know our
sticking around anoles having lunch with
them anybody wants to join in and
continue to person thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
