a maraca is a versatile very
full-featured music player and its
mission when it was founded was to
rediscover your music so lots of people
have lots of tracks you know you have a
bunch of artists you have a bunch of
tracks and what but what do you really
know about it a lot of that gets lost
when you have a digital music collection
you know you don't have your your cover
matter you don't have a lot of
information about about the music and
and so then be louder I'm sorry so it's
it's easy to get up and running and
basic two extra-base basic tasks are
basic to perform but it has a lot of
features that are designed around this
idea of rediscover your music so it it
will fetch information about artists
you're listening to from wikipedia it
fetches song lyrics for you it gives you
information about about tracks and
artists you're listening to and it has a
bunch of last.fm integration if you
don't know what last.fm is you upload
tracks that you play it's called
scrobbling and when you do this it keeps
track of your listening habits and you
can join various groups and you can have
it come and say alright you belong to
these groups and so we recommend for you
these artists and it can give you ours
to check out and if you have other
tracks in your collection it can
actually say hey you have some of these
tracks you know you want to listen to
this next and there's also a radio based
on on your preferences so it's nice and
there's a lot of features many are
unique to amarok things like our moon
bar a file tracking that keeps track of
your music wherever you put it all sorts
of nice stuff so so this is just a quick
overview of the UI I'm not going to talk
about too much many of you have already
seen it but it has a playlist it has
ratings it has some contexts Arabs I'll
go into more detail and this
presentation right now is the sort of
why we almost left kte
so the three things were context
hardware and portability where we wanted
to come up with our two point O release
and we have this context browser and
it's highly praised and and it's it's a
very well-loved feature but it relies on
HTML for rendering everything all the
all the stuff that you saw there have
I'll come back to that but on everything
you see here is rendered in HTML and
generating the HTML is slow and
rendering the HTML is slow and because
of rendering issues then we'd sometimes
hit something where stuff just won't
render properly at all we want to do
something we can't do it so so said that
so I mention other things in the context
we have these cash lyrics it'll fetch it
automatically just showing you what that
sidebar looks like the sidebar is is on
the Left I'll reference it later so
that's lyrics and sidebar this is
Wikipedia information pulled up in the
sidebar and this is context so you see
tells you when the track was playing
when it was last Blaine when it's first
played your favorite tracks and so on
and so forth and all those things on the
bottom that you see the album's and the
tracks you can then click on and say in
queue this or plate right now and so
it's very a very easy way to listen to
everything so so because of these the
slowness of this HTML and on it didn't
seem a way to go forward with context it
seems to be very limiting and so we
wanted to have some way around that we
wanted to be able to have a way to do
things dynamically and to do things with
nice graphical effects so the next thing
is hardware we could work with most
portable media players we work with
iriver media players we work with any
nomad jukebox bass player any MTP player
any ipod the rio karma we have at least
five plugins oh and a generic one for
generic USB devices we have six plugins
which covers probably something about
ninety-five percent or more of all the
players out there but the kidneys media
manager which gave us information about
the hardware was for generic storage
volumes only so
we couldn't see the other stuff
automatically we couldn't have someone
plug in a proprietary device like an MTP
device and say hey look this is air and
the medium objects had used were very
awkward not to get into too much
technical detail but it had had a bunch
of things that were in fixed order so
you couldn't just reference any part of
this data that you wanted you have to
trawl through it and so how is unloading
sis hardware abstraction layer kind of
similar to wmi on windows for instance
and it seemed like a way that that it
could help but there was no Katie way to
get at this kid Edie's media manager
used it but only for the storage volumes
and the next time its portability we get
lots of these messages please make a win
this version I can only use windows at
work and I miss Miami rock is oh my god
I saw him rock the other day on a
friends computer I was blown away but
I'm to newbie computer stupid switch to
linux and my favorite and and a little
bit close to home I'd switch Linux in a
heartbeat T's network but my girlfriend
would kill me so and we also get a lot
of people were a lot of emails where
people say they switch to linux just to
use em rock we probably get one of these
um you know an average about one week
it's a lot and you know so there's two
ways look at this would am rock on
Windows prevents wishing to free
platforms some people think that moving
apps cross-platform says or gives out
this message that well it's okay to stay
on the proprietary platform that you're
on and the non-free platform later on
and we don't really have that view
because we think that using free
software on proprietary platforms is
better than proprietary software
proprietary platforms and it provides a
conduit for moving towards free desktops
so we've been itching to go across
platform increasing our user base it's
not a bad thing on Windows there's
things like lamp which is free as in
beer if you don't get winamp pro but is
it's a you know there's no source code
available and it's owned by a major
company AOL and on Mac there's basically
no competition to iTunes so to do this
we need to go to QT only because for one
thing KD wasn't building on on windows
mac and uh and losing media manager and
cage TM l didn't seem like a big issue
moving forward because we didn't really
want to you know have have to be stuck
on HTML for the context of you anyways
there are a couple other nice things k
URLs in ko which you know have
abstraction of network so you can get to
your Samba you know play directly from
your Samba shares and all that but they
weren't see keable and that severely
limited how useful they were because you
could start at playing but you can move
around them file and so we had a few
other hard dependencies on KDE were
mainly using a bunch of helper classes
and and and so the next part of the sock
is about libraries libraries and more
libraries Kinney stepped up and came up
with all these libraries and I'm
specifically talking about plasma solid
and phone on three of the pillars of KDE
4 and kitty fours libraries had been the
answers to all of our problems and in
phonons case they were the answer to a
problem that we never really realized
that we had we kind of knew it but we
didn't really recognize it we weren't
really pursuing sec now I've heard um
the other day someone described the
kitty development community as a family
because everyone is so friendly when
their meetings like this everyone gets
long and it's such a nice a nice group
and they're like that with all things
they're friendly accept and accepting of
our suggestions and ideas so it makes it
so that if you're contributing back it's
appealing because you know that you know
if it's good idea if it doesn't you know
break binary compatibility things like
that that you can't that you can't break
that it's probably to get accepted if
it's well done and so on and and that's
good because application developers like
us we help ensure the libraries are
ready for real-world usage for you know
commercial applications for and for any
other application that wants to come
along there was something that Aaron
said on blog recently who's quoting
someone said something like that without
applications to test libraries you
wouldn't know if they were ready and a
lot of applications to one a good
libraries because they don't know if
they're ready so you kind of have to you
have to take that that track so the
quick facts just for anyone that's been
sleeping is a plasma provides ways to
make an arranged small graphical applets
and they look great too and solid is
ez platform agnostic hardware access and
configuration which basically means it
makes it easy to get at your hardware
devices all right phone on media playing
and and also recording made easy very
easy so plasma so HTML was slow I candy
was difficult to add without making
things even slower you couldn't add
dynamic effects and and the thing is in
this world when you're building this
kind of an application multimedia
application users expect eye candy and
it's true for a lot of other
applications too and you know we live in
a world where Apple makes sure to put
lots and lots of eye candy on everything
and so you know people look at Apple and
say this is what application should look
like and this is how they should behave
and I'm sure that the three people that
are using vista ultimate would agree so
so we want i can do you want things to
look nice so plasma came along and it
was this way that we could you know have
these applets and we could you know have
things that we could know dynamically
modify and that we could uh you know
right graphically without having to
render HTML and so it seemed like an
obvious choice oh it's a cutie kv coding
style so it's very easy to pick up
event-driven has the q graphics for you
makes things fast and alien i'm not sure
if anyone's mentioned it before it's
part of QT 4.4 that's coming out but
it's going to speed things up even more
because it's going to do all the drawing
directly in QT instead of telling x or
windows or mac to draw this then draw
that and draw this and then draw that so
it should speed up things even more and
make graphics just fly so the context
information is now freed from the
sidebar because we have this context
view and the context applets can be
whatever shape fits context best and
they can be resized move that will and
we saw have a key to WebKit that's
coming so for things like Wikipedia it
makes sense to just render the HTML and
so we're not you know we still have that
as an option if we want it so this is a
this is all very pre alpha software so
it doesn't look that great right now but
this is a view and you can see the
context is move front and center and
when you have a media player where it
rediscover your music is maximum then it
really makes sense to have the
information about
your music be the center of pain so
context is to Center and this is a
cut-off view of you know lyrics and
track information and this is a kind of
a thin view and then if you make a
bigger then then it gets thick and you
can see everything that's smaller all
the text got smaller but when you have a
view like this then you can one thing
that we're looking at is that you can
click on one and how to come out to the
front and then if you click on another
that'll come out to the front so you can
focus on something or you can have it
just all back there and available so
that answered you know that question but
what about hardware support so solid
gives us this qt-kt api and a back-end
abstraction so what that means is is we
can we can write device detection code
or rather we can write code that makes
use of devices that are handed to us so
solid will say hey this device just
appeared and it's this type of device
and we can access it using the
information that solid gives us and so
we don't need to write that ourselves
and we don't need to write a Hal version
and we don't need to write a Windows
version and a mac version because
that'll be done for us so the API is
modeled after the house structure
because that's what was available on the
free software world but it's not just a
Hal front end the most common most
useful information is there which makes
sense and the information is likely to
be available on all platforms so if you
have a hard drive partition than the
mount point or the drive letter if
you're on Windows you know that's likely
leave available on all platforms but um
you know certain things about does it
support smart which I know is on all
platforms but maybe at some point Linux
can support it and windows could so you
know doesn't make too much sense the API
of it is available across platforms hey
when there's a Mac developers watching
this right the back end please and back
and specific information is still there
if you want it it's just not not
portable but if you know what back in
Tehran that's fine so we don't need to
code our own device detection and
back-end code is you know is maintained
within KDE live so there's many eyes on
it
hey again Windows Mac developers Hapes
so now on to a phonon phonon here's our
list of engines 4am rock 1.4 and earlier
in subversion a code gstreamer keeney
mmm mas NMM are all deprecated and
unmaintained yeah wap which i'm not
actually sure you pronounce it but I'm
guessing that's it is kind of maintained
and and he looks and realtor and zine
are maintained but why do we have at
least deprecated unmaintained engines
well for one thing we don't have the
manpower we're not in the manpower to
keep all of them up if if someone who
coded it initially disappears the rest
of us may not know that library and may
not have the time to pick it up you know
we're all none of us are getting paid
for this libraries are sometimes too
limited so some of them couldn't support
crossfading when we wanted to add that
and non C++ and especially QT or KDE
api's make it difficult to pick these up
so we sort of recognized that this was a
problem and we always thought a half
we'll fix it sometime but phone on came
along and solved for us and we don't
have to worry about too much right now
all we have to really worry about is
getting phone on the right media at the
right time and it's k ki o capable so
currently the the deprecated gstreamer
back in could use ki o and all of its
magic to play your files everything in
phone on can use ki oh and it's all see
cable so the back ends are maintained by
lots of people trolltech maintains some
of the back ends i was told that this is
actually wrong i I've been told at some
point that gstreamer pays for mp3
licensing but someone told me that this
is wrong so I might I might not be
correct about that but the gstreamer
back end is there and it can still be
added even if mp3 support isn't a part
of gstreamer on that platform and so you
have zine and you have gstreamer and on
windows you have direct show and on Mac
you have quicktime and and these
backends have many eyes again and we
don't have to worry about it ourselves
and there's this huge code reduction
because phone on is so simple so our
zine engine had 14 95 lines of code in
this
gpp start lines in the file of cpp and h
files the phone on engine has 324 lines
so that's eighty percent less code none
of it back in specific none of it
platform specific and the phone on
engine code has more comments white
space too now if you actually look at
the comments white space in those files
you'll find that there's a bow even
those a little more on the phone on side
there's about 200 lines in each file
that are common to white space so when
you look at them when you subtract you
actually get a ratio of about ninety
percent code reduction it's almost
finished of ten to one so going forward
wakeeney for kitty took all these
concerns and and you know they're very
they listen to us they like us we're
part of a module called extra gear so
we're not packaged with KDE but several
of the very prominent KDE apps are in
this extra module you have us you have
digit cam which is an excellent photo
management utility and you have for
instance k3v which is probably the
premier CD and DVD mastering application
on free desktops and we didn't really
complain specifically I mean we did over
time but it wasn't like one of us came
to them and said you need to do this now
you know we didn't threaten them or
anything but they just recognize that
this need was there for application
developers and and so they answered all
of it so context we have plasma hardware
we have solid engine maintenance mess we
have phone on and there's result coding
for Eric to is is much easier in a way
because we can really focus on all the
really cool stuff that hasn't been done
before and we can get rid of all the
customized stuff and get rid of a lot of
the code that has been done before
that's boring that you have to rewrite
on all these other applications on all
these other platforms every single time
so you know right now we have few
reasons to remain QT only and we have
lots of reasons to stick with KDE our
position has done a whole 180 as a
result of all of these you know nice
libraries with good interfaces that are
out there and we have this excellent
community that cannot be stressed enough
of developer supporters and users
everyone is extremely supportive of the
applications that run on
the core developers and so it's a really
great environment to develop
applications on and now it's much easier
environment to develop applications on
and very soon across platform
environment to develop applications on
and all that's really exciting so I
guess we'll move on to any questions
that are out there I do also oh I saw
him I know I mean I'm pretty sure that's
my last slide yes it is I just want to
point out because I point out my fellow
am rockers before Leo right there is
working on the context of you and he's
contributed a lot back to plasma I'll
talk about that just for a moment I was
talking before about how KDE listens to
its application developers and how they
will go and though and they'll you know
listen to suggestions and take patches
and things like that they're open about
that with each of these libraries that I
mentioned they listen to draw backs and
and and that we found and they fixed it
so with phone on we needed some
notification ahead of time to know when
a track was going to change so that we
can load up the next track to cross feed
and we told them this and they added
simple as that was solid we you know we
looked at the solidi behind said well
this isn't quite good enough and that
ended up going back to hell and we ended
up catching how to work with you know
and then and install it to make things
better and with plasma plasma originally
the library was just something that was
there to to service plasma in the
desktop and its applets and it was
always intended to be abstracted but we
basically said hey we really need you to
do the sooner rather than later and Leo
did a whole lot of that and and they are
ended a lot of that too and it got done
and so now you have plasma that's
capable of being embedded in any single
application that you want so you can
have custom applets inside your
application doing you know anything you
can think of and it's really brilliant
stuff so questions
sure i'll let hey get you the microphone
do you have sorry i know that is your
user community taking advantage of the
possibility of writing plasmids yet that
you know there I don't know too much
about that Leo can you hi um not yet
we're still working on the framework for
the whole system um but if you want to
please come talk to me and start because
we already if you want to there is you
know enough there for you to work on I
think still be kind of under the radar
to know actually heard of it yet but
hopefully we feel like a first pre op
release soon to get the word out to
people but yes so come join us any other
questions sort of building on the same
thing are you gonna do something like
what dolphin did where you can move
around different panes using plasmoids
I'm sorry where you can move around if
you've seen the version of dolphin on
Katie for you can different views you
can move them around to different parts
of the window and reorganize them yeah
the side the side pains and all that
would you be able to reorganize them
later on like you have that plan I I
don't know but we like taking ideas so
one thing it sends send mail to a maraca
KDE org and you know get that kind of
stuff to our developers into our mailing
list and you know we can work on
flushing it out we like that kind of
feedback we like to stay ahead of things
you have any ideas I haven't fleshed out
there like contacts you too much yet you
know even in my head so like I need more
feedback you know what you think what
you want to do with it what you think
can be done with it so talk to me no
send me an email sent us an email we're
very open to tips some of you I I'm
sorry this wasn't an amarok 2 point 0
presentation because I know some people
like that but I didn't want to focus on
the Katie for side of things so
as we wrap up this day full of
presentations and neat technology and
that's this celebration of the KDE
community I'd like to give you a little
tagline for the KDE community we do
embrace and befriend good to meet you
Jeff thanks all right cocktails over
there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
