gong behind you somewhere all right bye
how often does that happen so you sort
of have to take advantage of it usually
the sound I make when I start a
presentation is a little bit more like
this that's a sound of the future in
case you guys aren't familiar you may
think the synthesizer is the sound of
the future but that was the sound of the
future in the 60s so today that's what
the future sounds like and what the
future looks like these days is it looks
pretty small whew foreshadowing but when
you start talking about small things
like mobile I actually think these
things have a really really big impact
which is what I want to dive into today
and kind of talk about some of the ways
we can manage what's going on with
mobile look towards making great
experiences for mobile devices but at
the same time instead of using these
things as as they exist today really
look towards what's possible going
forward through some of these
experiences so I mentioned Mobile is
sort of a small thing but to kick off I
want to talk about a very big thing
which is this idea of mass media so
what's the mass media it's any
technology you can use to communicate
with lots and lots of people right and
you guys should be familiar if these
sorts of things the first form of mass
media to hit our planet was print
there's a bunch of printed pieces around
you there's some on the walls right
there's posters in here there's books
magazines this was the first way that
our planet was able to take a message
and get it to many many people across
the world and print was around for a
long long time in fact it wasn't until
where that was like around 1500 it
wasn't around until 1890 but the next
form of mass media came out which is
recordings so laser discs you guys
probably have a laser disc right
minidiscs know one minute is flared at
tapes Wow
dating myself
after recording cinema all right so we
went to being able to share audio so now
we can actually share moving pictures 10
years after that radio now we can
actually broadcast those audio signals
so after this couple hundred year period
of all we had was print all we had was
print every 10 years or so something new
is coming out and really changing things
and you know we think we live in
exciting times now with the internet and
with self-driving cars and you know
laser planes that create 3d models of
buildings imagine if you were alive here
and all the sudden recordings came out
and all sudden cinema came out and then
radio like audio moving through the air
I don't know what the equivalent of the
1800s your brain popped or whatever what
does it blew my mind
I don't know what they said back then
but they they probably thought it a lot
radio stuck around a long time because
that was around 1910 there was about 40
maybe 45 years until the next form of
mass media came out which is television
and television also had a decent run
because it was around 1990 or so that
the internet really came out and became
the sixth form of mass media hit our
planet nobody will really argue that the
Internet is a form of mass media right
it means to communicate with lots and
lots of people but there's a theory that
came out from an ex Nokia executive
called Thome a haneen and he said mobile
is the seventh form of mass media to hit
our planet and to me this has really
profound implications because when we
start to think about doing things like
designing for mobile designing for the
small screen this is sort of the
Association we have right how do we take
our internet e things our software
things and fit them onto these smaller
devices if you will these portable
devices now that's one way we could look
at the issue but if we look at it at the
scale of a transition from something
like radio to TV or transition like
something from TV to the Internet
I think it's fundamentally a much much
bigger deal right and has a lot more
implications as a result it's worth
looking at is mobile really the seventh
form of mass media or is Tommy smoking
Nokia crack which there's very precious
little of left these days if you guys
follow the stock price right
so to understand if something is really
in the next form of mass media is it
really that big and important let's look
at something small like babies is how
many babies come out every day on the
planet so we've figured out that
algorithm I think it was a Google
project that figured out that
unfortunately this is how many iPhones
come out per day and I blame you guys
for this one but this is how many
Android devices are activated per day
add in the total number of iPod touches
and iPads add in the dwindling number of
Nokia's and the uber dwindling number of
BlackBerry devices I feel so bad I feel
like I still have to include them all
right but every time you look at one of
these charts so just getting squeezed by
ios and android so let's do the maths
how many is that select three million
plus mobile devices entering the planet
per day when I started doing this sort
of bit around kids versus devices a year
ago I sort of put together a little blog
post comparing how many kids are born
per day it's the amount of mobile
devices entering the planet it was about
a million over the course of the year
that number has gone up by another two
million so now it's an order of
magnitude difference all right three
hundred thousand children entering the
planet per day compared to three million
devices entering the planet per day and
those because there's so many of these
things coming out the rate at which
they're spreading is tremendous the way
that they hit mass market penetration if
you will right how long it takes for 40
percent of the u.s. audience to have one
telephone took about 40 years
electricity in the computer would you
think everybody would want to
electricity as soon as possible
took about 15 years radio mobile phone
internet again some these really
transformative things took about five
years with the fastest growing
technology ever to hit mass market
penetration in the United States has
been the smartphone took roughly three
and a half years right now it's at 58%
of the addressable audience in the
United States has a smartphone and it
continues to grow they all probably
continue to grow until you hit
saturation right where every feature
phone turns into a some more
and that's not a lot of time to figure
out what to do with mobile right three
and a half years is not the kind of
opportunity the telephone companies had
or the telegraph companies had to figure
out the telephone they had 40 years and
the impact of this is if you look at
what used to happen in the personal
computing market this is what personal
computing market chair looked like in
the first 15 years and every remember
over the trs-80 it had a tape deck so
you guys remember trs-80 but you don't
remember minidiscs come on it's talking
the geeks here eight-track anybody
remembered 8-track ok thank you
geez Commodore Amiga Atari right typical
for a new technology couple companies
trying to figure out what is it what's
the personal computer going to be to use
the language of today WTF PC is what I
think we can call this first 15 years
the next 15 years is basically all
Microsoft and Intel kind of taken over
the personal computing market but the
past three to four years is where it
really starts to get interesting and
here's the androids here's the apples
just ripping into the personal computing
space alright because what people are
doing on mobile devices is what they're
used to be doing on their laptops their
desktops or PCs when they got home right
or when they were at the office and so
big Mobile's big that fits part of our
definition the next piece is can you
communicate to it right in order to be a
form of mass media have to be able to
broadcast out to it and right now
there's six billion connections there's
going to be 10 billion connections I
suspect this will happen faster
pretty much every outlandish prediction
they make about mobile tends to come
true a year or two earlier than they
thought and in this case day is cisco
who's seeing like a twenty six x
worldwide traffic growth in mobile right
now so they're saying in about two years
we'll have 10 billion connections i
think that'll happen sooner but we'll
find out so there's lots of these
devices you can broadcast to lots of
people and correctly this is the stuff
that i think gets the most interesting
to me the little device that we carry in
our pockets can do everything all six
forms of mass media that came before it
can do can you
the web yes can you watch TV shows yes
can you listen to the radio yes can you
watch movies yes can you listen the
recordings can you read you're right so
this little thing has essentially
swallowed all six forms of mass media
that came before it just like TV or the
Internet can do what TV did what radio
did with cinema did it's on and so forth
so that's another indicator that this is
actually a new form of mass media plus
it could do all this stuff that none of
these other forms of mass media can do
Mobile is always with you always on it
can be used immediately at the point of
inspiration it can be used sort of in a
if you want to use the term augmented
reality context you can but you know
you're doing something in the real world
all of a sudden your network do you have
your services of information and you can
access them through this always-on
interaction so not only can it do
everything all these other forms of mass
media could do but it can do more right
yet another indicator that we actually
are dealing with something very
transformative right something very
different than just a smaller laptop
than just a smaller PC yet whenever we
make this transition whenever we go from
something like radio to TV what do we do
we copy over all the things that we were
doing before sponsorships the idea that
somebody sponsors a program was a
business model that was literally
created for radio
they wouldn't iterated a whole bunch of
different ideas and they couldn't figure
out how to make money off of radio and
then they came upon the sponsorship idea
which is still on TV today if you've
ever seen an ad in front of your Hulu
Plus paid subscription channel that
you're already paying for and they still
give you ads on so that's still around
spokesmen are literally people who spoke
for a product right spokesman and these
are the old-time radio shows that made
their way over to TV I don't know how
candid camera worked who's like candid
microphone back then but there it is and
when these things made the transition
over to TV this is what they look like
what do they do they pointed a camera at
people reading radio shows it took years
before we realized the true magic of
television and what it could actually do
as a unique medium right so it wasn't
immediately clear that the radio the TV
was not radio similarly print was around
for hundreds of hundreds of years
and those things that we see around us
all the time inside a print and we you
know kind of consume on a daily basis
are still stuck with us even when we go
and design for the Internet today many
people will talk about how the web is
not print but yet we still of all these
conversations about pages about layouts
about typography write about graphical
ads and things like this stuff that's
really inherent from the print world but
the web is not print and similarly guess
where I'm going with this mobile is not
a desktop PC right but this is a very
common transition so common in fact that
I think it's totally understandable why
we're trying to adapt what we already
know and try to fit it into this new
thing because it's skin Scott Jensen who
some of you may know used to work over
here on some of the mobile things before
that he was over at the Newton team of
all places but um he lays it out as it's
very common for us to copy what we were
doing before gradually extend it and
then finally figure out something new
right it takes a while for us to figure
out what sticks inside of something
different because it's these it's a
natural process as long as we're sort of
cognizant of this natural process that
we're going through I think it's okay
it's when we aren't aware that we're
actually doing is importing our ideas
from somewhere else and trying to fit
them into something different that we
run into issues and this is the thing
that I still struggle with very much on
a personal basis I oftentimes find
myself putting something on and into a
mobile experience that is just stuck in
my head from 20 plus years of the
internet or 20 plus years of desktop
software or GUI metaphors and things
like this and I put it in there and we
you know make it out and then we
actually start using it and see what
happens like oh right wasn't the right
thing to do
so what does this process look like I
don't think I need to convince you guys
that mobile is a big deal you get it
right but PayPal's numbers sort of
illuminate the story yeah okay mobile
payments sure four billion last year
fourteen billion all right I mean this
is the kind of singham ahooo we're
talking about what do you call those
hockey stick curve right in the venture
world so yeah and the other interesting
thing about this remember I said every
every time there's a number that comes
out it ends up becoming bigger so PayPal
was predicting they'd hit eight billion
when they were in the beginning of 2012
then they said it's going to be ten
billion and they said it's gonna be
twelve billion and they ended up with
fourteen billion over the course of 2012
and all our companies are finding the
other really common thing you get is you
hear people saying oh well conversions
lower on mobile or people won't do X Y
or Z mo because this screen is too small
it's a different you know different kind
of thing and I'm it's actually very
common in the e-commerce world to talk
about conversion being lower on mobile
but I think a lot of that has to do with
them not really designing uniquely for
the medium because when you do you can
actually have higher likelihood to buy
you can have higher likelihood to
subscribe you can actually end up with
more engagement all right and it boils
down to are you actually thinking about
it as a unique thing or are you porting
over what you were doing before and
other companies are gonna sort of be
forced to figure this out even if they
don't take the time to invest as you
probably see in actually this just
happened recently to my knowledge with
one of the Google products which is
Chrome right so now chrome has seen
mobile grow like crazy so all sudden
Chrome for mobile becomes a much bigger
deal than Chrome for the desktop and I'm
sure that's happening in other products
as well but 60% of Twitter users now
mobile 70% of pendo are users now on
mobile other companies huge mobile
growth and I think it's worth looking at
this at a big level so let's look at a
very large website no not Google but
Facebook and this is the past two years
of monthly active users on
Facebook anybody notice anything wrong
with this curve yes by the way they had
an IPO right around here
it's flat who thinks Facebook is growing
okay like one guy next they actually are
but this is this this is what's
happening right here right so all their
non mobile use is essentially flat for
two years and all of the growth is
happening in mobile and this this moment
where these two lines intersect I think
is really really interesting so I've
given it a name because I think it's so
interesting which is when your monthly
active use or whatever key metric you're
focusing on switches bits when you cross
this mobile line all of a sudden
everything sort of changes pretty
fundamentally and I'll talk about that
in a second the other really interesting
line on Facebook's chart is this one
which is the mobile only audience this
is people who only access Facebook
through mobile devices and that has been
kind of the fastest growing population
on their end for quite a while in fact
there's entire countries where a huge
chunk of their audience is a mobile only
audience and what we're starting to see
across the world is that many people's
first-time Internet experience is
through a mobile device their sort of
bypass a in the desktop laptop internet
and coming online with a mobile device
in hand as the first time thing and this
quote from Mark I think really
summarizes it that's it's sort of the
second part that intrigues me we are now
a mobile company because previously
Facebook always ran around and said
they're a web company and again here we
are Google Google is a web company was
maybe is shifting now but like think
about the transformative nature of going
from we are a web company to we are a
mobile company and talking with lots of
companies around the valley you hear
this story over and over again right now
so I don't you guys saw the news from
Zynga yesterday when they essentially
laid off five hundred and twenty people
and they're dead they're now a mobile
company kind of late to figure that out
right god bless them let's hope they can
do but they just hit this moment where
they said we are now a mobile company
that's the only thing that matters to us
but crap we had to lay off half the
company to figure that out
and you know there's other companies who
shall remain nameless that are seeing
the same sort of transition and I think
it's really hard to do honestly you know
I can tell you that in the facebook
world this was not an easy step because
what happens organizationally at least
from my outside perspective now thank
God from my outside perspective is
people hear it but they don't do it
right okay Mobile's really part uh-huh
no it really got to do it no no and it's
not until you know something really
dramatic happens that people really take
a very very large shift so yeah it's a
it's a big transition and it's a really
big deal so if we start to think about
mobile at the scale of a new form of
mass media I think that gives it
enormous weight if we look at it as this
transformative force that's changing
some of the largest internet companies
in the world to mobile companies right I
mean this is the scale we're talking
about here I don't think it bless you I
don't think it makes sense to really
think about this is a small screen
anymore all right
I think it has to really fundamentally
change the way you think about a lot of
things and that includes design that
includes development that includes all
kinds of stuff and the other scary thing
about that is you know a lot of our
instincts that we've honed and learned
over the years I just flat out wrong
all right they seem like it'll work well
it's kind of the same thing though I
know all this stuff and we put it in
there and try to make it work and we
ultimately turn out to be wrong
especially the early stuff we were doing
for mobile so with that kind of in mind
what I want to do is take a look at what
are some of the stuff we've been doing
all right what are the things that are
sort of inherent in our mindsets and our
approaches how do we take that and adapt
it and optimize it for this sort of
mobile world today and last but not
least what does that give us
in terms of ways to look towards the
future all right like what are ways that
we can look forward and I I proposed the
loop of you helmet instead of the Google
glass it's actually a little bit more
immersive
all right then people won't look at you
funny when you wear it so what do we
know what have we been doing highway
adapt and optimize it and what does it
tell us about the future and I want to
look at this transition in places that
often get overlooked right I have this
fascination with things that I consider
to be the linchpin of web experiences
things that are enormous ly critical to
like foundational elements on the
Internet
but often get ignored and bastardized
and not thought of because people don't
really think about them because they're
not interesting right they're not like
these super fascinating challenges
instead they're really boring lame and
we think we've solved it but there's
huge opportunities there so what kinds
of things am I talking about I think
things that are critical to conversion
funnels things that are critical to the
point where actually something happens
that creates value for both your
customers your users and your service
and one of those things that's enormous
ly overlooked is this Login thing and
you can say Luke what's wrong with a
login right does anybody know what a
login screen looks like it's two input
fields a checkbox that I swear does
nothing so things like keep me logged in
it's totally put there as like a little
decoy to mess with your head right
because you check it and it doesn't keep
you logged in and then it has a button
so it's like two input fields a checkbox
in a button what is there to talk about
with this well first of all this is a
very very broken system lots of active
authentications per day I think
something like 95 percent of US
companies used username or email and
password as an authentication mechanism
for their service like everybody is
doing this and that means we are logging
in all the freaking time and some of us
probably know one who works at Google
because you have to pass like 17 tests
to get hired here you guys have probably
never forgotten a password right but
other people do other people do in fact
when I was at Yahoo we didn't have tests
to work there that explains lots of
things
maybe Marissa added the test now I don't
know you definitely can't take the test
at home you have to take it in the
office I know that part
no take-home tests so when I was at
Yahoo 15 to 10 five to ten percent of
people that went to try and sign in to
Yahoo actually failed to log into the
site at this time back then you know
this was like seven eight years ago
during the days of laser discs and mini
disks and eight tracks and TRS ATS back
then Yahoo was 15% of Internet time
right was the largest site out there and
five to ten percent of sessions for the
largest site in the entire internet
resulted in password errors if you're
doing anything with Internet services
this is the number one issue that people
have so I personally contend that login
screens are fundamentally broken and you
know I was trying to scratch my head and
understand why why do people have
problems with these things you know it
doesn't make any sense to me it's so
clear everybody knows that the way you
do usability is you write things out for
people right you sort of like explain it
in text that's how you make things
usable so they've done that for this
login screen and you know you have to
use one letter one number one special
character but not these characters
because they are not special enough if
it's special it can't be first or last
that's okay right you can't have what
we're called sets so like if two
characters sitting next to each other
and they're the same that's a set and
that is not good you can't have that
also be aware that characters in the
first second and third positions cannot
be identical neither can the second
third or fourth positions be ignore the
sixth seventh eighth positions be
identical and you can't use Texas child
or the months of the year because that's
the first thing hackers try have you
seen these guys right so all the guys
you know they're like hacking these
things the first thing they're like
Texas child and boom they're in eighty
percent of the time
so do not do that and if you ever make
it through this realize that the past
eight times you solve this puzzle you
can't use that answer again right again
Google employees no problem but the rest
of us I could see how maybe we'd
struggle with some of these challenges
and so it's disheartening to me when I
see people going from you know the
desktop laptop side of the coin to
making a mobile experience and what do
they do okay let's make sure the login
screen fits on the smaller screen this
is what I mean by approaching this as a
small screen problem you see this over
and over again if like every single
design pattern that's out there it's
like how do we make our login screen fit
on the smaller screen and all those
problems that I just walked you through
now are on a smaller screen
congratulations the mobile revolution is
here all right but it's actually worse
than that so here's our friends over at
eBay and they have taken the time to
create a mobile web experience you can
go by browse and shop on things in fact
I as I mentioned earlier they're doing
like 14 billion and pay pound 14 billion
in global merchandising volume on mobile
so they're doing really well
but when they created their mobile web
experience they left something off the
sign-in screen which is this I forgot my
user ID or password and even if you try
to login says no guess again
so I observe this and I wouldn't talk to
a very large e-commerce company that's
doing really well in mobile who shall
remain nameless and I pointed out to
them I said you know hey you guys don't
have they're in the same situation you
don't have this get back my username and
password thing are you seeing any issues
with that I would expect you to see
issues like oh yeah we actually get a
lot of customer support volume for that
a lot I go well how much so I will ask
you what percent of their customer
service calls do you think were related
to login issues a percent 50 70 90 90
90% of their customer service increase
this is the thing I'm talking about like
who thinks about the login screen nobody
thinks about you know who thinks about
it you're poor customer service
department that every single time you
gather for yes okay I understand you can
get your password no no do you have a
desktop computer yeah okay so get your
desktop computer ok I don't know take
the coke out of the solder no that's not
a drink holder that's a CD drive okay so
uh recently eBay put in this I forgot my
user ID or password thing and we can say
oh yeah you know eBay weren't they made
in like the 90s right and it's just like
crufty old stuff how can you expect them
to figure things out what about our web
2.0 was web 2.0 a thing anymore I don't
think so right it's like the eight-track
of the web world's web 2.0 people make
jokes about it but LinkedIn used to be a
web 2.0 thing and they have this
touchdown linkedin.com experience right
where you can go and access LinkedIn on
mobile devices and again they have a
really nice feature here called forgot
password which when you try to log in to
LinkedIn on the mobile device and please
try again now let me ask you guys a
question when do you go to LinkedIn what
takes you to LinkedIn email this guy
needs a job I got a couple things for
you later
everybody else hopefully happily
employed but does anybody go to LinkedIn
when they get an email yes is that the
primary way do you go to LinkedIn
somebody sends you an email do you check
your email on your phone yes one of you
everybody else checks it on glass oh
yeah go on uh-huh okay so this happens
to me all the time this is the only way
I go to LinkedIn so I get an email it's
like Tim wants to connect with you right
all right all right I love Tim right I
want to connect the hell out of Tim so
here I am me and Tim are gonna connect
it's gonna be awesome so I click accept
I have the app
I have yep what do I do this is a
legitimate question what do I do I say
no thanks and I lie and they said a
cookie it says he doesn't have the app
so next time I go to this link they
bring up the thing get the app so this
happens right and I say no thanks so I
lie and then I get this spinning little
thing because they actually are loading
a dustiest
template where they serve an empty body
tag and manually and automatically
inject through JavaScript the entire
HTML page so that's like a yeah I know
3045 second process while the thing
spins and then I get the login screen
and I'm like I have no frickin clue so I
try and try and try and then this
happens it's not that it's hard to read
loosely it's that it doesn't even fit I
can't even solve it if I wanted to
nobody looked at this on an Android
device nobody went to actually see that
you can't physically see the CAPTCHA
that you're trying to dissolve in your
mind and so you know this is frustrating
right and I think it's especially
frustrating when you think about what's
the number one way do you go to LinkedIn
through an email where are we checking
our email on our phones you'd think this
would be an important critical flow to
those guys and I've been on their butts
a while about this lovely people over
there many of them I used to work with
in the past and uh they added a little
forgot password link which is fantastic
all right so what's the moral of some of
these stories here the moral of the
story is what Stephen Hoover says in his
little book mobile interfaces Mobile
should not be a dumbed down limited
experience because what happens in a lot
of these situations people like oh
nobody's gonna try to recover their
password I'm mobile it's too hard
Oh we'll just leave that feature out why
they wanted on this small screen right
they're not thinking of it as a complete
experience they're not thinking of it
part of this holistic thing and so what
they do is they just end up removing
things that they think aren't important
if it's critical on a 7-inch screen if
it's critical on a 15-inch screen if
it's critical in 30 inch screen it's
probably critical on a 4-inch screen -
so that's one thing
now to give LinkedIn some credit you
know they've
built this touch that linkedin.com
experience they've done some cool things
so small stuff like when they're
collecting an email they'll use type
email which will give you this nice
little keypad with a saving you some
steps with a gnat and a dot if you do
fun things like turn auto cop capitalize
an autocomplete 'off which takes half a
second in code you will make people's
lives awesome right some really for
password but password is actually a
bigger problem
so password here this is what happens
with password you're going to type in
this password and you're looking down at
this little keyboard right this little
virtual keyboard and you type in the
letter and then you look up right after
you type it and it turns into a dot and
then you go down any type of in turns
into a dot you go ahead and type it in
turns into a dot and I think this is an
issue because frankly when you can't see
what you're typing it's really hard to
know if it's right or not right and as
many studies now have sort of shown is
that masking passwords there's no data
that supports masking passwords actually
increases security there's no study that
says hey by putting the dots there
you've increased security by like 75
percent but there are lots and lots of
studies that say people fail to log in
and that costs you money seventy-five
percent of the time when somebody fails
to goes into a recover password flow in
e-commerce when they have a shopping
cart full they failed to buy and as our
friend Jakob Nielsen says it's worse on
mobile because mobile is a magnifying
lens for your usability problems and by
the way you cannot do this to just any
man look at how smooth his skin is
and it's just like perfect right if
somebody did this to me out of slot if
you log off there but this man is just
this complexion is as rich as his mind
so mobile is a magnifying lens for your
usability prizes if it's a big if it's a
problem on a big screen where you're
seated comfortably you've got a precise
mouse cursor a full keyboard right you
got your I don't know whatever the hell
else you have 30-inch giant monitors
cables coming if it's a problem there
it's gonna be a much bigger problem when
you all you got is a little thumb and a
tiny screen alright and this is what I
mean that Mobile's a magnifying lens for
your usability problems companies that
have been doing mobile stuff for a while
figured out this Login thing is a
problem so here's facebook if you try to
log in on mobile on facebook they say
hey that was wrong we're gonna show you
your password in plain text don't worry
it's still secure it's cool or we can
send you a message so if you send a
message they collect an email or phone
and then you get a link and you just log
in right then in their box net has gone
a little bit further and they actually
include a button that says show the
password so you can literally see what
you're typing in there personally I
think they should flip the bit and make
it hide password because of this idea of
some more defaults that is the default
that are set in place so the things
people use most of the time anyway and
you know the rationale for this is like
let's focus on creating a good
experience here rather than this
arbitrary pseudo security and why I say
it's pseudo security if there's a man
with a mysterious in a handlebar
mustache right trenchcoat behind me as
I'm logging into my phone you know what
I can do works you know the other thing
there's a virtual keyboard right there
that I'm typing into that makes the
letters big when I tap on them alright
so if somebody's a camera pointer on my
phone so the scenario here all the time
if someone has a camera point at your
phone they can get your password yeah
well they can see you typing on the
keyboard and get the same thing right
so as literally as doing nothing to a
certain extent you know you can argue
whatever but I personally believe like
this is an opportunity to create a
better experience again because mobile
is different right it's not like a PC
that's sit in front of your desk it's
something that's in your hand you can
move it around you can put it wherever
you want you can pivot your body or what
have you so it has different things so
we have my current startup has a little
product called polar and what we did
when we created our login screens we did
you know I sort of put my money where
Alfa's and what we have is by default
your password is visible you can always
hit hide if you feel compromised and you
want to get rid of it and so we launched
this I wrote a little article about it
and frankly I was really really nervous
because I thought I was going to get
skewered I expected people to be like
you know look I'm gonna show a password
dummy right don't you know the dots she
know about the dots you dummy right it's
totally what I thought was gonna happen
and I was really surprised that a lot of
people started like coming out of the
the what are you going to call it so the
web security closet if you will right
and started saying hey we did this and
we didn't have any negative security
implications right we rolled it out for
a large client Stephen who I referenced
earlier 20 million users for Sprint
removed masking and duplication of
password no issues tested well measured
and then I had my mind blown because it
turns out somehow Yahoo did this maybe
while I was there I have no idea but a
yahoo eliminated the second password
field displayed full password upon form
submission and not only was there no
security issues but they actually had
very significant improvements to the
overall flow right there's other things
going on there but double-digit
improvements is not a small thing and to
go back to our friends over at LinkedIn
and they just launched a new mobile app
right here and what you'll note is you
can go in here and see the pattern but
they have this funny little eye here
which if you tap you can see your
password and then you can hide it if you
want as well progress in my humble
opinion and the big picture here is
right rather than blindly copying what
we've been doing on the desktop in the
laptop world
let's literally think through what makes
sense for these devices right they're
different different things apply other
nice things we can do on login forms to
sort of deal some of these issues is
that we can use input masks so if you
have to login within at me comm email
address or an at gmail.com email address
we can just create an input mask for at
me calm and then as you type your
letters if you hit an actor or something
like that I will just ignore it and you
don't even have to bother with shifting
over the keys and doing it here
Twitter uses this on their sign-in
screen the way you sign with Twitter
with his aunt handle so they put the app
in an input mask and as you start typing
your characters they take care of that
for you so input masks are another
little trick that we can use so I've got
input types we've got input masks
another little thing and I keep saying
little things but together they add up
to the big package which we'll see in a
second right small little things that
you can do to make this experience
better in aggregate actually can make
the experience a lot better so Korra has
this thing if you try to log in with an
email address that it doesn't know it
says hey no account for this if you want
to create one sign up right now so they
spare you entering a password and
hitting the submit button and then
getting an error back and going through
that whole flow again the other thing
they do it which is a little bit more
aggressive but also very interesting
which is let me log in without a
password on this browser and that is
checked by default remember this smart
defaults idea that I talked about
earlier so by default the first time you
log in this is checked and the second
time you come in you're gonna have just
a little picture to tap no username no
password no button all you do is tap
your picture and you log in and you can
always exit out of this so you can go
exit out of this in another browser what
have you but they've basically taken the
login form and turned it into a picture
which is pretty neat right especially on
a personal device like your phone and
the one of the things that I hear from a
lot of people is okay well this makes
sense for you know a social little Q&amp;amp;A
app like kora but it doesn't make sense
for blank because I work on insert big
hairy thing I think is complex problem
here right I work on Finance I work on
healthcare I work on whatever but here
is a company that's trying to reinvent
what your bank is this is simple and
here where you create the credentials to
go and access your bank account what do
we see there's these show
that's where button and in fact they've
even gone further because they say I'd
pass we're gonna use a passphrase
instead of a password because past
phrases are easier to remember and more
secure than traditional passwords I did
that that DAP so here is a financial
institution big hairy complex whatever
thing you want to call it actually
acknowledging this is a problem
working to resolve it now if we pull all
these things together remember I said a
couple small little things but together
they actually create a pretty
interesting way to optimize and adapt
something as simple as the login form so
a we're not going to remove critical
features like I can't figure out how to
sign in we're gonna use input types and
attributes types equals email type most
password will show the password by
default I'll let people hide it we will
be flexible in what we accept so you can
sign with an email or full name here or
email or username within different
situations
we'll save passwords as possible and
when you actually go to log in on a
screen like this here on our little
Nexus S or whatever this phone is called
Nexus S write the Sprint one pulls the
Sprint one yes all right if you guys
don't know I don't know what to tell you
okay this is an iPhone so we're on our
hi phone here and you enter your email
immediately can tell you hey we don't
know who you are you know save you the
problem of entering your password and
hitting submit if you enter a valid one
great we can sort of show you you're on
track Luke come on in you enter your
password we're gonna show it to you by
default if there's a mysterious guy
behind you you just hit hide and you're
depending on your security tolerance
maybe you have it show versus hide as
the button I personally say you know
there's this giant keyboard which is
much easier to read especially in
illuminates lists but whatever remember
me as law is checked by default so the
next time you log in this is what the
interface looks like and notice I've
created this exile to be much bigger
because frankly people have much larger
fingers and kora thinks they do so we
have to design for that when we create
these mobile experiences and here login
is essentially just a single tap and
tada you're in the experience alright so
we've taken this whole poor thing of
logins usernames passwords down to a
single tap and these ideas I've been
showing them for mobile devices but
there's absolutely no reason we can't do
this on desktops on laptops on tablets
and god knows what's coming next and
speaking of God knows what's coming next
we can really think about this
authentication experience differently in
mobile because we have
friend capabilities we're not limited to
the sorts of things we can do on the web
and on a less top or laptop computer for
instance the mobile device is a phone
phones can send text messages we often
use phone numbers as authentication as
identification for identification
yeah identification for people so what
you can do is hit the button to sign in
and we'll actually send an SMS message
in the background subscribe to SMS
notifications and if we have that record
in our database and we can confirm your
imposition of the phone we just let you
in you could do this seven years ago and
WEP and now there's competing standards
on this so it's a little mucked up
another interesting approach to login
this is the Windows Phone which has very
heavily influenced what Microsoft has
done with Windows 8 in general and this
is this is fascinating to me because
it's sort of like a mobile first
operating system design which I don't
know if we've necessarily seen but one
of the things these two devices have in
common are these two systems have in
common is they're both touch interfaces
and so the way you log in to a Windows 8
machine they have this feature called
picture password and the way picture
password works is you upload a photo
maybe of your family and then you make a
couple gestures like circle or a line or
you know another gesture you can make is
a tap and now you've created a picture
password so this is your computer
and this isn't logging into one web
sites logging into your entire computer
if you want to switch the password you
can or if you want to what you can do is
use your gesture so what you do is you
circle the father-in-law you connect the
two sisters and you tap the
mother-in-law in the nose and today
you're in you just logged into your
computer and I keep using this phrase
and I'll use it again with you guys is I
think this is Microsoft taking a very
humane approach to login because what's
more human right like drawing a picture
of my family
punched a mother-in-law he knows I'm in
or cannot use Texas child special
characters front back second third
fourth character cannot match that's two
characters can't be the same and that
feels very robot to me alright and this
feels very human and again at this point
people will be like you know we'll dummy
that's like kindergarten security right
and let's look at that for a second
because I don't like to be called dummy
that often especially when it sounds
like that what movie is that from violet
I've like turn that into a thing I say
and I have no idea it sounds like it's
from some movie anyway so you got you
have a bank account four digit five
digit PIN here's how many permutations
you have a four digit PIN for a five
digit PIN to get into your bank so from
a brute force attack here's how many
combinations people have to try until
they can get to it
if we change that to an alpha character
write an A to Z character instead of a
numerical character we drastically
increase the number of permutations
someone has to go through typical
complex character password you find on
the web you know they have enforced a
number of character limit so you can't
go up below three here and you can use
numbers or alpha characters which really
increases the number of permutations
against a brute-force attack here's how
many permutations you get with
Microsoft's multi-gesture password now
this is a nice example of usability and
security are not at odds with each other
it's not like this trade-off you have to
make where you can either be secure or
you can be usable pick all right that's
all you get one or the other I think you
can actually do things that create a
better experience and increase security
at the same time you just got to sort of
work together instead of clinging to
these old systems and can you do this on
the web browser since we talked about
web things sure you need touch gestures
which you can get through a touch events
API that chrome and Android WebKit and
all these other guys have and now Chrome
on the desktop too you got image upload
which is available in iOS 6 oh and above
and Android 3 oh and above where you can
actually grab an image from the camera
or from the gallery and tada you've
actually created this username it is a
picture password thing in the web
browser
and speaking of Android
your OS has a similarly interesting
thing for login it's called face unlock
and what you basically do is you smile
at the phone and so it discerns that
you're friendly it uses these dots to
make sure you're actually friendly and
once it determines that you are you have
now created a facial recognition unlock
screen so if someone else pretends to be
friendly to this computer it can knock
it out say no right but then if you go
and look at it here we go instantly in
and she'll say see it works now if you
doubt the security of this approach rest
assured this man's phone was not able to
be foiled by a clever look-alike but
again you know this is a really
interesting way to think about login
right just look at the phone you're in
where's the username where's the
password where's that alphanumeric pin
where is the swipe be gesture weird
thingy that Android devices have just
look at it and you're in could you do
this in the web browser well for that
you need to get user media API which is
actually in chrome 25 I think they're
putting it into chrome 18 for Android
and it's in Firefox Knightley's and it's
in Opera and I one other little example
ATMs in Japan have this really
interesting thing where you are the cash
card so instead of bringing around an
ATM you can use biometrics to get into
your bank and there are techniques that
which you can actually scan fingerprints
when you touch a smartphone now you can
also do things where you detect which
finger is down and when so theoretically
you could have some sort of like you
know gang sign login where - - and
you're in again another way to really
rethink login and that's sort of the
theme here which is yeah we can spend
all this time optimizing those forms and
getting them down to one tap that's cool
but look at all the potential we have
through things like touch through things
like instant access to cameras right
through things like being able to send
SMS messages back and forward this gives
us the opportunity to use mobile as a
way to totally change what login is
versus spending our time dwindling
around the forms I think it's worth
twiddling our in the forms just to be
clear you know the alternative is let's
copy what we have right now and just
make it fit on a small screen okay
that's one way to approach mobile design
the other way to approach mobile design
is let's do a whole bunch of things and
sort of challenge our assumptions let's
show passwords
let's eliminate usernames and passwords
make it one tap to log in all right
let's really push it forward and not
just be stuck with the shackles that we
created for ourselves before and you may
say why bother well remember the mobile
device is always with you always on you
can use it anywhere so wouldn't you want
to make getting into a service as
instantaneous and fast as humanly
possible right don't you want to remove
all these barriers so somebody can take
that high-powered device connect to the
cloud and do whatever they want
instantly and frankly if all we're doing
is focusing on these sort of layout
adjustments we're gonna leave a lot of
bigger opportunities behind and I'm not
saying you know face unlock or picture
password is the future of login but they
don't look anything like a login screen
right there's totally different
experiences that accomplish the same
goal but they've been rethought using
the capabilities of mobile and I think
that's sort of the bigger picture story
to move these things towards the future
one more example and I'll shut up
another one of these linchpin critical
things on the internet that just gets no
love ever and you guys you've probably
seen one of these it's called a check
out screen they're bought anything on
the Internet
yeah so I'm only gonna show one stat for
checkout in 2011 three fourths of
shopping carts were abandoned 3/4 of the
time somebody put something into a
shopping cart they didn't ultimately buy
it which is disconcerting but what's
more disconcerting is it's getting worse
how is it after 20-something years of
designing for the web and making
ecommerce things how are we getting
worse and again I'm scratching my head
here because you know a company like
Dell
although they're private now you know
they take it a time to create this
mobile shopping experience right in fact
they've taken their checkout form all of
it and put it onto mobile including the
ability to provide an extension for your
mobile number and the ability to provide
your daytime fax number an extension for
it and if you happen to make it through
this entire screen they conveniently
tell you that you have the opportunity
to not to agree to their terms of sales
that's why you
completed that entire form to not buy
something here right so the first
message here is like let's think about
ways we can reduce effort when I say
reduced effort I don't mean remove
critical things I mean do the due
diligence to figure out what's the
minimum effort necessary to get
something done there's so many examples
of stuff on expedia in their checkout
flow they had an optional form field
titled company they've removed it
because they saw an usability test and
people were confused they got 12 million
bucks a year
overnight they found 50 to 60 of these
kinds of things okay if you're the guy
who gave them 12 million more of profit
a year overnight because you removed an
optional field they're naming a dish in
the cafeteria after you write it's like
Bob's conversion meatloaf is now on the
menu so we can remove unnecessary
questions we can also do other kinds of
things again sort of rethinking and not
bringing over what we know from the
desktop what is wrong with this on a
mobile device what is wrong with 16
input fields to collect the phone number
on a phone you could just do that it's a
phone it's meant for entering phone
numbers and you may say oh no no but we
need all these options no you don't you
just need to be able to call somebody if
there's something wrong with their order
what we deal with businesses fine okay
maybe they can add an extension if they
still have one you know okay maybe we'll
do that if you really bend to my arm and
smash me against the ground maybe I'll
add another and an option thing right
but that's only like okay you really you
hurt me and I'm not gonna go willingly
we just took 16 input fields down to one
right and in the things where we have
options we make them options you don't
expose these things by default to people
so I have to consider it the others that
we did remember it's a phone so you can
say I'm collecting a phone number and
look what pops up it's a dial pad
well these big fat numbers for entering
phone numbers and guess what the same
thing works on Android which apparently
none of you know but there it is the
same thing works on the Kindle which is
running this really weird web browser
called Amazon silic which I don't know
why they made but here it is all right
input type tell if you ought to really
be nice to
people let's go set up an input mask
where we show them the formatting and as
they start typing it in we're just gonna
keep that formatting and all we'll do is
accept numbers here if they enter any
other format character or anything we'll
just ignore it through our input mask
and away we go so that's one way to be
really nice to people all right we can
sort of condense these inputs and bring
things down other things that we can do
well we what about the address could we
remove optional fields like this four
digit extension and not necessarily in
Aus because some people require the nine
plus four zip code but we can make this
thing flexible and sort of combine those
two but here's another issue select the
state there's a drop-down saying what
happens when you tap that this is the
only reason it's awesome to live in
Alabama if you live in Alabama like
every state drop-down for you is like
one tap you're like I'm living the dream
right salla Bama every earth every other
reason probably not so good but for
everybody else it's like tap scroll
Scroll scroll Scroll scroll whether it's
an iPhone thing or an Android little
dialog scroll Scroll scroll Scroll tap
the one you want happen you're done it's
a multi-tap operation so we could do
instead is maybe you know turn that into
a text field we're now a text field
you're going to enter two characters and
again but still a four tap operation now
we've inserted some potential for errors
because maybe if we will miss type in
and you know we have we have issues the
drop down so it constrains you and
prevents you from making errors although
it makes you swipe around forever so
what about a technique like this where
we can say okay enter your street
address billing apartment number and
then enter a zip through which will get
city and state and if you enter city and
state again remember we're using our big
numerical dial pad here so we'll enter
city and state and now we get San Jose
because there's actually two options
that come with the zip code but we don't
want to use this drop-down thing again
because that's sort of a pain in the
butt so instead what we'll use is a
stepper since they're currently be up to
three of these things you just use the
stepper and you go pop it's a little bit
of a friendlier touch control so all
kinds of things that we can start doing
to make address more manageable and when
people see this they say well Luke what
if we could do ready for magic
PowerPoint transition well what if we do
that this actually makes me really
nervous because I think people are just
going to start entering their entire
address in here and flail and they won't
ever get to this right so maybe that's
not necessarily the way we want to go
with addresses next thing got to pay for
it right credit cards so how does a dell
do this so on dull you select the credit
card use let go you enter all this
information you make your way through
and I think we can get away with doing
something a little bit more like this
so what we're going to do is collect a
credit card your entire payment
information here and we'll set this the
type of number because you want to
collect the credit card number but what
happens when we set it to input type
number look we get all these little
losses it I don't want that look at that
we're like ripe for touch errors what I
want is this thing that I did when I hit
telephone all these big fat number keys
right but this isn't a telephone number
so now like semantics are fighting with
usability so what you can do instead is
set an input type pattern where we will
get this big numeric dial pad so now
you've got this pattern up and what
we're going to do is as you start
entering a credit card will tell you the
type of credit card you have because we
can discern that from the pattern if
it's an invalid credit card number we'll
throw an error if it's valid what we'll
do is just slide it over slide it over
and now we're gonna collect month month
year year because it's still numbers and
there's this big numerical dial pad so
now we enter that and based on the type
of credit card you have we show you
where that CVV code is and again you're
still on the numbers so you enter your
CVV code using that numerical dial pad
and we just capture all the information
you need to collect a payment in one
input field alright so you've never come
off the keypad you're not jumping
between a bunch of input fields it's all
numerical so we've used these input
masks to reduce the potential for errors
because all we'll ever accept his
numbers and you're off to the races
collecting payment info and if you
combine all these things together this
is sort of the uber message I want to
get across to you guys let's look at
what a check out form could be if you're
dealing with digital content like a book
a movie music whatever everything a game
everything is digital these days right
if you're dealing with digital contents
like a little book here we need to be
able to send it to you so here's your
receipts and here's what you can
download it we can use our payment mask
pattern we can collect your credit card
name in one field and then we just have
a button to buy it and that is our three
fields checkout form for comparison
Dells checkout form had 42 input fields
42 input fields compared to three and
you say again why bother doing all this
work well if you've got your phone with
you it's always on available to point of
inspiration somebody tells you about a
book you can just buy it and if you
doubt the impact of lowering these
barriers to entry I point you to Amazon
Prime which is one-click purchasing
today shipping people that use Amazon
Prime will go from spending $400 a year
on Amazon to spending $900 a year on
Amazon they're responsible for like 20%
of US sales because it's so damn easy
look Oh
toothpaste dude right they make it so
darn easy that you just go behind I buy
and this is sort of the model the more
you can reduce these barriers to entry
the better off you are so if we can take
a 42 filled checkout form down to three
all right this is a really really really
big deal and again I've been talking
about doing this on mobile but there's
no reason you can't do this on desktops
laptops tablets and god knows what's
coming next and speaking of God knows
what's coming next let's look at a
couple ways to sort of look towards the
future of a checkout experience again
using the same kinds of capabilities we
talked about before all right so these
mobile devices know where they're at
they have cameras on them they can
process images they can do all kinds of
things so inside of the Apple store app
in the Apple App Store there's a feature
called personal pick up and the way that
works is you shop around you find
something you want to buy you say you
want to pick it up in a store you tell
them the store you want to pick it up in
and that's not the interesting part the
fact that they can find stores near you
the interesting part is when you walk
inside that store somebody comes up to
you and says Luke here's your iPad and
how do they do that well they do that
because they have a Wi-Fi perimeter and
you know they know you bought the thing
on your phone you have your phone with
you because who doesn't walk around with
their phone and as soon as you walk in
it connects the Apple Network and their
little iPad or iPhone comes up and says
hey here's the guy that bought the iPad
go give
all right that is a very interesting
checkout experience to me using mobile
and sort of rethinking what mobile can
do another example here in Korea this is
a Tesco they're a grocery store chain
they're number two they want to be
number one but they don't want to build
giant buildings all over the place right
so what they did is they go to places
where people spend a lot of time and
they put these illuminated placards that
look like grocery store shelves and what
you do is you can go you know like milk
milk milk egg egg cheese you scan the QR
codes you hit by you go on the train you
come home two hours later truck shows up
with your groceries in a city where most
people don't have cars we're carrying
bags of smelly fish on the subway it
might not be so great right this is
awesome and can we do this on the web
sure we can do this on the web through
getusermedia card i/o is sort of the
inverse of this which is instead of
spending money using your mobile device
you can collect the money just by taking
a video of a credit card
it'll process all that info input the
expiration date the number for you and
through this they get actually 2x faster
registration and conversion right and
last but not least and I'll sort of wrap
this up one more example back at Apple
the same Apple Store app in the Apple
App Store which is a tongue-twister by
the way has this feature called easy pay
and what easy pay is if you're in a
store you can scan any barcode on
something that doesn't have a serial
number so an on Apple serial number
product it doesn't matter how much it
costs it can cost like 900 bucks
it doesn't matter you scan it it tells
you what you're looking at you say pay
you enter your password you sign in and
you just bought it you walk out all
right that's all you do point the camera
at the thing you want enter your
password and walk out and if you don't
think people will use barcodes to scan
things they actually do do it a lot so
let's let's compare this stuff for a
second to sort of round this out and
let's go we'll stick with the checkout
example so let's say I want to buy a
mouse I would like to buy a mouse from a
computer manufacturer a computer
manufacturer that could sell me a mouse
as Dell and they have created a mobile
commerce
experience right this is the Dell mobile
commerce experience I'm buying this
mouse okay that continue go continue
almost finished dare you tada
you just bought a mouse on your phone
right like the future of technology is
here contrast that to the Apple example
point your phone at a barcode enter your
password walk out now granted the Apple
examples inside the store so they have
to collect shipping info right but
that's kind of the point here which is
this is a mobile first take on checkout
people have their phone with them wise
oh they'll have their phone in the store
oh the phone has a camera oh it's got
one clip shopping what can we do to
rethink what the checkout experience is
right very much a mobile first sort of
check out thinking mindset this is a
desktop first check out mindset right
what did they do they took their desktop
form they fit it under the small screen
and all the issues that you had on the
big screen are now magnified like Jacobs
knows on that's how you remember this
right just picture that knows are now
magnified on the small screen
alright so mobile first check out
desktop first check out and I'll leave
you to think about you know what does
the future look like
which direction should we be going so to
summarize this I think Mobile is a
massive new medium I don't think it's a
smaller screen I think just treating it
that way really leaves a lot of
opportunities on the table we've looked
at login screens and checkout screens
but you could go through the same
process for anything all right I
deliberately picked these boring lanes
sort of things that everybody's familiar
with just to show you how like there's
opportunity and every little thing
that's out there regardless of how much
we think it's already been solved and if
you start treating it as a unique thing
if you start treating it as its own
things that have the smaller screen the
fit stuff on I think that gives you this
opportunity to really adapt an OP
to my stuff that frankly is a problem
now and those optimizations those
adaptations you do while mobile forces
you to figure that out it's actually
good for all devices right is a faster
checkout experience good for a laptop
user sure is an instant login experience
good for a desktop user sure right I
don't think this is you know restricted
to mobile but mobile sort of has these
constraints and these opportunities that
force you to rethink things which is
great and when you do that right I think
there are opportunities to really think
differently about this stuff right to
look towards what the future of checkout
or login or whatever it is where we're
dealing with on a day to day basis even
on the web and I tried to show some
examples of native applications and how
you can actually do that stuff inside of
websites as well because I don't think
we want to leave the web behind right
and as we look at the future oops and as
we look at the future I think the future
is going to be even more complicated
than it is right now all right we've got
a deal if these mobile devices these
tablets all kinds of things what about
the Apple slap bracelet that's coming
out soon what about the Google glass I
noticed somebody looks a little
different than mine
this is the model they sent me I don't
know if I'm like in the Alpha Explorer
program instead of the early Explorer
program but yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
