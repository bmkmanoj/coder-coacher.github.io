Jacobson will be giving the talk today
he's now working at park palo alto
research center and he just joined there
he came from Indiana University and
before that RSA before that Bell Labs
and before that he got his PhD at UCSD
he always gives interesting talks
usually about some kind of security and
security relating to the problems with
those pesky users so this is one of
those talks and so Marcus thank you and
I wanted to start by inviting you all to
interrupt me at any time if you want me
to clarify or elaborate on something or
or just skip over something that is not
as exciting as exciting as the other
part so please let this be a very
interactive talk and let me start by
saying exactly why I'm doing this and
I'll come to explaining the title later
the way I feel this is the dressing the
weak link right now where passwords are
something that people have started to
get an idea of how to deal with not to
reuse passwords across sites and so on
but password reset questions it's still
something that is poorly understood and
it becomes a meta password pretty much
if you have the same password reset
questions over several sites that is
another password in fact and not only
sit across sites but it's also over time
for most kind of schemes in particular
if the if it relates to your history
where you were born and what your
mother's maiden name you can't really
change it many people especially
technically minded people say well you
could because you could lie and that's a
good point but it's actually irrelevant
for a large segment of the population
because it becomes another password on
if you lie at any time then you created
a password that you need to remember and
you have to deal with a system like this
because you forgot your password in the
first place so having to remember
another password when you forgotten the
first one that you use more off
it's just not the right approach so this
is dealing with the problem of what you
do when you have forgotten the password
so looking at the trends I think it's
clear that people are going to forget
passwords more the first reason is that
there are more sites and hopefully that
means that they're more passwords and
it's going to become harder to remember
all of these many passwords if you don't
have a tool which not everybody does to
keep them and if you do you're tying
yourself down to a machine of course or
if you have a very clear structure in
which case you introduce a security
vulnerability also credentials are going
to be used credentials that are reused
are going to be more vulnerable and
password reset questions of course is
one of those that becomes very
interesting for hackers and fissures to
get and there's already evidence of this
I spoke to a representative of a large
company around here that said that in
order to buy credentials for our users
of that company it costs a dollar on the
black market except if you want the
password reset questions too then it
cost $15 and the reason is clear they're
long-lived when people change their
password they don't change these and
also they have value outside this site
so here's a bunch of typical questions
that are used name of sister's best
friend mother's maiden name your high
school city of birth make of your first
car name of first pet and driver's
license number these are common none of
them are really good so let me pick them
apart one by one so make of your first
car it's pretty easy to say well maybe
it's a common car and maybe it's not
such an expensive car Ford is a good one
it has a very large market share first
name of your best friend it's not a good
one because some names are just more
common than others and this is the kind
of thing that you could find information
on social networks you could just assume
that somebody who writes on the facebook
wall of a particular person might be the
best friend at least at that particular
time the other reasons that why this is
not a good question best friend change
and and it's it should be long-lived our
first name of sister's best friend is
actually even worse not only do you have
to remember it but what if you don't
have a sister so many of the questions
are raised in a way that maybe there is
no answer name of the first or favorite
pet seems like a very good question at
first but then of course not even
talking about records at vets and local
groomers there's the risk of reuse
between different people and in fact
their lists of common pet names online
that makes it pretty easy to strike a
large segment of the population and get
a reasonable percentage right mother's
maiden name it doesn't work very well
the student of mine and I published a
paper a few years ago about how easy it
is to derive from public records with
mother's maiden name is we decided to
select Texas as a choice both because
there's a large number of Texans and
their public records that are pretty
good and because my student has some
beef with with Texas so that was our
example and also their demographically
more representative than California it
could have been done for California just
as well but it would not apply to the
greater population the US population in
this to the same degree so that shows
that with a very high certainty you can
get at least fifteen percent of the
population their mother's maiden name so
these are bad questions for many reasons
also people forget and of course you are
here in a system like this because you
have forgotten you're already stressed
about having forgotten so a trivial fact
that you normally would not forget you
might not be able to remember it at this
time name of the street you grew up on
even though you might not forget
this you might have forgotten what
street you entered when you set it up
you might have grown up on two or three
streets which one was the one what was
the correct spelling what was the
spelling of years before did you write
st your street name of the best friend i
mentioned before it could change city
you were born in there is a
representation problem what was the
representation you entered before of
this and of course an attacker who would
like to have a fair chance would just
try the main metropolitan areas for a
given victim or the same area where the
victim is known to live now and hope
that that is right and then the problem
of people lying to increase the security
that actually decreases the usefulness
of the system in general and it
increases the costs this is a very
expensive proposition too many companies
with over twenty dollars average for a
customer rep initiated or supported
reset so automated resets are important
in the industry to perform and but at
the same time they expose security
problems to to the companies and the
curve you see up here is what's called a
forgetting curve I'm very pleased to be
able to cite research from the late
1800s in this paper that supports this
talk there's a German researcher who
looked at what people forget and the in
conclusion is pretty straightforward
that people forget strange information
more easily that they then they forget
information that seems to apply to their
lives now passwords often are a good
password is often strange information
it's especially if it's assigned to you
so according to that principle people
would forget things more of this type
so there's a good recent soups paper on
the taxonomy of problems so one of the
problems is it's applicable it's a
question that you cannot answer and
therefore it's just a matter it's a
frustration when you set the system up
that there are questions that just do
not apply to you so what high school did
your spouse attend well most people
apply hi attend high school but not
everybody has a spouse there is the not
memorable question name of your teacher
in kindergarten I would not be able to
answer with my kindergarten teachers
name in some of you might then your
remarkable ambiguous question name of
the college you applied to but did not
attend that at first seems like a great
thing because there are no public
records of it but what if you apply to
more than one and that you didn't attend
it happens and you'd have to remember
the same one not only one of them
guessable H when you married and
favorite color there are great examples
of that it's fairly predictable the H
which a person marries a 25 is much more
common than 65 and favorite color there
aren't that many colors and people would
pick red or blue or green or something
one of the standard colors not rust
beige or you know whatever weird color
you might imagine and there's a bunch of
questions that are either attackable or
automatically attackable so that's the
kind of question that company called
varied right now uses if you call your
online banking or 401k service to reset
your password chances are that you'll
have to answer questions about streets
and countess that you've lived in and
where your own property and it's very
easy to find public records about this
in fact that is how these questions were
derived the company that provides the
service goes out and takes all the
public public records compiled huge
databases of it and asks people want to
reset their password for the answers and
anybody who could do the same thing of
course you could also answer the
questions and these aren't very
difficult questions to to answer if you
have access to a search engine so the
intuition of how to approach this
problem is you shouldn't rely on a long
term memory if you could help it but
instead use preferences so preferences
are not documented to the same extent as
long term memorable things facts are and
also since it doesn't have to be
remembered the forgetting curve does not
apply these aren't things that you have
to specifically keep its you you know
these things because it is how you are
also preferences are known to be stable
over time which is a good thing you
might argue that some of your
preferences change over time but not all
of them and you could keep their you
could build a scheme that ensures as as
long as you don't change too many
preferences over time you recognize that
the person you were when you set it up
also preferences are rarely documented
and now people might observe that a lot
of people scream out their preferences
on social network sites but that's a
kind of preferences that you could avoid
for example favorite rock star is a
preference that people might feel like
they want to express on their Facebook
site but whether they like you know
Korean food or not is not quite as
likely to be on their Facebook site and
dislikes are even less likely to be
there especially lukewarm dislikes you
know things you rather not do than doing
but you know you wouldn't die if you had
to do it so this is a screenshot of the
setup for the system and you could go
and play around with us if you want to
it's if you type I forgot my password
calm hyphen between each word then you
get an explanation how the system works
and then you could go to this this is
called blue moon authentication calm
hyphen again between all of the words
the reason for the name choice blue moon
authentication is that hopefully you'll
only have to reset
to your passwords once in a blue moon
and you should succeed then and this is
the setup so what you do here is there's
a number of topics 6 topics here sports
places music food TV and interests and
those are categories that are randomly
ordered so not everybody gets them in
this order and then in each category
there's a number of things that you
could express the preference for and
again these are randomly ordered so that
is to avoid bias of always the same view
of different people doing the setup and
here you could say whether you like
doing your yoga by pressing on the like
button or you dislike it and skating
playing golf playing billiards or pool
and so on you could express your
preferences here and by doing that you
populate these two boxes here the likes
and dislikes this is what you do during
setup of the system and that takes about
two minutes for the average user now
some people at first Express a little
bit of frustration because none of these
might be extreme preferences you know
when people think of likes and dislikes
to think love and hate but that's not
what we want because those are much
easier to anticipate but these are
expected to be lukewarm preferences
where you should think do I slightly
prefer it or do I slightly prefer not to
do it we got music in the background to
and then when you want to reset your
password you come to screen that looks
very much like this where the topics
here are the things that you are already
chosen for example it says cars watch
soccer gospel music punk music and so on
and you have to say whether you're like
or dislike it's one of them now these
are things that you already expressed a
preference for so notice here that you
don't have to remember which once you've
selected during the setup you only have
to take the list of things that were you
had a preference for weather like or
dislike and say which one was it so the
only thing that you have to do is to
think do I slightly more like than
dislike or vice versa for each one of
these and if you your score is above the
threshold here then you succeed and you
have authenticated and now you could
reset your password and of course this
has applications beyond password resets
you could say that if you want just a
little bit more assurance that the
person is who claims to be for a
particular transaction to be carried out
then you could have asked two or three
of these questions to boost your
assurance and if the person answers are
largely correct then you know that's the
extra score needed so behind the user
interface this is what happens you get a
small reward for each correct answer and
you get a much larger punishment for
each incorrect answer and the exact
balance between these can be made in a
way that maximizes your chances of
correctly logging and even if you make a
couple of few mistakes whereas it
minimizes the attackers chances of doing
it and so then it compares to a personal
threshold that corresponds to when you
said when you set things up and also the
size of the rewards and the punishment
they depend on the onion through p4 the
distributions of the answers that you
expressed an interest for they don't all
have the same entropy and a question
with a slightly higher entropy would
give a little bit more score because the
risk is greater for an adversary who
picks the wrong the wrong answer
and your benefit should be slightly
larger too so before I can go on and
really talk about the security I need to
talk about who is the adversary here so
the faceless enemy on the web is the
most prominent adversary they could
either be what we call a naive adversary
who will just get the list of questions
and select at random select the right
number of likes and dislikes but doesn't
know anything about the distribution
doesn't care and it might seem strange
why we would care about such a such a
strict dumb and limited adversary when
after all he might know something about
the distributions and care about it but
actually if you look at most phishing
attacks today they are this kind they're
not maximized for success instead
they're maximize for being simple to
perform the Fisher would rather target
twice as many victims rather than
working a little bit harder and getting
it right and making it more convincing
there's not a strong trend towards a
brilliant attacks the general trend is
not so with even though this is a
limited adverse er it makes sense to
consider the strategic adversary is an
address or who knows distributions so we
assume that the distributions that we
know about the questions and the answers
are distributions that the adversary
know too and they the adversary will
maximize is our chances of success based
on those distributions but doesn't know
anything about the victim in particular
and then the second kind of adversary
here is the acquaintance friend or
family member and to evaluate that we
have performed tests where we asked
people to impersonate one of one of
their acquaintances friends or family
members now family members do very well
at impersonating in fact my wife got a
higher score than I did and so I goes it
goes to prove something I guess not sure
what but acquaintances got a lower score
than the strategic adversary the
acquaintances know a person but doesn't
have all the distribution
and they have to just make a pretty good
guess they were worse off and the front
reasonably close friends fell somewhere
in between we would be from these
experiments and there was a recently
engaged couple who participated in
trying to impersonate each other and we
had qualms for the longest whether we
should tell them that maybe it's not
going to work out they did not do very
well they had no idea who the other
person was the worst attack that we know
of is what we call the ex girlfriend or
ex boyfriend attack this is a person who
knows a lot about you and he was
malicious and let me tell you that it's
not good news but these very strong
attacks like the family member of the
ex-girlfriend ex-boyfriend attack
they're not a typical attacks out there
they're not with the you know bank of
america and paypal worry about because
that's not where they lose most of the
money in fact even though the identity
theft performed by family members is a
very common kind of attack it's very
easy to resolve the money is shipped off
to an address that it's it's obvious
whom it belongs to and or good some
order to that address and it's very
easily resolved family members don't
necessarily make her good criminals so
from a commercial point of view even
though attacks by family members or
ex-boyfriend ex-girlfriend might seem
like it worried something commercially
speaking it is not such a worry
something as the faceless adversary on
the web what is worrisome though is the
website cloning attacker so imagine that
you wanted to know my bank of america
credentials or paypal credentials
doesn't matter you set up a system which
you don't try to impersonate one of
those sites you might have a cartoon
website or news feed or something like
that and you ask me to you know if I
want to have my preferences registered
or even if want to use the premium
version then I need to set up an account
and then I of course need to answer
password reset questions the questions
you asked me are exactly those that are
asked
the company you would like to get access
for my account for so you know those
questions beforehand of course and
that's what I refer to as the website
cloning attacker it doesn't clone the
whole website but it clones the
particular questions now it knows the
answers to those questions and now view
the evil attacker you have the answer
you could reset my question my password
potentially so the results that I'm
going to talk about are backed up by a
bunch of experiments the first
experiment was to use a little bit more
than 400 college students and ask them
lots of questions about what they prefer
and not prefer to do and from this we've
ruled out some really bad questions that
were obvious from a large population
from from this population that they were
not going to help be helpful for example
you'd like to watch TV not a good one
most people said yes and so it's it's
obvious that an attacker would say yes
in this case this is actually the time I
could explain the title for the talk
love and authentication because what we
did was we asked the questions we asked
people were questions that we scraped
from online dating sites our gut feeling
was that people who register there they
don't really register things of their
long-term memory like where they lived
and so not in order to be matched with
their potential mate it's just not
relevant but they would ask answer
questions that relate to who they are
and how they are and so we took all of
those questions we remove the obvious
bad ones like do you have a tattoo on
your back and things that should not be
asked to a bunch of college students
unless you want to lose you know not
have a tenured position anymore there's
some dating sites that are pretty
explicit so we asked the a bunch of
questions that were still considered
reasonably secure to ask and then we
weeded out those that were bad so bad
questions being low entropy we kept
almost 200 of these questions
and then we used Amazon Mechanical Turk
in a very similar fashion we asked
people to express preferences and now we
could use much more people we use more
than a thousand Turks in order to rate
questions and also to set up thanks
using this interface they did a set up
in the authentication and we could
observe the distributions for the
various things oh I'm sorry so
Mechanical Turk is it's an online forum
where people can perform small task task
for a small reward so for example if you
have a huge number of photos and you
would like them all to be turned in the
right direction you might put them up as
tasks where somebody who would like to
say how to to turn the photo in order
for it to be correct would earn one or
two cents and so what we did was that we
put up tasks where people express their
preferences and then they registered and
then they did the authentication for for
large number of users in order to it's
pretty much duplicates normal human
subjects tests but it's much faster to
perform you could easily get a thousand
results in the day or two if you if
you're willing to pay enough and in this
context pay enough means 26 cents per
per user it's remarkably inexpensive too
so it's a good way of performing
usability experiments and in addition we
emulated a large number of users so we
created what you might think of as
artificial profiles from the
distributions we already have observed
from other users just in order to have a
much larger user set and we verified
that these are statistically similar to
the actual real profiles and we did that
because we needed a very large number of
profiles in order to get statistical
accuracy for the false positives
estimates
so when we did this we asked people to
set up and then immediately afterwards
we asked them to authenticate in a real
system that would never happen of course
you would authenticate and answer the
questions when you have lost your
password but we did it just to verify
that the question eve topics that people
selected first were not selected at
random especially on Mechanical Turk
you'd have to assume that some number of
people just click in order to go get
those 26 cents and it doesn't matter
what to click on so what we did was we
did not allow people to go back and see
what they had selected before but
immediately after they did the set up we
asked them to perform the authentication
to see if they were reasonably close to
what they had expressed this was to weed
out people who obviously cheated and you
could see here there's some people who
got 13 out of 16 right bunch who got 14
15 most of them got all of them right
and the red line here is the threshold
that we would have required if this were
a real authentication so you actually we
were very surprised that there were no
no cheaters at all we had expected a
much larger number of people who would
behave not so ethically and just in
order to get the small reward so that
was a good surprise now when we
bigger party okay so the question is how
many people started the survey or the
setup enta keishon but did not complete
it that was a very very small number of
them I don't remember the exact number
but it was maybe 10 or 20 out of those
thousand users so which the reason was
probably that it was a fairly simple
task to carry out and many of the
subject seemed to think that it was
interesting we got lots of requests for
follow-up experiments and they wanted to
be notified if we're going to run more
studies of this kind so we got the
feeling that people actually liked to do
this it's not as dry as many other
systems and they felt like they were
helping science because we explained
what it was for now this is the showing
some of the results we use SurveyMonkey
to ask people about their preferences
and this is the the printout from
SurveyMonkey you could see here that
this is the like column here the first
column this is the no opinion column and
this is the dislike column for various
questions that the top question here is
reggae and there's a forty three percent
like there's a 27-percent no opinion
which means that it wasn't selected or
it was kept in the no opinion and at
twenty-nine percent dislike so if you
compare the like in the dislikes you'll
see that they're more likes than
dislikes there's an imbalance so that
lowers the entropy here it's somewhat
easy to guess for a random subject that
they will like reggae there's almost
white or third as many people who like
reggae than this like reggae reggae is
not the greatest question but it's not a
bad one you could see liking folk music
or disliking folk music thirty-six
percent like it thirty-four percent
dislike it so this is in fact a really
good question it's uh if you only know
that I have selected folk music but you
don't know anything about me then it's
almost equal chances that i like it and
i dislike
yes it's a pretty bad question
forty-seven percent of people like just
twenty-five percent of people dislike
just now this is for the population that
we asked to participate you might argue
but independent studies show that this
is a fairly representative population of
the US population in general except for
that there are more women on Mechanical
Turk than in real life as a proportion
at least we don't quite know why it's
exciting it's the place to go if you
want to date I guess so then this is to
chart the entropy of the questions as we
figured out from this previous graph so
there are some questions that are just
horrible and those are of course
questions that we want to avoid
including in a real password
authentication scheme then there some
whole lot of questions that are oops
sorry that are pretty decent there up on
this plateau those are the questions we
want to keep then you can look at
correlation between questions we did
pairwise correlation and we saw that
there's some that are very very
correlated for example garage sales and
flea markets anybody who likes either is
very very likely to like the other so
that's those two questions should not
both be included we have to remove one
of them if people enjoy political events
and politics that similarly had a very
high correlation you know that should
not surprise us and we were silly for
not catching that before so this was
really a weeding stage where we removed
the questions that turned out not to be
suitable in combination you can see
though that most of them over here a
very small correlation there's a
remarkably small number of them with
negative correlation but as you see here
the negative correlation is not very
strong and you could largely ignore that
in terms of the effect it has on the
system
so this is the worst questions to ask
this is just a selection so on top of
its political events and politics and
then flea markets and garage sales these
are the kind of things that we had to
remove on the bottom here there's racing
motocross and motorcycles I guess
there's no there shouldn't be any big
surprises in this list there are things
that when you look at them you say oh I
guess if you like this then you like the
other one too but the best way of course
is for us to just throw all the
questions in there and see what comes
out which ones turn out to be good and
not so good those with slight negative
correlation easy listening in Punk it
should not come as a huge surprise that
people don't typically like both of them
watching reality shows and folk that's a
little bit more of a surprise to me and
watching reality shows in bookstores you
know these are things that you might
want to throw out one of them just in
order to avoid the negative correlation
their free time I know maybe just
watching reality shows for that reason
it's a thing that people have strange
correlation I don't know so that's an
interesting list just two for the
weeding purposes and then you have
things with remarkably low correlation
like watching reality shows and
motorcycles almost no correlation at all
so those are questions that it doesn't
matter if you ask them together it's not
going to be who've an attacker at all
knowing the correlation here and this is
just a heat map of the all the pairs of
correlation so yellow is really bad and
red is kind of bad dark red and blackish
means a good question or a good set of
questions to ask in addition to this one
could perform vector analysis where you
you look at clusters of questions and
that's work that is ongoing right now
not only to look at pairwise correlation
but also try to see if you like a and B
then you're more likely to lexi is as
well but this goes towards defending
against
because that is much more powerful
really than what we believe is necessary
but it's good to extrapolate and
understand still of course so the
experiments in the experiments we want
to measure both false positives and
false negatives the false negatives are
done by actual user experiments where
people set up and then after some time
long enough that it's not maintaining
short-term memory they come back and
they express their preferences according
to the authentication system and then
they're given a score and so this was
run after two weeks after the
authentication and we did a relatively
small number of people for this one but
it was large enough that we could see
that there wasn't really any problem the
people did not change over that course
of time the preferences as they had
expressed them before and then we're
falling back on a psychology research
that shows that in general people don't
change preferences very much over longer
periods of time and then we looked at
the false positives this strategic
adversary at less than half a percent if
we ask 16 questions and the naive
adversary the adversary only guesses at
random that that's much easier to
anticipate what that would be because
you could even you know you don't need
to perform the experiment to say that
and that is close to zero percent and
these are plots that show for various
thresholds here on the x-axis what is
the false negative what is the false
positive for the strategic and for the
naive and and you can see here for most
thresholds here that's very low and
there's a bump up here and it goes up to
between two and three percent if you set
the threshold too high so of course that
means the threshold of what is an
acceptable score should be set somewhere
around here and this curve over here is
the precision of the false positive
rates and that's where we needed the
emulated users because it turns out that
in order to get significance and to get
a high precision you
a very large number of users towards
49,000 and we could not have so many
actual user profiles and that's why we
supplemented our actual user profiles
with the emulator you've user profiles
which is a little bit of a stretch but
it's only in order to get an
understanding for the for the accuracy
of the false positive rate so we could
say with reasonable likelihood what we
have here is representing reality so
this of course they represent the
strategic and the naive adversary's they
do not represent the family members and
the ex-girlfriend ex-boyfriend attacks
those as I mentioned are much worse but
those also I should mention could be
dealt with in orthogonal manners for
example many of the deployed schemes
require in addition to knowing the
answers to the questions that you need
to access your email account a link is
sent out to your email account and then
you would have to to follow that link
and then answer the questions and that
makes it harder even for insiders to do
it now that is also usability
vulnerability because people change
email accounts sometimes far faster and
more frequently than they access
accounts for example your 418 401k
account you might not access it more
than every two or three years and you
might change email accounts more often
so the conclusion here is that
preferences they don't change
dramatically and very quickly they are
changed very slowly and that's something
that we could leverage on and we can get
really good error rates and using a
practical interface I haven't mentioned
it yet but imagine doing password reset
for the traditional schemes on an iPhone
you'd have to type in the name of the
street you grew up on or their mother's
maiden name it's it could be frustrating
experiment experience whereas clicking
boxes it's much easier and you could
even have a voice driven interface where
you simp
just on the phone say yes no yes yes
press one and two so the user interface
is more appealing for the approach that
we suggest here and then you could also
have orthogonal security techniques to
deal with insiders the background here
is the faded background is that forget
me not flower but by the way it's
probably not very visible but you know
if I start with a one flower I have to
end with another one I guess and so I
before I end and open up the questions I
want to recognize the the help and the
participation I've gotten from a lot of
other researchers who have been involved
in this project since it started this is
a project that has been going on for a
little bit more than two years and
there's been a crew of HCI people
security people and psychologists
involved in one way or another in
developing this you could read more if
you go to a dub dub I forgot my password
com you could try it out on blue moon
authentication calm and of course you
could contact me with questions Marcus
Jacobs under par kaam so I have time for
questions
yes ducky show where do you think the
threshold and fifty-five sixty percent
something he essentially have zero was
that after one times that was measured
with users so false using false positive
or false negatives well David's right
now with both the false negatives is
when actual users having registered they
log into the system and they succeed to
log into the system so the question is
how long after the setup did they
perform the authentication around two
weeks not not all the subjects were
exactly two weeks because there's the
the practical issues of getting people
in and performing the experiment but i
believe 12 to 16 days almost all of them
and so that was the time that
psychologists suggested would be a good
good approximate time because you want
to make very sure that nothing is stored
in short-term memory obviously nothing
is going to be retained that long and
short-term memory and just to be sure we
make it much longer then what's
necessary and so that's the two-week
span that should have rather similar
results as if we had waited a year we
believe of course we'd have to try the
same experiments in after a longer time
to really assert that this is true and
it might be that the score would degrade
over time to a certain extent and that
could be taken into consideration in the
policy mechanism that decides what is a
passing score you had a question
so a strategic adversary we have a five
percent success rate and what their
success rate they were attacking
the question is if you compare the
success rate of a strategic adversary
who in this scheme has a point five
percent probability of success what
would they have what's the probability
of success using normal questions that
is somewhat harder to measure for sure
you know without doing it I could say
that for example using mother's maiden
name as the research question and
falling back on the research i mentioned
earlier on relating to texas there we
would get a fifteen percent success rate
for fifteen percent of the portion of
people we know for sure and then about
another ten percent we know with a very
big likelihood we know that they're only
two or three choices and so the question
then becomes how many tries with the
adversary get in order to do this the
numbers i reported on here is for one
try the analysis gets much more complex
if you let the adverse I have to eat
rice for example because the best
strategy would take into consideration
the distributions of course and try to
maximize the chances so my answer I'm
trying to avoid answering it because I
can't answer it we cannot know with
certainty what the false positive rates
offer their six existing scheme we just
know of the obvious vulnerabilities and
if you were to if you were to pick one
particular scheme like the one where you
have to say out of these four addresses
which one have you lived on I could say
with a very high probability it would be
beaten for any given person just because
of the public records you get for doing
a white pages search and then you have
to answer a follow-up question about
what countess you have lived in but that
only requires that you do a little bit
more work to see what what counters were
those addresses and so it for us
reasonably dedicated attacker
doesn't take much at all so don't make
me say the percentage but I would say
it's more likely to be beaten they're
not for a given person yes the time
official news here are more people over
the world while questions like your
mother's waiting-maid will be totally
different in us right now the point is
that this might be useful in other
countries and it's true in certain
countries mother's maiden name for sure
is not a meaningful thing to ask for
authentication say China or Korea where
there's it's fairly obvious what your
mother's maiden name is because there's
only four or five common last names it's
not a good authentication question now
it does the selection of questions does
have a cultural correlation you could
ask people in the US for example if they
like baseball or not and that might be
reasonably good question but in Europe
it might not be such a good question at
all and you don't ask people in India
whether like cricket or not because the
answer is going to be obvious so you
have to do a similar kind of screening
of questions / on a per country basis
now it does have other benefits for
example in Europe there are very strict
there's very strict regulation about
what kind of questions or what kind of
data you're allowed to store about
people you need permits for storing
pretty much anything preference is
excluded if you like sushi or vegetarian
food and if you want to tell me I could
store that and that is not a problem so
in countries where the laws and the
adherence to the law is very strict
Germany has been brought up in as an
example this is a good approach because
people don't feel bad about it and
there's no legal requirements for it yes
buildings fear experiments in terms of
the false negative rate where the
experiments conducted under the
assumption that this was their primary
authentication mechanism or did they
have to set a password and were they
under the impression that this was a
secondary education okay that could
imagine that would affect the false
negative okay the question is did the
users think that this was their primary
or secondary authentication method when
we performed experiments to back up the
D false negatives and in fact they
didn't know why they were doing it we we
wanted it to be realistic but if we say
that you do this to reset access to
something you really need that
corresponds to a very strong incentive
to do things right but if we try to give
a similar very strong incentive for
people participating in the subject and
say if you get the answers right then
we'll give you 50 bucks then we know
that there people are going to leave
exactly they're going to write it down
and so then we're not measuring the
truth anymore so we had to be very
careful what we did was we performed two
sets of experiments in the first one
subject took the first part of the test
the authentication and then came back
after two weeks and they had no
particular instructions in the second
group they were exactly the same thing
but as they came back after two weeks
they were told that if you score about
the fifty percent of people who had the
highest score you get another five bucks
so some of them who had already cheated
in the first phase because they thought
that this was a meaningless exercise
that allowed them to get a couple of
dollars they were not able to do that in
the second phase and of course when we
saw that it was obvious from a person's
participation that they were cheating
they were considered outliers so if
somebody said they liked everything
because the buttons are aligned and it's
easier to click like for everything then
we say this is not a subject who is
participating in the study and we remove
them it would have to be realistic and
sirs but we could never say if a random
clicking would be realistic or not and
so when we give people in some type of
thinking hard what they really feel like
we saw that the the success rates
improved not dramatically but a little
bit so it means that if you if you know
that this is valuable to do it right
you're going to do better and so this is
a lower bound in some way we know that
people are going to do better than we
thought and so our false positive is an
upper bound well it seems silly to say
that zero is an upper bound but it's
just about where we put the threshold
and how we balance thing yes
okay the question is what if this gets
accepted everywhere and would you guys
have to type in the preferences for
every bank site first of all if it gets
accepted everywhere I'd be very pleased
but that's a kind of an orthogonal issue
how you maintain this if you do it in a
federated sense or not that's really
that's another question it could be kept
by one company that knows your
preferences and then just sends an OK to
the other companies or it could be kept
in a distributed fashion and now
remember if you go back to the website
cloning attacker that's an attacker who
know something about you because they
asked the same questions that is
actually not such a likely attack for
the system because remember the topics
that you're asked about during your
legitimate setup and the order of them
and the order of the categories it's
going to be random and there's a very
large number of things that you could
select if I r % an attacker and i would
like to capture your answers it's a very
very unlikely event that i would be able
to post you with the same questions and
have you respond so they're too obvious
ways of dealing with this one is to ask
you all the questions five hundred
questions if we have them ask you to
answer all of them that should make
people suspicious and bored the other
one is to perform a man-in-the-middle
attack where you go to the
authentication stage you see what are
the questions asked of this person and
then you ask them to answer only those
questions that is in one sense it's a
more powerful attack but it's also an
attack that is easier to detect any
active man in the middle who goes
somewhere would leave IP traces and also
if they want to do it for a reasonable
number of victims at any time if you
think of it as a phishing attack the
peak of request would be making it a
very obvious attack so that's not a such
a big problem from a practical point of
view yes
questions and they ask you to be 20 of
them in detail whether you like
something
then if an Africa wants obviously
personate you you can just turn the same
pool of questions and probably pick the
same questions and the same answers
because you feel strongly about
something you don't know okay so the
person is set at bank a process you with
500 question and you select twenty of
them an attacker wants to know what what
your answers are he would just push you
with the same five hundred questions now
this is where the randomized order comes
in there are going to be much much more
than 20 things that you have a
preference for weather like and dislike
and the attacker is not going to get a
consistent selection but also where
there might be five hundred questions
they're not going to be five hundred
questions available for a given user at
any one time so if you come to the
system you might have six categories
with 12 in each these are populated from
the 500 questions at random well if the
attacker hopes to set this up again he
would have to take another selection
from the 500 or again have a very
different user experience where the user
is inundated with questions or forced to
answer many more and that should make
people aware of it but there's also the
and there's always the the question will
people understand that they're being
defrauded and we don't know yes
okay question is after we removed the
low entropy and highly correlated
questions how many were left currently I
believe we have hundred twenty questions
that are good this might seem silly but
it's a very exciting area research
really to develop new questions I think
right now I have condiments I challenge
you to guess what good entropy condiment
questions are not ketchup so you could
expand you could improve the security by
expanding the number of categories and
select the right kind of items of these
and using this approach we hope to have
a couple of hundred of very good
questions within too long before too
long yes you have a couple hundred
questions you ask the user to out of
around 80 questions you ask the easier
to identify 20 and you present the
fullest of 20 or you present some subset
of what the user originally selected for
that theory okay this is a good question
the question is if you ask the person to
select twenty question to select twenty
topics do you later ask them the same 20
later we actually use 16 to get this but
you could of course do more we as a
policy question we just say the same
ones as you select during the
authentication are the ones that you are
asked later you could ask a subset you
could even ask a super set and the
system could introduce other questions
where if you don't have a strong
preference for them you know it's not a
big deal you will figure out if you
slightly dislike it more than you do
then you dislike it you might be a
little bit puzzled because you don't
recognize this question but you know
it's not going to affect your response
to the other questions this has a couple
of benefits one is that if you actually
do express a preference that's a new
question that the system has an answer
for you for another one is that it's now
it's going to be harder for the attacker
to know in the current system the
attacker would know that
out of these sixteen eight would be like
sand it will be dislikes but if we have
kind of chat questions enter there it's
not so clear how many would be like sand
versus dislikes and the attacker would
first have to kind of eliminate those or
or just have an optimal strategy
involving all of them and that becomes
harder so there are many kind of policy
extensions to this a last question all
right then I thank you thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
