we're very excited to have some
immigrants represented here tonight we
do have a lot of partnerships that we
have for up years hopefully we can have
some events that can cater to every
organization moving into our next topic
we actually are going to hear from a
Google engineer like to give you a bit
of information about her and apologize
for reading this but I don't want to get
anything wrong so our speaker is
Fernando das she's at a computational
designer whose work focuses on the
social collaborative and artistic
aspects of information visualization she
is a co-leader with Martin Wattenberg of
Google's big picture data visualization
proving cambridge here for 20 google she
wanted fleming media incorporated into
visualizations video focused on media
consumer-oriented projects and prior to
that they led ibm's visual computing
communication lab where they created
group groundbreaking public
visualization platform called many eyes
and experiment an open public data
visualization and analysis before
joining IBM Vegas's research at the MIT
Media Lab focused on the visualization
of online communities she is known for
her pioneering work under 15 chat
histories email archives and Wikipedia
activity Vegas is interesting the
stories that people tell about these
activities legend a series of
visualizations of personal emotionally
charged data for artistic visualizations
that you such as the New York Museum of
Modern Art the Boston institute of
contemporary heart and the whitney
museum of american art biggest holds a
PhD mms from the Media Lab at MIT she's
Brazilian and she misses the year-round
warm weather she had appeared in Rio de
Janeiro where she grew up so I'd like
you all to welcome you in that welcoming
Fernanda that's what it works I have a
lot of live demos so there's a lot of
opportunity for things to go wrong here
tonight so anyway it's a it's an honor
to be here talking to you guys inside
it's always an honor to be talking to so
good to an audience with so many women I
have to say which is quite different
it's a nice change um so I'm going to
talk about something that I think is
starting to impact all of us which is
visualization culture and what do I mean
by this I mean that when I first started
working in this field about 10 years ago
visualization was something that
scientists did and you know serious
people with a lot of expertise they did
like businesspeople and scientists and
it used to look something like this it
was mainly done by men and they looked
very colorful and very especially
interesting and it was something that
again was done for a scientific insight
mainly or for you know
but the cool thing is that scientists
don't have a monopoly over this kind of
technology / anymore and in fact this is
the change I want to talk about tonight
artists for instance are starting to use
this technology in very interesting way
so what I'm showing here is actually
something that is not new this piece is
an art piece back from the 90s it's by
an artist named Jason Sullivan and it's
called homes for sale what he did here
is he collected a hundred pictures of
homes for sale endymion six different
cities in the US so you have to seattle
at the top left here and miami at the
bottom right um and then he superimposed
all of these pictures and average the
color of each pixel okay and so what you
end up with are these ghostly images you
don't see any individual house but you
see something of the overall median
house for sale in that city so you can
see that at the top there on the left in
OC 80 is a Washington Missy appraised at
the bottom middle here Dallas hosts the
greenest lawns and Miami has the bluest
skies okay and then took this same
technique and aimed it at something very
different of which are photo books so
you haven't been
19 and the top and the class of nineteen
sixty-seven at the bottom so this is a
studying bad hairdos and you can have
any traces of my bad what he did next is
he took this and showed every Playboy
centerfold by decade okay so you can see
that's the 60s at the end there six to
seven days and nights and we can get us
instead playboy bunnies are getting
whiter skin and launder as time goes by
so whatever that says about our culture
what it means is that this artist was
you know back in the 90s taking some
pretty cutting-edge technology to look
at rites of passage at cultural icons
and so forth fast-forward to 2006 this
is a peaceful if you find by jonathan
harris in September and what they were
interested in here was they reminding
the blogosphere to understand how people
were feeling so they were looking for
sentences like I feel what we feel or I
felt and then you wouldn't start
counting what is it that people said
afterwards I feel happy I feel lucky I
feel sad and then he started visualizing
and even breaking it now by them
correctly so those are like women and
the women in the 20s in cold places and
this is what they're doing right right
now and then finally the web you know
web visualization becomes news so I am
sure that most of you must have come
across some of the New York Times
visualizations interactive
visualizations online right and they are
really efficient the envelope when what
visualization can be in this day and age
so this for instance is a
utilization of violence 2013 budget
proposal where each circle has to do
with a specific program that the area of
the circle is how much how many dollars
are going there green means that girl
runs getting more dollars red means that
program is getting less dollars it's a
very different way of looking at tons of
numbers at the same time and keep in
mind this is like this is not just for
experts this is for anyone right it's
New York Times reader on the web it's
sort of like here oh and make sense of
this really interesting and
sophisticated Brad this is another piece
they did this past year because the
election was so close that day was a
visual events are were all the different
planets that could take each one of the
of the candidates to the presidency so
you know if Obama wins Florida then
these are the other paths ray if Romney
wins Florida then these are used so this
is sort of like the simulation I
remember getting friends for on election
night words sort of sitting in front of
this visualization playing with it back
and forth to try to understand oh my god
okay so if this other state goes you
know to Romney what happens next if this
other say goes to Obama what happens
next so this is really just a simulation
of a whole bunch of different scenarios
that could happen but you really know
that visualization has made it big when
it becomes part of a comic strip
I am sure a lot of you consume earlier
familiar with an XP CD and what he did
here he was creating these narrative
plots where he was looking at the top
here he was looking at Lord of the Rings
and he was so the horizontal axis is
time and then he was plotting when
characters different characters were
coming together or setting apart and
then coming together and you know there
are a lot of sort of plots and subplots
happening at the same time in the middle
here Star Wars you know so you get the
you get the idea for the cool thing for
me as a visualization researcher was
that um this very chart actually
inspired at least a couple of
submissions to the top information
visualization conference in the world so
here are scientists being inspired by a
comic strip trying to visualize
narrative right so how cool is that that
we're sort of reversing years here and
it's not just visualization coming out
of the ivory tower it's sort of like oh
look at all this interesting styling
stuff around us then artists writers
comic strip writers are doing what can
we take panel so how did we get there
and this is where I get to talk about my
work and hopefully some of these
projects will give you a sense of how of
my own personal behalf in understanding
all the different uses that
visualization can have and how it
becomes more powerful the more
mainstream it is so back in 2003 I
started working with Martin water Britni
by the way all the work that i'm showing
you today tonight is actually working
with Martin so we're going to hear
we it's Martin and me we looked at
Wikipedia this is 2003 so you have to
remember that this is a time when nobody
knew what we maybe it was was the
beginning of what if you do let alone
what a week II meant right so what does
this thing but we happen to look at it
and we thought wow isn't it interesting
that people are coming together and you
know creating these pretty sophisticated
because you're pretty sophisticated
articles that have pictures they have
like tables of contents hard aliens so
we've realized at the bottom of each
page that was an edit this patient but
then we also realize that Wikipedia
makes it makes every edit to any article
public on its website so this is the
history of edits to that article that we
were just looking at and it's basically
like a lot of everything that happens to
that article so you can see when the
Edit happened who edited and what they
did and if they left a little comment
saying what it is they did so we looked
at this for like wow this is it this is
what we need to visualize to try to
understand how people are doing what it
is that they're doing and really nobody
had visualized we can be there before we
had no idea if we're going to find
anything interesting or even maple but
we set out to to try it so this is how
the visualization works imagine you have
three people who are working together on
on a document in this case so we can be
the article ok Mary Susan and Martin and
I'm going to color them in different
colors and version one is all written by
Mary she puts together a little outline
or something and so we're creating a
fine that represents the length of that
article and it's all colored by her
color because she's the one who authored
then inversion to Susanne comes along
and says this all looks nice but I want
to add a little paragraph to the end so
her little paragraph in blue shows up in
her color and it's just a small city and
then he goes on and on and you know
someone deletes texts you see that piece
of tech strength the wine their strength
and so forth what we did then is we
started connecting pieces of text that
stayed the same over time so you start
to get these shapes colorful shapes and
you start to get things like poles to
you know which means that either some
content was added or it was deleted okay
and then we can start to play some
interesting games with us what I'm
showing you here is each version equally
distanced from each other right but I
can also show the same data in real time
and then we can start to get a sense of
rhythm so you can see that between
version 1 and 2 a lot of time test event
version 3 came up really fast okay and
then I can start to highlight each
version and see the text on the right
with the different color
the authors so let me show you the first
demo let me show you history flow i can
so i am showing remember this is 2003
data this is why we were working on this
August project this is the history flow
the history of edits for the article on
design so i have this wand here that I'm
moving and it's done showing me every
different version of this article so
okay not a very interesting article let
me bring up a more interesting article
so this is the article on cats okay so
you have three on the left August
poquette's are always babe nylon don't
have to pay you list of authors and on
the right you have the article itself I
can start browsing through the article
is pretty long but the thing I want to
call attention to is this white spike
here and the bottom is it sort of like
hanging out there by itself so what is
what happened so if i bring my wand here
i can see that someone added a whole
bunch of paragraphs and they are all
talking about the unix command cat I
knew this on expert understand this so
what happens then right does someone
just go ahead and delete the whole thing
so if I look at the next version I see
that no and it's not just the leading
they created a new page called cat units
and redirected an entire piece of
content there right so this is some of
the dynamics that we started uncovering
is how do you negotiate what piece of
content fits or doesn't fit within a
given particle so now let me show you
the article and abortion so this
anything
try to you as different or we are here
what somebody saying has been deleted
exactly so these black gashes here are
massive deletions this is a huge article
as you can imagine on abortion it's
beautifully written and then someone
comes and leaves the whole thing it gets
restored and then someone over here it
deletes it and says abortion is great
and then they come back and they say
abortion is good and that it gets fixed
so okay so we know that was vandalism in
Wikipedia it's interesting to actually
see it but the cool thing the
interesting thing to us is that when you
when I highlight is deleted version at
the very bottom there is a timestamp and
it says that the deletion happened on
the seventeenth of December and 406 okay
and then if I look at when it got fixed
it's the same day at 407 it's again
equator around like how are you how are
these guys doing this and this is
something we started seeing in a bunch
of ages it's just like one minute two
minutes aware you look at fixed we're
like how are you guys doing this so we
talked to be companions and they
told us about something on a watch list
which is whatever you edit an article
you can sign up to watch it and whenever
that article gets touched you get a
notification that says you know your are
very touched and then we're like okay so
do you watch like one or two articles
they're like oh no we watched hundreds
of them sometimes thousands I'm like
okay rewind again how are you do this
and so they explained that you know a
whole community will watch sometimes a
single page and then the other strategy
is if when you get the notification if
you recognize the name of the person who
edited and you trust them you sort of
don't even bother looking at it but if
it's an unknown IP address or a new you
know user you might want to go check and
make sure they're doing the right thing
in fact if actually the same data spaced
out by real-time those things were so
fast you don't even see the dashes
anymore right and then the last page i
want to show you where we compete it is
one of my favorites it's chocolate so
it's very thing but you know other than
that not very interesting except that
when I space it out but by versions I
get this interesting pattern right
things out and I always say that when it
when I saw that I was like I want a
scarf that looks like this but does
anyone have any idea of what this exact
mining exactly it's an edit war right
someone put something and gets the read
it and gets put back against the lead I
can show you what it is so epic back
here this little piece of white text was
inserted and it's this small paragraph
that says extremely rarely melted
chocolate has been used to make a kind
of surrealist sculpture called collage
so that piece survives for a long time
right until so and it was put by someone
called Daniel C Boyer until someone here
says removing Boyer invention well
Daniel compass wagon says reburning
collage is not a Boyar convention
someone says google search for chocolate
collage eyes only Boyer reverting leave
your humbug out regrading and so
Florence my hotel which is laborious
sort of gives up which is really bad
because nick martin and i did a search
afterwards and my collage does exist the
other thing we did is to get rid of all
the catbird information so not have
colors my father but just get the text
darker the old Ernie God okay so why are
we doing this well we're doing this
because in a place like Wikipedia old
untouched text could be a proxy for
quality for high quality text that the
community doesn't feel needs to be
edited and if I scroll down this article
you can see that there's quite a lot of
dark text there that people are working
around so
it was really nice to see this so one of
it what happened with this we we did
this visualization started to see these
patterns and we wanted to know if things
like the very very fast fixing of mass
deletions how general how generalizable
that was so given that we were seeing
these patterns what we did then is we
downloaded all of Wikipedia and ran a
statistical analysis to understand how
fast on average those faces were
happening and they were happening within
a couple of minutes for the entire site
so that was average which was really
interesting to see so now let's go back
yes yes okay so from Wikipedia we
started realizing the importance of
social and the fact that people were
looking starting with the visualizations
not only has you know tools to use in
isolation but really as part of bigger
conversations and interesting back and
forth so that they were having with with
other people so we thought how can we
design an environment where
communication is art of visualization
from the ground up and that's what many
eyes is so many eyes was launched in
2007 and it was it is it's sewn running
it's a site it's a public free site
where anyone can upload data visualized
that data and share those visualizations
with others so let me see if I can
actually
feel a little back and forth here yes
let's hope this works
all right let me just see yes okay so
this is many eyes as it stands today and
basically it's sort of like a media site
where you go there then there's always
some interesting visualization being
highlighted on the front page and you
can see that people are using a bunch of
different visualization techniques and
they are looking at very different data
sets so the exercise the little thing I
want to do with you guys now is a little
exercise I'm about to show you a map a
world map of alcohol consumption per
capita per country okay so when I do
this what country do you think is going
to be the champion what country do you
think is going to be the one with the
highest alcohol consumption in the world
Russia okay Russia any other guesses
Germany France Belgium okay all good
guesses so oh I was afraid at this you
know guess we're gonna have to wait it
out if this guy and start again so isn't
that fun I told you there were a lot of
opportunities for them to go comments to
go wrong so I know
let's see you oh let's see if I can have
everything I need here where where did
you see that I didn't see that oh here
awesome I even there the max bites good
audience ok so it's hope this comes up
it's coming up good awesome ok so this
is our world map that I was talking
about so Russia Russia consumes 10.3
litters of alcohol per capita so 10.3
but our scale goes to 1726 so brusha is
not the champion someone said England
11.8 better but not quite friends 11.4
and someone said Ireland 13.7 anyway you
would think it would be in this vicinity
but it's not the champion is here in
Africa it's your own 17.6 right so when
we first saw this or like wait is this
right because we had sort of the same
guesses as you did and we're like either
the data is wrong or something is going
on that we didn't know so the cool thing
about mini has is that every
visualization is not only a
visualization but it's a opportunity for
conversation so at the bottom people
started a really interesting
conversation about what was going on and
in fact this person here for instance
said you know for the story on you Cadiz
alcohol consumption check this link
seems like a national epidemic so
actually it was pretty sad
something to do with AIDS and Men
drinking a lot so it was not good but it
was the data was true the other thing
that's interesting about this man though
is the fact that there's a whole swath
of white countries they're white meaning
they don't consume almost no consume
alcohol so this also became a point of
conversation and any guesses about what
that I need their religion yes so what
I'll under cool famous idea is to blink
conversation to this other minions map
that shows the percentage of Muslims in
the world population right and you can
see that it's almost opposite man of the
map we had before so this was exactly
the kind of conversation we wanted to
see which was based on data and where
people were really discussing hypotheses
and trying to explain what they were
when they were looking at let's wait for
this guy to ok I think I am where I want
to be here so this is a very different
visualization this is called the tree
map a treatment is a visualization of
hierarchical data ok each one we're
looking at cars here different car
models and how they do in terms of
consumption in the city vs. highway
mileage that they get each one of these
little rectangles here is a mod is a car
model so this one isn't body you know
this
mercedes-benz this one is a BMW this
one's kia optima and support the color
of the rectangle has to do with how well
they do in the highway versus City so
the better they knew the difference
between highway mileage and city mileage
the bluer they are which would make
sense so it makes sense that most of
these cars are glued right except that
we have very orange ones this means that
these cars are very much better in the
city than they are on the highway so i
can start highlighting these and okay so
this is a Toyota Prius this is an escape
hybrid this is a mariner hybrid you
start to get a sense of what the pattern
is but I can also start changing the
hierarchy of the way of grouping things
right now I'm grouping cars by their
class midsize cars are here compact cars
are here if I change this and I do by
manufacturer I can see that toyota has a
lot of oranges lexus has a couple but
then if i bring up transmission as the
grouping principle i can see that all of
a sudden all my outliers are here right
so this is interesting because it tells
me that not only are we talking about
hybrid cars we're talking about hybrid
cars with a specific kind of
transmission and those are the ones who
do much much better in the city vs on
the highway and that was another kind of
data set that was unexpected but I
imagined this this is a public website
before
whatever data they want to blow to
visualize right everything here is
public so we say that very clearly one
of the nice things were these surprises
that we would get so for instance
someone used the same exact technique
which is quite sophisticated to
visualize their wedding okay so this is
a treemap of someone's wedding where
each rectangle is a guest so all the
guests who said yes we're coming or sort
of this you know warm color here and all
the guests that said no are hearing the
greenish other people who said maybe
people who serve drinks only so it's a
very sophisticated kind of wedding list
and then you have to all these hierarchy
at the top so if I bring on the detail
kappa category i can see you know this
this is these are aunts and uncles these
are the parents friends these are the
cousins these are the brights friends
and so forth I mean this is really
serious and my leg of country I can see
that it's US and UK so it's an
interesting wedding how interesting you
know there are people coming from Italy
Austria Ireland and then my favorite one
which is if I bring up age all the way
to the top I have young and old idea
what the threshold is and why there
aren't any people in the middle but you
are even up or you're old and
but the whole thing is that here's
someone who's looking at their personal
data quite personal they were using a
pretty sophisticated visualization
technique and they did it so well that I
have no idea who they are this is all
anonymous data it's very personal but
it's very amount of us and have no idea
who's more which is perfect for
something like many eyes the other thing
we saw as soon as we launched many eyes
was that people we had a dozen different
kinds of visualization techniques and
they were all aimed at visualizing
numbers but as soon as we launch the
site with an optical employee text they
wanted to visualize text so what we did
is right away into the word cloud which
is when everybody does but we wanted to
do more than that the problem with word
clouds is that they'd only show
frequency and they d contextualize
everything okay so this word happens on
is it good or bad ones have anyways work
so we wanted to show frequency but in
context so we created something called
the word tree so this is what the word
tree looks like this is we're looking at
the entire King James Bible year as a
tree and what you do is you search for
things so here I searched for and God
okay and the word tree shows me
everything that comes in in the Bible
comes after bad phrase and by so I can
say and gone said and God saw and God
made last spank half and then I can
start looking further and say what did
God say how he said let there be light
let there be
moment and so forth and I can start very
quickly interacting with this big corpus
of text so what did God see and I get
very quickly again to specific verses of
the Bible I can also play games such as
okay let me put a question mark and when
we put the question mark at the end so I
have all of the questions in the Bible
at once and I can say oh what r one
Supporter questions being asked of me
what are things being done unto me and
so forth and you can go back and you
could just play with his and search for
oh you can you can just play with the
text and see both macro patterns and
then micro patterns also and again I
want to contrast this very serious piece
of text with another data source that
someone put up which was this one these
are personals ads by males who say I'm
married and so these are all married
males who are looking for things or
companionship and i love the difference
in philosophy right it's like i am
married and looking for i am married but
looking right what does that mean so I
am married and plan on staying that way
I am married and looking for someone
discreet or I am married but looking and
married it gets said so I you know II
guess it gets you get the point rub your
head the the data sets were just
incredibly diversified so
this guy and let's go back to our
presentation so the last visualization I
want to I want to tell you about lemania
eyes is something called the phrase net
and the first day came up came about
because we wanted to create a map a
concept map of a large body of text so
if you could say okay what are the
concepts ain't talked about here and
then you know one of the things that
people have been doing and it is it
takes a lot of power is sort of like
semantic analysis right of text and it
takes a lot of time and it takes a lot
of power and we wanted to do the dumb
stuff we're like what can we get away
with that is really low hanging fruit
how far can it we get we decided to look
at repetition once more and repetition
is always a visualization friend and we
decided okay if you have this template
and you just point these templates and
text do you get repetition that is
meaningful enough that will start to
give you a sense of concepts and how
concepts are connected in a piece of
text so basically this is what we
created we created a template where you
would have whatever word and whatever
other word and in the middle you would
have some template and this is it shows
and here but nan does not a boolean and
could be any
it can be over under yellow green
whatever word and then what we do is we
run a piece of text so for instance if I
were looking at Jane Austen's Pride and
Prejudice I would come to this phrase
here Friday heading pertinence and that
would match my template so that becomes
an edge on my visualization it becomes
pride edge impertinence for the edges
and so if i run into the entire Pride
and Prejudice book through this i get
this interesting network and what's
interesting about this networking said
at the bottom here I have pretty much
the social network of the books so I
have you know the father elizabeth-jane
the mother and so forth and then I get
other kinds of interesting concepts
there let's zoom in I get a cluster this
is pride impertinence conceit folly
vanity ignorance so all these negative
things are sort of happening together as
one cluster I also have another cluster
which is amiable easing and fashionable
or wishes affection open solicitude so
all these sort of positive things also
have any so all of a sudden we have
we start to have these clusters that we
offer free just by looking at repetition
really if we change our template and we
say x @ y instead of and why we get a
network of places in the bullpen ok so I
have long warned Netherfield Pemberley
and I start to see things that are
happening at these different places so
for instance it longboard I have people
assembling reappearing I have visitors
and so forth if we look at a different
piece of text if we look at the Bible
again and we do X you get why I get the
family tree right so this is um these
are the families if i zoom into that
circle there I see who we get home and I
got these interesting sort of circular
patterns here when the Sun has the same
name as the father or the grandfather
and so forth so and again looking at the
Bible if I do X of Y this is the Old
Testament this is the New Testament
children of Israel came from is real and
here kingdom of god son of god and so
forth so again just very you know blow
any fruit to try to visualize our
conceptual map of text so many guys has
many more visualization techniques that
I've been that I have time to show here
but if you have a play with it it's and
then you have data that can be public
it's a fun place so other people are
doing with it two days after we launched
someone named crossway uploaded
co-occurrence data set for Biblical
verses so in other words whenever you
have a verse of the Bible if two people
show up in the same verse that becomes a
data point okay that person then created
a visualization of social network and in
Canada Mike this is a new testament you
can't imagine who the big doc is in the
middle right he then walked about it and
immediately got started getting hundreds
of comments and people just went if it
was it was really impressive within a
couple of days this got out of the
Christian blogosphere and expended to
things like Boing Boing youtube this is
a screenshot of a YouTube video we're in
the person is playing with a
visualization and looking at different
hypotheses that the visualization allows
him to make in questions and so forth
and then the other thing is that in turn
people started seeing these
visualizations and they started
uploading their own data sets their own
biblical data sets too many ways
creating visualizations and i'm going
back to the you know conversation that
they were having the win their community
before and this is something that we
could only dream of happening when we
want you two maniacs right which is you
have a community that has data that's
interesting to them and they use that
data to create organizations and charge
the conversation that they want to have
even though we designed many eyes for
lay users you know there's no database
there's no bit there know the technical
technical parts are very very simple you
just copy and paste
that's about it we got we got scientists
using the eyes a lot of them so this is
for instance this is a historian who was
looking at the Canadian Parliament and
created a witch of different
visualizations and I wrote to us he was
finishing his PhD and he wrote wasn't
said I just found out new things about
my data set and I talked about this in
my pieces for like yeah of course or you
know score for you this is a linguist
who was looking at language formality in
corporate blogs and as you can see he
used a bunch of different kinds of
visualizations and then he would create
these visualizations go back to the
squad this was during his master's now
and talk about it and then the rest of
the community would shine in this is a
geneticist who was looking at microarray
data and he created maybe hundreds of
these we thought they all looked
beautiful we have no idea what they need
and then he wrote to us and said I just
found out something really interesting i
want to publish a paper and i show the
visualization screen yes of course this
is why we go too many eyes for people to
use it and then you know so as you
credit vignette that's cool so really
this interesting and unintuitive thing
we're here we were designing for the
regular person you know thinking
scientists had access to two tools like
this and again we had a lot of interest
from experts and scientists so going
from a place that was designed to have
five minutes
okay very quickly I'm going to talk
about ripples promote blood sprinkles so
this is a visualization where we created
a visualization inside a product so this
is the idea where you can should have to
go outside the place where you are
having your conversation to look at
visualization so the question here is
how do things flow and get shared on
moscow book must being obviously the
social network that google launched and
so this is this is the the sharing tree
for a and that folks wagon did for the
Super Bowl last year it was something
called the dark side it was a video
there's all these little dogs barking in
this car horse named song so it went
viral so what's happening here at
Volkswagen posted this on google+ and
then we create edges whenever we have
the followers from folk swag reshares
that link with someone but this doesn't
look very viral to me because it's not
very big but this is the action around
volkswagen other people who saw this
video when we r we sharing this video
outside of volkswagen right so this is
what the entire sharing graph she looks
like so let's take a look at this let me
see get this really quick
yes
one more okay so this is the life
visualization and and I can see that
this person Chris Pirillo was hugely
influential so the more followers who we
shared from you the bigger your circle
becomes okay so this person reshared
from chris i can zoom in Josh armor
thats Sarah Legree shared it gives them
into her I can go back I can actually
look for folks wagon here and focus
wagon is right here so you can see how
smaller circle is right i can zoom into
their circle and see that it's the same
tree we were looking at before so this
is something that is really interesting
to see is that individuals have
sometimes a whole lot more influence and
power on the social network extend the
official channels you know who actually
created the content in this case
Volkswagen then you can start to see the
different communities who are all
communal tension to this and the thing I
wanted to say about that is that we
started seeing different about patterns
were interesting so this is what we're
calling a select celebrity pattern so
Felicia Day happens to be somewhat of a
celebrity and has tons of followers and
then she shared a link to a video and
then tons of her followers we share that
immediately and then that's it it
fizzles out so it's a very broad tree
but it's a very shallow one right very
different from this sharing sharing
pattern this is a sharing a link to a
petition to the White House to open up
scientific journals so you can see very
you know different communities with
sherry chains these are people from
outside the US who are also helping to
boost this up this is one of our you
know usual suspects Tim arriving the
other thing at the bottom here you have
a timeline of activity you can see that
this against a lot of activity and then
it sort of dyes and that Tim where ID
comes up right here and I gets another
boost of activity and you have different
patterns like this where you do have
sort of a celebrity thing going on but
they are not the only ones sharing the
content here and then this one which is
going to take me to my last project is a
visualization where Martin and I were
using this is a mirror this is a
visualization of how one of our projects
god we shared on google plus this was a
visualization we did of wind it was a
map of the wind in the US and the same
thing for us is that we started seeing
so I'm I'm just a little guy here I have
no impact or influence or whatever but
these other people have tons of
influence in be sharing our content and
you know this is a very high of
executive room this is a mathematician
this is an author there's someone else
here it was from the New York Times so
we started seeing all of these different
communities who are pay attention at
this visualization and we had no
I liked visualization so it's really
nice to see how your own content sort of
does so to finish off I want to show one
less project this is the wingman so the
wind map let's see how it does so this
is the wind right now in the US and we
can actually zoom in to Boston and see
how we were doing for actually doing
really well with the wind is pretty low
2.4 if so around our area but the thing
I want to show you is that you might
look at this and be like oh you know
what's what's so interesting about this
is how we got there you would think that
visualizing something like the wind
would be pretty straightforward but it's
not so i'm going to tell i'm going to
show you how we actually do stuff in and
i'm crazy gets so we've got the visual
we got the data from the wind and we
decided to wear like how are you going
to joy's this so this is actually just
the vector field of the wind around the
world looks horrible Thanks that's the
purpose burl and we're gonna do
something just horrible in the beginning
just to remind ourselves you don't want
anything that looks like this then we
thought oh we know what we're going to
do wind is nothing more than particles
floating or not just the air
around so let's show it as a particle
thing there's you know just articles and
this is what we get when we show
particles will win this particles so
this is the world can you see the
pattern I can't it looks just like a
bunch of little hands so we decided what
particles don't work with it what is
that supposed to mean maybe if we have a
very specific shape that we are all
familiar with so say the US and we don't
particles on the u.s. maybe that will
work and so we tried that next so this
is better right you can see the US but
if I ask you what part of the US has the
fastest wind or the slower wind came yes
then no right isn't that amazing that
particles just don't do it how is that
possible so we started very good that
you're thinking about this in the
completely different life this is just
wrong we don't need movement or we
actually we need color growing let's do
something where we do areas that are
very very colorful and they just flow in
the way that the wave is going and they
just take the speed of the wing with nut
hence that's it that's how we're going
to solve this so he went with the
coloring areas and decided to flow them
the way exactly right so it just melts
your eyes and I'll get anything
meaningful but that's the challenge by
the data visualization
nothing is obvious so then we decided
okay the idea that actually worked we're
going to go back to our particles even
though these seemed horrible and what
we're going to do is we're going to add
some transparency to them so that they
leave traces as negative a lot and this
is this was sort of one of our last
attempts
so by doing that we start to see stuff
right we start to see patterns and this
is not what the wind map it's not
exactly the women but it's pretty close
by then we're like we can you have
something we just need to polish it up
and so that's what we did and so the
wind map is is shows the wind live
always and then the cool things that we
also have this gallery that shows you
how different things can look from one
day to another so this is actually
Hurricane Isaac and it was interesting
because it was happening it made
landfall and we started getting getting
emails from people there who were in
norleans saying I'm sitting here I'm
looking at your map and just hoping that
this thing passes through and we didn't
really help we were like we're right
there with you but it wasn't until we
got this guy here that we really
understood what it feels like to be in
the half of something so this is sandy
this is after he had become a tropical
storm there wasn't a hurricane anymore
but just you know in a sense of all the
different the wind can do crazy things
from one day to another and it can go in
very very different ways this is not a
hurricane at all this was a week when we
had a lot of tornadoes in the Midwest
and we got a forgotten a nice email from
a teacher saying I was sitting with my
students looking at this and we could we
predicted that we would have tornadoes
and we did have tornadoes so and this is
the final thing I want to say is
something like the wind map it I'm going
to test all of this you have no time
it's sort of like the the impact that
had that was completely unexpected to us
you did the win that and we've got this
Indian Kiki project who cares you know
there's everybody has access to whether
have sand in my maps they've been around
forever who cares it turns out a lot of
people here so we this is the project
that we've got most email tons of email
to this day so like bird watchers love
to this we got email from a from a
community of butterfly watchers who are
using wind map to help track migration
professionals this is actually a
professional video neurologist you know
you have someone who said I've been
working with his native professional 28
years and the organization for handling
tuition for the data and then confirms
of pilots surfers sailors you name it
who write to us and pilots are writing
to us and we're meeting please
mark please we do we visualize surface
wind data so that's from the bottom to
like 10 meters you don't want to be
looking at this and it got such we got
such a response we got this one's wild
from fighters of firefighters of
wildfires and we had to add a disclaimer
is the first project the ever had and
the disclaimers please do not use the
map it is quite plain simple provide
wildfires and we got an email even after
that st. please respect the power of the
visualization okay so I was like all
right I'm saying the show but anyway
that's that's the thought I want to I
want to leave you with tonight is is the
fact that we are in the new moment we
are in erwin i think very exciting
moment where data is not only something
that the government has it's something
that we are dealing with every day and
it's becoming part of our stories you
don't be part of how we tell our stories
I'm part of how we understand the world
and so it's really exciting to see
people use using visualization to
understand is no reality and to sort of
interface with things like statistics or
math or whatever in a more natural way
for a lot of people and so I hope that
you as engineers and scientists are part
of this I think
it's an old new culture so thank you so
we do have a few minutes if anyone has
any questions for Samantha you take
those down hi you kind of touched on
this but in your ending as far as not
doing government facebook but I know the
warfighter government agencies they have
huge big data issues right there trying
to do data to decision widely and will
sufficiently and this seems like a great
method of getting to that point I'm
wondering if you have worked with them
or fabulous in touch with such a new
things so we personally have not but
it's interesting so the wind map for
instance is all based on government data
and thank God for government data and so
and it was so it's always about no idea
and what was cool was that Noah house
after we launched the women but in touch
with us and said hey can we use your
algorithms to actually visualize the
flow of currents in the Great Lakes and
we're lecture and so they did they use
their algorithm to visualize the flow of
currents in the Great Lakes and
different deaths which is really cool
but yes you are absolutely correct in
that all different kinds of government
agencies are interested in this a big
part of their interest also is things
like text visualization have a lot of
texts text is very very hard to get a
grip on so text positions on a very
interest yes any other questions I was
just wondering if it's google normal it
has turned out at Google wrinkles is
available on Google Plus so all you do
is let me see if I have it open here
whenever you whenever yes whenever you
are in your stream this is my stream and
you see something that has been shared
so this this Francis has been shared you
go to the menu here on the post if you
save you ripples of that name this Rick
was going to be very small because it's
only 11 things that i shared but it's
yeah it's a public oh where is it good
anyway it should unhappy trouble but
that's it what did I did it go somewhere
else that I'm not seeing I don't know
anyway just you know go to any public
post it is all it only shows public
posts so even if you're sharing a lot of
things you know privately we don't show
any of that
um how do you get I guess the idea is
for what you're going to visualize and
what does some things you like to
visualize in the future so it's a very
interactive process in which we usually
get the data first and then we're like
oh how can you visualize this so it's
sort of like what the Wikipedia think
you had no idea how we work even what it
meant that really wanted to visualize
Wikipedia and it wasn't until we saw
that log of edits that were like this is
data we can really read up on to and try
to visualize so it's it's sort of a
given take with the data set itself
things that would like to visualize that
have visualized yet I think different
kinds of media so things like video it's
like we have tons of video how can we
visualize video in an interesting way
nobody has done that so maybe you can do
it I'm just wondering if you familiar
with the research that there boy Michael
you have to get bad cool hi so so
Deborah is a professor at the media lab
just to catch everybody up and if I am
thinking about the same thing you were
thinking he is well known for having had
I don't know if it still does this but
he had a whole setup where he had
cameras all over his house and he would
take video footage of his little kid
ever since he was born until I know
maybe it so it was like four years old
or something and he was trying to
understand how his kid God language how
he would pick up words and what could
you understand if you had access to
pretty much every single moment on this
his life what could you understand from
how language is formed in a kid's mind
and I think they did that you're right
they did try to do visualisations of
video for that because they had just so
much video footage the visualization is
unfamiliar with that they did I don't
think they were really the tools they
were using to explore that dataset I
think they were more sort of like oh how
can we show the kinds of things we know
in an easy way in a visual way so it's
sort of like almost after the fact
instead of a exploratory visualization
let's find let's find the the patents
here
so some of these visualizations that
you're dying are pretty complicated and
a lot of their usual not things that
people was even born just wondering how
you determine what which are going to
make sense to people you do a lot of
people in custody or process
so we do some testing but it's not like
we have you know focus groups that come
in and we basically we're always testing
with people who are not familiar with
the project we're doing and try to get a
sense of how well respond to it having
said that there are two things that I
think are interesting about that but
that question specifically one is a lot
of times I find out I found out we tend
to underestimate users in the following
sense when we watched many ideas for
instance we knew that we wanted to have
all of the visualization techniques all
the graphs and charts that people were
very used to her things like Excel so if
we wanted to have a bar chart a line
chart a pie chart a scatterplot things
of that nature and then we were like who
should we have a tree man which was the
thing I was showing you i don't know
tree maps come from academia nobody
really uses them nobody stands now but
we're looking at what the heck let's put
a Tremont there and if people don't
understand and they won't use it and
then we saw it being used over and over
again so that was really interesting and
then unexpected the other thing is when
you look at things like the near times
where they are pushing the limit and
they are showing things that are fairies
I think it's sort of a it's the kind of
thing where I think visual literacy is
going up not necessarily
because we are having you know
traditional classes and what does it
mean to use this technique I decided to
make makeup and that's a whole other
thing I think we should have more of an
in regular education but because we're
starting to be surrounded by these
things you're just exposed to that all
the time all the time and not only that
they're fun to play but friendly do
things you click on things things happen
Oh interesting how does this one work
you know so maybe you get you get people
that way to happen by how a meaning it
is nothing I'm saying here is saying
user studies are of no interest they
definitely are and always try our things
with people but it's not like we have a
random sample of people that we have a
really strict methodology we basically
just try it out and the last thing I
want to say about that is that you
always know when you have a hit when you
hit the sweet spot for a visualization
it's when you can give it to a friend of
yours or anyone and they just can't stop
playing with it oh my one is Oh what am
I on your right okay I'm done my work
here is done okay next so it sort of
speaks for yourself a lot of times we've
got quite a got two more questions so
what a couple of answers and a couple of
answers you mentioned either getting
access to the data and playing with in
seeing what visualization was best in
breaking down there is like users to a
bit you see visualization as a more of a
young science or a advanced art um
I think it's of makes of those things i
think it's it's definitely a young
science you know in the sense that it
comes a lot of the techniques come from
academia and in the sense that when it
first started visualization was
something it could really only do in
very expensive machines that
universities and industry labs had
access to so I sort of historically
could only happen in these voices so it
was very scientific but more and more
you don't need anything special to do
regionalization visualization of the
web's it exists today just about anyone
can do it so in that sense i think is a
young in science but it's becoming less
of a science at the same time you have
things like scientific visualization or
the visioning like volume rendering and
3d techniques and those continue to be
so quite sophisticated and have been and
resources to me enough that you you know
you have to have a little bit more
infrastructure but to me the interesting
thing is that at least two world are
coming together it's the scientists
doing their things and there's
explorations we really also the artists
the journalists the authors using these
techniques in a completely different and
interesting refreshing way so to me it
needs a little bit of both
so my question is a little bit of
curiosity so I'm going if you have a
chance to start from scratch what would
you do differently you actually talked
about the ideas became popular really
quickly so what would you do good friend
you can start from scratch if I start
kind you're saying if I start from
scratch today yep like you open this
obvious i think i would have all of my
projects online and with be available to
to use so things like the project was
started with history oh that I showing
here is something that was none is in
the lab it was done as a tool for me and
I ever would be happy yeah you know and
it wasn't it so much much like that it
was started writing to us and saying
wait a second you know i am doing code
source provisions like I want to look at
my code and the code that I work with
with my colleagues and you can you share
this technique or I'm working in this
other project or I'm looking at how ills
and comrades get edited can you share
this technique so all of a sudden start
to dawn on us that these things need to
get out of labs they need to be
available on the web we need to be you
know freely available for a bunch of
different so I think that would be one
thing I would have done differently and
then taken worse these statistics
classes
think of their help too great and that's
all we have time for your all join me in
thanking for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
