give a long intro rather you here chips
Brack background directly from chip he
knows himself a lot better than I know
him
so I won't take a lot of time I will
just like to say thank you very much for
coming down ship just flew in from
Vancouver today so really appreciate you
coming down and sharing the story of
your background and Lululemon with us
you know the one thing that I would note
and just learn a little bit about you
online is just the vision that you have
and I'm really curious myself to hear
lots about you looking for these
up-and-coming trends whether it be
snowboarding or yoga and also maybe what
you see coming next so we're delighted
to have you and thank you very much we
look forward to your talk thank you very
much excellent so thanks for coming I
really appreciate it it's exciting for
me so I thought that today I talked
about you know what how the yoga kind of
fits into Lululemon why yoga and what it
what it means and then how how how that
affects our culture and further that how
the culture then allows us to grow at
the rate we're growing which I don't
know if it's at the same rate at Google
but it's but it's fast so I I actually
originally came from San Diego my my dad
was a phys ed teacher and my mom was a
sower so you can kind of see where
sports and clothing kind of got put
together I am when I actually brought
the surf skate culture to Canada and so
it was kind of a virgin territory for me
and allowed me to do quite well up there
quite fast but and then in 1987 when
snowboarding here at Whistler Vancouver
was kind of the center of the world for
snowboarding and so I was able to expand
something worldwide and I eventually
sold that that company to a public
company in Oregon the funny thing is
though is that even I have to say I'm a
total fraud in the whole operation of it
all because I was really a competitive
swimmer with absolutely no sense of land
balance but I was smart enough to
realize that no one was really gonna buy
into what I would call body surfing but
surfing was the cool thing so I
perpetuated that culture and then in
into skate and then into snowboarding
I'm an OK snowboarder but
after 20 years of snowboarding I people
would still probably tell me I need
lessons so but what occurred out of all
that of course is a body that got deeply
bruised with a lot of Falls and so in
about 1997 after I sold my my snowboard
company I was looking for something so I
could continue play squash and
triathlons and that type of thing and I
went to my first yoga class and and I
went you know I went wow this is great
and of course you know over a period of
time my body started to feel so great I
went this is this is like the panacea
for my life so the thing is is what I
saw in that class of course is that it
was just mostly you know 99% girls which
was of course there's nothing wrong with
that
and I but it was all they were all in
cotton clothing they were sweating and
cotton clothing wasn't working in my
expertise was technical clothing and so
I kind of put the two things together
and they said well no no one else is
really doing yoga clothing so I'll take
the high road make the very very best
stuff because I know you can always come
down in price and quality but you can
never go up so that was my my scene
there so for me what yoga is is it's two
things yeah it's the physical which I
which I to me is like you know opening
the joints and stretching the muscles
and and again for me it's like really
the releasing of the toxins in the body
so and then on the other side is the
mental side and for me it a lot of that
comes actually from something you might
think it's physical but it's actually
the deep breathing and to actually
breathe breathe breathe what it takes to
do that is to live in the moment it's
impossible to breathe like that
constantly for 40 minutes without
constantly being right what am i doing
right now what am i doing right now
now then for me though in in yoga in
that breathing then what it really has
you do is have something called living
in the moment okay and the feeling of of
that is a kind of euphoric feeling and I
can I it's actually I think it's
same thing as the runner's high so it
releases endorphins into your body makes
you feel great it has you a very be very
calm and then living in the moment now I
might my dad is here today and which is
kind of funny because it when I was 17
years old he came back from the s
program and somewhere in San Francisco
Big Sur somewhere up back up to Canada
and he was all searching for the meaning
of life and he said you know chippy said
the meaning of life is living in the
moment you known as a 17 year old you go
you roll your eyes and you can yeah
right you know like that whole thing and
but of course as I grew up and I learned
more about the how powerful it is to
live in the moment and how great my
decisions in are are when I'm living in
the moment how good I feel then then I
know there's something really important
about that so so what I mean cane then
is that we are the most powerful in life
when we're when we're living in the
moment and we're able to create okay so
we're most powerful so let me like you
know if you kind of look at your own
life and when you work you're creating a
vacation or you're creating a
relationship or you're creating a new
program or it's something like that
you'll notice that time goes very
quickly and you're very lit up and and
it's exciting okay to me that's what
living in the moment is in the
creativity so to kind of like give you a
better idea of even what living the
moment is for those that don't really
get that and that that runner's high
endorphin rush or that forty minute yoga
type of feeling alright just a couple
other examples I've noticed in life are
when people are on drugs or alcohol
right and I maintain that people in
drugs or alcohol aren't actually doing
it to escape I actually think they're
doing it to live in the moment because
that's when they're creative and that's
when they're most powerful and the
problem is with drugs and alcohol is
that it doesn't you need to keep doing
it in order to get back in that
situation those people
learned how to live in the moment so
obviously the second one that I was
going to talk about was the runner's
higher the forty minutes of any kind of
aerobic exercise and then the third one
I mean this take go back a bit that the
thing about the the runner's high is
that lat lasts for about four hours
right after your yoga class you'll
notice you have that euphoric feeling
for about four hours as that runner does
the thing about you know drugs or
alcohol is that you're incredibly
creative but you don't remember any of
it and then the third one I was thinking
of was sex you know it's like you're
living in the moment you're incredibly
creative but you're not creative about
anything that really moves the rest of
your life forward so it doesn't really
work in the same way so so then so
rather than then rely on drugs and
alcohol or yoga or running or sex or
something like that what I what the
thing that I'm here to talk about today
is that how do you create so you can
always live in the moment how can you
create that without yoga how can you do
it without sex or the drugs or alcohol
that type of thing so I'm gonna take out
a little story here so when I was 13 and
it was of course that would have been
the you know the 70s and the in the
Haight Ashbury type of thing I I bought
this purple shirt and I kind of had my
first date and I went to my first party
type of thing and you know this is in
the prairies of Canada and so everyone
laughed at at the girl I kind of took
kind of laugh at it too so I had this
this experience of this bad experience
of this purple shirt okay so you would
think then this purple shirt experience
lives in my past and it's in my past but
in reality it lives in my future okay
because if there's ten colors of shirts
and I go there to look for a color shirt
there's the purple shirt there but for
me there's only nine other shirts there
right you see because that purple just
you can forget about that one but in
reality how life goes is that you have
most people have bad experience after
medics
after that experience so a man gets to
be the age of 45 and he goes to buy a
shirt and all he sees is white so we
think as as people then that we have
choice in life that we have lots and
lots of choice but our choice is so
narrowed down by our experiences in our
past that we really limit our choice and
we don't have the way of really breaking
out of that choice so the so all I can
so then the idea if you can imagine it
is that if there is some way to
eliminate your past just for a second
it's like brainwashing or maybe you woke
up in the hospital he got hit by a you
know bike or something and you've got
total amnesia and you wake up and you if
you have no past then you have no future
right because if I hadn't had that bad
bad experience about the purple shirt in
the past then it wouldn't live in my
future so you can imagine all your life
exists of your experiences in your past
giving your future and your living in
your past your future your past your
future but never there never in the
present so by actually being able to
recreate this thing called a little
being in the present by not let me put
it differently by eliminating your past
then you can see you have no future does
that make sense if you had if you had no
bad experience then you would have
really no future so what you've got is
living in the moment
so the minute that you're living in the
moment there that's when you can be most
creative because you can imagine waking
them the hospital with amnesia and then
going to the store to buy a shirt and
having no bad experiences of a purple
shirt or anything else the purple shirt
looks wide open you see how that works
so so then like the goal is how to how
to create that living in the moment so
the interesting thing about the mind
that I've that I've discovered is that
the you can only hold one thought at a
time it's actually kind of fun to try to
hold two thoughts but in the and you can
all might hold one thought at a time and
this is where the word choice comes from
and B
you have the power to choose one thought
okay so then the then my my assert Asian
is that we can choose to have a thought
called living in the moment okay so so
what I'm what I'm trying to do there
then is to get you to the the living in
the moment part is and choosing to do
that is something I call creating
creating so what I find with most people
and I think this is so pickable to
Google and our Lululemon is that we're
creating companies all of it all it is
is creating but most people don't know
how to a set aside time aside for
creating and then second of all they
don't know how to go into creating mode
because they don't really know what the
what the triggers of it are or even what
the feeling is they haven't consciously
thought that oh it's the same feeling I
get after forty minutes or an hour and a
half of yoga if I if I can choose to
live that feeling right here right now
even though I haven't done yoga then
suddenly I'm in a creating mode okay and
I maintain that's when we're the most
powerful in life so so at Lululemon then
you can this type of culture called
creating creating has us have a common
way of communicating and it hasn't have
a common way of being because we come
from the position that nothing works so
if you woke up every morning and you ate
at Google that goes Google doesn't work
you know so what does that have for you
then well that has you have the great
opportunity to recreate Google or for us
to recreate Lululemon because we all
know there's competition all those
things but and you can kind of like fall
into that thing all its competition so I
got to get better better better but it's
more of like being in the mode of having
fun and being lit up and being powerful
by going I'm gonna recreate my company
day I'm gonna recreate my life I'm gonna
recreate my job I'm gonna recreate my
marriage because you know what nothing
works in my life but you can look at it
from a fun point of view as
to a point of view that it doesn't work
for you
so at Lululemon then we have we have
something most people call it a vision
but I've figured out that it's not it's
not really a vision anymore because even
with your founders that something called
an original intent like what was the
original intent of the company because
this is the thing that gets lost as a
company grows as fast as Google and to
some extent Lululemon so our original
intent from the getting it had nothing
to do with money but we knew that if we
followed this original intent that we
would make money was to take the world
from a place of mediocrity to greatness
so then how do we do that everything at
Lululemon is actually built on our
training programs and it's it's having
people go through a goal setting
exercises and having them be responsible
for how their lives turn out and this
can go anywhere from seven days to
twenty days and you know there's
refreshers just like you guys have a lot
of perks here everything about us is is
mentally based what we give our people
not everything but but most of it so so
then so then you can see as a company
grows fast like Lululemon or Google by
being in a in an era of creating
creating and nothing works then you can
be on top of your life all the time and
you can all be successful and for us at
Lululemon it allows us to grow and to
continue to train more people in goal
setting and self responsibility so that
we can help make a difference in change
of the world and that's what I invite
Duggal to do too and so I want to thank
you for asking me to come I could talk
about any subject for about five million
years so I just thought I'd leave it at
that and see if anyone had any questions
about Lululemon about yoga about
anything
so was asked about how do you reconcile
the original intent of yoga perhaps her
but I often wonder if that is the
original intent of the yoga being almost
like poor or I guess the focus of yoga
would have been all inner and not out
there right yeah rich inner life I don't
I don't really see how you can divorce
being great inside from wanting to be
great outside I think that the qiyan in
life is not buying that hundred and
seventy five dollar bag because you want
to look good to somebody else the idea
of buying that $175 bag is because you
choose to make it you feel good you like
to design you like the color you like
the functionality of it that the
sickness and I think in life in general
is looking good for other people because
it it affects the way that you act and
be and everyone else can see it except
for you does that make any sense at all
looking good as if it's that it's a
sickness and but the beautiful thing is
is that you can look it as long as you
choose to look good not be a defect of
what other people what you think other
people think of you it's complicated is
that yes
what's the magic behind
so she's asking about her fit and how it
fits so well
well I has been the technical holiness
for 20 years and actually interesting
and I don't know how Google operates
around this but if you try to deliver
any kind of product into Japan I mean if
you have ever seen a Japanese person
look for a car they spend two hours
circling the car going inside looking
for a scratch looking for anything like
they don't they assume it's gonna drive
perfectly you know so so for the
Japanese the quality has to be
unbelievable and and so I learned a lot
of my mistakes through Japan and how to
deliver to them and how to make them
happy so our quality control process and
our checking process from front and is
is is really very thorough and you know
some things to get through but I'd say
in general there hardly be a company in
the world that could in clothing that
could perform at our level with knit
fabrics where every colorway every batch
every roll shrinks differently in
actively it's it's a entire science to
itself one of I think our big keys is
that I just figured out that to make
every garment then we shrink it in hot
water hot dryer and so that when a
customer gets home with it there's that
takes out probably 95% of anything that
could go wrong with the garment I hated
taking a cotton garment taking it home
and two weeks later not being able to
wear it just drove me crazy and so I
think that subconsciously I think a lot
of people like Lululemon because they
know that in the long from a
sustainability point you'll have it for
five years
because we get a lot of a lot in about
you know using nylon which is our licker
which isn't really sustainable it's hard
to break down it's hard to do something
I mean we're working full out on that
right now but what I notice is that
people buy other products and they keep
them they have them for four months and
then they never wear them again we're
and its totally biodegradable where our
stuff will last for five years hello
I was dr. Newman classes
and you look tall
know where it came from I mean I
actually this girl here is wearing it in
a certain way but um well no because
it's that's got an emboss on it and
anyway that what happened is when I was
in the snowboarding business I this is
actually quite quite interesting I I
tried to bring in snowboard clothing for
a woman in 1994-95 couldn't get I
couldn't sell it there were it was the
first time girls were really coming into
efflux at all before that girl I mean I
tell you that it was hard to find a girl
in any kind of athletics so there wasn't
really enough girls to make enough
clothing for because you need to make
about 2000 is something to really make
it work but I found that I couldn't sell
anything because it kind of it was mail
buyers mail merchandisers mail setting
up stores they only had 2,000 square
feet it was all about man they didn't
understand women all that kind of thing
this is a very long way of getting
around to what I'm saying - but I was
also in the wholesale business so I
would make my product and then I would
sell it to the retailer and they would
mark it up and sell it again so I would
I developed this fabric that it was a it
was nylon lycra but it felt like cotton
so it took me about three or four years
to do it it was incredible
because I mean as a man of course I
noticed that whenever I saw a girl in
black lycra tights I went man that girl
looks great but in order to do that that
girl had to be at ten out of ten because
if there was any imperfection at all it
would show up because all the lycra at
that time was bright and shiny and very
thin right but I felt that if I could
make it thicker and make it dull and so
a girl could wear it and even under
snowboarding pants was my original thing
but be able to take your pants off and
not have to be concerned walking through
the village I thought I would have a
real home run there so worldwide I sold
fifty-seven pairs and so you know as a
failure right because going to a
wholesale system and getting to the end
they caught the pant cost 135 dollars
and I went and but these girls have had
them kept calling me up I want more I
want more
myself I'd sold my company and I'd
started into yoga and I had this in the
back of my mind and I went okay you know
like this is the perfect fabric for this
and so was kind of a combination of
those things the great thing about I
bought a man-made fiber is that you can
put wicking properties in it you can put
UV properties in it you can put any
stink
you know silver thread through it to
make sure it doesn't stink things like
that so the the the technical
possibilities of a nylon lycra that felt
like cotton were like you know
astronomical so that's kind of how that
all came to being oh yeah because I had
no let me say I had to go open up my own
retail store so I wouldn't have a
middleman so that I could bring the
price down to $90 you see how that works
and that $90 and I could sell then every
girl would buy three or four pairs yes
the benefits that she's meant to those
three yoga classes whenever she wanted
throughout stereoscope so how does that
benefit come to be in the feedback what
do you feel about well we have free yoga
Lululemon but um you see I think it's
more for us it's not a it's on of you
may think that you view Lululemon being
a yoga coming we had free yoga that
would be the right thing to do that's
not how I do it I'd prefer to put my
money into the people's minds and then
have them have the free choice about how
they want to spend their money in time
and how they want to keep in shape and
how they want to keep their health and
that and but really for us it's like if
we're if if are the people I work for
are coming aren't involved and love and
breathe and and no yoga and know what
people are doing in it and how practices
are changing and how clothing is changes
how temperature may change in the room
which would affect clothing in that then
we'll be dead in the water so it's
actually why our employees are a huge
feedback system to us and we have that
kind of come in through you know a
general you know information gathering
site okay yes
so she's saying she's happy with the
customer service but that we have a no
returns policy she's heard there's
always a no returns policy and underwear
and things like that that you where'd
we're directly near your genitals
anywhere so I think that's that's
worldwide we probably have a no return
policy after two weeks or three weeks I
don't know exactly what it is in
California and mostly because you know
we change our product every 45 days and
so if if people can't get it back in two
weeks then then you know with what we're
already onto something else because
we're all in the creating creating mode
okay okay one more question or none yes
the other God and it's just lemon how do
you yeah I mean I am I doing anything
else I mean no because I'm I'm handling
my original intent in a way that I could
never envisioned like by creating create
you know putting this training program
of creating and goal-setting into the
end of the company and growing that I am
I can I can affect the world by growing
Lululemon then I more than I can doing
anything else in my life um our feedback
systems are really immense I mean our
design team does maybe a hundred focus
groups a year in the different cities
not only with ambassadors but with with
customers and we try to find customers
who don't like Lululemon to find out
what's going on or ones that don't know
about us so that you know that kind of
gives us an outside perspective and then
we have every to the other thing that I
think is really great about our company
is that actually we go even myself go
work in the store every week so I'll
probably work 48 hours in a store a week
so I actually know what's going on
talking in the customer and so we have
our management meetings on you know
Tuesday afternoon it's like we're all
talking from what is the customer want
what's happened that week what's
actually going on it's not like it's
being filtered through three or four
different you know levels okay
okay one more and then that too
well I'm not a techie at all like I'm
just not so I mean but I you know I'm on
the computer all day long of course and
and all I know is that if I want to find
something else I would I go to Google
and I type it in I find it out that's as
much as I know about Google and you know
and that I you know I I know I've used
the map a few times when I want to find
things but it's it's interesting at my
stage and maybe wealth and and the
number of people I have working for me
how easy it is for me to turn around and
go Leah can you find that out and I go
to here and she goes and uses Google I
don't thinks what did we use recently we
use Facebook recently for a sale I know
and that worked it was phenomenal
because we were able to you know viral
marketing uh sale we because we don't
ever put anything on sale so it was the
first time we ever really did it and we
kind of put it out through Facebook it
worked phenomenally so if you want that
feedback that's there I personally I
wouldn't know how to use Google for for
my marketing yeah sure right after this
so thank you so much I hope I added
something to the value of your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
