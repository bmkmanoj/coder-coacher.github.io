here at Google and it's my pleasure to
introduce Chad Salman Chad Salman grew
up in a small town in western Colorado
called Glenwood Springs studied English
Literature at Duke University with a
focus on Walt Whitman while it dookie
was also the captain of the track and
cross country teams and specialized in
long distance events he was awarded a
road scholarship in 2007 to study
medical anthropology at Oxford
University his distinguished master's
dissertation was on the island
communities of Lake Victoria he explored
the relationship between the
introduction of foreign fish species and
HIV among remote populations in western
kenya his dissertation was awarded one
of the highest marks in the history of
the oxford medical anthropology program
and praised by luminaries in the field
like Paul Farmer Chaz's spent much of
the last four years living in working
among the tsuba people of muffin gonal
Island to establish an indigenous health
organization called the organic health
response Chas joined the global health
nonprofit micro clinic international
formerly called the global micro clinic
project in 2009 as the senior vice
president of special projects to
implement the world's first micro clinic
pilot for people living with hiv/aids in
western kenya in my volunteer position
with micro clinic international I worked
with Chaz last year to secure funding
for the project through the google inc
charitable giving fund of the tides
foundation Chaz is currently a
third-year medical student at UCSF and
preparing to return to Kenya for 12
months this coming Saturday to implement
the micro clinic pilot with his team on
muffin gonal Island please join me in
welcoming Chad Salman to Google
great thanks for that introduction Matt
yeah very excited to be here today at
Google we really appreciated Google
support this past year and yeah decided
to talk with you about a place that
means a great deal to me and a project
that I think means a great deal to the
people in these communities and I think
has potential to mean a great deal to
similar communities throughout
sub-saharan Africa the project I'm going
to be talking with you about today is
called the infant Ghana Island healthy
networks pilot program and it's a
collaboration between the organic health
response and micro clinics international
in order to understand this program
though I want to take you to western
Kenya and give you a little bit of the
history of the people we work with and
how our organizations got involved here
so we work in Lake Victoria which is the
second largest body of fresh water in
the world just behind Lake Superior we
work on an island called in Feng GaN Oh
Island which is actually in the boundary
waters between Kenya Uganda and Tanzania
some of the outlying islands are
actually disputed islands between Kenya
and Uganda depending on how well the
fish catches going and this is a map of
infant Ghana island itself about 20,000
people live here we work on the southern
side of the island in a village called
Joaquin gah at a community center that
we've developed that I'll be talking
about today called the ecology on a
center we also work closely with a
series of clinics that are on the island
that are supported by the University of
California and San Francisco and they're
located in sin as you can see on this
map
I want to spend a little bit of time
talking with you about my ethnographic
fieldwork in these communities which
took place over the course of two years
and really I think has kind of formed
the foundation of a lot of the programs
that we've begun to implement were put
the seeds for those programs were
planted during this period of time and
my my research as an anthropologist and
a medical anthropologist specifically
was around this idea of what exactly is
an organism medicine is often very
focused on what I would call a neo
Darwinian explanation of an organism
it's an organism that's bound by a
membrane and directed in many ways by
you know genetic material of DNA however
a lot of systems biology and
anthropologists and ecologists are
starting to think of definitions of
organisms that are actually a bit more
expansive and this is a definition that
makes a lot of sense to me in my
research and I hope during the course of
this talk can convince you make sense as
well in understanding something like an
hiv/aids epidemic in western kenya
colocalize nexus of growth and
interaction within a continuous field of
relationships
ok
to talk about the organism that we're
doing with here and our story is really
actually the intersection of three
stories on this island I want to take
you back a little bit and talk with you
about the origins of the tsuba people on
Feng Ghana Island which is a story that
starts 15 generations ago i also want to
talk with you going to close my updates
here about the introduction of the now
perch to Lake Victoria which I actually
think was the kind of the inciting event
for the intense hiv/aids epidemic that
we have on the shores of Lake Victoria
almost like nowhere else in the world
probably one of the most impacted
populations on the planet and it's my
belief and i'll talk to you about today
that that's because of this species of
fish that was introduced to lake
victoria in the 1950s and then finally
the story of how our organization began
called the organic health response so we
think around 1750 based on about 15
generations ago we know that two super
warriors were involved in the
assassination of the 26th king of Uganda
and it's actually a very Machiavellian
scheme this king was assassinated by his
brother a guy named semi koo koo roo and
as soon as he took the throne he
basically realized that he'd made these
warriors and their clans very powerful
in this war and held the war council
basically to go out and eliminate these
two brothers and their clans fortunately
for these guys there was a drummer at
this war council who overheard this plan
and literally ran that night and warned
them that the king was at basically
coming to wipe them out and they loaded
up their boats with their families and
began sailing east across Lake Victoria
and actually this sparked a major band
to Exodus this was very exciting for me
when I was a year later back at Oxford
reading in some of these dark libraries
to really understand this history which
was which was a major migration of band
two peoples across Lake Victoria and
they actually met the luo's who were
just coming south at the same time many
of us may be familiar with luo people
now because it's the tribe of Barack
Obama's father
but it's interesting that the tsuba
people arrived on the western shores of
Lake Victoria and they were immediately
assimilated into Luo culture and so that
today there's really only a very few
places where suba language is still
spoken on the islands of mangano in a
few places in tanzania this is an
extremely endangered language and what
is this was a language that was
endangered you know from the sixties
onward but since the 1980s and the
emergence of hiv/aids in Africa this
language has really been decimated right
now we think about a third of the
remaining suba speakers in the world are
infected with HIV so this is a language
that really is on the verge of
extinction the second story that's
really important to understand is the
story of now perch this is a picture now
perch right there now perch were
introduced illegally in the 1950s to
Lake Victoria there was actually a
clause in the lake victoria Fisheries
Act basically that band the introduction
of any foreign species however the the
British were pretty intent on
establishing a breeding population of
now purchase within Lake Victoria
because of the idea that this fish could
make an extremely valuable export
commodity now perch can grow to huge
sizes then go to you know 400 pounds
whereas the indigenous species of Lake
Victoria the haplochromis cichlids are
actually very small bony fish you guys
have probably seen them in aquariums are
actually beautiful the her bright colors
and but those those fish were traded and
cotton there was a large kind of
artisanal fishing economy throughout
Lake Victoria however it was not an
export economy in any way so this
species was introduced illegally on a
day in 1954 according to colonial
officers who report actually bringing
buckets of fish from Lake Albert to Lake
Victoria by around nineteen sixty they
were able to show that there was a
breeding population in Lake Victoria and
make the argument that this was now a
native species to the lake and at that
point full-scale introduction began and
then right around the 1980s
now perch boomed in Lake Victoria and
essentially completely change the stroke
the trophic structure of this lake where
before there been a really diverse
ecosystem now purchased centrally
concentrated all of the biomass in Lake
Victoria at the top of the food pyramid
I think the numbers were in nineteen
eighty and now purchase represented
something like two or three percent of
the lake of the biomass and lake
victoria by 1985 they represented
ninety-five percent of the biomass in
Lake Victoria it was an incredible boom
and what happened was essentially a gold
rush hundreds of thousands of migration
from across Africa converged on Lake
Victoria because anyone who could get a
boat in a net could literally pull
hundreds of pounds of fish out of the
lake every single day at the same time
International Development organized
organizations began putting up
production factories and processing
factories around Lake Victoria something
like 25 factories in a matter of five
years and this export economy
immediately boomed and finge on an
island in fact was one of the major
processing centers the the water around
venga know is actually extremely deep
which often I tell people sometimes
maybe for a bit of shock value that the
reason why HIV is so high I'm pagano
island is because the water is so deep
just offshore but it's actually a fish
amazing fish breeding ground and was one
of the centers for this export industry
where most of the fish was taken from a
fan ghana island to kisumu kenya where
it was exported one thing I often talk
about those that the parasitism of this
epidemic is not just this virus that's
moving through people's bodies in my
opinion a major piece of the parasitism
of this epidemic was the way in which
this industry was structured almost all
of the value of this industry accrued
this is an example of just showing the
European Union's share of the deal and
basically the on the wholesale and
retail end of the market where now perch
was selling on international markets
it's an amazingly useful fish you can
process this white fish and fish fingers
and mcfish sandwiches you can ship it
all over the world freeze it it's
excellent for an international
fish commodity and you know selling it
extremely high rates there was also
processing factories that were owned by
international organizations throughout
Kenya but in fact a very small
percentage of this industry usually just
the boats and nets themselves were owned
by individual fish Kenyan fishermen that
lived in these communities and very
quickly those fishermen and those
families themselves were overwhelmed by
the hundreds of thousands of people that
converged on Lake Victoria at the same
time the effects in Lake Victoria were
catastrophic it's actually the single
greatest mass vertebrate extinction in
recorded history over 300 we think 300
to 500 species of haplochromis cichlids
went extinct between the period of 1980
in 1990 which is really unfortunate
story that cichlids themselves have an
amazing evolutionary history that
basically ecologist can no longer follow
because it was so devastated by now
perch at the same time the nutrient
mixing capacity the lake completely
changed this is a satellite photos of
hyacinth blooms which were kind of
another invasive species that has been
linked to now perch introduction as well
but this is now this is a graph often
get in trouble with because it's hard to
argue causation but as an anthropologist
I think it's very interesting to look at
if you look at the top graph you'll see
the curve of now perch and the blue line
represents the the annual catch on in
Kenya and if you look down at the the
graph below actually represents the rate
of new infections in Kenya as well and
you can see they both peak right around
1991 both began in the early 80s and my
argument has been essentially that the
introduction of now perch created a
perfect storm for an hiv/aids epidemic
in western kenya hundreds of thousands
of young men away from their homes
earning cash in extremely poor
communities that were immediately
undermined by an export economy they
completely lost their own livelihoods
and even lost access to a lot of the
places where they normally fish to
provide food for their families and at
the same time no one at this point no
one who lived there for a while was
actually eating fish made a lot more
sense to sell the fish and go buy corn
than to actually take a fish back to
your family so amazingly we saw it rates
of protein
energy malnutrition rise in these
communities as well so we had extremely
desperate communities and thousands of
cash solvent fishermen moving through
every single year created a perfect
situation where desperate women in these
communities and desperate families in
general one of the only means to income
was by forming relationships with these
fishermen and I'll talk a little bit
more about what we call Shibuya which
formerly was a relationship system where
fishermen would have wives in multiple
communities as he traveled around the
lake he would live and stay with his
family here and stay with his family
there with the emergence of now perch
Shibuya became to represent something
much more closely aligned with what we
would consider prostitution it's often
used it translated as fish for sex so
that today western Kenya has nyanza
province has some of the highest rates
of HIV in kenya and suba district
district specifically where we work as
some has some of the highest HIV rates
anywhere in the world you can see in
2003 sentinel surveys we're showing HIV
prevalence around 41 % today on the
islands where we work we think HIV
prevalence is somewhere between 24 and
28 percent so this is impacted every
single family every single compound
every single community has been hit by
this epidemic I'm coming out today is
about 20,000 subang Luo people it's a
three-hour canoe ride from the mainland
there's only one ring road I say no
electricity but actually there's a small
diesel generator that powers the health
center now so that's an improvement and
yeah one Ministry of Health Center
fortunately however a program that's
coordinated through the University of
California here in San Francisco called
faces has actually really scaled up
access to care and treatment in western
kenya such that now free antiretroviral
medication is really available to anyone
and this is literally saving hundreds of
thousands of lives but we'll talk a bit
more about why more than medication is
needed to really deal with this epidemic
and this is this is kind of the part of
the story where I come in
this man here is named Richard McGregor
I was excited when I'm a gringa is
actually the name of a very famous chief
in the oral history of the tsuba people
my friend Richard was an aids orphan at
the time that his parents died their
illness was described as cheetah which
is actually spoken of among rural people
as a curse that can come upon your
family when you break certain cultural
taboos and I'll talk a bit more about
jira but by the time well Richard's
mother died of cheer by the time his
father died actually people were
starting to talk about HIV and AIDS the
Richard actually received training in
HIV counseling and testing and using his
training he was able to start working
with some of these international
development organizations on the
mainland and I'm sure he was doing his
job very well at the same time but one
of the benefits of this is that he
gained access to the Internet at some of
these organizations and during this time
while he was surfing the internet began
researching and reading about organic
agriculture his family to always been
farmers and began talking with his uncle
a man named Joel Goethe about
registering their farm on him Feng GaN
Oh Island on the worldwide opportunities
on organic farms website and essentially
when they registered their farm they
attracted the attention of two Americans
Adam soo Lauren Friedman who've been
really looking for an opportunity to
essentially move to Kenya and start a
sustainable life and through their
conversations with richard and joel
decided to actually drop out of college
pack up their bags and move to kenya and
it was one day in 2007 I was actually
backpacking through western Kenya when I
met them at a bus stop and yet they
talked me into coming out to visit their
farm for a night and in fact I've been
working there for the last four years
and I plan to work there for the rest of
my life and that this story of how our
organization began i think is actually
an integral story to the way that
Internet can be used in these places to
to breathe life into someone's idea and
this is in fact the idea that Joel and
Richard approached me with
the next time I came back to him finga
no I talked my professors into letting
me do my fieldwork there and when I came
back the next time Joel and Richard
actually had an amazing idea and the
idea was they wanted to donate a piece
of their land to build a community
center and the idea we began to talking
about was providing solar internet there
was no internet access anywhere on this
island for 20,000 people but incredible
enthusiasm everyone knows about the
internet but no way to get online and
the idea we had was what if we build a
free solar powered internet center on
their land and make it accessible to
anyone in the community on one condition
you have to know your own HIV status in
order to use the center and the idea was
not only to incentivize people to come
use our Center excuse me and sent device
people to come and get tested because
people want access to the internet but
essentially was really to create a
universal excuse that would free people
from the bonds of stigma instead of
saying I'm worried about I might have
HIV or I think maybe my husband's been
sleeping around or I'm a community
leader I can't be seen going into the
HIV testing center or I'm a young
fisherman and things are great I don't
want anyone to know that I'm worried
about HIV we basically were able to give
everyone a blanket excuse which is I
just want to go sign up and use the
internet and what they're asking me to
do is no my HIV status so this was our
idea and this was actually our first
beach meeting back in two thousand seven
but as we as we began moving forward
with this we realized that building a
community center like this wasn't about
just setting up a cyber cafe and the
metaphor we begin talking about in these
communities as we were we had we had
meetings in every single village to talk
about what people would like to see in
the center was the idea that rather than
bringing in goods from the outside you
know bringing in a bucket full of fruit
the idea was we wanted to plant a tree
that would take a lot of energy as a
community to initiate but that over time
would provide not only sustainable fruit
but really shade for a variety of other
gardens and that's I think how we've
really been thinking about what emerged
as the ecology on a center in suba
translates
and I'm kind of two ways either the
whole world or the whole community which
we felt was really appropriate name for
this Center we begin working with we had
a group of designers on the island and
we begin working with a student of
architecture Matthew tyranny to actually
design the center this is a picture of
the land that dole that Joel donated on
his farm and we spend the next we
thought we could build the center in
eight months we spent the next three
years building it and part of the reason
that that we decided to do this so
slowly was that we decided not to hire
any contractors from off the island and
we hired we trained a group of local
Carpenter's and welders and Mason's in a
sustainable technique called ferrocement
and then as a community we literally
purchase stones and labor from people
within these villages and built this
Center together this was a construction
update as of last summer and before I
get well I'll talk to you little bit
about where the center is today but
during this process we begin researching
solutions for the types of computers
that we wanted to have in this
solar-powered center and we were very
fortunate to come across an organization
that's based here in San Francisco
called envy neo and what we were really
looking for was a system that actually
had all the components that the envy
niall computing station has which is
something that you know I really had a
solid design that we wouldn't need fans
it was dust proof you know we have to
take these things on boats out to the
island when you did something that it
used extremely low amount of power we
realized that Envy neos the computing
stations that we use are averaging
around 20 watts which was perfect for
our system and also we needed a simple
user interface for beginners so there's
a picture my brother we actually bought
one ourselves with a bit of help from
the road scholars Southern Africa forum
and broad optum finge and became testing
it out and I think we yeah we love this
computer we ended up writing a letter to
one of the directors of envy neo Eric
glance who's fortunate actually to be
here with us today and we were pretty
thrilled when Eric wrote back with us
and was pretty enthusiastic about are
using this computer and as we continue
to move forward
this was exactly the type of system that
we wanted to use for our Center I'm this
actually picture our very first Google
search ever on Feng GaN oh and i think
he was researching planting organic
onions now if you can read it closely
but so we actually were fortunate to
really form a partnership with envy neo
and this was made possible through
funding from here the gore will the
Google corporate giving counsel and also
from the craigslist charitable fund and
we realized once we started working with
convenient not only with a good partner
to help us with computers but actually
to design a broadband internet
connection that could actually reach
this remote island in like Toria so we
were fortunate to purchase 10 computers
and nique yellow key on the center today
in the in the past year we've registered
over a thousand members in our Center
which makes us the the fastest-growing
VCT center anywhere in the district and
actually we've just installed these new
computers within the last month and
talking with Richard who is now our
executive director yeah we've had people
pouring in the doors to use the center
and kind of like we'd hoped lots of
other organizations and small businesses
have really grown out of the center
here's just a list of a few the second
phase of this project is what we're
working on right now which is actually
trying to establish a broadband
connection right now we're using some
small cell phone modems on the island
which are working well for our purposes
but our really vision has been to bring
high-speed internet so that people can
surf and research their own ideas the
way that we do and working with envy nia
we've actually come up with a solution
which involves putting a radio
transmitter on top of a skyscraper in
the nearest city to the north about 70
70 kilometres to the north city called
kisumu and broadcasting a signal to a
small tower following Joel's example
another family has actually donated
their land where we can put a small
tower on top of the mountain on him Finn
Ghana and fortunately for us there's
actually a line of sight from this
skyscraper to the tip of this mountain
and so with this system basically which
we are in the process of implementing
will have high speed internet access for
our commute
Center as well as a series of clinics on
the island that we hope to link into
this network and what I want to talk
with you about today is the way that
this idea of an organic health response
growing out of a community center that's
equipped with the World Wide Web has
really kind of branched off into three
main objectives the first is this idea
of a cyber VCT club where you get
membership to a club simply by knowing
your own HIV status the second thing
well mainly talk about that for just a
second this is the this is the etiology
on a club right now you have to know
your status every six months you come
back and renew your membership and
basically gives you free access to the
center but at the same time as more and
more of these businesses come online you
know we've been fortunate that the guys
who helped us build our Center have
actually become their own independent
business now we've got a crafts
cooperative a bicycle shop an organic
farm that's we've continued to run and
basically our ideas that this card will
entitle you to access and discounts
within this entire network of businesses
to just kind of continue the incentive
of encouraging people to know their HIV
status but also allowing us to really
essentially pay forward micro-financing
will provide a small loan and training
to a small business and say in exchange
instead of paying us back what we want
you to do is provide discounts to
everyone else in this network the people
in your community that could use this
valuable service at a cheaper price
that's the you kiala keanu club the
second thing is that we've got an
opportunity to develop a youth radio
station we've been working with envy neo
and a few other partners to actually
implement a suba radio station out of
our center this is actually a broadcast
map that shows from our tower site on
top of the island where our small radio
station will reach its actually
extensive population and we think this
is a really important way to preserve
both the tsuba language cultural
identity but also to develop hiv/aids
programming that's not coming from the
outside actually designed and
implemented by people in these
communities and finally the third thing
is the opportunity to implement a micro
clinic pilot and I'd like to spend some
time talking with you about that today
when I was doing my research this this
concept of cheetah came up again and
again and if you look at in the
literature it's often described as kind
of a superstitious myth that people have
a curse from ancestors or kind of a
superstitious myth of people think of
the cause of HIV and matura is
essentially as a wasting illness that
afflicts someone who breaks certain
cultural traditions and the illness
itself looks exactly like hiv/aids
people waste away and die but what was
interesting to me and talking with
people about the causes of cheera you
know people would describe that cheer
just doesn't come to an individual who's
infected with it essentially infects
their whole family and ways you can
bring chira are you know sleeping
sleeping around while your wife is
pregnant certain types of cultural
disputes domestic disputes can bring
cheer on a family and as I begin to
explore more and more into this idea
realized that people are actually very
intuitively and sensitively talking
about social network phenomena behind
hiv/aids which i think is an area that
actually hasn't been addressed properly
at all in our public health work for
hiv/aids and that's what we intend to do
with this micro clinic pilot a lot of my
own experience with this is from one of
my close friends a man named a call on
Feng GaN oh I'm alcohol in 2007 when I
was first there and it wasn't when I
returned six months later I remember
being approached by this man on the road
who was greeting me and I didn't
recognize him at all and it wasn't and
he was wearing an oxford shirt and I was
thinking where did this guy get an
oxford shirt and it was only when i
realized that this was the shirt that I
had given to a call and that actually
was my friend that I realized that yeah
it was the same person but also that
he'd gotten much sicker he was infected
with HIV and we talked about it when i
was there in 2007 but for a variety of
reasons and a lot of it had to do with
stigman his inability to talk with his
family about this disease he decided to
disengage from treatment and
unfortunately for my friend he became
sick extremely fast also developed
tuberculosis which is the real killer of
people with HIV in Africa
and unfortunately my friend passed away
this really was yeah an extreme blow for
me obviously for his family he was the
sole breadwinner for about 18 people and
to be honest has been a lot of my own
personal motivation to continue working
with this project this family is so
intimately tied with a lot of things
that we do as an organization in part
because of our close relationships but
also because of what we've really
learned about the way the HIV affects
not just individuals but social networks
and in the final few weeks of his life
we really developed a program around the
idea that we needed everyone to pitch in
to help keep keep a call alive and for
the first time he was able to really
talk with everyone in this family and we
made a plan about one brother who is
going to bring food a few times a week
one brother who is going to take him to
the clinic every time he needed to go
other people who were going to come and
help him on his farm and this this kind
of informal support network that we
created for him in the final weeks of
his life is really the foundation for
the micro clinic pilot at the same time
our community center was able to train a
group of local researchers and for the
past two years we've actually been doing
community-based research on FN gaano
through our partnerships with the canyon
Medical Research Institute in the
University of California I don't have
too much time to go into it but a lot of
what I've been really interested in from
this research is looking at what types
of social support people rely on in this
community and as you can see you know
people get affection they have lots of
opportunities to people they trust but
at the same time you know it's people
have a it's hard to read from these
graphs but there's not a lot of support
that people have for when it comes to
sharing food medical fees school fees
household chores and those are really
critical elements that I'll talk about
here in a minute when someone becomes
infected with HIV because when you
become sick those are exactly the drains
that that not only you as an individual
must absorb but your social network and
this is essentially the problem as I see
it right now with the way that hiv/aids
has been tackled in sub-saharan Africa
we continue to separate treatment from
prevention we the idea of treatment
essentially equals
access to antiretroviral medication to
anyone who's infected with the virus and
the idea of prevention has really been
around this idea of behavior change
within at-risk uninfected populations
the problem is that as I see it and is
when we understand an organism is not
just an individual bound by a membrane
but really a nexus of relationships HIV
isn't infected individuals it's
affecting networks without efforts to
formally engage support networks
hiv-infected individuals lose key
support they remain stigma stigmatized
and isolated they're fearful to seek
help for opportunistic infections that
you know TB in many places is often
synonymous with AIDS so people who are
coughing off and will stay inside their
houses because they don't want to be
seen they're forced to manage
challenging antiretroviral regimens that
have all sorts of side effects
completely on their own without the help
of you know the normal support systems
that they would have from malaria or for
you know about of stomach flu and have
to now navigate some pretty challenging
healthcare decisions on their own but
the point is that when individuals get
sick and when they fail treatment is not
just their own immune systems that
suffer their whole social network takes
a hit reduced adult productivity burden
of orphans rising food insecurity
reduced income for education increasing
medical fees and general economic
hardships come hand-in-hand when an
individual gets sick and this is exactly
what I saw with a calls family as he got
sicker and sicker and essentially what
what we're seeing for so many families
on Lake Victoria is a vicious cycle
where HIV AIDS related illness weakens
rural breadwinners when this happens
women and girls especially within these
HIV stricken families faced some pretty
desperate economic choices and on Lake
Victoria for about 20 years one of the
primary ways to get access to income was
by forming relationships with fishermen
and for so many girls when their family
took a hit when you know when
breadwinners were getting sick they
didn't have funds to pay for for school
fees well the first thing so many
families do is basically pull the girls
back from school
and for so many young women often times
it's young women who have just have one
more year of high school to go and they
just got to find a way to pay for it and
I don't really know if it's appropriate
to think about these relationships as
prostitution they're generally the
generally our relationship that endures
over time but it's certainly a
transactional relationship and it really
created a perfect situation for the
transmission of hiv/aids through these
communities once it emerged and the
argument that I make is that it's not
that HIV is passed from a sick uncle
down to his nieces directly but that
when HIV comes into a family that risk
is induced throughout the network it's a
social network phenomenon and that those
individuals in that family are much more
likely to become infected because he's
getting sick and that's really the idea
of social network induction of HIV risk
which actually don't think many people
are talking about but is exactly what we
designed what we intend to address in
our in our pilot there's a couple little
bits other bits to talk about one is the
idea of risk compensation which is that
we're seeing in lots of places even in
places here like San Francisco where as
access to care improves people have a
decreased perception of the severity of
this illness and actually unfortunately
we're seeing a rise in risk behavior in
populations where people feel that HIV
is actually an easy disease to manage
and we're seeing an increase in HIV
incidence unfortunately which for me
really underscores the need to not only
engage people who are sick but actually
everyone in their networks with
education about what treatment actually
means the good news however is that for
the first time we're actually proving
that treating individuals can have a
reduction on what we call community
viral load and this can have a huge
preventive impact that actually by
reducing the amount the number of viral
copies in someone's blood they're much
less effective and that we can actually
decrease the transmission of HIV
actually by treating individuals and so
that this is just one way that
prevention and treatment have started to
come together but really our argument
has been that we need to redefine the
unit of intervention and that that in
order to optimize treatment for
individuals individuals need both a
highly active enter
etro viral medication but also education
and support skills training for their
associated support networks at the same
time in order to prevent new infections
we can't just educate we actually need
to design systems that treat individuals
better and this brings us to another
serendipitous crossing of paths I'm
grateful that both of my friends are
here today but while studying at Oxford
was actually fortunate to meet Daniel
Zoghbi who's the founder of an
organization called at the time the
global micro clinic project now known as
micro clinics international I also met
matt werner who was working for this
organization as as their PR men and we
began talking about the work that they
were doing in places like Jordan India
and Kentucky and basically the micro
clinics have designed a model a social
networking model around providing care
and treatment not just to individuals
but their extended families this model
is really and end the people within
their social networks this model is
really designed around diabetes but as
we begin talking to we realize it
actually a micro clinic model which of
the micro clinic is not a small building
but rather something like a therapy
therapy management collective was
actually something that could work
extremely well in the context of
hiv/aids for rural communities ontem
finga no and so we spent the last two
years developing what we call the
Pentagon Oh Island healthy networks
pilot program and the idea is the the
world's first micro clinic pilot for
hiv/aids and our goal and mrs. actually
has been enabled by funding from the
Google corporate giving council has been
to Train first 50 micro clinics on
fingernail island east sub location
where the etiology on the center is
located we're actually calling these
there's been some confusion micro
clinics the abbreviation MC also
overlaps with another important
abbreviation in HIV treatment and
prevention which is male circumcision so
we don't want there to be any confusion
about us asking people to join an MC
group
so we've renamed them can ya clothes
which actually means team in de Lua so
these are groups of 5 to 15 people these
are extended families their church
groups their sports teams we're not
trying to recreate the real and tell
people to form new support groups we're
really looking to do is engage all the
groups that people normally rely on for
support and help train them as a group
on how to deal with the third of their
membership that's infected with HIV and
this programs are designed to achieve
three outcomes to improve heart
adherence for faces clients that are on
in finga know so I faces relates to the
the treatment program that's been
implemented through the canyon Ministry
of Health and the University of
California here in San Francisco we're
also look to improve clinical outcomes
for these individuals and at the same
time we look to improve general social
support services for their HIV affected
social networks we've developed a 12
session curriculum that each of these
groups will go through through the help
of community health workers that will be
trained at the etiology on the center
and then we'll conduct bi-weekly
trainings out in the community with
these groups this is a map of them finga
no East where our Center is located and
kind of just a graphical representation
of the way that community health workers
that have been trained by the Ministry
of Health will receive training at the
ecology on a center that will allow them
actually to go out into the community
and conduct these workshops on a
bi-weekly basis at the same time we've
continued to work with the University of
California in San Francisco the Kenya
Medical Research Institute to to develop
a study to really rigorously evaluate
the impact of this type of program we
feel this program actually has great
potential not only for resource-limited
settings on Lake Victoria but actually
throughout western Kenya and sub-saharan
Africa so we've really developed a
longitudinal cohort study to actually
follow to follow these communities
through time and measure the impact both
for individuals and their social
networks our primary research objectives
are three we're looking to evaluate the
long-term effectiveness of the micro
clinic social networking strategy which
is really focused both on the clinical
outcome
and the network effects we've also
introduced something that's fairly novel
which is the idea of collecting hair
specimens from participants in our study
right now it's actually extremely
challenging for physicians in
resource-limited settings to make
determinations about patient adherence
when patients start to fail treatment
it's hard to know if it's because
they're not actually able to take their
medications as in the case of my friend
who passed away or if actually true
viral resistance which is a real problem
has emerged to the regimen that they're
on but the self-reported surveys that
people provide architour ously
unreliable and there's actually a group
of researchers here at UCSF that have
developed technology to actually
evaluate hair samples for hair specimen
excuse me here do hair specimen analysis
to determine adherence over time off
much like hba1c is used for diabetes
which for our purposes we actually saw
as a perfect marker so we're actually
looking to pilot this novel biomarker in
the field to see if this is a useful way
of following adherence and in and of
itself we think this can be a really
valuable contribution to the way that
adherence is monitored in
resource-limited settings throughout the
world and finally we've really been
looking to explore a novel design in our
research methodology that wouldn't
necessarily compromise the ongoing
service provision in this extremely
resource-limited setting so while you
know we've really spent a lot of time to
creatively come up with a way to do this
research that would really both bring
the community into the into the center
and the program as freely and openly as
possible allow us to rigorously evaluate
the pilot but also to really encourage
research again in the future in this
type of vein one that really prioritizes
the needs of the community ahead of the
need to get the results at the end of
the study and basically this is the
study that we've designed we'll be
focusing out of one clinic on the island
and basically all of the clients who are
currently on antiretroviral medication
who live within infineon o East where
the micro clinic pilot will take place
will be enrolled in our exposed arm and
our unexposed arm is basically clients
that reason that are living within these
other communities where we're not yet
able to implement this study
here's a list of some of the the
different surveys and indicators that
we're using to track our progress in an
example of someone getting their hair
cut kind of an overall diagram of the
way in which you really tried to line up
the service provision of the ecology
honest enter the micro clinic pilot
itself and the research staff that will
be involved in a really an integrative
way at which they can work together to
facilitate a lot of communication so
that this pilot runs smoothly and that
the community the community benefits
above all so it's an 18-month timeline
for our study from yeah which will
actually be starting when i arrived in
September I'm actually leaving this
saturday and i'll be in kenya for the
next year so this is kind of our
timeline for the next year and a half
and i just wanted to finish with a very
brief discussion about you know what's
often talked about in global health is
the idea of vertical versus horizontal
interventions a vertical intervention is
where you target something very
specifically saying like we're going
after malaria and you channel all your
resources to nail that one particular
target whereas a horizontal intervention
is something where we say all right you
know what we want to address maternal
health very broadly and extend primary
care services for a variety of diseases
and conditions and nutritional problems
I think both of these types of inter
both of these types of approaches have
their limitations and what we've really
tried to conceptualize with our program
is the idea of a cone that we're
starting with something we're starting
with a banner and a target which in this
community most certainly is hiv/aids but
the idea is layering prog layering
programs and building not only a
physical infrastructure in the center
itself but actually a social
infrastructure through these groups
within the community and a means of
communication both with the outside
world through broadband internet and
with themselves through a radio network
that really allows them to take and
harness an issue that is a really big
issue in global health there is a lot of
funding available there are resources
and people working on hiv/aids and use
that to build something that's actually
enduring and allow them to tackle other
challenges which certainly on FN Ghana
we have many clean water maternal health
emergency services nutritional problems
just to name a few and use that banner
to really build something that that
stretches far out and actually tackles
what I argue actually is the root of
this disease which isn't just a virus
but actually extends out into the
ecosystems and social structures of this
population as well and for me this is
what I've realized over the last few
years what I really want to do with my
life and I think it's also something i
realized that has a lot to do with
sustainability we often talk about
sustainability being you know a really
perfect financial plan or business
structure that will continue to generate
income for a project and I think that is
important but i also think part of it is
recognizing that it's about the
commitment of individuals who are part
of a project not only for myself but for
the rest of the team for Richard and
Joel the rest of the people that are
working with us both at the organic
health response and at micro clinics
international I think we've really seen
this as our life's passion and that
we're committed to seeing it through
this funding cycle and the next one and
the next and developing these programs
over time and to me I think that's
really at the heart of what I think we
as individuals on this side of the
north-south divide should be talking
about when we say sustainability next
year I'd invite all of you to follow our
progress I'm going taking my own first
crack at a blog and this is the address
the organic health response at tumblr
com and also feel free to check out our
websites the organic healthy spawns org
and micro clinics org yeah try and keep
you updated on our progress and fill you
in when we get back yeah really grateful
for this opportunity to come and speak
with all of you
okay i'm assuming yeah we've got time
for a few questions if anyone's anyone's
gadam
hi Chad I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit more about the the
micro clinic project that you're setting
up and and the the the research that
you're doing that will lead to medical
journal articles I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit more about that
sure I think the the the research that
we're doing with the study I think is
important for a few reasons I think one
I think it will provide actionable
programmatic data for organizations
throughout western Kenya that are trying
to find ways of really addressing this
realization that providing access to
medication for individuals is not enough
and that people continue to get sick at
the same time we've got all sorts of
prevention organizations that have been
really trying to push behavior change
you hear about the ABCs throughout
western Kenya abstinence be faithful use
condoms and those interventions have I
think we've kind of reached a plateau of
their effectiveness I think there's an
immediately actionable programmatic data
that's going to come out of this
research study as we begin to see the
results of an integrated system where
you're addressing both treatment and
prevention on a social network level at
the same time I think there's some real
literature that can actually emerge
that's an important discussion that we
need to have as an hiv/aids community
about where we're directing our
resources and how and I think building
up empowering structures where we're
actually training individuals not only
necessarily to address things like
hiv/aids but how to adjust the the
social challenges and that the economic
challenges that they face as a group
that building those types of
infrastructures will allow us to help
social networks become much more
resilient and I think that's a global
literature that that we really hope to
present during the course at the end of
this 18-month longitudinal study and
finally the last piece was just this
this idea of using hair sample analysis
I'm actually very curious to see how the
skills I nymph in Ghana there's a lot of
superstition around the idea of of
witchcraft and hair samples so I'm
curious to see how this will go in the
clinical setting I think we're fortunate
that we've built up a lot of trust
within this community and people really
understand what we're doing and we're
really hoping that we can use this tool
as something that will benefit
missions throughout sub-saharan Africa
as a way of following adherence we're
currently there doesn't really exist
anything other than asking people have
you been taking all of your medications
which if you ask me that question I
think would be unreliable so I think
that I think those those are what we're
really hoping will be the main outcomes
of this study that's a great question hi
well thanks very much for the talk um
I'm curious now looking back do you see
the setup of the community center and
the internet access as a sort of a key
part of as a hub or going forward do you
think you'd be able to do these clinics
without a sort of a Technology Center um
that's really a fantastic question I
think you know when we got started and
we were talking about what types of
things people wanted to see in the
center and as everyone kept talking to
us about internet we want access to the
Internet I think I remember kind of
thinking to myself like man like really
like Internet's the most important thing
here like we've got you know we need
toilets we need like better farming
systems we need you know an emergency
boat that can get people to the mainland
but we realized was that actually with
the internet was actually a vehicle to
create just what you're talking about a
hub that would really allow people there
to say this is an idea this is a need
that I see in my community the same way
Richard and Joel came up with this idea
say this is something that that I see we
need to do and actually here's a place
where we can get organized we can get
information about it here's the umbrella
of the center where instead of just a
random group of farmers emailing someone
in the you know around the world we can
actually say look we're working with
this organization we have a center where
you can come and train us we have
seminar rooms we have the resources to
continue this and facilitate and
administrate this program I think we've
seen that the Internet is the single
most important i think intervention that
we could have started off with that is
not just a silver bullet for one problem
but like we said really a tree that once
we plant that seed really bare
sustainable fruit and provide shade for
all these other ideas to start growing
so yeah i really appreciate that
question and i think we really realize
that the internet is at the heart of
locally directed development
great well thank you very much for your
time yeah really appreciate the chance
to speak with all of you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
