Sterling and Bruce invited a good friend
of his got clean care to come talk to us
about spines the Internet of Things and
how they're working on designing this
stuff and making it work of course I
think everybody knows Bruce he's author
journalists bloggers and futurist if I
can read my handwriting Scott's ahead of
3d design at cranbrook academy of art
which is where some famous designers to
come out like charles memes and some
others worked at IDEO for a couple of
years worked at ericsson before with
sony ericsson taught some stuff in japan
and the cran book guys actually are
famous for actually making things real
not just designing stuff so they're
going to talk about that today so
without that anymore at Bruce come up
and start
right so thanks for showing up today
pleasure to visit your justly famed
Google campus so I came here with two
things I have a design theory about
computers and i also have a personal
problem as a science fiction writer so
you know first the theory of course well
I was asked to write a little visionary
book which I did I don't know if you've
seen this came out in 2004 this is kind
of my grand visionary scheme about
computers and their role in our society
and networks of what they're good for
and so forth and so on you know when it
comes to computers and networks and
visionaries have been kind of surprising
numbers of these grand theories I'd like
to call a meta history's little meta
histories you know sort of grand foggy
theoretical notions about the true
nature the computational enterprise and
they always fall short or they get
fulfilled in various interesting ways
and then it's back to the drawing board
back to what they used to call a drawing
board because of course we don't
actually use drawing boards anymore but
you could draw some quick sketches of
these sort of grand theoretical schemes
by summarizing them kind of the bumper
sticker method and I want to run through
a few of these today to sort of put my
own notion into some historical
perspective so you know it's going to do
some future is prediction about
computers and networks and what they're
doing you can summarize them the way
you'd summarize a crime scene right I
mean why do crimes happen why does
anything happen well they happen because
of means and motive and opportunity
right i mean there's a way how stuff
happens and that's the means and there
are things that we imagine that
computers might be good for and there
are things that computers are actually
good for those would be the mode ifs
periodically you have to reassess those
things because computers keep changing
and so do our ideas about them and then
there's motives which is why things
happen the various things that need
doing to maintain a civilization
like supplying electrical power and
sewage and there's a bunch of other
stuff that doesn't actually need doing
but it's the kind of thing people
actually do in real life like sending
spam messages sometimes we meet some
large and serious needs with our
computers and most the time we just set
a screw around in our short-term can do
way that happens we get rewarded in some
fashion so then there's what happens
which is the opportunities means motives
opportunities these are conceivable
things moving into the realm of doable
things something I find of great
interest as a journalist and a novelist
new things disrupting the installed base
means motives opportunities that's
pretty simple even though the world's
full of unsolved mysteries and nobody
really predicts the future my scheme
which came out in this book you can see
it my flickr said there's like YouTube
videos me ranting about it something
I've been talking about since 2004 not
hard to find let me just try to place it
in context by listing and describing
some rival schemes the grandfather this
bunch to be the original scheme of
boniva bush as described in his famous
magazine article from 1945 atlantic
magazine as we may think published it
just as world war two was ending the
means is what boniva Bush called the
mimics which is a kind of analog desktop
library and the motive was accelerating
scientific research through networks and
hyperlinks really you could look this up
networks in hyper lates 1945 and the
opportunity or the upshot of Bush's
predictions was Bush's establishment of
the National Science Foundation what
Bush called science the endless frontier
the NSFNET that wasn't too many years
away from his original concept of the
Memex visionary theories about computers
go we can call that one a major success
one of the most brilliant acts of
technical forecasting ever okay then
there was JCR Licklider thesis of
nineteen sixty one of the founders of
the net the means you
computer symbiosis yes enhanced human
bodies enhanced artificial intelligences
meshing together into a cyborg super
mind yes the mode of creating an
Internet the intergalactic internet he
called it to link machines together so
they could be linked directly to the
human mind and the opportunity was
creating cyborgs scholars for the
Pentagon okay that scheme did not
exactly work out I mean nowhere near so
well as Bush's ideas but we did get the
ARPANET from it you know it wasn't
brilliant for casting but it turned out
to be a very fertile mistake right so
often these schemes aren't written out
in so many words are kind of techno
folklore really for instance if you read
popular period books from the 1950s and
1960s to talk about Thinking Machines
very commonly they predict a fully
planned economy basically a kind of
cyber socialism why so that mankind can
explore the moon and the planets like
well wait a minute what does Thinking
Machines actually have to do with space
flight or going into space well very
little really except that a lot of the
guys who are working in California on
early computers were also Aeronautics
guys I mean there's just a lot of bleed
over between engineering cadres and
besides if you talk to somebody at the
time it was obvious that computing was
the highest technology we had and rocket
ships with the highest technology we had
so the highest technology we have has to
help the science technology we have it
just seems obvious well it was a period
notion in the spirit of that times it
was obvious history passes it seems odd
to us right other means virtual reality
motives spiritual transcendence the
upshot a ciphers psychedelic society
only not really maybe Warcraft and
second life but you might get the means
email and Netscape the motives
commercial disintermediation point click
and ship the upshot internet stop boo
the means artificial intelligence the
motive Otto designed super a is the
upshot a singularity the end of history
the means open source instructables the
motives popular mechanics and popular
programming the upshot cyber arts and
cyber crafts the means military command
control communications computers and
intelligence the motive battle space
awareness the upshot destroying enemy
armies mission accomplished now I know
the newer schemes you know are a little
harder to describe because we lack
historical perspective on them they
haven't become silly yet the means
Wikipedia the motive free knowledge the
upshot world enlightenment the means
real-time located systems the motive
global geolocation the opportunity a
city of bits the means search engines
the motive publish everything first then
search the net for at the upshot old
publishing hierarchies turn into new
publishing hierarchies with the power
law distribution of Google juice the
means computer fabricators the motives
fabricators that can fabricate
fabricators the upshot acorn utopia
alright well in real life you don't
actually get single brilliant
technologies which work and splendid
isolation it's kind of easier to think
about them that way but it we know now
that that's not the way the world
actually works so instead we tend to get
grab-bag theories like web two point oh
and the means of web two point O is a
whole bunch of stuff it's tagging
perpetual beta granular address ability
PageRank User Content long tail cheap
scalability open api's web as a platform
for development Ajax Ruby p2p networks
human collective intelligence that's
just part of it and sometimes these
factors seem to work together smoothly
and sometimes they kind of obviously
clash but the motive is a new kind of
web that feels different to users and
developers
the opportunity revenge of the boom its
user bubbles instead of investor bubbles
so you know which brings me to this
scheme that I described and a bunch of
conference speeches in this book that I
wrote and my means are cad/cam
computer-aided design plus RFID plus
fabs plus tracking plus searching plus
recycling plus and ever-growing pool of
metadata and the motive is a historical
transition to a society that is
high-tech but also environmentally
sustainable and the upshot is an
Internet of Things an internet of things
that I call spines spines are the kind
of thing that is the native to an
Internet of Things they are internet
metadata objects they're mostly metadata
and occasionally their physical that's
what a spine is and it's a future world
a visionary future world based in
present-day technologies there's no
artificial intelligence in it there's no
machine intelligence of any kind there's
no ubiquity there are no virtual
realities no augmented reality's it's
about reality reality it's about stuff
it's basically what we have now right
now but RIT larger and linked up and
bent to solving our worst problem which
is that the way we run industrial
society can't go on it's not physically
possible it's not sustainable and that's
a pretty severe problem a really severe
problem I can promise you it's going to
get a lot more severe we're on a slider
bar between the unthinkable which is the
consequence of doing nothing and the
unimaginable which is trying to dream up
stuff that will actually work and I'm
trying to shove that slider bar into the
direction of our imagining new things
that are hard to describe but might
conceivably actually function now I
often use the expression you can google
your shoes in the
morning to try to make it clear to
people there would be some major
advantages to having an Internet of
Things but that's just my bumper sticker
the key to my spying scheme is that
unlike all previous visionary computer
schemes this one concern sustainability
you know it's a little hard to imagine
that we could practically use computer
networks computers and networks to
achieve sustainability it's a little
like saying that Thinking Machines will
get us into outer space but I argue in
my book that there's likely no other
practical way to do it we've tried many
other methods gotten brought got not
very far at all with sustainability we
do have severe global environmental
problems that need to be addressed at
very high speed and computer and network
technologists are highly inventive and
they may be moving fast enough to make a
big dent in that crisis maybe so I was
this visionary in a design school and I
was commissioned to write this visionary
manifesto for MIT press which I did and
I'm happy about my book and I'm glad to
brag about it it went into a second
printing and the reviews were kind and
now you see stuff like this I have to
buy this in and a munich on the way over
this is the Economist doing their little
Internet of Things pitch here are the
sort of latest issues a 16 page report
on the coming wireless revolution and
it's quoting Adam Greenfield the author
of everywhere and it's got some nice
ambient findability riffs and you know
it's like three years after I did my
little piece here instead of like
hitting the conventional business press
and I feel that's kind of the right
place to be and I'm kind of thrilled
about that but as I mentioned earlier I
have a problem I have kind of a severe
personal problem here because I'm not
just this guy who writes about design
and I'm also not a tech journalist i
have also like try to write novels and
you know as a design visionary I'm kind
of happy to make things up and you know
that's kind of groovy and my schemes I
think makes a certain kind of sense it's
not particularly difficult to understand
you can look at a little flowchart of it
you could just sort of say well this is
like
product product lifecycle management
only kind of like amped up by a factor
of 10 and how hard could that be not
hard to do you know and as a journalist
I'm a cynic of course so then I look at
the scheme like mine and I think I'll
the install base will never let that
happen there's going to be all kinds of
IP problems and the devils and the
details and who's going to manage the
routers and what about the privacy
issues and so forth and so on but then
it's a novelist they have a more severe
problem which is like making this stuff
work on the page I mean what's it like
to wake up and among in an Internet of
Things it's not enough to say you can
google your shoes you know I mean it has
to actually make a difference and I have
to like describe it in some way which is
vaguely plausible and just isn't full of
hokum now I'm a journalist and I'm a
design critic and I'm a novelist but man
I'm not a designer and I'm not even a
technologist fact I have very few skills
there so when I asked myself things you
know when I wrote this treatise I was
unable to think well enough about the
user interface how do people actually
deal with this I mean suppose it comes
true i mean what's it like on a daily
perspective how do you relate to it how
do users relate to the system how do
they see it how do they guide it how do
they judge whether it's working properly
or not this vast recycling spying wheel
a virtual design identity tags
fabrication tracking searching recycling
pools of historical metadata all these
things I went to such pains to kind of
describe how's that work even is it in
your hand is it on your head you could
draw a flow chart that shows it working
in an abstract sense but what happens I
mean how do you describe what happens
when you walk into a room full of the
Internet of Things and you fire up some
things do you log on what I mean how do
you do it what is it what does it look
like is it like an apple iphone like the
mobil oil could remote control for
reality you know maybe it's a
head-mounted heads-up display like with
you know spectacles glasses laser things
on the retina
maybe it's one of these new skull
mounted cognitive devices that set of
reads brain waves and somehow slots them
into whatever you're looking at maybe
their regional versions of it or
scalable versions I mean it's about a
real internet which has real 3d
dimensions so maybe you get not just
everywhere but like body where room
we're building where city where nation
where global where how do you tell those
levels apart if they exist at all now
you'd think that it would be a simple
matter for a sci-fi writer to just sit
down and make something up I mean how
hard can that be just make it up you
know just pull it out of your hat but
you know I've now learned enough about
interface design and experience design
and human factors design etc etc etc
that I know you just can't wave your
hands at it it's actually really hard
work now the closest we have the spines
today is something that software
engineers call product lifecycle
management I just came back from a
conference of these guys PLM they call
it please liberate me mandas that stuff
suck I mean it is it's so bad I mean
this is sort of the hardware for the
internet of things as we understand a
product lifecycle management it's so bad
that engineers were confessing to me
that they spend ninety percent of their
time acting as software clerks for
product lifecycle management systems and
maybe ten percent of the time
engineering now you know that prospect
doesn't actually bother me that's not a
tragedy I'm sure that engineers will be
software jockeys for as far as the eye
can see that's just a given but they
don't like the design of Product
Lifecycle Management you know please
liberate me right I think that's that's
that's a legitimate plea the world needs
a PLM and needs product lifecycle
management that is liberating it needs a
system of manipulating using buying
selling manufacturing recycling physical
objects that empowers people in the way
that goo
empowers people we really need some
product lifecycle management that isn't
evil I don't even know what that looks
like I mean I've been working on it a
long time trying to work it on the page
it's just very difficult I want to know
how it feels and what it means I need
help I generally get help from designers
because they can design and i can so i
want you i want to now a job introduce
you to buy my colleague Scott clinker
here who actually helped me with my book
shaping things some time ago he works
for cranbrook school of design a place
where I go sometimes he has a he has a
presentation to make I think he can help
me I hope you can help him help me thank
you for your attention and thanks for
the t-shirt to hey been there done that
God hi good morning
so when I learned about Bruce's ideas I
was very very excited and I run a
graduate design program i have about 16
graduate students were in Bloomfield
Hills Michigan north of Detroit and
we're really focused on trying to give
form to experimental cultural ideas so
when we heard about Bruce's ideas were
very excited about it and and we can
help him to visualize his his his
visionary ideas and we we will but we
were also thinking that it would be much
more interesting if we could get google
involved in it because it seems like it
would be a very much a win-win situation
for for everyone because he matically it
really fits with with google and we
could as we put together a project a
project would be much more informed by
google knowledge and creativity in the
process too so we would we would like to
talk about some kind of collaboration
between Bruce and the school and and
Google but I wanted to show a little bit
about what what we do at cranbrook this
is just a shot of the campus it's
actually more more beautiful in the
Google campus I'd have to say but you
have a great campus here so we call what
we do a narrative research in design and
we're looking at the way that you know
in the in the old days product design
was really about shaping an object but
these days product design of course as
we all know it is much more involved
than that bringing together aspects of
image object experience and story so
we're looking at these inner
relationships that begin to ultimately
tell a story and
we're looking at other aspects of of
culture like gaming and Hollywood these
areas now this is really one of our
major cultural exports in America and
we're looking at these for inspiration
on how to tell stories and and how that
begins to integrate with ideas about
product of course the fashion world has
these storytelling for a long time to
encourage people encourage consumers to
make emotional choices about product but
here physical things and stories are
very much integrated and Bruce and I
last night we're talking about this idea
of mented reality or ways that
storytelling and intersects with with
the physical world this is a cell phone
that was produced by Samsung that was
originally a prop from the movie The
Matrix so just this idea about this this
interplay between the physical and and
the virtual I think from a design
perspective is a very powerful idea and
who better represents that interplay
between the physical and the virtual
then then this guy so we could think of
as a product design as or the product
itself as a story container it goes out
into the world through a story network
and we can think of the designer as a
storyteller I like this quote on this
quote kind of sums it up unlike the more
or less ephemeral media design has the
capacity to cast myths into an enduring
solid and tangible form so that it they
seem to be reality itself so that really
sums up this this idea of taking ideas
and and and portraying them away in a
way or basically just physical izing
them so that your ideas or a story
enters into into the world in a very
tangible way so with the students of
course we're
talking about these ideas and and
creating methods around them but really
it comes down to what story are as a as
a designer what story you interested in
in telling and and we're finding that
one of the well of course one of the
most important stories that as
profession in industrial design but also
I think as a society in general of
course sustainability is on everyone's
mind and how we craft that story and how
we provide a vision to people about what
that might look like is really important
I think that's what Bruce is is trying
to do with his book and a lot of there's
a lot of theories out there a lot of
ideas about sustainability but there are
really very few portrayals of what
that's really going to feel like and I
think that's what we want to do with
Bruce we want to look at some of these
ideas about spines and bring them to
life through through a design portrayal
so what some of the students are doing
now we've called speculative futures
whether some of them are looking at the
values of technology for example this
this camera sticker by Celine Lee which
is a basically a wet webcam that is
portrayed as a sticker it's a working
webcam and but it's make it's really
announcing itself through a strong
graphic that could be applied anywhere
and she was looking at what would a
society look like that had had these
eyeballs everywhere and what kind of
emotional impact would that have on
people and how would that affect
people's behaviors
this is this is kind of a funny one
based on a paradox by some Pio Hong
who's a Korean student came to America
and one of his first reactions to
American culture was WOW Americans are
really big and and at the same time
while he saw on the on the television
there's a constant push for consumption
sort of you know eaten or paid less but
at the same time everyone's supposed to
look like a supermodel so he designed
the external stomach which is a kind of
critical commentary I suppose and the
proposal is that you would the external
stomach would allow you to overeat but
not get fat so it's a it's a critical
proposal kid tech by Carter Wong this is
a this has to do with fabbing or 3d
printing at home so looking at a future
where we'll have 3d printers at home you
can print your own electronics at home
download a product printed out at home
in this case a cell phone so I think
this came out of his desire to get rid
of clients he was looking for a future
where he could be able to offer his
products online himself interaction this
is this cell phone by Mia Lee is where
where most electronics are moving in the
direction of miniaturization she wanted
to look at an idea of how it could it
could be the interface could become more
bodily I have a different physical
relationship to it reality games by Sean
Sean Lee is a geo-located you could call
it a video game she wanted to get kids
out of out from in front of the tube and
get them out exploring the world so she
created what this could be you could
call this another augmented reality
where
that the idea is that you could well she
she created a narrative a story that is
basically a scavenger hunt that's based
on locations specific information
delivered to your cell phone so based on
a GPS location in this case on the
cranbrook campus you would go to a
certain point on the cranbrook campus
and you would be given a clue to a
narrative that would send you to the
next place on campus and so at this a
story unfolds and as you're also
exploring the physical space so the same
kind of idea it could be used to explore
new york or tokyo for example scenario
building is a strong tool that we use
and and something that we'll be using in
working with Bruce but this is a project
called the day computers enter the body
by some pill hong and it it gives you a
sense of what we go through with with
storyboarding so in this scenario you
would inject you inject software and
hardware into your body and then an
augmented reality interface would pop up
so she's setting her preferences here
and then also a virtual Butler shows up
on her shoulder and then this begins to
look at what the experience might feel
like in it augmented reality or in the
it transitions between augmented reality
and virtual reality but what that might
physically look like so there's some
sophisticated storyboarding going on
here
and then as a as a result of that of
creating that narrative the student also
goes goes back in and creates props or
basically product proposals these are
antennas that the the characters and his
narrative would use to that would
transmit the computers and further
computers inside their bodies and this
is a 3d print of the the the butler and
creating the hardware that would inject
the software into the body the evil
hardware and this is hit the student's
thesis presentation with all of these
elements working together so what we
would like to do with Bruce is to to
create a speculative documentary that
would take some of his ideas turn them
into scenarios and basically create a
video documentary that would portray a
fictitious future perhaps with several
short chapters for different kinds of
ideas about spines that could be
downloaded it would all be net-based
could go on YouTube and basically it is
to take these ideas put them out there
on the net to inspire discussion across
different disciplines and of course it
it since the ideas are very systemic
they they cross over lots of different
disciplines like product design software
manufacturing sustainability social
issues and a good model for this would
be apples knowledge and navigator that
was done I think back in the late 80s or
90s but that's a good example of how
they took a lot of ideas and put it into
a state excuse me a scenario or a story
that
that made it that integrated a lot of
ideas into into something that was that
you could actually feel as a story
rather than sort of intellectualizing it
of course we'd make it much more cool
than the knowledge navigator and then of
course what's in it for Google I mean
the I think what Bruce is proposing is a
whole new paradigm about integrating I
gives about information into physical
products so of course there would be
lots more stuff to search and we could
think of it as rd think about new
markets new applications new knowledge
and ideas and also brand building where
Google can begin to explore new ideas
about their sustainable point of view
some potential resources for this is
right now I mean I really don't have a
format for it but we're thinking what
we'd like to talk to people at Google
about what kind of interest or what kind
of ambition they would have in trying to
to support it with money and knowledge
but the the I was thinking that we could
have a concept scenario development team
that would consist of Bruce and I and it
a group of designers and and Google
people and then to generate concepts and
and then after after that develop it
with a video development team that would
have a director editor director of
photography
and it would basically have a planning
stage that would be similar to any kind
of Hollywood production I suppose so
that's that's the the invitation and we
would like to continue talking to anyone
at Google that would be interested in in
working with us I think it's a very
exciting project so thanks for your time
this morning so we can people and ask
questions but it's going to be up on
google video so it's all public so
nothing proprietary okay like you're in
a deep need to ask proprietary questions
of science fiction novelist and /
nevertheless this to be is like a really
exciting notion you know it's just we
decide you know it's odd i mean because
you know you're in science fiction and
you do a lot of the stuff it quite
frequently you'd like write a book
instead of see it become a film or it
sort of moves into a graphic novel
something along that line you know we're
all on the same page now it's like roll
on the internet it's not about sort of
the ink-stained wretch sitting there
typing and sending it off with a
publisher we're just we're just did I
don't know it I mean it seems like a new
a new potential era for a weird kind of
cross-boundary creativity you could set
of see it happening every day now they
would break a lot of my logjams I'd say
it's just sexy no anyway so do we have
some questions huh does anybody here
actually read my book little shaping
things but yeah well one noble soul
there says a lot of nice things about
designers not enough about interface
issues you ever seen a book called
everywhere by Adam Greenfield heard of
that our book called ambient findability
by Peter morville these are the books
that people buy on
when they buy my books you know this
well you know I didn't know these guys
before I published my book but now
there's like a little ground swell of
kind of you become theorists guys we all
come to know each other because we found
each other on the web so now we all go
to the same events and look at each
other's flickr sets i mean one of us is
an information architect one of us is a
website designer one of us as you know
science fiction novelist it's getting
harder to tell the difference ladies and
gentlemen really seriously harder a
question out there yes how some of these
ideas about the the Internet of Things
tie into sustainability I guess the
connection there is not
right well I think there's three there's
sort of three methods of all right yes
though the question is what the heck
does the internet of things have to do
with sustainability now I think there
are three basic methods for that have
been proposed to do you know a
sustainable society where you know
objects don't pile up don't pollute the
environment okay well first of all
there's the sort of classic 19th century
arts and crafts vision where you sort of
make everything per minute me know
planned obsolescence no junk heaps
everything's very parsimonious kind of a
small is beautiful fully recyclable very
agrarian society where most objects are
either permanent or handmade okay that's
never worked that's never gonna work for
in a whole bunch of different reasons
many of which is then that that society
is not actually sustainable it it's too
poor and too weak and it knows too
little about itself to survive it's just
too ignorant to pull through an
earthquake an epidemic can wipe out a
society like that okay now the second
scheme is to make everything biomimetic
so that it actually rots when you're
done with it and you know as a design
theorists I'm really interested in this
I mean sure you know you just get rid of
all the chlorine and the kind of toxic
chemicals and you know you run every
make out everything out of hemp and
bamboo and coral and wood and maybe you
do a little genetic engineering and I
one kind of like cellulosic ethanol run
everything on bacteria and sugarcane all
right that's a sexy idea but I think
it's about a century away and I mean we
can do certain things that are
biomimetic you know I've got a pair of
like Nike biomimetic shoes I don't know
if you've ever seen these instead of
Nike considered shoes they're little
running boots but they're all organic
okay they rot I mean that's the problem
you put them on they start rotting
immediately it's like you know bread
without preservatives gets moldy faster
so you know I have these shoes I can't
really wear them because they're doing
what they're supposed to do with their
compost on my feet you know and they
smell kind of odd
you know so I you know I don't have a
problem with that scheme I just don't
think it's entirely practical there's
just too many things that we can't make
out of organic materials right so then
we have this other scheme which is sort
of unique to the 21st century in place
to a lot of our strengths at place the
stuff we're doing already which is just
to catalogue the whole shebang I mean
just search the living daylights out of
it you don't lose pollutants you just
watch them you know you put identity on
them you tag them you follow them you
actually you tag them before they exist
you don't manufacture anything that
doesn't have an expressed consumer
demand first so that gets rid of a whole
bunch of stored stuff right there then
you like give every object a unique
identity you know maybe an ipv6 or
something so that everything we make it
exists I mean we can comment on it we
can annotate it we can discuss it we
could say it's good or it's bad all
right then you track it so you know
where it is on the planet's surface you
search it so you sort of know what the
old model look like know what the new
model looked like you can design it a
lot faster that way you can obsolescence
more quickly you can get rid of stuff
you're just more knowledgeable about it
and then you fold it back into the
production stream when you're done with
it so it's just kind of a giant
ubiquitous computing Internet of Things
method that allows us to put all our
toys away so we don't leave broken glass
on the beach right I mean that's why
it's potentially a sustainable system
now it doesn't necessarily have to be a
sustainable system and you know a major
part in fact it could be a devilish
system that just sort of like multiplies
our problems you know I mean if you have
a view a ubiquity if you have a an
Internet of Things system which is not
sustainable you can create tremendous
environmental havoc and very short order
which is why it needs a sort of cultural
engineering all right and you know I my
suspicion is that if this happens at all
it's going to take about 30 years in
other words this isn't something that
you're going to do in a couple of
quarters i would say that somewhere
around you know of twenty thirty seven
maybe 20 30
to given that you know I was predicting
it three years ago you're going to wake
up in the morning and realize that
you're actually living in an Internet of
Things in other words you can query
every object you have you don't lose
your house cues your shoes anything else
I mean practically every item that
surrounds you has a Wikipedia entry it's
in Amazon org you go in and look at a
loaf of bread in the morning if you want
to query it it's like people who eat
this kind of raisin toast like to try
other kinds of raisin toast if you ever
like I soon you know try the raisin
toast with the orange juice in other
words you know the things that we have
now which are very clunky kind of barely
there actually spread into physicality
right so I've been like writing a
science fiction novel on this subject
for gosh must be five years now and I've
got chapters or people do trying
different things I know it's an okay
novel but it's not good enough it's not
really good enough to actually change
people's minds it's still too comic
booky you know it just is not really
getting a grip you know I need like
professional assistance here I need some
actual genius right and not like
novelistic genius because he'll every
novelist thinks he's a genius but we're
not genius designers and we're not
genius interaction people and we don't
really mean we can't be all things to
all people but we can link to all people
you know fast and like you know and you
know you could do it in like six weeks
and do just like prototype a bunch of
stuff and it's you know I mean that's
what I like about teaching design school
if you go teach creative writing you
tell people a lot about culture and they
sort of neatly write everything down if
you go to designing cool you could tell
people something they try and prototyper
they just go out and my temp to do
something it's a gorgeous thing to say
it's very addictive another question
they're right
trying to get people see
29 you explain designs maybe you could
post some kind of situation a short
story for example
and say what kind of design would have
worked better in this situation open it
up for comments and ready yeah well dad
actually I've got like a you know I've
got a mailing list and I like Veridian
designed or you can see me like
struggling with these issues since 1988
and I've got like a blog yeah I write I
write a lot of stories I get a story out
and the magazine of fantasy and science
fiction couple of months ago it's called
kiosk it's about a guy in Eastern Europe
who gets an outlaw fabricator and you
know when he turns it into Street
technology this is as close as I've come
you know I mean that story really is
pretty well doing the kind of thing I
would like you know my fiction to do but
i don't know i mean it's just it's a big
world building project and you know sure
i could start my own wiki and try and
you know get people to do it or i can
actually set up put some skin in the
game and maybe they'll work really hard
you never know and it's worth an effort
yes oh by the way if any of you would
like to send me some email and suggest
some brilliant you know design
interventions you have in mind I'd be
thrilled you know by all means Bruce s
at well calm I'm not hard to find Google
me you know yeah I'd be thrilled to hear
from you I need all the help I can get
they don't frequently this happens I
mean it's what I call predicting the
present you can be a science fiction
writer and you can talk about something
you imagine and some guy says you know I
think we already have that except that
we call it something else that's great I
mean it means somebody's done all my
work for me just terrific you had your
hand up there so yes
imagination on my part but I see this as
to your ideas to fairly different things
you have put RFID tags and everything so
you can locate it and find it which you
can pretty much do right now and it's
kind of cool except for some privacy
implications and then you have the tie
unitronic life management lifecycle
management and before creation and be
able to create things from prototypes
which that technology is way far out and
not as to me not as compelling um do you
you said you don't see these as two
things you see them as one inextricably
linked constant yeah I think they're all
linked to the theme of sustainability
because if you have all these things if
you have a piece missing you've got a
problem the fab thing I admit is kind of
the weak link it's just scifi writers
who can't love fabs you know I mean just
the idea of like you've got the model
there you press the f1 function key
thing pops out whole and steaming right
out of the chute you know it's just it's
a very sexy notion it has some really
nifty you know sci-fi ish kind of
attitudes everything box kind of thing
you know the scheme would work without
fabs if you just made them in normal
relatively normal sustainable factories
you know it would work just as well you
know they're reprap guys who believe in
fabs that fab fab zor like nano fabbing
guys want to like done it all with tiny
invisible machines i mean i'm extremely
familiar with these far-out notions the
other you know the other six legs there
of my of my of my set of scheme i think
are all necessary to actually reach a
sustainable situation and without it you
really have a sort of open-ended machine
that just spews garbage faster I could
be proved wrong no in fact that i would
i would say that historically speaking
it's very likely that such would be the
case i would also predict that if there
were an Internet of Things nobody would
call it internet of things but you like
calling something a horseless carriage
it would just be you know I don't know
what they call it reality to point out
it would be you know the way we live now
you know it's it's kind of a unique
problem but your ingenious people know a
bit of any company in the world would
pitch in on a mad scheme like this it
would be you lot well anyway any other
comments their questions shocked and
frightened interjections well thanks for
hearing us out we enjoyed being here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
