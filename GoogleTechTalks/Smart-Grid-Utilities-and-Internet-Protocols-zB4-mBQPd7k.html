Corporation I'm the chairman chief
technology officer at a tenor NEX were
electric power engineering research and
consulting firm happen to be working in
the in the smart grid arena a lot right
now
my background is electric power engineer
but I also have a heavy background in
enterprise architecture utility
communications and the like basically I
oftentimes get introduced as someone who
speaks geek in molded languages so will
will which happens to be an important
characteristic for for Smart Grid today
now what I'm going to talk about today
is provide a little bit of overview of
the use of Internet technology
specifically tcp/ip and other more
advanced protocols in utility automation
from for you from five years before
Google and earlier so I'll occasionally
refer to my B G and AG time frames for
before Google and and after Google so B
G and a G the first thing to note that
for utility automation what we're
dealing with here are a convergence of
at least two infrastructures I can argue
more but we at least have two
infrastructures we have to deal with we
have the existing electrical power
infrastructure the lines you see along
the road and in the fields between
cities that connects central generation
stations substations over long distances
to distribution stations the small
fenced in areas with smaller equipment
you see in the in cities and that then
emanate out along feeders anywhere from
a few miles to 4050 miles long you know
to where the loads are located so a
significant physical infrastructure
we've had in place for over a hundred
years in one form or another very
similar to what we still see today that
physical infrastructure however is has
been overlaid with some time by a
communications infrastructure it's a
matter of the level of sophistication of
that infrastructure that determines
whether we want to qualify as smart grid
or not but for a number of years and
history of electric power management we
have been using a communications command
and control to manage the very ass these
assets on the electric power
infrastructure I've I could send a
couple of days talking about the various
standards and protocols that are used in
in this infrastructure and the shortest
I usually can do it is in about a day
but I'm going to try and do it in an
hour here but this this diagram here you
know gives you an idea of the different
standards that are involved the
different domains of utility automation
we've got the back-office the enterprise
for which we need to have protocols
information exchange network
communications the control center sort
of a specialized element of the of the
back-office Enterprise getting out into
the field through wide area networks of
a variety of different technologies to
connect to those various substations and
other assets that are distributed all
over the country where the devices are
actually located then getting into the
local areas we like to call the field
area network providing us the
connectivity to commercial end-users to
consumers residential end-users to bulk
generation sources to all the various
substations that are out there to
distributed resources so all of these
different elements need to have some
level of connectivity for the most basic
operation as well as the most advanced
operation where I'm going to be able to
show you is that the large extent IP is
already pervasive in all of these so in
the in the news and the like sometimes
the utility community is portrayed as
being a bit backward and gosh why don't
they just use you know IP haven't they
thought of that well the answer is yes
it's been in place for for quite some
for quite some time it just hasn't been
exactly all that well known and in a
sexy as as some of the you know
interesting uses of IP that you guys are
responsible for putting together here so
give you a little bit of background of
what's been done and some of the reasons
why which will point to some things that
we can do and bring new innovation
moving forward you know why automation
first place certainly a hundred years
ago we didn't have communications like
this we relied on on automation but
mechanical entirely local no
communications but what so you know what
what really drove you know automation
well a couple of key events really drove
that starting in the 60s with the
Northeast blackout of 1965 that led to a
whole lot of different efforts to change
the way that the power system has
managed how we measure reliability the
standards we have in place the need to
automate to understand how various
protective devices interact it was the
defining event that resulted in the
creation of the Electric Power Research
Institute every and that was reinforced
in 2003 when we had another north
widespread Northeast blackout and it
uncovered a whole series of new areas
where we weren't communicating as well
as we should
human communication as well as a machine
to machine communication and I can trace
a path and have another talks that can
show that August 3rd you know 2003
blackout it was I think was actually I
was 14 but then we contributed to what
became the Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007 a prior to that the
2005 act that had states look at smart
metering so a lot of it oh I can say
started from this this event so
historically you know in the utility
automation we've been dealing with
mechanical devices that worked just fine
they're very intelligent devices in
their own small mechanical computers if
you will that perform very specific
functions very reliably with little or
no maintenance for many many decades and
some of these you can walk into some
substations you know in the country and
find some of these still in place today
and working just fine but you know
they're you know was a you know a
observation that we can use technology
to make these devices be more cost
effective and operate in more innovative
ways as we apply micro processors and
other technologies so you know in the in
the 70s we started
adding electronics to automate these
devices which then led to being able to
connect them so today and we use the
term protective relays probably the most
common intelligent devices in the grid
today are the devices that keep the the
grid safe keep things from blowing up
keep transformers from blowing up in
your neighborhood make sure that if
someone or something contacts a line it
very quickly is de-energized and like we
call those protective relays but there's
some of the most intelligent things in
the grid and if they miss operate has
this most significant opportunity to
disrupt the grid if if an adversary gets
in or something behaves incorrectly so
since the since the advent of cheaper
communications cheaper electronics there
has been an explosion of intelligent
electronic devices you no pun intended
on the if you notice the the acronym
that we use you know for these devices
is the IE D and in our world utility
world we invented ie D before the
terrorists did so I'll be using the term
ie D you know quite a bit here during
this discussion the general concept of
managing devices on the power grid that
is generically internationally called
telecontrol but in north america we
generally refer to it as a SCADA
supervisory control and data acquisition
and you know this evolved to take
advantage of these new electronic
devices find ways to remotely control
them monitor their status change their
configuration and this was done with
very specialized protocols for provide
performing utility operations the
characteristics of these protocols were
very dependent on that on this
long-lived history of how the mechanical
devices evolved electronics were brought
into play that mimicked the mechanical
behaviors added on to them and so a lot
of the way things evolved were because
of the of the long history and log lived
nature the devices in the field so I'm
going to cover a few of these talk a
little bit about the the multitude of
protocols that we started off with and
and where we've been moving towards here
recently so in the beginning we really
did have the tower
there's a hundred or so vendors of
different types of equipment every
vendor you know had a protocol it just
seems like a rite of passage that if
you're a new engineer and a new project
by gosh you've got to create a new
protocol yourself I would just I don't
know any engineer who hasn't done it at
least one time before they finally
realized after a while that that's
probably not the best thing to do so
that was done in in that K in those days
was trying to encourage brand loyalty or
we now call it vendor lock-in in order
to in order to you know get the business
with a particular new utility or
infrastructure provider huge investment
was was made in the SCADA master
stations that's where all the money was
so it was was to the vendors advantage
to lock the utility in to that
particular master by using their own
protocol to the end device so data
concentrators then were created within
the substations in order to talk to all
the other devices so we early on had a
multitude of in still today of data
converters in order to provide our
well-defined points of interoperability
this is just a partial list though the
full one takes many pages of the state
of protocols that were out there
and many of the protocols are named
after the utilities that invented them
okay so AEP protocol PGE protocol okay
but one of the earliest ones but a whole
host of different protocols some
specific to utilities that invented them
some to computing companies large
equipment manufacturers ABB protocol for
example and others so we've had a lot of
them and given the long-lived nature of
the utility infrastructure a lot of
these are still out there but they're
collapsing pretty rapidly you know to a
few that I'm going to focus on you know
here now but if we go back and we look
at you know around 1980 and we're trying
to do this you know automation and
replace the electromechanical relays and
other field equipment with electronics
you know we were dealing with talking
about 8-bit processors 9,600 bits per
second was considered you know really
fast you know well for the most part 300
baud it was plenty fast enough
for and actually for some things today
it still is memory was very expensive we
didn't really have anything in the way
of radio so we were using mainly leased
serial lines for everything the case to
automate the business case was unproven
some say it may still be unproven and
you know basically you had the
mechanical device everyone understood
and knew or this newfangled electronic
thing that maybe could communicate and
they wanted to pen spend the same money
you know with it
so as the two so the fact the cost
pressures made it very difficult for
those new electronic devices to be very
sophisticated so very processor
constrained had to be brewed stupid you
know you know cheap in order to produce
in in the same context our connectivity
was is essentially phone lines leased
lines dial-up lines very poor quality
because the radios were still too
expensive hadn't even thought about
lands yet powerline carrier was used
early on that was one communication
mechanism was used but the earliest
protocols that were developed were not
reliable they couldn't compensate for
the you know the noise on these things
so a lot of the protocols evolved and
with to some very arcane implementations
in order to get around these you know
these issues some major failures early
on really you know caused a lot of
paranoia and things then got over built
and over built and over built with extra
and more redundancy you know built in a
good thing in general but done not it
wasn't engineered it was just done so
you know starting in the in the mid 80s
to early 90s you know big customers
retired of the vendor lock-in looking
for reuse and standards ation we're
starting to get new protocols being
available you know things like this
newfangled you know thing tcp/ip and
another advanced protocols users groups
were beginning to form to band together
as utilities and infrastructure owners
to force the vendors to to try and get
some standardization in place we still
have some limitations a lot of
still not much bandwidth in order to we
have more ideas than we had enabling
technology to be able to allow us to
cost effectively implement so really
moving into the early 90s so 5bg you
know five years before Google 1993
you know skated discovered the local
area network and that's where we really
started to apply it now a lot of people
you know would thought between 2003 or
2005 mean you were starting with local
area networks in tcp/ip and 93 well yeah
we were and a number of things you know
we're driving that office computing was
it was you know starting to spread in
this gated world we had engineers who
were using office computing networks and
you know they wanted to go and try and
put that in the substation because they
can and and so we had more CPU memory
bandwidth is available a couple of other
drivers you know in 93 we had the
national information infrastructure
initiative that nough that Al Gore was
involved in and an outcome of that was a
Department of Energy grant specifically
designed to use internet protocols for
energy applications and a lot of folks
aren't aren't aware of that project but
it was sort of a groundbreaking effort
to specifically you know look at how to
do that and the screenshots I have here
are from the the first implementations
of that using a old netscape netscape
browser and an early internet explorer
browser in 95 to query data in this case
from nasdaq you know pulling back energy
usage information power quality event
information in the 90s in 1995 one of
the main things that had to happen we
tried doing this a little bit earlier
but getting reliable tcp/ip stacks to
work in embedded systems was very
difficult yet to find at the time and
and operate you know for more than more
than a day before rebooting memory leaks
all that happy stuff so that you know
that was a challenge early on we started
be able to discover that the big problem
we still had in those dives was
reliability and robustness in a non
office environment we had folks
developing you know
this equipment that you know had its own
reliability in the office environment
let alone putting something in a
substation for which when there's a
problem on the system thousands of
amperes of current flow causing
electromagnetic interference that would
just totally blow the brains of almost
any equipment that was you would be used
in office environment so that was a
challenge these SCADA protocols were
very simple memory-mapped register-based
the meaning was related to a physical
memory location a specific bit pattern
you know no concept of layered systems
loose coupling that you know this was
incredibly tightly coupled programmed to
the bare metal if you will in order to
scrape out every ounce of performance
and all sorts of innovative crazy things
were done in order to get the
information from from point A to point B
with very low overhead because again
things are still very very expensive so
once we got beyond that proprietary
stage started to get some coalescence
around you know the concept of
developing some protocols with some more
modern computer you know science and
communications Theory applied to it
early protocol that's still around today
called Modbus was very widely used in
industrial automation but some very
basic concept of being able to set two
variable and get a variable it was
patterned after physical manifestations
so when you look at the terminology
you'll see registers referred to as coil
registers or input registers so holding
registers it still had mapping to the
physicality of the devices that were
there so it's still very very tightly
you know coupled so we had some of these
early protocols but there was no
standard for time stamping the data one
thing that you do mechanically in an
electric power infrastructure is you
want to select something first you know
basically okay you know prepare the
device so that we're ready to operate it
once we make sure that yes in fact we
know this is the device we're going to
operate then you operate so-called
select before operate these early
protocols didn't have that and there
were some rather spectacular failures
when
an addressing scheme inadvertently
addressed the wrong device instead of
opening this breaker it closed the other
one and caused a massive failure so some
key features were missing in these early
early elements but but they did survive
and that protocol has evolved to operate
over tcp/ip but it doesn't have any
inherent built-in security and and you
know it is not very extensible the you
know the protocol that evolved after
that is one that's probably still the
most pervasively deployed in the in the
world today especially in north america
dnp3
it was developed by a company called
West tronic which later became a part of
GE and GE Harris it was based on some
early IEC International Electrotechnical
Commission at work in Europe to develop
a protocol but but they weren't
interoperable that evolved over time to
create a uses group it's now being
standardized in the I Triple E and and
is really sort of the workhorse today of
remote terminal unit intelligent
electronic device communications mainly
again in North America South America
Australia Africa popular in the water
world as well it's still it's robust
enough as design was good enough in that
we had communications engineers working
side by side with the Power Engineering
domain experts that we started to you
know get some things into it that
allowed it to be more extensible and
long-lived
supporting various mappings dongling
physical layers it lent itself to being
able to create a tcp/ip based
implementation and we were able to
secure ax T in it at a relatively low
level of the protocol so very reliable
still ty you know still more
register-based it doesn't have an
information model per se you still a
vendor a and vendor B vendor a may
represent voltage and register number 23
and represent the units in volts but
vendor B may put voltage in register 47
and it may be in kill volts so of
still quite a ways away from the kind of
interoperability and self-discovery you
know we see in other protocols and other
industries the the final evolution was
to the 61 850 protocol family which was
sponsored by the Electric Power Research
Institute starting in the late in late
80s leading up to a specification in
1992 that really merged fully the
information technology community
computer science folks and the power
engineers with their domain expertise to
come up with a relatively a pretty
elegant system that supports these
architectural concepts of layered
systems loose coupling and the like and
the concept of an information model the
problem was and it's in the mapping of
that abstract model it was very well
done the physical manifestation to the
to the Mac file error was pretty poor
you know cereal was the primary mapping
no tcp/ip support but it was focused on
on what was very popular at the time in
the federal government the the full ISO
network stack implementation competing
with tcp/ip at the time so not a lot of
pilot projects a lot of pilot itis but
no consensus and but there's nothing
like a real project to focus the mind
and actually get something done so
American Electric Power had a need to
replace some of their already aging
infrastructure being a you know utility
with that you know one of the older
utilities they needed to replace some
equipment so they had an initiative to
bring some focus to it which resulted in
taking the best of what was done before
and creating a a tcp/ip support to the
protocol via RFC 1006
was published as an I Triple E standard
first as a mechanism to transfer it to
the IEC and within the two thousand four
or five time frame the various parts the
sub parts were then finally standardized
is what we know is at 61 850 and that's
probably the leading standard for
new implementations today definitely in
rest of world were a little slower in
the US for a variety of reasons and most
of the rest of the world standards are
treated more like law once a standard is
available and applicable pretty much
right from the get-go and new
installations going to use it that's how
they're treated in the electric power
industry in the u.s. all of our
standards pretty much are are voluntary
and so even new installations today are
still using implementing some of the old
stuff because we just don't have a
mechanism to mandate or or I do other
than heavily suggest the new stuff a
part of that is another protocol called
the inner control center protocol this
is the protocol that's used to
communicate between control centers and
support wide area management that shared
the underlying protocol that's
underneath UCA and 61 850 which is the
manufacturers messaging specification
mms for you know the underlying bits on
the wire and capsule ization and that is
now a separate standard so all these
standards finally led us to a point
where we have some standards available
to us for field device communications
that have a concept of standard names
for standard things an information model
that's a vendor independent so when I
buy a device from vendor a and vendor B
both of them if they want to represent
voltage the same name string is used to
you know to reference them regardless of
how they're mapped internally to what
kind of process are they using or memory
our architecture what have you and that
was a big deal for the you know for the
utility industry
I just that just shows the mapping I'm
not going to go through that so what's
so great about this you know basically
what no other utility protocol had had
before 61 850 came along is and we now
have the ability for self description
because in addition to standard names
for standard things for the data itself
we also standardized the ability for the
metadata we can retrieve the information
about what units are represented we
won't have the Mars Lander you know
problem you know we can go and ask the
system and you know is this you know
what are the units that we're getting
this room is it volts is it kilovolts is
it four Long's per fortnight okay so we
were able to represent those and anyone
we want but we it's discoverable instead
of we're dealing with structured data
now we're dealing with the data that is
derived from common classes so that we
can reuse various classes of data a lot
of very fundamental concepts of
information architecture we take
advantage or take for granted in most
other industries but to the utility
industry bringing together the power
engineering world just trying to keep
the lights on with the communications
world was a big deal so a number of
capabilities were brought made available
to us the ability to replace traditional
point-to-point copper wiring to
interlock one protective relay from
another with being able to do that over
an Ethernet network being able to
transmit waveform samples in real time
so instead of having to put a current
sensor you know and and run copper wire
to every single device that needs that
current information we can put one
sensor in digitize it and make it
available to a whole rack of equipment
that can see the exact same data without
having to duplicate all those analog
sections and the cost associated with
that so a lot of really good things the
so in general you know the main things
that are different we have object models
we've got the nouns that the the
protocol operates on we've got
application services an app an abstract
communication service interface that
helps us with this layered concept a
technology layering and abstraction and
loose coupling and then underneath all
that we have the profiles you know that
can change over time today we may be
using MMS 2 as the underlying protocol
to instantiate the abstract service
interface but we also can use other
protocols underneath that new profiles
as they became available more readily
available have additional features that
we want to use we can map them without
affecting any of the stuff you know
higher level in the stack
when we talk about 61 850 particularly
it's a suite of protocols not just one
took a lot of years to develop all the
different parts but we've got the
sampled measured values and generic
object-oriented substation events that
basically operate directly as their own
ether type they bypass the rest of the
stack because we're dealing with
sub-millisecond performance requirements
the difference between a substation
responding to a a car hitting a pole and
causing a short-circuit and making sure
that that transformer is simply be
energized rather than blows up you know
you know maybe milliseconds and so some
things were done to support very fast
you know connections but for for the
bulk of the work using the MMS protocol
suite with tcp/ip profiles allow us to
provide communications and take
advantage of all the infrastructure that
we have in front of us today to to deal
with tcp/ip based based traffic so in a
typical substation we're dealing with
intelligent electronic devices that are
connected to generally two buses what we
call a station bus that's used for just
polling and reading the various data
from these devices controlling them
opening and closing breakers reading
settings back changing the settings of
protective relays and then a fast bus
the process bus that may be receiving
the high-speed sampling from those
voltage and current sensors in real time
- you know that drive the the way that
the sensors all all work the IEDs work
so the standards associated with that
standards associated with the fast side
of it the time syncing time syncing has
turned out to be a very important one of
the things we learned in the 2003
blackout is that without time stamping
we couldn't really figure out exactly
what happened so since that time huge
driver and value has been associated
with trying to get the time stamping
right so the protocols are all based on
existing standards at the high level the
application layers and object models
the standard names for the standard
things that's where the technology
independent interoperability comes from
that's what gives us the vendor
independence it isolates us from from
proud of a technology change at the
lower levels when I first was
implementing this we were implementing
this in on 10 megabit Ethernet
everything works just fine with Gigabit
Ethernet works fine over fiber wired you
know what have you and you know that so
that benefit of layering comes into play
all right I'm not going to go into the
incredible details here so what can you
do we the services provide the ability
to name objects to read and write them
to describe them to be able to report
when information changes to log data to
do file transfer you know so we have
this thing called a logical node which
is just basically an object and it
instantiates one or more common data
classes so some very classic computer
science you know things that are very
come natural to a information architect
but we're new for the utility industry
but we were able to do this in the early
90s which for the utility industry was
looking back on it was up was a pretty
big deal the abstract services isolates
the data from the specifics we can map
to let many protocols handle the future
you know the future proofing let's see
so the data objects represent all manner
of things I talked about voltage and
current readings and the like but all
manner of sensors control inputs it can
be represented pretty much you know
anything that we've historically done
with mechanical devices and standalone
electronic devices we've been able to
use this this protocol to up to address
everything it comes down to the name so
you can think of 61 850 to some extent
if you look at the naming configure you
know convention here it has a lot of
similarities to a to a SNMP mapping a
mid in it's a hierarchical
representation of of a device the
farther down you go the more specific
you get so you know you know
here we've got a top-level device that
may be an addressable device you know
this is a name for the third instance of
a device that does measurements then we
can get down to the phase phase voltage
one channel phase a it's the it's the
absolute value of the magnitude and the
floating-point representation of it so
very just like you drill down into a
into a tree and an SNMP you know type up
a tree similar kind of thing here so you
know I hadn't really thought about it
before you know but you know 650 could
be thought of as SNMP on steroids I
guess are you will from my naming point
of view all right
okay then the the other element here is
the immunity I mentioned earlier getting
all of this to work in a substation
environment is a real challenge
a lot of work has gone on to be able to
support that we now have standards in
the IEC that define exactly how this
equipment needs to behave and in in
these environments and high
electromagnetic interfering environments
things that those of us who've done you
know created Hardware before products
for the corporate environment never
really thought of before and it's a real
challenge to get this stuff to work in
the in these harsh environments and it's
a it's not and it's it's harsh in many
ways we've got wide ranges of
temperature but also as I mentioned we
have a a fault occurs in the system high
current flows these electromagnetic
environments are significant security of
course is a major issue in you know in
in supporting these systems so once we
have communications we have the ability
to control large amounts of energy there
are clearly security concerns security
you know from a safety perspective as
well as from a disruption to Commerce
point of view in the early days the
systems were standalone they were very
barely interconnected and that the
utility communications world grew up
thinking that security by obscurity was
the way you achieve security
and it is taken us a very very long time
to to address that and and and I would
say that the problem still isn't solved
of the institutional problem of security
we still run into engineers who say oh
well you know that's a you know no one
knows about that protocol you know and
and and it is anyone who knows anything
about security knows that that is a you
know not a way to secure a system so a
lot of work is currently going on to
address that there are several standards
that have been developed recently it's
particularly in this particular
standards arena to specifically secure
these core standards that are most
pervasively deployed Tazi to ICCP the
inter control center control center
protocol 61 850 the European versions of
dnp3 which is IEC
one-and-two-and-three-and-four
another related one 870 and then dnp3 so
we've managed to to create some
standards to address the security on
these on these relatively new protocols
some protocols are considered not worth
it Modbus so it's not being addressed
there are the utilities you know do take
seriously their overall security
architecture and almost every utility is
different because of how they evolved
how their infrastructure evolved whether
they have a fiber-optic rings in a you
know in a nested you know SONET ring
system or or they just got a few
microwave point-to-point links it's all
over the map as far as what their
physical communications infrastructure
is the regardless of how they've done
that they're applying of best practices
that are evolving for utility skata
system protection involving what you
would consider is standard practice in a
in an enterprise environment but with
some very you know special needs
recognising the importance of the energy
management system to stay to network for
which the wrong button pushed on one
console can you black out an entire city
or large
area particular attention is made to
ensure that it runs on a completely
separate physically isolated Network in
most utilities and this in this case
it's depicted by the blue lines and the
blue ring versus the corporate firewall
in this case the you know the red ring
and with a lot of monitoring in place
and mechanisms that allow specific
corporate clients to access aspects of
the energy management systems you can do
your work but through but through some
very controlled environments and there
are as many versions of this diagram as
there are you know utilities and some
utilities and multiple versions of that
we have a number of guidelines in the
industry that are driving that the one
that most you most of you hear about are
the at the Newark sips the North
American reliability corporation
responsible for the critical
infrastructure protection standards but
those standards focus more on
accountability and who to blame when
something goes wrong than to give a
whole lot of guidance you know on
exactly what to do
so other activities are going on to
develop things like what NIST is working
on here now on this releasing released
mister providing specific guidelines on
how to secure different elements of the
smart grid so these architectures will
evolve common elements things that work
will be identified in depth and and
deployed elsewhere but a common theme in
in in this these architectures for what
we've had out in the field for a very
long time now is our critical devices
that do the bulk of the switching of
energy and where a lot of energy is
concentrated in a small place and if
things go wrong can result in you know
loss of life loss of millions of dollars
equipment that may take a year to
replace is all at the substations the
issue is that you know these substations
oftentimes are shared facilities they
may be a transmission company like a
Tennessee Valley Authority may you know
have their equipment there but it's
shared with you know Bubba's co-op you
know that it has you know two employees
and 700 customers and the facility is
accessed you know by any number of
people so even in that environment we
have to treat these as if it is an
unsecured facility we cannot trust any
of the devices that are in that system
so we are trust no-one Yamato here so we
there's been a lot of discussion
recently in the for smart grid in home
area networks well how do you know if
the home area network device is somehow
connected to or interoperating with a
utility the utility network you know
isn't that a risk shouldn't we just not
do that air-gap it you know if you will
well I mean you know we were able to
accomplish that with point-of-sale
terminals ATMs both of which exist in
untrusted environments and then we can
get their hands on one and toll in a way
if they want to but we're able to apply
the standards and security technologies
in order to be able to deal with an
untrusted end nodes so what I really
bothers me when people talking about you
know trusting the end node and you know
and that that's the wrong statement
there is no such thing as a trusted you
know end node even in this case where
the consequences are much more critical
than home area network scenario
so it's matter having that mindset in
designing the security to address it all
right I'll get off my security soapbox a
key thing that happened in the early
2000s starting around 2000 and
culminating in 2002 to help get the
utility mindset to start thinking you
know even further about structured
information management was the uh pre
intelligrated architecture you know
historically in the electric power back
in utility back-office did a lot of
one-off integrations you would have one
engineer developed sorry and when one
team developed software for managing
energy markets another for let's say
meter reading another for SCADA
you know say someone found that there's
some value and gluing these things to
together so you would do a one-off
implementation get the guy next in the
cubicle next door whose kid knew Visual
Basic to write an application any
competent engineer you know or your
neighbor's kid can write a VB app to
you know glue the two systems together
but trying to do that in a way that's
extensible manageable maintainable and
secure is another story so there's a lot
of systems that have been developed
where you wrote some code extended it
they need to write a little bit more
code to extend it again glue it together
you're you know taking less and less use
of the interfaces that these devices
present themselves and sooner or later
you run into something that you can't
bolt on like security and what the
intelligent folks you know project did
was to really begin to make the case
evangelize it's sort of one of my jobs
to evangelize the utilities to use this
kind of approach to evangelize you know
getting them to you know architect the
system from the beginning create a
infrastructure that has security data
management built in and so we've created
a series of standards now to support
this concept of standard names for
standard things in the back office we
have a reference architecture that's
been identified to codify all of this
within one of the IEC committees it's
responsible for telecontrol so we have
identified various standards that are
you know deal with the the information
capsule ization at the at the high level
and through middleware web services a
common information model for the
enterprise then being into recognizing
the various application domains that we
have to support and the unique
requirements associated with them
recognizing that all of these
applications require on data acquisition
to sensors in the field and control and
actuators in the field for which we've
identified a variety of standards in a
reference model that meet the disparate
requirements of these different
applications the utility Enterprise is a
very large enterprise it encompasses
almost every kind of back-office
business model that you can think of you
know in one place and the requirements
for the field devices cover an
incredible wide range from you get me
the data once a month and you know if
I'm missing some data because it's
accumulated I can fill in the blanks
that's meter on one end or by gosh I
need four second data absolutely
reliable
cuz I got a fetus state estimator to
make wrong decision you know I'm going
to knock out the Northeast you know and
so we've got a wide range of
requirements and the very standards have
been identified in the reference model
address those various needs this is but
one reference architecture of several
others that are that are really
necessary to visualize the information
exchanges in the utility enterprise it's
one of the challenges we have in front
of us is to try and find a way to come
up with a comprehensive reference
architecture or an architecture of
architectures to represent all the
different information exchanges and
business operations that need to occur a
lot of ways to look at this so basically
what utilities are now moving towards
the rest of industries have been doing
this for a while but service-oriented
architecture is relatively new to two
utility enterprise but we now have
standards that are codifying the service
oriented architecture type adapters and
interfaces codifying some of the
Enterprise Service bus characteristics
that are necessary to support to support
this service orientation of the utility
enterprise translate that to a real
example Southern California Edison is
just about to publish this as their
overarching architecture showing some of
the elements that got their field area
network IP based connectivity using 61
850 650 and IP again here with their for
protection and control networks IP being
used in many other dnp3 over IP six to
eight fifty again having a common
services environment that has security
built in intrusion detection built in
and throughs and prevention built in
being able to recognize and utilize all
manner of networks use WiMAX where
necessary fiber where necessary being
independent of the underlying physical
layer manifestations and then
recognizing that we need an enterprise
architecture and the
trol Center that can deal with all the
different types of applications energy
management systems GMs outage management
distribution management I mean there are
hundreds and hundreds of different
application categories that were that
have to run in a utility environment so
that's so you know we're starting to get
the early adopter utilities to start
thinking in terms of architecture
creating a reference architecture that
they can build and design to to identify
their well-defined points of
interoperability for which specific
standards work today but they can change
them out and put new ones in later
because they've implemented the very
basic concepts of loose coupling and
layered systems so just to you know
allow me to revisit the picture and this
you know short amount of time I've
really only been able to talk about just
a tiniest subset of these talk a little
bit about dnp3 61 850 ICCP the common
information model again standard names
for standard things at the enterprise
level we're using things like soap and
web services and restful implementations
as well at the enterprise level the
common information model with xml
encapsulation of the data to run our
various business applications all of
these we've been doing this for you know
10 plus 10 plus years in one form or
another and there's been a continuous
evolution more exponential here recently
because we're starting to get you know a
lot more uptake on it so this work has
been is pretty mature we now are able to
be totally agnostic of what's in the
wide area network we've got all of these
technologies are being used because
we're mainly using IP we can use
whatever is cost-effective in our
particular area the you know the wild
west still exists right now in the
utility industry in the field area
network you know that the last mile if
you will or less several miles to the
end devices this is still the area where
it's driven by you know vendors in a
very vertical market where it's
primarily proprietary the well point the
fine points of interoperability you know
are here
and you know and here we don't have Mack
fire layer interoperability or even
another layer so above that in this
arena so that's something that people
are working on the value just hasn't
surfaced yet completely to up you know
to to force that to happen any quicker
you know we also have evolving standards
that are still being worked on in the
Society of Automotive Engineers for the
electric vehicle got the connector
nailed some issues with the height with
with the fast charging connector because
SAE neglected to pay a whole lot of
attention to little things like ul and
some other standards they should have
but that will be addressed but the big
problem here is these guys don't have a
whole lot of domain expertise in
understanding what's necessary for
demand response another managing that
load and doing smart charging so we got
a lot of work to do here yet we've got a
lot of proprietary things happening in
the asset management area there's only a
lot of asset management systems out
there but they all roll their own thing
you know right now so there's some work
to be done there in the consumer side
we've got you know dozens of protocols
we'd have an interesting email exchange
going on right now where I was able to
relate that I've got it probably you
know I've got all of these in a dozen
more running in my home automation
system all using gateways it's very
expensive to integrate that way but you
know we can find in a week we can make
it work but there's work going on to to
try and at least agree on the
information model again we can get to
agree on you know the standard names for
standard things aspect and map it to any
technology that will be a good thing and
on the distribute resource side again
we're not we don't have a lot of we have
some standards that are based on 650 to
represent the data but we're missing
some electrical standards to ensure that
the safety of the network is provided
for when we have pervasive deployment of
these things we need new protocols that
can interact between a photovoltaic a
panel that's generating energy back into
the system and the protective devices I
talked about that are on the
substations so they know when we're
generating and if something happens on
the line that you know we have a car
knocks down a pole and we've isolated
the system that we are able that the
line worker knows that that part of the
line is in fact you know dead so they
can work on it you know safely so a lot
of things have to be done from a
protocol point of view there and we
fully expect you know tcp/ip internet
related protocols will be involved in
coming up with that solution so a lot of
work yet
you know yet to do and this again this
is also just scratching the surface of
that probably the most visible you know
standards that are out there but again
you know IP is everywhere I mean you
know IP is involved with almost all of
these not all of them but almost all of
them okay so why did that you know so
some people ask me what well you know
why you know why do we have this
mismatch of things that is out there and
how did they evolve the way they did and
and why is the uptake on standard
protocols and the like you know you know
taking so long and the key is really
looking at the at the drivers for
utility automation you know the bulk of
the decisions are all been primarily the
first second third fourth maybe fifth
thing are all safety line worker safety
Public Safety and safety of the
equipment the equipment that we're
dealing with here is massive amounts of
energy are flowing through it and some
of the equipment literally takes a year
year and a half to build in my early
engineering career I worked for Cooper
power systems and Rytas and where we
built the 500 kV and 765 kV transformers
from beginning end to tan that takes a
year and a half to build one okay and
and you know so you go to
extraordinarily external links to
prevent from from having one of those
fail there's you know us only a few
spares in the entire country you don't
want you don't so there's a and it's a
lot of attention has to be paid to that
reliability just keeping the lights on
you know the US has probably that you
know the most reliable electric power in
the world as much as we talk about aging
infrastructure in the
antiquated nature of things it's still a
pretty reliable system you know because
of the distributed decision-making
that's done that the mechanical relays
as well as the new ones
but so the next objective is for is to
optimize for reliability so a lot of
redundancy a lot of cost being you know
the tight coupling was considered as a
way of managing some of that reliability
the security in in the utility world you
hear people talk about security security
has a different meaning to a utility
engineer it means really the ability to
meet demand and and be able to meet the
future demand is what security means to
a utility engineer for you know all of
us information geeks we think of cyber
security but we have to be able to
address you know both stability being
able to deal with the load generation
balance in real time these protocols are
designed to recognize that we know we
with we don't without a major
breakthrough on on on bulk storage in
general the bulk of the utility system
we deliver energy in real time you know
millisecond by millisecond trying to
maintain that balance a lot of decisions
are made a lot of requirements are
driven by that real time nature of
things only when you really get down to
you know getting near the end of the
list you know is it for convenience and
for you know for making it easy for
end-users to you know be aware of their
energy consumption and and to make it
easy for vendors to participate you know
in a market it that gets lower on the
list I put regulatory at the bottom just
because I hate regulation but a lot of
things are done because the utility has
to you know there's a fundamental
concept of the obligation to serve
Universal service so things that you
might say well why don't you know why
can't we just apply this technology and
then automate it and and just require
that we have a gateway in the home and
we've got PCTs and then we're done well
you know we can't do that and mandate it
across all socio-economic classes
and and and put requirements on the
end-user you know to do that so we've
one of the reasons utilities end up
getting inside the home area network is
because of that Universal service you
know requirement it's not as if they
want to be able to get into the home
area network and provide thermostats to
an end consumer but in many cases they
have a regulatory driver to be able to
do that so there's a lot of unique
drivers that exist for you know for AF
for utility you know one thing that I
wanted to get across is when we have a
failure in a router or in the Internet
you know we inconvenience someone I
can't run that Google search right now
I'll have to do it in a little bit when
the network comes back up may lose a
transaction or two some of it loses some
money but when we're dealing with the
when we're dealing with the electric
power infrastructure we have physical
manifestations of these errors and
issues that we've got to that we got to
be able to deal with so when things go
we lost lots of noise lots of heat
things that have real
well as cost associated with them not
really really that this particular this
particular oligarchy right is going to
burn those protective devices
with a neighboring device in this case
because of this configuration
the second content
upstream from that that communication
didn't occur the backup protection day
resulted in the
and finally clearly Apple there goes our
power in there go oh it was beautiful so
you know part of the yeah the other
aspect of things you know we prefer to
do things remotely when we add
communications so we can prevent things
like this from happening again you know
a failure of a mechanical device that's
being operated locally you can have
catastrophic effects on on human life as
well he was okay but here here the car
alarms going off in the background this
is a relatively small fault but a
significant electromagnetic pulse
disrupting equipment in here in this
case a car this kind of thing happening
in front of your house doesn't exactly
give you a warm fuzzy feeling and when a
failure occurs our protection doesn't
work communication goes down you know
things like that
you know happen on a factory where on a
smaller scale
they're on a large scale that line
probably was out for you know a couple
of weeks replacing all the insulators
here's a you know here's another example
where the protection inside the facility
failed
never
weird and
we have a rather spectacular failure of
a large transformer and that you know
that took you know that took many many
many many months to replace that so when
we have a failure in the communications
network in the utility infrastructure
there's there's real consequences and
that's why you know we you know every
industry says they're special and
they're different but there's not too
many that you know we have that kind of
kind of consequences and that's what we
we pay a lot of attention to very
carefully and deliberately adopting new
technologies moving forward that's it
any questions go for it yeah
when children
we're vidacup
there's a lot of folks in the utility
industry who point to you know tcp/ip
and say man we could do a lot you know
better but with all the failings and
known issues and vulnerabilities you
know we've we've managed to engineer
systems around them to be able to
address and deal with a lot of those
issues yeah absolutely would like to
solve some of those very fundamental
problems the you know the issue is well
you know who how much money is it worth
it and you know the utility industry
learned a long time ago we don't want to
you know do another one off we want to
use what's pervasively deployed so
pervasively deployed infrastructure that
has known flaws that we have workarounds
far for is better than a new approach
that fixes the known ones but while we
have a whole host of unknown you know
issues and flaws so that's sort of the
trade-off yeah believe me we talked
about that so yes so you're in the
California energy crisis
one of the big issues was this Kiko
lights on phrase because the government
would distinguish between somebody
really liked the air-condition at 68 and
somebody finding a heart now is there
anything in this
yes I mean with the newer technology
being deployed will give us that the
capability of doing that by you know
most of the utilities have a good enough
customer information system they know
where critical loads are but up until
recently when with those smart meters
with integrated disconnect the best we
could do is disconnect all the low to
the substation so we go into rotating
blackouts we've got to shut a whole
substation down meaning all feeders
meaning fire stations police stations
people on life support as well as all
the folks are just watching their plasma
TVs that was the best granularity we
have with smart meters with integrated
disconnect we can do that but of course
we have a large faction of folks who you
know you know think the fact that you
know the ability for a utility for some
reason they relate the utility to
government but being able to first of
all determine what your usage is and
whether it's critical or not and then be
able to turn it off as a Big Brother
issue so we have you know political and
social problems to solve to be able to
allow us to use the technology that's
presenting itself per house for probably
a per houses so you know basically on up
you know household by household basis
instead of going and shutting down the
entire sub the entire substation we
could go and send a signal to turn off
the disconnects on all the houses that
are not you know that don't have a
medical exemption you know a turn off
all the and we can keep all the grocery
stores the convenience stores in the
neighborhood on to keep the police
station fire station you know other
elements selectively you know all
energized and and accomplish our
objective for reducing load for peak
management so my thinking was looking at
my house there's very little power
gets sued it yet anyone times exactly
the dryer and so so I prefer a system
that just came in and its first step was
turn on everybody dryer in there so
that's the new you that's that's exactly
the next step see the first step you
know just takes the what has classically
mean within the scope of the utility the
service to the house you know well you
know and let them control that which has
high benefit the next step is allowing
the utility to be able to send either a
price signal or an emergency load
control signal saying you know for any
appliance that knows about it that is
able to hear me go ahead and defer the
defrost cycle you know go ahead and up
and and yeah and shut the dryer to
tumble so we don't mess up the clothes
but you know but you know don't use that
don't turn the heating element on we
have the ability to do that but again
there's there are social and political
you know questions as far as how much
into the home should the utility you
know go where does its responsibility
end you know should it just provide the
information but not be concerned about
how the information is consumed
internally well you know you could argue
if they don't have some visibility into
their you know their and not knowing
what's responding or not they can't
manage the system so a lot of social and
political issues to be addressed on that
one - yeah
and your diagram of home and the car
connecting up to the utilities privately
viable absolutely the field area network
is generic that field area network could
be one or more Private Networks by a
third-party aggregator a utility the
Internet
you know it doesn't doesn't really
matter and it you know and how that's
managed depends on if that kuttan
consumer is subscribed to a special
utility rate program in the end up and
in which the utility needs to be assured
that the signal has gotten there and
they're meeting the terms of the
contract you know for having a special
rate for responding to a a load control
signal in the ultimate if we had nothing
but pure real-time prices so we
delivered pure prices to devices you
don't have to create artificial programs
that require a a two-way acknowledgement
of whether you know did you do this or
not well if you didn't respond to the
price and stayed on any of you have more
power to you you paid through but if
it's a direct load control program you
want to make sure the utility wants to
make sure that they really did respond
and put foil around the radio and
prevented you know the device from being
turned off so again you got you know
some social issues that have to be
addressed here on on rate reform and the
like yeah for at least the same public
how far away do you think any realistic
solution to this problem is a whole
bunch of different solutions to this
problem that you're talking about this
one
which prices and then you know the
people can opt in and act voluntarily
with ones where the utilities could go
on control devices in your home and
smoothly power it could make everything
a lot more efficient and potentially
theirs economically said it if they set
up the right kind of system with the
energy markets and deregulate them maybe
people can opt in or taking the profits
from turning off my air conditioner but
all the day because it's too expensive
and so forth right and give that power
back to the grid and get paid for it
maybe even well technology's not the
problem we've got a lot of ways to do it
you know so there's and we've been
implementing demand response I implement
a first demand response system like 30
years ago you know so the concepts have
been around a long time what's making it
more feasible now as the technology is
cheaper ubiquity Communications multiple
ways to do it we're creating
architectures that realize that you know
just codify the information don't tell
me how but you know the the rate reform
is a key a key element you know to that
to make sure that we can you know have a
mechanism where the true cost of energy
is actually represented so there's an
incentive a business incentive to do
that and and that just takes time and we
have a we have a situation in the US
where every state has different you know
regulation it makes it difficult for a
national or international market to
develop you know to produce cheap
equipment so there's a lot of barriers
and most of them are not technical I
mean we got plenty of good technical
problems all too but they're less
daunting than some of the some of them
some of the rate and regulatory issues
be real need right like like the flights
aren't actually going out of my home I
can run my air conditioner if Phil today
so while we'd like to change the people
owed and it would be cheaper for the
utilities and they think more money it's
not clear what benefit there really is
to me and just close enough far away are
we from really caring about well the
business case is very difficult
California it's a lot easier you know
your rates are high for all sorts of
reasons your capacity is constrained
because in California in other parts of
the world too but in California in
particular you know there's you know
it's difficult to get approval to build
anything new Nym be is a you know and
banana you build absolutely nothing
anywhere anytime you know are huge
problems but people but the energy is a
demand is still increasing California
has the lowest energy band in the per
capita in the country but it's still
going up and if you're not allowed to
build anything you know cut makes rates
go up and we have to use this technology
to manage they know that that peak load
so there's a lot of drivers if we can't
make it here we're not going to be able
to make it work anywhere where I'm from
in Tennessee be a long time before I see
that you know I pay six cents a
kilowatt-hour we have no congestion
problems so I mean even if you know even
if we did have you know a five to one
price difference I'd save a buck or two
a day solution like why I build a smart
grid why not just go free nuclear power
plants in the middle of the state
somewhere and increases the generation
capacity hey you know but say it's it's
a like I said these are not technical
problems you know these are
socio-political economic you know you
know issues more than anything else
because it good question I mean we're a
bunch of geeks and we think it would be
neat Google even has a program where you
can install continuous metering on your
home and get all these real
updates yep you know somebody who's
accessing because you can so I actually
think the privacy concerns are
legitimate people who hack into these
networks and if you build that they will
hack in
so people will then know what you're
doing and if your home and it's a I
think it is a kind of Big Brother
problem and and so I feel like people
are kind of right so to resist the
technology until there's a real benefit
that that do you hit the nail on the
head with a lot of these you know a lot
of these questions that you know the
core offer for many elements and aspects
of smart grid on the on the on the end
consumer side is consumer empowerment
being providing information so that you
can make more informed buying decisions
it's really not much more complicated
than that we have the technology to do
it there's way easier ways
technologically for you know for
adversaries to find out your you know
your living patterns and the like and
there and there are ways like we've
managed to secure ATMs and point-of-sale
we can we can do a pretty good job at
securing it not going to prevent every
you know you know issue from occurring
but you know those are that's a matter
of managing your risk but you know is it
worth it to provide the information the
consumer to save you know some amount of
money and and what we found is that in
consumers don't want to be energy
managers after the first couple of days
that nifty display and watching your
energy use on your on your PC the
novelty wears off pretty quickly you
know but if you do have pure prices two
devices and the devices are smart enough
just to simply listen and when they can
make an intelligent decision and you
save a few bucks because you did have to
do anything special that has some value
I could install something in my home for
under bucks and how to deal with
our company where I paid $20 less a
month and in return it pays for itself
but also use the power company to build
some limited ability to manage the power
flow that my home draws at certain times
I mean I think people would've saw that
but I know it's doing it you're right
apologies existed forever and in the
regulated environment I mean it's not as
if you're saving the utility you know
any money you know sooner would any any
costs sooner or later
any savings sooner or later are
reflected in the rates so you know you
know you know just given your time
window for the rate cases you know the
consumer pays no matter what you know
what what we've been able to demonstrate
that you know that smart grid is able to
do it makes it suck less in other words
you know basically you have energy
energy supplies continue to you know
cost more more people are using so
demand is going up we can't build
anything you know that has you know
price pressure goes up all that smart
grid can do is make that suck less it
can make the price is not increased as
fast now a lot of folks you know you
know what you know don't that's you know
that's like you don't you don't want to
say that you know it's everyone expects
smart grid to make things you know you
know go dramatically down in price well
for some individuals who are making you
know stupid decisions because they
didn't have any information you know
probably can save a whole lot of money
but in a grand and the grand scheme of
things you know I fully expect energy
costs to continue increase just with
smart grid in this technology they'll go
up a lot less fast question on the other
side
the generations side and I'm concerned
about variable sources like solar and
when that are unpredictable and also
home generation we call it we call it
variable generation and renewable
variable you know generation you know
some of it is very you know very
predictable for example we know solar
panels are are not going to produce
energy at very well-defined points in
the day so you know there's some things
you can do actually in the in bulk wind
with the weather forecasting with a
tightly interconnected grid it's more
deterministic than you would think even
with bad forecasts you know for one wind
turbine I can't predict it but you know
if you know and I'm in the Midwest all
interconnected together I got a pretty
good idea of and can predict
hour-by-hour pretty well what it's going
to do the thing is turns out load is way
more variable and unpredictable than
some of the generation sources are and
and you know so we just published a
study called the eastern wind
interconnect transmission study whit's
that demonstrates what we need to do in
the eastern US to get 20-25 percent wind
integration and you know some new
transmission is needed in order to
couple things together tightly enough to
manage that variability storage
obviously can come into play but a lot
of folks talk about well let's locate
you know battery storage you know at
each of these variable generators well
you know that you know that doesn't work
all that well because the bulk of the
variability is in the load it turns out
that you know storage is always good but
it makes more sense to analyze as a
system and figure out where the optimum
place is to put you know the storage you
know where it it can most
cost-effectively be used so that's
that's something that we have to look at
is you know how do we architect the
system to support thermal storage
electrical storage at appropriate places
the grid they handle high in a higher
higher and higher penetrations of those
types of generation but it's not an easy
solution
dial on my dryer that says you know
start whenever the power company says
it's a good
and that's exactly we're talking about
we're talking about the smart smart
appliances smart devices that's some of
the work going on the standards you know
organizations here today is to figure
out what is the information that we need
to get to an appliance to make that kind
of a decision you know that a dryer
manufacturer or a washer manufacturer
does not want to have an external
devices turning something on and off
because you got a consumer you know you
know it's umer interface problem there
with you and destroying clothes so tell
me when the price is high or tell me
when there's a good event and let it
make the best decision on do it orderly
shutdown or just keep things tumbling
but turn the element off and you know
that's what we're working towards
develop the standards on how to
encapsulate the information so that
those appliances can be can be built
because you don't want to have to
program it you know we all know what
happened with the you know with the VCR
and your program will thermostat you
know the thermostats on hold all the
time okay and of you know I mean yeah I
mean you have a survey you know
demonstrated maybe only 20 percent or
last 15 percent were actually being
programmed and and you you you got to
get the person out of the loop
the state of the grid in the forensic
power and so on you think they would
deliver this over some kind of broadband
all the power lines themselves or do you
think they'd be scared it'll be
delivered on whatever makes sense in
that particular area is cost-effective
and can be you know relied upon to be
secure initially because of the
investment that's being made for smart
means we need smart meters to reduce you
know to in order to cap we need to
replace the meters to capture the
interval data so that we can have
innovative pricing and it turns out that
by putting the smart meters in place and
putting an Internet integrated
disconnect we get a whole bunch of value
by being able to do that selectively
rotating blackout to be able to save a
pile of money on on new homes and move
in move outs and the like and be coming
along with that is a communication
infrastructure that allows us to deliver
some data that way so early on demand
response signals will likely be
delivered over the utility network just
because it's available and an obvious
thing to do but you don't have to you
don't need advanced metering
infrastructure smart meters to deliver
prices to devices there are other means
through you know through other external
networks broadband to deliver that the
thing is you got to find a way to do it
in a way that you can trust the
information if I agree to turn off my
air conditioner and take a payment then
I need to turn right and that's the
difference between the program approach
which is that you know that's it you've
struck a deal I'll do this you know if
you do that and now you've got to be
audited that's we call it that's the
energy you know a demand response
program if instead you simply you know
there were prices for you know for you
know hourly prices if you choose to use
energy you know when the price was high
so be it we don't care there's no
contract you know you know we're
charging you for the cost of energy you
don't have a program so you don't have
to verify it you know we need to measure
your energy use but we don't have to be
aware of all the devices and how they're
behaving and and and auditing your
behavior your being that we the prices
get adjusted you know to influence the
behavior and over time you figure out
what those prices need to be and let the
market decide
a long way away from that though written
about or discuss protocols I don't know
kind of like cyber cash where you can
you can probabilistically enforce the
rules across an ensemble of people such
that any individuals privacy is
protected but any given time they might
have to offer ups improvement if they
fail than they pay out I'm sure I mean
I'm not aware of any specific ones that
are going on there's a lot you know but
I'm sure there are some folks looking at
that you know fundamentally from the
privacy you know point of view the
utility always has and still does you
know if they want to go look in the data
you know when you you know you know when
you're you're you know you're using
energy or not you know what with a smart
meter they simply you know know it to a
or can know it to a higher degree you
know and it's no different than your
credit card company being aware of every
transaction you know that you make if
they choose to go and look at it so
there's a stewardship of the data issue
that's required to support that privacy
collecting data and putting in a central
repository to be searched in mind by
computer that's right if actually
information you can discover there that
you couldn't before
absolutely I challenge the meter readers
to collect enough data to learn the same
kinds of facts there's huge value in
those datasets that you know that that
could be mine but this is where policy
is required this is where as as already
has exists in the banking industry
especially the credit card industry you
know to what level they're allowed to
mine that data for marketing purposes
and and provide that you know to to
other vendors that's something that
probably I'm not a big regular egg
ulation guy but that's probably
something to make sense to have some
rules on and and I fully expect to see
that in the in the utility world as we
have that more granular data
all right but a little bit over time
there but thank you all appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
