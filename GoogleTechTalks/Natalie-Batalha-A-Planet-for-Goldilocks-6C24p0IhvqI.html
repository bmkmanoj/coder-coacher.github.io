FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.
Thanks so much for coming to
our latest NASA Google Talk.
This one is especially
interesting.
They all are, but this one has
had a lot of buzz around it
in the last couple days.
I'd love to introduce
and we're really
happy to have Natalie Batalha.
She's an astrophysicist
at NASA Ames,
and she's been there
for about 15 years.

So she's been with Ames
for about 15 years,
and has been with Ames since
the inception of the Kepler
program.
And we're really, really
excited to have her.
So without further ado, Natalie.
[APPLAUSE]

NATALIE BATALHA: Good afternoon.
I think I'll use the hand mic
because I like to walk around.

The title of the talk--
A Planet for Goldilocks.
We're looking for planets
that could harbor life.
In fact, government agencies,
both here and abroad, are
committed to finding
evidence of life beyond Earth
and are investing
a lot of resources
towards that objective.
So I'm going to tell you
about one pathway, one
possible pathway towards
that objective, which
is finding evidence of life
on exoplanets-- planets
orbiting stars beyond Earth.
And this is largely
borne out of the progress
that the Kepler mission has
made over the last five years.
Kepler is a space telescope
that was launched in 2009.
It's still up there.
It's still taking data.
But its level one
science requirements
are almost completing.
So I'll tell you
about that and how
it's changing the
landscape of this search.

There are actually
three pathways
for finding evidence
of life beyond Earth.
Two of them are symbolized
here through these images.
So on the left we've got an
image of the geysers erupting
from the subsurface
of Enceladus,
one of the outer moons
in the solar system.
And so it represents our search
for life in the solar system.
Right now we have no
indication that there
is other life in
the solar system,
but it could be lurking
in this subsurface ocean
on the satellites of
Enceladus in Europa.
It could be lurking in
non-subsurface Mars someplace,
maybe in a subsurface cave
or some niche on Mars.
Maybe we will go to Mars
and we will find life.
Maybe we'll find death
in the form of fossils.
But that in and
of itself is going
to be very interesting,
because until now we've
only got this one
unique tree of life
in all its particularities.
And we want to know if
that kind of a tree of life
is ubiquitous in the
universe, or if it's diverse.
The other image represents a
radio telescope and the idea
that you can listen for
signals in the universe,
perhaps signals that are
not astrophysical in origin.
That is, they cannot be
explained by any astrophysical
body that we know
of in the universe,
and therefore perhaps are
an indication of some kind
of technology that
exists out in the galaxy.
And so this is the
famous SETI searches.
SETI stands for Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
We have the city Institute
here as our neighbor
in Mountain View.
But there are many different
city organizations,
said there's a SETI at
Berkeley, at Harvard.
They're scattered
all over the world.
And this got a recent
boon by an investment
from the private sector.
Yuri Milner up the hill
has invested, or committed
to investing, a
sizable amount of money
to rent the Green Bank telescope
to do this kind of search
for life.
But the third pathway for
finding evidence of life
emerged about 20 years ago.
I was a graduate
student at the time,
and I happened to be invited to
go to a conference in Florence,
Italy because my adviser
built this instrument that
was operating on the Keck
10-meter telescope in Hawaii.
And it was there at
this conference in 1995,
when a Swiss astronomer,
Michel Mayor,
announced the discovery of
the first planet orbiting
a normal star, kind
of like our sun.
And here's an artist's
rendering of it.
It's not an actual image.
Everything you see is going
to be an artist's rendering.
We do not have-- well,
except for one exception,
two exceptions, which
I will show you.
So this is an artist's rendering
of the planet 51 Pegasi b.
It is a Jupiter-size planet
orbiting tens of times closer
to its parent star than
Mercury is to our own sun.
It only takes about three days
for it to orbit its star once.
So it's a giant planet
orbiting very close.
In our own solar system we
have the rocky small things
on the inside, and we've
got the giant things
on the outside, beyond
what we call the ice line.
So we think of the giant
planets as occupying this space
in the cold regions
of a planetary system,
and the terrestrial planets
occupying the warm space.
And this very first example of
the planet we found completely
contradicted that paradigm.
Huge surprise.
Now, this is not the planet
we're looking for, right?
No solid surface, probably
doesn't have life.
It's being blowtorched
by its parent star.
So this is not a
planet for Goldilocks.
Well what is?
What is it that
we're looking for?
I'll talk about two things--
size and temperature.
Or you could even think
of that as size and orbit.
And these are typically
the kinds of things
that we can measure when
we find an exoplanet.
Size might be in the
form of, maybe, mass,
if it's a dynamical detection.
Maybe radius or brightness.
Those are all indications
of how big a planet is.
A temperature is
how close the planet
is orbiting to its parent star.
So knowing something
about the planet's orbit
tells you something
about the energetics
and how much
life-enabling energy
that planet is receiving.
So both of those are
important if we are
looking for life as we know it.
Life here on Earth
is very diverse.
But no matter how
diverse, how weird,
how lurking in some
extreme environment
it is, every single life form on
Earth has one thing in common,
and that's that it's
carbon-based and uses
liquid water as the solvent
that facilitates the chemical
reactions important for life.
and so this is why
there's so much
emphasis on going in
search of the water.
So we're looking for
things, for planets
that are at the
right temperature
so that liquid water
can pool on the surface,
assuming it has a surface.
And therein comes
the idea of size.
We want planets
that are not so big
that the gravitational force
is so high that it starts
to really efficiently glob
on a bunch of hydrogen
and helium in the form
of molecules and ices
that are so common
in the universe.
Hydrogen and helium being
the most common elements
in the universe.
So that's what exactly
happened to the giant planets.
You build up a core,
kind of a rocky core,
and the idea is that it
gets to a certain size
and then it becomes very
efficient at creating
on these hydrogen and helium
volatiles, we call them.
Building up an envelope and
creating a giant planet.
No solid surface.
By the time you get down to the
interesting stuff, the stuff
that our cells are made out
of, the pressures are too high
and it's going to be difficult
to form complex molecules.
That's the idea.
So on the other extreme, down
here in the bottom right corner
is a little depiction of
Mars, probably too small.
Well, why do I say that?
Well, if you have a very
low surface gravity,
then you can use your
atmosphere much more easily.
And in fact, that's probably
exactly what happened to Mars.
Mars has evidence of
water in its past.
This week we learned
that it still
has something that's
kind of like water.

But what happens is the
sun bombards these planets
with radiation, part of which is
ultraviolet and x-ray radiation
that breaks up water molecules
at the top of the atmosphere.
You break up those
water molecules
and you've got hydrogen
and oxygen gas,
and the hydrogen, being
the lightest element,
is very easy to escape.
It escapes easily.
And so you literally
boil away your hydrogen,
and you're left with the oxygen
that has no more hydrogen
to be combined with, and that's
how you lose water over time.
So if the surface gravity
of a planet is really low,
that process is
really efficient.
And so although Mars had water
probably three billion years
ago, in fact, oceans of
water, today as you observe,
it doesn't.
So we're looking for that
sweet spot, again, for life
as we know it.
And life that's
remotely detectable.
Not lurking in some
subsurface cave.
So here's where the Kepler
mission comes into play.
Kepler, as I said,
is a space telescope.
It's depicted here cartooned
in the bottom left-hand corner.
It has a mirror about
one meter in diameter,
and it's just doing something
really, really simple.
It's measuring brightnesses of
stars with exquisite precision.
And it has a wide
field camera that's
measuring about 190,000
stars simultaneously,
taking a brightness measurement
of every one of them
simultaneously, once
every 30 minutes.
And it did so for four
years without stopping
and without blinking.
And the idea is
when you build up
these brightness measurements
as a function of time,
and if you observe
enough stars, the idea
is that some of those
planetary systems
are going to have
orbits that are aligned
so that the planet
passes directly
between the disk of the
star and your telescope.
The planet casts a shadow
out into the galaxy
like all planets
orbiting a star.
And if the alignment
is just right,
that shadow will sweep across
the face of your telescope,
and your telescope will
perceive it and measure it
as a momentary dimming of light.
So that's what you see depicted
here with the green trace,
is this brightness dimming.
How much it dims tells you the
size of the occulting disk,
or the planet.
And then you keep measuring,
and you wait, wait, wait, wait
for it to come around
to happen again.
Now you've got the
time between dimmings--
that's the orbital period.
Johannes Kepler taught
us in the 1600s,
that the orbital period
is directly related
to the distance between
the star and the planet.
Now you know how close to the
campfire you are, that is,
you know if it's
amenable for liquid water
to pool on the surface, or if
it's in this Goldilocks zone.
Just to give you
some appreciation
for how technically
challenging this is,
a dimming of light due to an
Earth-sized planet orbiting
a sun-like star
is about one part
per 10,000 change in brightness.
So the analogy I
like to make is,
imagine the very tallest
skyscraper in New York City.
It's, what, like stories
high or something, maybe
it's taller by
now, I don't know.
We'll say 80 stories high.
And you're staring at this,
it's nighttime, and just
imagine that every
window is open,
and every room has a light on.
And one person in this
building goes to the window
and lowers the blinds
by about a centimeter.
That's the change in
brightness we have to measure.
So that means that we need
part-per-million precision,
exquisite stability
of our spacecraft
and of our instruments
in order to see this.
But that's the idea.

So I want to give you a
bird's-eye view of what Kepler
has found so far, and I'm doing
it with this animated plot that
shows the radius of the
planet on the y-axis versus
the orbital period
on the x-axis,
the two things the
Kepler can measure.
So you see points
being added to this
over time, some blue points and
a smattering of pink points.
These are all planets that have
been discovered over the years
from missions or surveys,
excepting Kepler.
So this is the sum total of
all of our knowledge of planets
up to the present day.
The blue points were
discovered with a method called
the Doppler wobble method.
I can talk about that
more if you're interested.

The pink points
that you see were
discovered with this methodology
like Kepler's that I told you
about.
We call that transmit
photometry because the planet is
transiting across
the face of the star.
And so even with
ground-based telescopes,
we did start to discover
planets with this method
around the year 2000, the end
of 1999, beginning of 2000
was the first.
So if you look at this diagram,
you start to see patterns.
You see a little cluster
of pink points on the left,
and you see another big
swarm of blue points up
in the upper right, a
smattering of other points.
There are some horizontal
lines for reference,
so you can see where planets
of different sizes would lie.
And this gives you an
impression that in the galaxy,
small planets like Earth
are actually really rare.
It also tells you that maybe
these very short orbital period
giant planets, like 51 Peg b,
might be really common, even
though we were very
surprised by their existence
when they were first discovered.
But now I'm going to
add to this diagram
the planets that
Kepler has found
in its four-year prime mission.
I'll do that with yellow points.
And this is what it looks like.

You see the really
remarkable difference
that you can achieve
when you put out
a new piece of technology.
We just looked at the
galaxy with new eyes.
And the veil that was
shrouding our eyes
to the existence of these
small planets was lifted.
So what we saw before
was an observational bias
that came about because we
didn't have the sensitivity
to see them.
Now with this
detection method we do.
Yeah, that's a really good
question, let me repeat it.
He said, &quot;Well, how
long do you have
to observe before you
start to see planets?
And is the fact that
you have nothing
at orbital periods of,
like, 10,000 days because
of that finite
observing window?&quot;
And the answer is absolutely.
Even now, even though our
blinders have been lifted,
there are still observational
biases in this diagram.
All of the absence of planets
in this bottom right hand corner
is due to that
observational bias.
Kepler observed a patch
of sky for four years.
So in order to find
an Earth analogue,
orbiting at 365.25 days, you
need to see it not just once,
but twice, actually three times
to get a unique determination
of its orbital period.
So that means you need
to observe for at least
three years in order to see it.
AUDIENCE: So your
points [INAUDIBLE]
markedly thinner about
the Neptune line,
is that an observational bias
that you guys understand?
NATALIE BATALHA: Yes,
hold that thought,
because I'm going to
show you something,
I'm going to try
and convince you
that that's not an
observational bias.

The other thing I guess I should
point out-- where does Earth
lie in this diagram?
Well, it would lie
right around here.
So that's the sweet spot.
That's where we're headed.
You can see that we do
have a smattering of points
down there.
Those are the hardest
planets to find.
In fact, if I drew a
diagonal that kind of hugged
this envelope right here--
these are the hardest
to find right below
that diagonal.
And so we're just now
reaching the nexus
where Earth would lie.
You can see that NASA does
not over-engineer anything.

We will have another catalog
coming out next year,
and we might find a
smattering of new points
in that part of the
parameter space,
but I think this is
more or less what we're
going to have to work with.
I should also mention that the
yellow points that you see here
represent over 4,000 planets.
85% of them are
smaller than Neptune.
In the previous sample from
the ground-based observations,
85% were larger than Neptune.
So very different.
But Kepler was funded for
one very specific thing--
to answer a very
specific question,
and that is what is the
fraction of stars in our galaxy
that host potentially
habitable Earth-size planets?
The other way to
say that is, what
is the occurrence rate of small
planets in the Goldilocks zone?
So that's what we
have to quantify.
We will be a failure if we
don't calculate those numbers.
So in that sense, Kepler
is a statistical mission.
It's not about finding
the one Goldilocks planet.
It's about understanding
the demographics of planets
in our galaxy, of all types.

So this is a histogram
of the same distribution.
Before I give you the
answer to that question
that Kepler is
working to solve, I
want to talk a little bit
about the amazing diversity
of planets that
we've discovered.

Here is a histogram of
planet size from that sample.
And what you see
in this diagram is
that the most common planet
right now known to humanity
is a kind of planet
we don't even
have in our own solar system.

It's literally the
grey area in-between.
You've got the rocky, or what we
think is rocky stuff down here
in brown, you've got the
giants over here in blue,
and this grey area in-between
is where we have most
of the discoveries.
And we don't have
any examples of them.
What are they?
We don't know.
And so we look at
these, we have started
to look at these in some detail.
We have follow-up
observations of many of them.
Here's one example of a
planet called Kepler-10c.
Kepler-10c is larger than
Earth by a factor of 2.35.
We've actually also
measured its mass
with ground-based
telescopes, and we
find it 17 times more massive
[INAUDIBLE] than Earth,
as you would expect.
It's bigger, it's heavier.
And then we get a
density of seven grams
per cubic centimeter.
But we look at another
one, Kepler-138d.
It's also bigger, by
almost a factor of two.
But it has exactly the
same mass as Earth.
So what this is telling
us is that there
is a huge diversity
of compositions
amongst these planets.
And by composition, I mean the
recipe for making a planet.
How much of the rocky stuff
versus how much of the hydrogen
helium stuff you mix
in is very diverse.
It ranges, it's
got a huge range.
And so that's really
interesting to me.
I want to know is this like
something I could stand on?
Is this like a big super-Earth
with more real estate
and lots of water?
Maybe a water world?
What are the possibilities?
Maybe the water covers
the entire planet,
but it's not so deep
so you can still
have interfaces between water
and those other elements that
make life.
I don't know.
So this is just
kind of pointing out
that there's a lot of
possibility to consider.
Kepler has also found a class
of planets that's orbiting also
ten times closer to
its star than Mercury
is to our own solar system,
but planets that we know
are rocky, because
we've measured
their size, their radius,
but also their mass.
Mass divided by
volume is density.
This planet, Kepler-10b,
we know is a rocky world,
but it's being blowtorched
by its central star.
The star-facing side
has an ocean larger
than the Pacific Ocean,
but it's an ocean of lava.
Because the temperatures
on that star-facing side
are in excess of that
required to melt iron.
Not just rock, iron.
We call these &quot;lava worlds.&quot;
How do we know that
it's a lava world?
Like I said, we measure
the dimming of light,
as depicted here on the left.
That's real Kepler data.
Every white point is a
brightness measurement.
That tells us the radius.
We go to our ground-based
telescopes, the Keck
10-meter telescope
in particular,
and we measured the
the Doppler wobble.
That's what's being
depicted on the right.
That gives us the mass.
Mass divided by
volume is density.
This cannot be anything else,
but a rocky planet with pretty
much the same recipe as earth.
AUDIENCE: How do you
know it's tidally locked?
NATALIE BATALHA: Sorry?
AUDIENCE: How do you
know it's tidally locked?
NATALIE BATALHA: The
question is, how do I
know it's tidally locked?
Because in between transits, in
between the dimmings of light,
we see the light output
from the whole system
change by about two
parts per million
and then come back down.
What we're seeing is the day
side, night side, day side
of the planet in its orbit.
So I know that there
is a huge temperature
differential,
thousands of degrees,
between the day and night side.
And it's consistent.
It doesn't change.
Yes.
That's a great question.
More extreme.
There are planets-- Kepler-10b
was orbiting its star once
every 20 hours.
This one, KIC blah, blah,
blah, blah is orbiting its star
once every eight hours.
It's so hot that it's actually
disintegrating before our eyes.
The planet is blowing apart.
How do we know that?
Well, because when we
measure the brightness,
very precisely, as this
planet transits the disk,
it doesn't have that nice
predictable shape because
of that comet like tail.
So what you actually see
is something like this.
It takes longer
for the brightness
to come back up on
the right hand side
because the planet has
this cometary tail.
I think this is a astoundingly
interesting because what this
tells me is I can actually
go to a telescope,
like Hubble or The James
Webb Space Telescope.
I can collect light
that's filtering
through that cometary
tail and it's
going to leave fingerprints
of what that cometary tail is
made out of.
That gives me a direct probe
into what these planets
are actually made out of it.
Kepler proved that
George Lucas was right,
although we got the stars wrong.
They're the wrong sizes.
But planets do orbit
gravitationally bound stars.
So this artist's rendering
on the top is the planet,
Kepler-16b.
16 It's orbiting a
G-type and a K-type star.
G-type stars are
these yellow stars.
K-type stars are
cooler, and smaller,
and we depict them as
being more orange in color.
The G-type star would
be bigger, so we've
got kind of an
incorrect size ratio
here for these Tatooine stars.
But what this tells you
is that the planet is
orbiting not just one of them,
it's orbiting both of them.
So you've got not just one
star rising in the east
and setting in the west,
but you've got two.
Moreover, those stars
are orbiting one another,
gradually changing
position in the sky,
and they're eclipsing
one another.
So what we actually observe
is very complex and full
of information.
On the upper swath are the
brightness measurements
that Kepler takes.
And there are some
arrows to help your eye.
So for example, we've got blue.
If you focus on the
blue arrows, that's
a really huge
dimming of light that
happens when one star passes
in front of the other star.
And then when that
star comes back around
and passes behind the brighter
star, you get the yellow.
So you've got blue,
yellow, blue, yellow,
you've got some blues
that are missing
because the spacecraft
went to sleep or something,
blue, yellow, blue,
yellow, blue, yellow, red.
See?
There's a red in there.
Or a green.
The red and the green
those are the planet
that's passing in front
of the bright star
or are, alternatively, in
front of the green star.
And it's complicated because
these two stars are moving.
So if you've got one star coming
around this way and the planets
coming around this way, too,
they're moving in tandem,
the dimming of light
is going to stretch out
longer than the planet
happens to be moving around
while the other star
is moving behind
in the opposite direction.
Now they're going in
opposite directions
and that dimming of light
is going to be short.
So that's a very rich
amount of information
from which we can ascertain
the masses of the planets
and also the masses
of the stars involved.

These are Kepler Orreries.

Many of the stars
that Kepler observes
have not just one sequence
of dimmings, of transits,
but multiple
sequences of transits.
So these are multiple
planetary systems.
And what we have
learned is that there
is a class or an
architecture of planets
that's a little bit different
than the solar system
that we live in.
You know that planets in our own
solar system orbit in a disk.

So you can think of that
disk as kind of a pancake.
These planets that are
plotted here for you
are dynamically compact systems.
These are planets
that are orbiting
pretty close to one
another, so that's
what we call them compact.
And in these scenarios,
the disk is so flat,
if our solar system
were a pancake,
this would be like a crepe.
They're exquisitely flat.
So it's intrinsically a
different architecture
than we see in our
own solar system.
And that's a clue
telling us something
about how these systems form,
and how they evolve, how
they interact with one another.

And let's see.
Finally, the Goldilocks planets.
I wanted to say something
about which planets--
how many of those
planets we find
are indeed in this
Goldilocks zone.
So here's another scatter plot.
On the y-axis, we have
the surface temperature
of the central star.
Remember, stars come in
different masses, and sizes,
and luminosities.
So on the top, we have
stars like our sun.
These are K-type stars.
And on the bottom, we have
the tiny, M-type stars.
And so the green band
is the Goldilocks zone,
where the energy you receive
on the surface of the planet
is amenable for liquid water.
So you can say that we
have a few dozen that
have been discovered
so far that are smaller
than twice the size of Earth.
So that's the sample that
we're really focusing on.
That's the sample that's
going to allow us to calculate
the fraction of
stars in our galaxy
that host small, potentially
habitable planets.

Let's see.
I can show you a
couple of examples.
This is one system, one of those
Goldilocks planets, Kepler-186.
So you've got a cartoon
of the solar system
on the bottom that shows the
green band where the Goldilocks
zone is.
Kepler-186 is orbiting one of
these really low mass stars,
what we call an M dwarf.
So if you want to be in the
Goldilocks zone for an M dwarf,
you've got to cozy
up next to that star.
So you see that the
green band is really
in a much tighter radius.
So the planet Kepler-186f,
which is the Goldilocks planet,
is orbiting with a much
shorter orbital period.
And there are people
who argue that that
is going to be
difficult for life
because when you
get planets that
are orbiting so
close to their star,
they can become tidally locked.
They're more susceptible to the
ultraviolet and x-ray emission
that's coming off
of stars, especially
like M stars that emit lots
of that kind of radiation.
But then in July, we had
another exciting announcement.
It's now touted as the
exoplanet most like Earth.
Kepler-452b.
So here's a split screen.
On the left, represents
our sun and earth.
And on the right,
represents Kepler-452b.
On the left side of the
star-- or if you compare
these two in the
middle there, you
can see that the
stars themselves
are very similar size.
In fact, they're the exact same
mass, but Kepler-452 is older.
It's probably more like
6 billion years old
compared to our sun, which is
about 4.5 billion years old.
So it's a little older, but
otherwise, very similar.
They orbit with
very similar period.
Earth at 365 and
Kepler-452b at 385.
So they've got very
similar energetics.
The strongest difference
is that Kepler-452b
is 1.6 times the
size of the earth.
Is that important for life?
I don't know.
1.6 is kind of the
dividing line where
you start to get big enough
that you start to glob
on this hydrogen and helium.
But the jury is still out.
It Seems like that's kind
of a transition region.
So this could be an the
earth with more real estate.
I don't know.
Maybe an earth with
even more water.
Maybe it's even more amenable
to life than our own planet.
I don't know.

So now I want to say a
little bit about statistics.
What is this answer
that we're looking
for with regards to the fraction
of stars that host potentially
habitable planets?
This yellow cone shows
you Kepler's search space.
We're searching out about 3,000
light years along the Orion
Spur, so kind of along a spiral
arm, centered on the sun there.
And so I'm going to do a
little thought experiment.
Well, let me first show
you this histogram again.
You saw this
histogram once before.
This is just the number of
planets and each of these bars
represents a different size.
Now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to try and correct
for all of my
observational biases
in order to transform this
into the true fraction of stars
that are in galaxies for
these same size bins.

And this will speak to the
question that we got earlier.
Who was it that
asked about-- yes.
Are these giant planets
really, truly rare?
So I do that correction and I'll
just toggle between the two.

See?
That's the bias correction.
So the small planets that
are really hard to find,
I have less sensitivity.
So the correction
is larger for them.
The large planets though,
they hardly change at all.
That's because I have
100% completeness.
My survey's complete for them.
The statistics don't change.
So this scale tells
you that the frequency
of giant planets, like Jupiter,
in these warm interiors
of planetary
systems are an order
of magnitude smaller than
for the earth size planets.
So this tells us that small
planets, at least orbiting
within an earth like orbit, are
much more common than Neptunes
and giant planets.
So what does that translate to?
Well, I'm going to ask the
question, given the statistics,
where is the nearest,
potentially habitable, earth
sized planet?
How far out do I
have to go find one?
So here's the Milky Way
galaxy, a cartoon of it,
depicted from the top down.
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going
to scale the continental
United States to that size.
And here we are, on the
shore of the Pacific,
and you're turning east.
And let's look across the
continental United States
and ask ourselves, where is the
nearest, potentially habitable
exoplanet likely to be?
And the answer is right about
there at the tennis courts.
It's very close.

The answer is three parsecs
or about 10 light years
with 95% confidence.

So this makes the galaxies
seem like a smaller place,
don't you think?
This makes the idea of actually
going and visiting these places
a little more tangible.
It makes the search for life
seem all the more feasible.
And in fact, we
know how to do this.
We know what to do.
We know what
technology milestones
have to be met in order to do
this within the next 30 years
even to look at these
planets and look
for indications of life.

Just to drive this point home--
I don't know if you can see it,
but in this little yellow
bullseye, in the very center,
there's a red dot.
Do you see it?
That red dot is about 10
parsecs or about 33 light years
in radius.
This is a 3D
animation of the stars
within that radius, 10 parsecs.
There are about 350 stars in
like 250 stellar systems--
250 plus.
240 of them are like
these cool, M-type stars.
About 20 are stars
like our own sun.
Those are colored yellow.
The M dwarfs are colored red.

Like I said, that's 10
parsecs or 33 light years.
That's a factor of three
larger than the distance I just
gave you of 10 light years.
So volume scales as are acute.
That's a factor of 27 in volume.
So if there's one planet at
least within 10 light years,
there's 27 times that in
this tiny little volume
that was just that
little red dot.
So these are the stars
that we want to target.
This is what we want to explore.
I would argue we want to go out
about another factor of three
in diameter because I
want more yellow points,
I want more stars like
our own sun to probe.
And there is where we're going
to focus our search for life.
And let me just highlight--
we're kind of done working up
to the present and now, for
the remainder of the talk,
I want to tell you a little bit
about my dream for the future.
But let's just reflect here.
All this has come about--
and this search for life
has become kind of
within our grasp just
over the last 20 years.
Between 51 Peg b
and Kepler-452b,
we have grown
orders of magnitude
in orbital period, mass,
radius, radiation, energy.
All of these parameters.
We've gotten very close to
finding true Goldilocks plants.
So now the task
at hand is to move
from finding planets
in the habitable zone
to finding truly
habitable environments.
And that will occupy us
over this next 20 years.
So let me say a little bit
about that future search.
This is now NASA's portfolio,
just one government agency's
portfolio.
Kepler, you can see, is
here, kind of in the middle.
We've got two missions that
I'll talk about together, TESS
and JWST, very briefly.
In the upper right
is a mission called
WFIRST, which I think I'll
skip over a little bit.
It's another
demographics mission.
It's going to speak to the
demographics of planets
not within an earth orbit,
but beyond an earth orbit.
So after that mission, we
will have a complete census
of planets in the galaxy.
Not a census, but demographics.
A representative sample.
And then I will end by talking
about what's listed here
as a notional mission.
And we're calling it The
New Worlds Telescope.
This is what is being
studied and will
be studied over
the next five years
as we develop mission concepts.
But first, TESS and JWST.
Just to remind you, this
is Kepler's search space,
that yellow cone of light
that goes off into the spiral
arm of the galaxy.
It's looking out 3,000 light
years, but at one patch of sky
without blinking.
0.25% of the whole
angular area the sky.
Just one swath.
TESS is a mission
very much like Kepler.
It's going to do to
transit photometry,
but it's going to survey
the entire sky out
to like 200 light years.
So it's going to
look everywhere,
it's going to have to do that
with a step and stare approach,
it can't stay fixed
at one spot at a time,
it's going to have
to move around.
That means that it
will only catch planets
with orbital period of
like 80 days and less.
So short period things.
But they'll be nearby.
And the reason
this is interesting
is because these
nearby stars will
be amenable to
characterization studies
afterwards with The James
Webb Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space
Telescope is the successor
to The Hubble Space Telescope.
It launches in 2018.
And The James Webb
Space Telescope
will be capable of
determining what's
in the atmosphere of
some of these plants.
So here's the idea.
This is the planet Venus
transiting in front of our sun.

If you look carefully, you can
see a very thin, yellow line
that hugs the planet.
Can you see that?
Especially where you have
contrast in the upper left hand
corner against the
black background.
That's the atmosphere.
Very tiny, thin atmosphere.
The scale height is
like five kilometers.
The total area that that
atmosphere intercepts
is like one 200th the area of
the disc of the planet itself.
It's very, very thin.
But what James Webb will try to
do with the transiting planets
that TESS finds is it
will observe the planet
when it's in front of the star.
It will see the
star light filtering
through that very thin
haze of an atmosphere.
That atmosphere will leave
a fingerprint upon the light
that The James Webb
Telescope will catch.
It will spread that
light out into a spectrum
and look for the
chemical fingerprints
of what the atmosphere
is actually made out of.
And here's a
cartoon illustrating
an example of that.
The James Webb
Space Telescope will
do this in spades for the
sub Neptune super earths.
Those planets in the grey area
that we don't know anything
about.
It's going to knock
that out of the park.
We're going to know all
about those planets.
We're going to know what their
atmospheres are made out of.
It's going to be great.
I don't suspect
that James Webb is
going to be able to do this
without a huge investment
in resources for the Goldilocks
planets that are really tiny.
For that, we need a
different methodology.
The plants are just too small.
The atmospheres are too thin.
We just don't have
enough photons to be
able to see the signatures.
So for that, we're going to
need something different.
And imagine-- I
mean, just think.
Here, you're getting
fingerprint from the photons
that happened to pass through
this tiny, little, narrow
strip.
What if I could get all the
photons that are bouncing off
the whole surface?
Like reflecting off of
the whole entire surface.
That's a much bigger area.
That just, in theory,
has to be easier.
And indeed, it is-- if you
can take an image of a planet.
But you have to be able to
take a picture of a planet.
This is tremendously difficult.
So now let me talk about
The New Worlds Telescope
because that is the objective
of The New Worlds Telescope.
Here's the technical issue.
Trying to find a
planet orbiting a star,
like taking a picture of it,
is like trying to see and gnat
next to a searchlight.
The glare of the searchlight,
or the star, in this case,
is 10 billion times the
light that's coming off
the surface of the planet.
So these planets are
literally lost in the glare.
In order to accomplish
this, we have to block out
the glare of the star.
It's analogous to going
outside on a starry night.
You walk out, you want
to look up at the sky.
Like maybe when you saw the
eclipse the other night.
And you look up in the
sky and you see nothing
because you've got all
these bright streetlights
in front of you.
All you have to do
is put your hand
in front of the streetlight.
Your pupils dilate out
and you can see the stars.
So you just block
out the light source
and then you can see
what's behind it.
That's what we're trying to do.
There are two ways of
doing this and we're
doing technology development
on both right now.
And we've made a
lot of progress.
So I'm going to show
you two videos that
illustrate the technology.
The first one has
audio, so I assume
that the audio is working.
So I'm going to go
ahead and start that,
if I can find the cursor.
Here it is.

[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]
-A distant star is
orbited by two planets.
One looks similar to the earth,
the other is a gas giant.
When viewed from a
distance, the two planets
disappear into the
glare of their sun.
How could we ever find
these planets all the way
from the earth?
By using a space telescope
with a Coronagraph
that separates starlight
from planet light.
As a star's light passes through
the telescopes large mirrors,
it picks up small distortions.
Diffraction ads concentric
rings to the image we see.
To reveal the planets,
first, the Coronagraph
uses a mask to block
much of the stars light
and redirect the remaining
light to the outer edges.
A washer shaped device
can now block most
of the rest of the stars light.
Because the planet's light
comes in at an angle,
it misses the mask and
passes through the center
of the washer.
But when we turn
up the image signal
by collecting more
light, we can see
that the plants are
still hidden under blobs
of leftover starlight.
To remove these
blobs, the Coronagraph
has a special,
deformable mirror that
can change shape by using
hundreds of tiny pistons.
This can incorrect
distortions in the light beam.
As the mirror deforms,
the blobs of light,
as seen in the monitor,
slowly begin disappearing,
finally revealing the
brighter of the two planets.
Afterwards, the fainter
planet also comes into view.
We can now see objects more
than a billion times fainter
than the star.
And if the light
from these plants
is passed through a prism,
we can spread it out
into rainbows of color.
But some colors are missing.
They were absorbed by gases
in each planet's atmosphere,
giving us important clues
about their composition.
The search for life
in the universe
has taken a new step forward.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]
NATALIE BATALHA: I never
get tired of seeing that.
It gives me goosebumps.
So that's Coronagraphy.
A Coronagraph, where you put
something in the light path
to block out-- just like your
thumb-- block out the light.
The problem is that stars
create this diffraction when
they come into your
telescope and you saw that.
Now there are technology
hurdles to accomplishing this.
One, for example,
during that process
where you've got the
pistons, and you're
adjusting the shape
of the mirror,
and making all of these
subtle corrections--
during that process, you
need pointing stability down
to like a picometer.
I mean, really, really
exceptional pointing stability.
So that's one technology hurdle.
Another technology hurdle
is that, well, OK, fine.
But you still need to
collect enough photons.
These things are
really, really dim.
I need a huge
photon bucket, which
means a big, gigantic mirror.
The only way we're going to
get a big, gigantic, 10 meter
dish mirror out into space is by
making it segmented and folding
it up into your rocket ferry.
The problem is that
when you do that,
when you make a
segmented mirror,
all of that diffraction that
you saw, that makes the rings,
is different.
So we have to learn how to do
this with segmented mirrors.
We have to learn how to
achieve that picometer
stability in the pointing, in
the thermal sensitivity, all
of it.
It's really going
to be challenging.
Now you can simplify that,
if you figure out a way
to hold a giant thumb out into
space instead of putting it
in your optical path.
if I can put a giant
thumb out in space,
it's going to make
it much more simple.
I'm taking it out
of the optical path
and I don't have to worry
about that wave front control.
And we're trying that.
This is called
Starshade Technology.
And this is the next video.
Here, there's no audio.
What you're seeing is
a probe class Starshade
that is unfurling and
creating a shape that
looks like a sunflower.
It has that special sunflower
shape because of the way
that we want it to
control diffraction.
But the idea is
that you're going
to fly this thing independently,
some tens of thousands
of kilometers away, so
that it gets really tiny
and perfectly blocks
out the starlight.
And you're going to have
another space telescope that
is doing to telemetry
or metrology
to communicate
with the Starshade,
and get it perfectly
pointed, and aligned,
and hold it there, steady,
like a giant thumb up in space,
so that you can see the
planets it lost in the glare.
Two different technologies.
They each have their
advantages and disadvantages.
The disadvantage of
this one-- although it
made the optics
much more simple,
the problem is that it's tens
of thousands of kilometers away,
and now you want to point
over there, and look
for a planet over
there, and you've got
sit there, and wait while the
Starshade makes the journey
from one place to another.
So you lose a lot of time.
But if the telescope can stay
observing something else,
making other astrophysics
contributions
while you're waiting
for that slew time,
maybe that's
something worth doing.
So those are two technologies.
I wanted to show you that,
indeed, we've already done this
from the ground, albeit,
not for small, earth size
planets in the Goldilocks zone.
There was an announcement,
just about a month ago,
about the first planet
discovered by an instrument
called The Gemini
Planet Imager, GPI.
The Gemini Planet Imager.
Here is the image
from that telescope.
You see the concentric rings?
That's the eri pattern due
to the diffraction, just
the remnant eri pattern.
But here's the planet, 51 Eri b.
This was another system.
I can't remember which
instrument discovered it.
I think KIC.
And here you see one,
two, three planets.
But what you also see, because
we've been observing this
for so long, is you see
the planets actually moving
in their orbits.
Now you've got some
dynamical information
to tell you something about
the masses of these plants.
So this is really promising.
This looks great.
But just one caveat.
What you're seeing
there are planet's
larger than Jupiter,
younger than Jupiter,
so they're hotter than
Jupiter, and they're
orbiting tens of times
further out than Jupiter.
So here is what our
own solar system
would look like with such
an instrument-- actually
a better instrument.
And Jupiter and Saturn-- OK.
We can do that.
What we want to achieve
though is find the earths
that are in this annulus.
So that's why it requires
a space based telescope
to get above the atmosphere.
It also requires a
very large light bucket
because these things
are going to be faint.
And so this is what
we're talking about.
We've got The Hubble, down here,
dwarfed in the lower left hand
corner.
The Hubble 2.4 meter Telescope
next to Goldilocks there.
James Webb, its successor,
at 6.5 meters in diameter.
But what we're proposing,
our moonshot right now,
is a 10 to 12 meter
class telescope
that will have the capability
of seeing this tiny annulus
and collecting enough
photons so that we
can search for biomarkers.
AUDIENCE: How cheaply
can you actually build
a telescope like that?
NATALIE BATALHA: What's that?
AUDIENCE: How cheaply
can you actually build
a telescope like that?
NATALIE BATALHA: How
cheaply can you build it?
The good news is that the
cost per unit collecting area
of telescopes is going down.
So they do get cheaper
as you learn more
and as you built them,
but they're still
extraordinarily expensive.
So if I were to project out a
couple of decades as to when
we would start to
build this thing,
I could posit a guess that
it would cost about the same
as The James Webb
Telescope does now,
something on the order
of $5 to $10 billion.
Yes.
I'm sorry, did I
shock you there?
Come on, this is Google.

Let's see.
Why such a large telescope?
I can answer those questions,
if you're interested.
Just to say that what
we really want to do,
as you saw in the video,
is take a spectrum
and look for the presence of all
of those gases that are emitted
by complex life
forms on planet earth
as they metabolize
food into energy.
Things like methane, oxygen,
respiration processes,
all of those things
that are indication
of not just a planet, but
of an actual, living world.
Again, this is possible.
It's not limited
by what we know.
It's not limited by technology.
It's just simply
limited by resources.
So with enough time we
will accomplish this.
Maybe not in my
lifetime, but certainly
in my children or grand
children's lifetime,
I think that this
is going to happen.
Where one day,
soon, we will know,
for certain, that life does or
does not exist beyond earth.
So that's where we're headed.
And I'll end with the
beautiful retro travel posters
that JPL created for these
worlds of our imagination
that actually do exist, just not
with quite so much color yet.
Thank you very much.
I will be happy
to take questions.
[APPLAUSE]

AUDIENCE: I recently
read that you
should be able to detect the
glare of a water covered planet
going in front of the star
that they orbit around.
Would Kepler be able to see this
or any of the satellites that
are proposed?
NATALIE BATALHA: So
to detect the glare.
So when you say
glare, to me, you're
implying reflected light.
So light that's
coming from the star
is bouncing off of a shiny
surface and we see that.
So the question is, is
that possible with Kepler?
We do see some phase functions
as planets are orbiting around.
The kind of specular reflection
that you're talking about
would happened at
precise moments.
We see these kinds
of phase functions
for mostly giant planets
that are heated on one side
compared to the other.

So I don't know.
I'm not aware of any
such a detection.
We will do this in the future.
I think that our best bet
is to do the transmission
spectroscopy between
TESS and JWST,
see the light come
through the atmosphere--
so you're not talking
about a glare,
you're talking
about transmission.
And we would hopefully see
evidence of water and vapor.
Whether or not we'll have
the kind of situation--
I'm not even sure water
worlds exist in entirety,
but certainly, oceans.
The kind of specular
reflection that
happens quickly when you're
just the right angle, I think
is going to be very
difficult to find.
Yes.
Just thinking out loud here.
AUDIENCE: Direct imaging.
Is it easier to just
do the reflective light
from the star or
the transmission
from the planet based
on its temperature?
NATALIE BATALHA: So the
direct imaging emissions
are reflected light off of the
surface, but they can also be--
and this is where
I thought you were
going with that question-- they
can also be thermal emission.
That is, the warmth
of the planet
itself-- like in the
case of the multi planet
system from direct
imaging that you saw.
That was enabled by the
fact that the planets are
young and hot, so they're
emitting thermal radiation
and you're seeing
that emission as well.
AUDIENCE: And the contrast
between the star and the planet
would vary based on
which wave length
you're looking at, increasing
the temperature, too.
NATALIE BATALHA: Absolutely.
That's right.
That's correct.
AUDIENCE: But if
it would be easier
to look for really
hot planets close in
because they're
emitting a radiation
length that the star
doesn't emit at as much
as it normally does.
NATALIE BATALHA: Yes.
But see, when they're close in,
you have a resolution problem.
One of the other reasons why
you need a big telescope,
even to see the
Goldilocks zone, is
because you're trying
to be able to resolve
a planet next to a star.
And so resolution is
proportional to the diameter
of the telescope.
So the closer in
you want to see,
the higher resolution
you're going to need,
and we're already really hard
pressed to do that for an earth
out at 365 days.
So if you want to do something
for planets that are even
closer, you have two choices.
Either you do transmission
spectroscopy in the way
that you've mentioned, but
that, of course, only works
if you have the right geometry.
Or the other alternative, and I
think this is going to happen,
on the ground, we are already
building 30 meter telescopes.
So telescopes that are three
times bigger in diameter,
27 times more collecting area,
and you get the same benefit
with resolution.
So now you have the
possibility of seeing
the habitable zone of the M
type stars, which are closer in.
You can't do that with a
10 meter class telescope,
even in space, because you
just don't have the resolution.
But with a 30 meter
telescope from the ground,
if we can work out the rest
of the technology challenges,
we might be able to do it.
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the orientation.
Do you find that it's
typically consistent,
that we tend to be with
the disk of the galaxy,
or are they pretty
randomly oriented?
NATALIE BATALHA: Yes.
That's a really good question.
The question is, do we have
any preferential geometry
in the galaxy with
these orbital planes?
And the answer's no.
That they're all cattywampus.
Randomly distributed.
AUDIENCE: Would there be any
advantage or disadvantage
to a telescope
based on the moon,
so you have something
solid to put
it on and still no atmosphere?
NATALIE BATALHA: Is
there an advantage
to building a
telescope on the moon.
AUDIENCE: I'm thinking
instead of having
to put a satellite
out far away, you
might be able to put a
relatively small thing
on a mountain a few
kilometers away.
NATALIE BATALHA:
Which is kind of what
we're doing on the earth
to test the technology.
We're going out into the
desert and setting up
systems like that.
I don't know.
That's a really good question.
There are other challenges
you have to think
about when you go to the moon.
First of all, getting
supplies there,
of course, because you're going
to have to make multiple trips.
But also, the
dynamics on the moon.
You've got a lot of dust.
And so I know that one of the
biggest technological hurdles
to building
telescopes on the moon
is just the amount of dust.
We've got the regolith, which
has this very fine dust.
In fact, if you do
hiking in California,
because of the
draught, the ground--
I hiked up to [? Ridgelane ?]
the other day for the eclipse
and it was like I was
walking on the moon.
It was like poof, poof.
So if you have even
lower surface gravity,
that dust is going
to loft, it's going
to get into your electronics,
it's going to be a mess.
So nobody seems to be
thinking seriously about that,
but that doesn't
mean that it's--
AUDIENCE: What's the
status of Kepler today?
I know that its reaction
wheel is failing,
but there was some
back up plan in mind.
NATALIE BATALHA: Yes.
Thanks for asking that.
Maybe I'll go ahead and
back up a little bit.
So the question is, what is
the status of Kepler today?

So a few years ago-- sorry.
This is not very
efficient, is it?

Well, several years
ago, Kepler lost
one of its reaction wheels.
And so the reaction wheels are
these like gyroscope things.
There are three of
them, one for each axis,
and they keep the telescope
pointing very stably.
So there was some redundancy
built into the spacecraft.
There were four.
You only need three
because there's
three axes you can rotate about.
And so we had four.
We had some redundancy.
We lost one.
No problem, we've got three.
But then, a couple years ago,
in fact, it was on my birthday.
I was sitting at my birthday
lunch and I got the phone call.
We lost a second reaction wheel.
So now we were down to two.
That meant Kepler was
spinning about one axis.
We had no control.
So for me, I was like,
well, OK, we already
completed our baseline mission.
We'd already collected
four years of data
and that was our baseline
mission, so I'm good.
But it was a disappointment.
But the engineers at Ball
Aerospace were very clever.
And what they did
was they recognized
that there is an axis
of symmetry built
into the spacecraft itself.

Let me back up for a second.
What is it, out in space,
that make the telescope spin?
The answer is, radiation
pressure from the sun.
So you're literally
being pushed on by light.
It's very small,
but it accumulates.
So they recognized
that they could
utilize this axis of
symmetry if they lined it
up with the vector pointing
towards the radiation
pressure towards the sun.
And they did that perfectly.
It would be like pointing
a boat directly upstream.
If you balanced it, you would
neither yaw to the right
nor to the left, you
would stay the course.
And that's what they did.
So that axis of symmetry happens
to be in an orientation that
puts the telescope observing
along the ecliptic plane
of the solar system.
So it limited the
amount of places
where we could
point and observe.
It also meant that we could
not point the telescope
to the baseline patch of
sky that we were observing.
But it actually opened
up the possibility
of this whole, entire
new thing called
K2, which is Kepler's
second mission,
but actually named
after the mountain K2.
And so K2 is looking
at these patches
of sky along the ecliptic.
And you see, they're traced
as this sine wave with regards
to the plane of
the galaxy, which
you see there as a flat
image across the screen.
So it's going to observe
each of these patches of sky.
It's been doing that
already for over a year now
with great success.
So it's kind of like a step and
stare approach, more like TESS.
And we're finding lots of
planets in these patches,
including some planets that
are-- that pink part just
shows you where
in the sky we get
to look relative to the
Kepler field of view
during the baseline mission.
When you add up all the fields
that we will observe over
a few years, maybe four years,
that adds up to about 4%
of the sky instead 0.25%.
So it's great.
And we're finding planets that
are actually really close by,
like this three
planet system that's
just 100 light years away.
So it's doing good
stuff and I think
it's actually going to find
some really good candidates
for The James Webb
Space Telescope
to observe when it
launches in 2018.
AUDIENCE: How long is the
mission expected to continue?
NATALIE BATALHA: How long
is it expected to last?
So there is a hard constraint
and that's the fuel.
There's a fuel on
board the spacecraft
that does some thruster
firings to change position.
And that does have
a finite lifetime,
but I think it'll
easily last four
years in this configuration.
AUDIENCE: So this is
obviously a lot data
you guys have collected.
How much--
NATALIE BATALHA: How much
data is left to be analyzed?
So we're still actually
even working on the data
from the baseline mission, that
first four years between 2009
and 2013, because we're
improving the pipeline that
does the analysis.
So we'll get some more
discoveries from that data,
but we're wrapping that up.
That's due to finish
by September of 2017,
so we've got a little less
than two years to finish up
the analysis of that data.
That said, the data
sits in public archives
and scientists will be
analyzing the data for decades
to come because it's
such a rich data set.
Kepler's level one
science requirement
is just to compute
the fraction of stars
with planets of
certain properties,
but there's a lot
of other things you
can do with this data to
characterize planets, and learn
about different architectures,
and oddball cases,
and all kinds of things.
AUDIENCE: What is the
process for scientists
to get access to that data?
NATALIE BATALHA: I'm sorry?
AUDIENCE: What is the process
by which scientists get access
to that data?
NATALIE BATALHA: You could do
it right now with your phone.
It's there.
The NASA exoplanet
archive is one repository.
And then multi mission archive
at The Space Telescope Science
Institute is another archive.
So yes.
It's all publicly available.
Anybody can plan with it.
Well, thank you very
much for your time.
