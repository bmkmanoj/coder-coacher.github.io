he's going to be talking about power
from thorium reactors I should give you
a little introduction about to Robert
Hargreaves he he started he worked at
Dartmouth and eventually started a
company called DTS s which was intended
to promulgate some of the software that
he and others had written while at
Dartmouth on the one of their first time
sharing systems there the time sharing
system that he worked there was actually
the one that Bill Gates ended up
learning basic on which is sort of a
somebody relevant to to to Bob's later
career so bob has a PhD in high-energy
physics about eighteen months ago he
started teaching about nuclear energy
policy at Dartmouth and during the
teaching of that course he found out
about liquid fluoride thorium reactors
and they have a number of nice
properties and since then he's been
singing their praises and that's what
he'll be doing today hopefully so I
think I'm gonna turn it over to Bob
thank you you all know we have an energy
crisis and a climate crisis we have 300
parts per million co2 growing going up
we have the cost of oil going up again
and so on we import 350 billion dollars
worth of oil from the unstable Middle
East so we have a lot of problems and
sometimes it's easy to step back and see
if there's a wider solution to that to
all these problems so today we're going
to talk about some of the people who
noticed the limits of growth in the past
the concept of what I call aim high try
and solve a really big problem an answer
that I believe might work thorium power
a project and a question period first we
talked a little bit about global warming
and you're also familiar with it I'm not
going to
dwell on it accepts to say the polar
bear is the poster child but we have
more to worry about than drowning polar
bears we have the problem about the cold
polar seas retreating through smaller
and smaller territory those cease being
so important for the development of
algae that are the source of life in the
sea we have the problem potentially of
the glaciers melting in the hill out
emolia's which are necessary to even out
the water flow to the people whose lives
depend upon the food that grows there
hundreds of millions of people
we have dezerter fication we have
problems with even today in the Amazon
rainforest the rate of forests being cut
is as much as three times as it was a
few years ago partly driven by the need
to farm more biofuels we have the
problem about fish in the ocean 40% of
the large animals are stressed and
probably beyond the point of recovery
i we have only a few more years of tuna
the Japanese have created a strategic
reserve of tuna fish by allegedly
harvesting illegally off the coast of
Australia and last but not least we have
air pollution we have particulates 2.5
microns unless invented by coal power
plants that are responsible for the
deaths of 24,000 people a year in the
u.s. hundreds of thousands in China and
according the UN perhaps 2 million
people worldwide so we have plenty of
problems to deal with
Dennis Meadows came to Dartmouth years
ago when we were there and I actually
helped attract him to Dartmouth because
I managed to get Phil Coke to write the
Dynamo compiler in time-sharing to get
him to come and move his research to
Dartmouth this is a graph that came out
from an old pin printer multicolored
ribbon teletype cost five thousand
dollars at the time and it's here partly
for historical interest his projection
over the couple of centuries on the
graph is resources being
diminished food supply going up and then
crashing industrial output the same
pollution rising indefinitely and
finally population in his projections
rising and falling the limits to growth
was sponsored by the club of Rome it was
disparaged at the time as being
unrealistic because in past history
people would say every time there's a
lack of something technology steps in to
fill the void but today we begin to
think that well you know growing
population in a finite earth is perhaps
a problem here's the population
projections for the world 6.7 billion
people now and we're blindly told that
the population of the earth will rise to
9 billion by 2050 I personally think
that's not likely to happen and for bad
reasons but if you look at the OECD
nations populations and the US
populations you see the rate of growth
is not nearly the same so I got
interested in how prosperity works with
population I went to the CIA databases
that are online and they track children
per women for various countries and GDP
per capita as an indicator of wealth
I then sifted out only the nations that
had population is over ten million
people and just looked at the result the
stable rate population were stable
replacement rate for a population it's
about two point two or three children
per woman and you notice quite quickly
that all the countries that have the
largest population growth the largest
fertility rate are those that are the
poorest so I kind of looked at that
graph and I said let's invent a concept
called modest prosperity
and I just sort of arbitrarily drew the
line at about $7,500 per year GDP per
capita and if you look there the
nation's that have that level of
prosperity generally have much lower
birth rates they have stable birth rates
there are only four outliers in in that
in that graph the most outlandish one
being Saudi Arabia that has both wealth
and children now prosperity also depends
on energy but it depends on other things
too it depends upon the rule of law
depends upon food shelter medicine a
financial stable financial system and a
government that does not oppress the
people badly so but energy is a good
indicator and electrical energy is a
good indicator of the prosperity of a
civilization because the electrical
energy is necessary for for water for
purification for septic processing for
manufacturing machinery for
transportation heating refrigeration
electricity electric power is important
to prosperity here's a graph again from
the CIA data that I could find kilowatt
hours per capita per year on the
horizontal axis and GDP per capita going
up and I just sort of sketched in a line
here trying to emphasize the fact that
these seem to be pretty strongly related
the u.s. number by the way is somewhere
out around 12,000 kilowatt hours per
capita per year and somewhere around
45,000 GDP per capita but if we look at
that prosperity number on this graph
again at $7,500 a year that seems to
indicate that somewhere around 2,000
kilowatt hours per capita per year is a
kind of a break point if we could get to
that level of energy use perhaps these
nations could become prosperous enough
to keep their populations under control
now but let's look again at the
developing nations and look at what's
happening they want to increase the
energy use because they want a lifestyle
similar to the lifestyle in the US and
other OECD countries and they're going
to do with coal coal use is growing in
all of these countries stable in the US
increasing in China and India in the
rest of the world so unless we do
something different the developing
nations will burn more coal a common
thought is that conservation should
solve this problem here in the US and
you know people like Amory Lovins think
of negawatts the concept that if we can
save money we wouldn't have to build new
plants and so on
in fact the do-e is projecting energy
growth I'm hoping we can hold it flat I
know the the google.org projections show
an expectation of controlling energy
growth and in fact in the last quarter
of last year energy use residential
electrical energy use actually did
diminish a hair but let's just take an
example the u.s. uses 3.8 petawatt hours
of power per year in the US and let's
suppose that we were optimistic and said
we wanted to cut our energy use in half
down to 1.9 but let's also presume that
the rest of the world would like to
achieve the same kind of lifestyle as
the US and they would probably target
that level of energy use
if that happens here's what happens
energy use is going to grow tremendously
even under the scenario of increasing
electric power efficiency by a factor of
two we can't just do it with taxes
either
here's Jeffrey Sachs the adviser to the
governments of Peru and Russia and
Poland and so on who's a well respected
economist the director of the Earth
Institute at Columbia University he
tries to point out that we need new
technologies taxes alone or tax policy
isn't good enough not only that we have
to solve this problem technically in the
US and oacd nations and then use that
technology in a developing world if we
have any hope of stopping their
emissions so that's the problem we face
I say let's try and aim high let's
develop a new energy source that solves
many of these problems in particular
let's try one that produces electricity
cheaper than from coal right now there's
a tremendous negotiations going on in
the Congress the United States about
cap-and-trade
a lot of people are talking about maybe
a straightforward carbon tax would be
the most straightforward way to do that
but that looks like that's not gonna
happen
and the problem with cap-and-trade is
that it has so many special interest
groups that there are so many exceptions
that lesson should have been learned
from Europe Europe spent 50 billion
dollars in licenses for carbon emissions
over the last few years and their co2
emissions went up and most of the money
went to the largest utility in Germany
that burns coal so we should take a
lesson from that I think also people are
to us centric just because the u.s. cuts
down its carbon emissions doesn't mean
the rest of the world will and how are
we going to get China in India and those
other countries to stop their carbon
emissions if we try to say let's sign a
big Kyoto treaty in in Copenhagen now
they're gonna say well wait a minute
we're willing to do that but you know
the West emitted 300 350 parts per
million of co2 into the atmosphere to
get where they are now and we haven't
had our turn yet we're not responsible
for that climate crisis we want an
exception until we reach your level of
carbon emissions your prosperity I just
think it's an impossible negotiating
posture to take and I don't think the
Congress the United States will agree to
anything that exempts the developing
world from that the answer is to produce
electricity cheaper than coal that's a
way that we can convince people from
their own economic self-interest to
replace the coal burning power plants
not only that it means that we can
produce energy cheaper than we do today
and that alone increases economic
productivity so we got two things in
front of us there and another byproduct
of that is that you know there are many
people who deny that humans are the
principal cause of global warming and
many of these people are respected and
there's no need to alienate those people
those people can also endorse a concept
of more prosperous energy by having less
expensive energy when I first wrote the
talk gas was at $4 a gallon that dropped
back to two synthesizing vehicle fuel in
a way cheaper than oil might be an
attractive a goal for a project like
this we also wanted to in it be
inexhaustible current rate of
consumption of uranium would say 78
years worth of a uranium easily
available we know they were going to run
out of oil and be talking about peak oil
for years we've had new natural gas
discoveries but natural gas is gonna
peak someday as well people are
concerned about waste we want to reduce
the waste that comes in this example
from nuclear power plants to say nothing
of the amount of waste that comes from
coal plants which today amounts to as
much almost as much as all the non
recycled municipal waste in the United
States and we want it to be affordable
factor where a goal of checking
population growth in the world it
doesn't do a lot of good to try to sell
10 billion dollar nuclear reactors to
Bangladesh but maybe if we had a 200
million dollar reactor we could satisfy
their power needs and perhaps get a loan
from the World Bank so those are the
goals
thorium thorium is named after Thoreau
the god of thunder and lightning and
this is a play on that thorium has is
readily available there's enough in let
me pass in Idaho to power the u.s. for a
millennium but thorium itself is not
efficient above fuel how can it be a few
let's just look for a minute at this
chart on the top row we see the names of
some of the elements thorium through
americium and their atomic numbers the
numbers of protons in each one of those
nuclei in the rows are the numbers of
nucleons that's neutrons plus protons
it's the weight of the atom if you will
and there are three practical efficient
fuels plutonium 239 uranium 235 and
uranium 233 the only one that is
naturally available is u-235
the rest of all decayed away and you
probably remember that there's not much
u-235 in uranium it's decayed a lot -
there's only 0.7% of it in natural
uranium alright just a little bit of
review of what happens inside a nuclear
reactor a neutron excites a uranium-235
nucleus it gets excited splits into two
parts in this example Krypton and barium
and releases three neutrons the total
mass of the result is just a little less
and bye-bye equals MC squared over there
that's about 160 C MeV of energy in
addition they by the fission products
are left in a pretty excited state so
they'll decay perhaps a little more and
add a little more energy to the equation
that's just for one if you multiply by
Avogadro's number then you know 200 and
which is the number of let's say atoms
in 235 grams of uranium you you find out
that it's about a ton almost a ton of
uranium or thorium require
to create a gigawatt of of power thermal
power now let's take a look at what
happens in a nutrient nuclear reactor
today with the uranium 238 that's there
in natural uranium ore let's talk about
enriched uranium in a nuclear power
plant perhaps four percent is u-235 and
the other ninety six percent is u-238
that you took 38 on this chart absorbs a
neutron and becomes you 239 for a period
of time and after a while that naturally
decays beta decays by emitting an
electron increasing its charge and
becoming a new element eventually
becoming plutonium 239 which itself is a
fish edible fuel at the end of the fuel
cycle and a nuclear reactor after about
18 months a third of the energy of the
power plant is being generated by
plutonium fishing not by uranium fishing
so we're already breeding plutonium in
standard light water reactors to make
power same idea here with thorium
thorium in a power plant can absorb a
neutron become thorium 233 that decays
in two steps to become eventually
uranium 233 which is a fissionable
element that can be used to generate
power that's how that works
those two materials thorium 232 uranium
238 are called fertile in the lingo
because they make fissionable fuels if
you expose them to neutron radiation
here's the idea of a thorium reactor you
have a fissile u-238 core just as at a
normal power plant and it's at a
critical mass so it generates neutrons
that cause other uranium 233 atoms to
decompose and so on that sustains a
chain reaction in addition there are
neutrons that escape and there's a
blanket around the
fissile core of this case thorium 232
that thorium absorbs that neutrons as in
the examples I gave before and it
becomes a uranium 233 atom now uranium
and thorium are different chemical
elements so they can be separated
through chemistry not through complex
isotopic separation and you can develop
a chemical separator plant that takes
out the 233 fuel that has been converted
and feeds it back in to the uranium 233
core in the same idea same way we can
remove the fission products we gave
examples I think of Krypton and barium
and there dozens of others you can take
away the the uranium and put it back and
reject the deficient products by the
same kind of chemical process used
before so you end up with a reactor that
runs pretty continuously it's constantly
replenished with thorium coming in this
side and constantly emitting fission
products wastes really on the far side
and like all reactors it generates heat
that boils water or something that turns
turbines to make electric power there's
a lot of innovations here first thing is
that the fuel is in a liquid form it's
not solid makes it easy to handle to
pump around that liquid is a molten
fluoride salt of the order of 300
degrees centigrade or so hot it means
that the chemical processing is it
relatively easy to accomplish so that's
that's innovation number one about this
concept number two is the reactivity is
inherently stable that's because the
fuel salt expands as it heats up driving
some of it out away from the critical
area we so that the criticality is
reduced besides another side effect be
something well the most important thing
is it means it's very the reactivity
controls simple and safety controls are
simplified it also means
can generate less than full power so
you're in a situation where you don't
need all the power output it can do load
following today we use coal and nuclear
principally for base load and use
natural gas for load following this kind
of technology could do both at the
high-temperature end you can have a much
more efficient conversion of thermal
energy to electric power it's not 50%
using a the Brayton cycle which is that
is used in a jet engine compared to the
about 33 percent efficient cycle and a
typical steam plant
fueled by either coal or nuclear power
also that high temperature enables
efficient electrolysis of and separation
of hydrogen from water the hydrogen is a
poorer fuel itself but it's a good
feedstock to make other fuels and
another advantage we'll come to is the
radioactive waste generated by this
machine would be a lot less than 1% of
their waste of a current light water
reactor and in fact it can even burn
some of it how do we start one of these
machines up
we don't have uranium 233 on earth very
much it all decayed half-life is too
short
but the US government has a lot of it
maybe got 500 kilograms snorted Oakridge
that was left over from the Manhattan
Project when they were doing every darn
thing they could to develop nuclear
weapons
unfortunately that is slated for
destruction by being down blended and
put into nuclear power plants and the
guys who do the research are up in arms
because it'll be a wonderful research
asset for this kind of work but you can
prime this thing with other kinds of
fissile material any kind of fissile
material can get the process started off
you u-235 or plutonium or even leftover
spent nuclear fuel from today's existing
light water reactors eventually all that
stuff is used up and we enter the stable
state of u-233
here's a scale enough uranium to power a
city for a year there's a one-ton
thorium sphere about a half metre in
diameter
it'll power a one Giga watt plant for
about a year there's about 500 gigawatts
of power used in the United States it's
about $100,000 a ton so it's not too
expensive we have in the desert 3000
tons in storage owned by the United
States government that were extracted
and isolated during the Manhattan
Project and certainly at least 400,000
tons more of reserve in the United
States today
so it's plentiful a little bit of
history here back in a Manhattan Project
Wigner developed the idea of the thorium
to uranium breeder reactor I think it
looked kind of at the chart the red line
at the top seems to say you get about
2.5 neutrons out of this process per
fishin the other possibility was what
Fermi had proposed and that was that the
uranium to plutonium cycle worked faster
because you got about 2.9 neutrons per
fission so he could make more fissile
material for more weapons faster for
that reason all the emphasis was turned
towards the uranium plutonium cycle
because of the necessity of making
nuclear weapons that's not necessarily
today's goal you remember rickover
invented the atomic submarine which
could patrol under the surface of the
sea for months at a time without
resurfacing for refueling or running
engines the generals in the airforce
were anxious to have a similar
capability for the Strategic Air Command
so that they could fly bombers equipped
with nuclear weapons continuously
without ever having to come down for
refueling
and so they from
and funded the aircraft reactor
experiment to create a nuclear reactor
powered aircraft engine that well a
Mitchell experiment was done at Oak
Ridge in 1954 in molten salt at that
temperature later on another experiment
was to think about the thorium cycle and
they created a second Experion
experiment using uranium 233 which they
had and successfully ran that reactor
for four years they never installed the
thorium breeder blanket they instead
what an instrumentation around that
reactor for their work all that work has
been captured documented and posted on
the internet there's a lot of
information there talking hundreds of
millions of dollars of research at that
time today there are no molten salt
reactors in test anywhere but these
countries particularly France has a
group of maybe 20 people working on this
project all theoretical all on paper you
had a speaker here from Canada
David LeBlanc come and you had Bhanumati
from from US come and talk about these
technologies but people are interested
I'm just going to quickly go through
some of these that establish the idea
that this is just not a theoretical idea
there was a thorium reactor built a
pebble bed reactor in Germany in 1883 it
was fueled with pebbles made of the the
fissile material 3 to 35 and to 32 it
had a pressure vessel reinforced
concrete it was a dry cooling tower
interestingly and they had an accident
of some sort the details aren't well
known in 85 B fuel pellet lodged in the
pure feed pipe apparently in Chernobyl
was 88 or so that in the work in Germany
to look at radiation fall from Chernobyl
they discovered that there was
apparently radiation
from a previous fuel pellet problem at
the thorium reactor people got nervous
they had been a cover-up they shut that
plant down and of course Germany is on a
path now to shut down all its nuclear
power plants there's something called
the generation 4 forum they've sort of
adopted six designs for new kind of
power plants the molten salt reactor
being one of them in a way the forum's
kind of a paper tiger but here's the
idea again that you have a molten
fluoride salt the beryllium fluoride and
lithium fluoride you heat it up it has a
relatively low temperature to become
molten at certain composition so maybe
300 degrees C or so and you can dissolve
uranium fluoride in it or plutonium
fluoride or thorium fluoride so it's an
interesting vehicle their design again
it's just a conceptual design even talks
about how it works an important aspect
of this reactor is that it's not
pressurized it works at atmospheric
pressure so in the event of any kind of
accident there's no pressurized steam or
helium gas or anything to expel any kind
of radioactive products into the
environment in this example it's
graphite moderated they estimated a
billion dollar orangy cost to develop
this tower was the inventor of the
hydrogen weapon ralph Moore was the
director of Oak Ridge and he was also
the patent holder on the solid state
solid fuel nuclear power reactor these
two men as late as 2004 just before
Tyler died I have published a paper
again promoting the concept of the
liquid fluoride thorium molten salt
reactor India is very interested in
thorium India remember did not sign the
non-proliferation treaty they've been
sort of an outcast
asked and have not been able to buy much
uranium nor technology on the open
market
up to now and they have a lot of thorium
so their strategy up to now has been use
heavy water reactors reactors moderated
by deuterium oxide such as Canada
developed to convert uranium to
plutonium and eventually convert thorium
to uranium because they have a lot of
thorium in India more recently for some
reason we've signed an agreement with
them to say we will send you technology
and and uranium I don't understand it it
seems to undermine the non-proliferation
treaty to me but anyway there are
friends now I guess
India has that many heavy water reactors
13 under construction they are
interested in thorium they expect 30% of
their electricity to come from thorium
their technology is all involved in the
solid forms of thorium they expect to
modify the existing technologies for
pressurized water reactors or can do
like reactors for thorium they have not
adopted the concept of the liquid form
at I got interested in this through this
forum on the internet there's probably
two or three hundred people on it today
Ian's being one of them and from time to
time people contribute ideas like I
think there's like thirty thousand posts
to date so if you have an idea and you
put it up on the forum you get a
response in about an hour from somebody
and what's always a mystery to me is
that people like to be anonymous on
these forums I'm not quite sure why we
have a lot of mysterious bright people
we'd love to meet someday but I don't
know who they are or where they come
from so no surprise I would recommend
that we have a national project to
develop the liquid fluoride thorium
reactor this is the part that nuclear
engineers folk
on the reactor core and blanket that's
kind of the fun part but there's a lot
of chemistry work to be done we finally
got a winner - good chemists on the
forum that that can perhaps help I'm in
the uranium separator plant that kind of
work was all done in research mode at
Oak Ridge 50 years ago you know
similarly the waste separation research
some of that's been done but you have to
establish a sort of industrial quality
fabric Abul chemical separation plants
for both of those processes these are
big projects and from an engineering
point of view you need to go to heat
exchanger and part of this is will be
that you may need specialized high
temperature materials to achieve the
efficiencies that i've been speaking
about so heat exchanger development is
important people talk about something
called a triple reheat Brayton cycle
which is what's necessary to get up to
that 50 percent efficiency it hasn't
been done with helium there's a lot of
work to be done there in the US
companies like GE I bet could do a
wonderful job at that control systems
and eventually if we want hydrogen
separators I gave the same talk to the
American nuclear society last month and
this is sort of message to engineers
it's very important to keep the costs
down and if we make cost an objective at
the beginning of the project we have a
chance of achieving that if we don't
make electricity cheaper than from coal
then all those benefits I've been
talking about really lost so you got to
keep that in mind why can't it be low
cost one is all the radioactive
materials are at low pressure so no
large containment extractors are needed
no large expensive containment
structures well less construction
material the negative temperature
reactivity means this simple safety
system that is as it gets hotter the
reactivity drops there's a concept of
inherent safety what do you do if all
powers lost the plan
once you have no control systems
whatsoever there's a design that allows
a sort of a freeze plug underneath the
liquid salt to melt and then drain into
a non-critical shape if we can make
enough of these we can mass-produce them
and again the fuel is cheap we want to
do it for several reasons we want to
stop global warming by producing cheap
electricity and we want also to bring
prosperity to developing nations by
having inexpensive power sources for
them so again I'm promoting a proposing
just as an example a hundred megawatt
sized unit a typical power plant today
is about a gigawatt but if we're looking
at under $2 a watt we should be able to
develop such a plant hopefully for under
two hundred million dollars a unit to
make it affordable to developing nations
to allow us to distribute to put the
power sources near the points of use
that cuts down on transmission line
losses and makes them less vulnerable to
disruption from terrorism let's take a
look I said well well suppose it costs
200 million dollars and I kind of got my
wife's HP calculator out plugged in 8%
and here's what that would cost a month
to repay the cost of capital and if were
your words are divided by the kilowatt
hours produced about two cents a
kilowatt hour for differing the capital
costs again the start-up uranium is sort
of expensive this is the price that we
pay today you may not realize that we
pay Russia for uranium they take out of
warheads to fuel half of the nuclear
power reactors in the United States
today and that's what we pay that that
rate 10 million dollars a ton D content
I don't know what decommission he's
gonna cost that I said half the price
operations I'm a proponent of low-cost
operations so the principle cost is the
capital cost as is always that case in
new
your power will that be cheaper than
from coal I don't know
here's what power costs in China these
are the industrial areas of China cost
about seven cents a kilowatt hour that's
delivered I don't know what it costs
coming out of the power plant in the US
we're paying three four five cents for
distribution
so I'm guessing three cents will do the
trick again I'm suggesting we aim high
that is use automated controls I mean
right here in San Francisco you get on a
train at the airport that has no no
driver
well we're used to that kind of
technology can't we do the same thing in
this business we we've sending rovers to
the moon without people then they do a
good job again the idea of the the base
the inherent reactivity control makes
the safety systems simple so if anything
happens to our command and control
system where we lose power somehow the
thing will decay to a stable state and
there are a lot of advantages of no
workers one is lower costs two is safety
you know remember that at Chernobyl
people overrode all the safety systems
people in power plants caused problems
and there's no risk of uranium theft if
you have no one there to steal it and we
don't want people to be able to steal it
to make weapons
I say emulate Boeing look but look at
the look at the similarity with Boeing
aircraft not far from here there's a
production line they make one a day
Boeing actually makes more than one a
day
unbelievably their standardized units
they're able to do that they use the
newest technologies of computer-aided
design manufacturing and the units cost
about 200 million dollars each coming
out that are one a day and they have the
same concerns about life safety as the
public has and the nuclear engineering
community has about life safety and
nuclear power plants
okay what would happen if we were to
build these things what are the benefits
well let's just see what happens build
one a week and install them to check
coal power today we're burning 227
gigawatt years a year of coal and we
could just we could displace all that
technology with this over a period of
forty four years faster if you wanted to
build more what about the world I said
that's a worldwide problem let's do the
same thing but do one a day 1400
gigawatt years of power used a year in
the world at a rate of one a day we
could diminish it say in by 2050 eight
so it will have an impact on co2
emissions it will have an impact on
small particulate emissions what about
motor fuel a little tougher there is a
neat process you don't look at the
diagram too hard except to say that you
heat water and sulfur as a catalyst
separates oxygen iodine separates out
hydrogen and this process works well at
high temperatures 900 950 degrees
centigrade it's been done in a lab scale
ever been done a commercial scale there
are other a lot of products you can make
from hydrogen hydrogen is a tough fuel
you can't really use it very well but
just take ammonia for a second there are
processes where you can use dissociated
ammonia through fuel motors don't forget
that ammonia is plowed into the ground
to feed half the world the haber-bosch
ammonia fabrication process in fact uses
more than 1% of the entire world's
energy output not just electric and
that's responsible for feeding the world
what about methanol we got plenty of co2
around we can combine it with hydrogen
to make methanol fuel George Ola is a
Nobel Prize winning chemist from
California who wrote the book called the
methanol economy and he shows the
advantages of methanol for example it
was used as a racing fuel in the Indy
500 up for years and years and years
until recently
it's being hijacked by the Midwestern
farmers in need so on and they're trying
to dilute it more and more with ethanol
so ethanol is a fine motor fuel dimethyl
ether is a good substitute for diesel
fuel and I did a little you know really
back in the envelope suspect
calculations to say it could be
something like two dollars a gallon to
make fuel this way so it seemed like a
good idea
we ought to do it but or there's another
problem that is the initial power plants
might not have the really high
temperature materials that are needed
there's some R&amp;amp;D done so we might have a
little more expensive process let's look
at oil imports for a minute
let's make gasoline that way or here's
the oil imports that are necessary to
make gasoline in the United States
suppose we do the same game it's all in
one of these a week to make gasoline
well it turns out we use a lot of
gasoline or over the rest of the century
we'd only cut it down by about a billion
barrels a year I'm and I was surprised
at that
so I have to say well we can make it
cheaper than imported oil but that's not
gonna be really all the answer a lot of
the answer is what Google recommends as
well and that is electric cars they're
much much more efficient in this example
a Chevy Volt recharges with a kilowatt
hours cost about fifteen cents or a
dollar twenty all together in New
Hampshire where I live you know we could
power 300,000 cars on a 100 megawatt
reactor and same game put in one a week
until half of the existing 125 million
play the street is replaced and the
current Phyllida car is about 20 miles
per gallon so we could knock off maybe
two billion barrels of oil imports that
way I discovered here's a picture of a
Boeing 777 I discovered one of the
reasons it's so hard to make a fuel is
each one of those jet engines on that
airplane is capable
of generating 100 megawatts of kinetic
energy and we were only talking about
100 megawatt electric reactor so you can
understand all these things it can can
drink a lot of fuel and we need that
kind of a dense power source to fly
airplanes air cooling typically a power
plant today evaporates perhaps 20,000
gallons a minute of water to make a
gigawatt of electrical power the
advantage of the higher efficiency of
thermal to electric conversion is that
this less heat rejection into the
environment and so we can get away with
half of the cooling requirements of
today's nuclear or coal plants and we
need air cooling in places that are arid
so instead of using water cooling let's
use a more expensive admittedly air
cooling system I was looking for air
cooling towers and I came across this
picture of a museum in Iran it was just
so pretty we can't make it with that
pretty but maybe you can make it baby
can make one that's aesthetically
pleasing and if not look what we did in
Boston we was an ugly tower so ugly the
gas tank we just painted it and here's a
kind of a third world tower that it's
painted with them pictures now here's
what happens in a normal two days light
water reactor start off with about 250
tons of uranium some of its enriched
passed through and about as many fission
products come out as product grew in
makes sense most of the stuff that comes
out is u-238 it's not burned up but
there's about a ton efficient products
and about 0.3 tons of plutonium that
come out of a typical gigawatt plant a
thorium reactor has a different mode it
only uses a ton of thorium because we
burn all of it we only buoyant burn
point seven percent of the uranium that
goes into one of these reactors really
and out of this thing we get about
ooo one ton we get about a hundred grams
of plutonium compared to 300 kilograms
and any other technology there there's
two reasons for this one is that you
remember the thorium atom thorium 232
has a much lower atomic mass than does
uranium 238 and in order to make
plutonium you need many many more
neutron absorptions successively so the
probability of making plutonium in that
kind of reactor is much much less the
second reason is that the plutonium and
other such things stay in the fuel salt
and in turn eventually fission absorb a
neutron or otherwise consumed so where
do we how we do this
well I start playing games I said let's
look at NASA's strategic plan and this
is it come run came right off their
internet site less a few adjectives and
they all seem sort of reasonable they
look at the last one and they part of
the strategic plan is a lunar return
program will utility for Mars I'm saying
to myself gee I bet this money that
could be redirect in here and their
budget is about 18 billion a year we're
thinking the project like this might
cost a billion dollars over five years
to do the R&amp;amp;D support that's a very
round number that's the number that came
out of the Gen 5 Gen 4 for but it isn't
just the money look at the expertise
that outfit like NASA's got to have in
materials that make sense in development
of this kind of reactor look at the
project management the quality
management skills that are necessary in
NASA and a project of this sort
probabilistic risk assessment is
something that NASA used if we said it
we had to be perfectly safe all the time
we never would have flown a man to the
moon
well they know about all this sort of
thing energy and information technology
all these skills are important to both
NASA and to this project so I say well
instead of going to the Mars or the moon
let's take a temporary detour
and spend some of that money here
establish a national energy program
we're not doing that now we try to
establish tax programs delay or curtail
some necessary some NASA programs if
necessary and then commandeer some
resources we've got Idaho National
Laboratories that built perhaps 40 of
the test reactors that were built in the
United States still has a lot of
capability we've got NASA we've got Oak
Ridge that did the work on the thorium
reactors but I don't know if there's
anybody left there are gone and right
here their plant is plenty of places in
this country that have skills that can
be applied to a project like this just
picking numbers sort of out of the air
saying well look why these projects take
so long
partly it's because we don't set goals
that are aggressive suppose we say we
want a five your goal to do all the IRD
and then at the end of that five years
maybe you figure out how to scale it up
for mass production in the first five
years develop all the data and put it in
the public domain maybe in the second
five years you might want the GES
Westinghouse's and array of is to have
proprietary products that they hope to
make money on because we want them to be
able to produce to produce one of these
a day if we produce let's say one a week
that's a 10 billion dollar business if
we then start exporting these that could
be a seventy billion dollar a year
business so there could be a financial
incentive for business to do this as
well so here's the recommendation
establish a national energy project
commandeer resources from NASA and the
National Labs and share the R&amp;amp;D
initially because this is a worldwide
problem and that would then allow
commercial incentives to develop the
production line to make this happen
enjoy the benefits I'm going to review
for a minute electricity cheaper from
coal from this vehicle fuel cheaper than
oil yes and
range strategy that's an okay objective
it is inexhaustible we do reduce the
waste in fact we consume waste let's
start up we can make it affordable to
populations of developing nations maybe
there's a way we can achieve Meadows
goal and his model of reducing
consumption in the way that population
would stabilize maybe I'll say right now
Meadows is not a fan of nuclear power so
I'm not trying to imply thank you very
much for question I'm happy to accept
questions there is a mic there too or I
can speak
I ignore environmental impact costs I've
just sketched out the basic costs that
that is true but I think the
environmental impact costs are less if
we consider the impact study of a coal
plant or the impacts of today's nuclear
power plants yeah I think to make
anything like this happen you have to
have a phalanx of lawyers way out in
front trying to clear the path and make
it to allow such a thing to go to occur
as Steven Chu I believe it's the energy
secretary do you have any idea if he's
actually working on this or not question
is do I think the energy secretary Chu
is working on this
I think he's not heard of me I've
written him letters I get thank-yous I
said a little book but reality no I
think the Energy Department still thinks
that the right horse to ride is the
liquid metal liquid sodium fast breeder
reactor and their incentive seems only
to be how to get rid of the nuclear
waste they don't seem to have the goals
of say power cheaper than from coal
news favors ecology little ways and
we find a lot of the smaller capital
costs by crime but there's still no
solution no long term solution
especially if people was supposed to be
deployed in the skin and water st. Louis
is smaller
yes the liquid thorium reactor will
generate wasted all reactors generate
about the same amount of fission
products which are highly radioactive
for a period of years and what can be
safely put aside in cast as is now being
done at nuclear nuclear power plants
eventually you got to have some
necessity for a long-term geological
storage of these materials if we have
less the disposal that's a big advantage
in spite of the fact that Yuka's being
stymied by Senator Reid there is the
existing Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in
New Mexico which stores all the wastes
from the military programs in salt
caverns then very slowly collapsed and
enveloped though the waste
there's a
he's pointing out to fit that is less
that the 1% is less than the current
plants that is true for the long lines
race the the immediate waste the race
that's going to be active for two or
three hundred years is about the same
from all kinds of power plants sure okay
so the question says are am I being
unfair comparing a technology from 50
years ago to a new theoretical one
perhaps a little bit but the facts that
were given in the talk are still correct
we often looked at the French as having
only 37 tons of nuclear waste what it's
tied in classified containers every year
but you have to look more closely the
French have another 200 tons at least of
the kind of waste we have 300 tons of
surplus uranium and plutonium that's not
used they have hundreds of tons of
material added to their storage each and
every year they have good PR I was
curious you mentioned the 100 megawatt
number as sort of just a ballpark and
you also talked about traditional plants
are typically like a gigawatt in size
I'm just wondering is there an economy
of scale at some point in time like
there's a hundred megawatt like a really
sweet point or did you just sort of get
it for for some other numbers or is a
gigawatt or 10 Giga watt or whatever a
better choice right the question is the
economy and scale of a gigawatt first is
a 100 megawatt plant and yes today's
plants are all gigawatt sized or bigger
in the sense that utilities put two or
three of them on the same site
principally or partly because the siting
permissions are so difficult
to obtain the utilities would would
never consider honestly in this day and
age try to increase the number of plant
sites by a factor of 10 it's take a lot
of social engineering to get people to
accept that many sites for nuclear power
plants now the other thing is that the
engineers do say so well wait a minute I
economies of scale here Bob we can make
one gigawatt electric turbine less
expensively than ten hundred megawatt
turbines and perhaps I was right but
that forgets about the fact that if you
have a production environment where you
have competitive suppliers and rapid
turnover on the production line there
are economies that occur as the
technologies developed that you that I
depend upon in this idea that's not to
happen
why thorium instead of uranium 238
uranium 238 is in fact a reasonable fuel
we have a lot of it there's even been
experience in Chicago with the integral
fast reactor the advantages of thorium
are that it works at an at the advantage
it started it's more plentiful to begin
with another thing is that it generates
much much less of plutonium and other
high-level wastes and material that
could be used for other other purposes
but I don't know that there's a liquid
fuel design for a uranium 238 reactor
there are a lot of compromise designs I
only showed just one that people will
deal with that would involve other fuels
in addition to thorium</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
