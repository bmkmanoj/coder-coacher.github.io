the tech talks team and today we're very
excited to welcome dr. krishna kumar and
to google santa monica dr. Kumar is a
senior economist at rand corporation
where he leads the Rosenfeld program on
asian development at the party Rand
graduate school his research and
teaching interests focus on economic
growth and development human capital
accumulation and technological change
dr. Kumar joins us today to discuss the
economic relationship between India and
the United States please join me in
welcoming dr. Kumar thank you very much
for inviting me to in fact with this
elite audience here the topic of
discussion today is India and in
particular the implications of the
economic rise of India for the United
States in preparing this presentation
I've been informed by three projects
that we have done a trine one is
studying the effect of state level
policies in India and entrepreneurship
the second is a cross country comparison
of Indian and Chinese education system
and the third is a broad study of the
future of global poverty and I would
like to acknowledge support from the
Rosenfeld program at Rand which makes
much of my work on Asia possible so
looking 30 years back the mention of
India would have him walk what kind of
images probably these delicious
unhealthy fried snacks from India
samosas or maybe spirituality if anybody
wanted to find themselves whether in
books or movies or in real life they
would go to India and unfortunately the
problem of poverty which has been
endemic in India since independence and
it's not as if these images have
disappeared fortunately in the case of
samosas and unfortunately in the case of
pretty and even the recent movie pray
love the prey was assigned to india so
spirituality is alive and well as well
but india today evokes a different set
of images first it evokes the image of
software companies both indigenous and
foreign companies that are doing
business in india so software and
services accounted for over sixty
billion dollars in the Indian gross
domestic product or GDP and while this
might be a small percentage of the total
Indian GDP about six percent or so the
influence it has had on the Indian
economy and on making the Indian
companies players on the global scene is
incalculable Indian software companies
export a total of about fifty billion
dollars which is a quarter of India's
overall exports and a good sixty percent
of them out of the United States Indian
labor force the well-educated labor
force that it is known for its growing
every year 3.5 million graduates and
postgraduates are added to the labor
force annually and over 200,000 of them
have degrees in IT in computer science
the law the other image that is a boat
in fact the publishers will never let us
forget this image is one of call centers
or business process outsourcing so these
are the places where Indians with made
up American names and so your credit
card and other reservation inquiries so
this BPO industry has accounted for over
12 billion dollars in in revenues for
India and even though there are
competitors now going after the same
business as India such as the
Philippines Malaysia and Thailand India
still retains the top BPO spot in the
world and the recent survey by the
management consultancy firm AT Kearney
ranked India first in global services
location based on quality cause
availability of labour and so on the
other image that India evokes is
actually a country its neighbor to it's
not China this word chin dia which is a
nun felicitous coinage of you will has
been proposed to think of China and
India as a whole these two countries
have become joined at their hips whether
they like it or not so let's spend a
quick minute comparing India and China
and the US if you look at GDP gross
domestic product which is sort of like
the sales of a country if you will the
u.s. is over 14 trillion dollars and the
number one economy in the world China
has about a third of it it it was ranked
number three because these figures are
for 2009 but as you know it recently
overtook japan to become the number to
country and india has over trillion
about a fourth of the chinese gdp ranked
at number 12 but if you are just for
what is called purchasing power parity
or PPP to capture the fact that labor
and you know the goods that use labor
intensive Lee or cheaper in India and
China so for example dollar is unlikely
to fetch you a haircut even a bad one in
the US but if you convert it to the
Indian or Chinese currency you have a
good chance of getting a haircut in
these countries so once you make the
adjustment for that you can see that
chinese gdp is much higher and already
ranked number two it's been ranked
number two for a while and india is
ranked number four in the world if you
look at the real gross domestic product
growth rate india and china are growing
at phenomenal rates even when the
Western countries are still struggling
to get out of the recession and I will
get back to this two percentage point
gap and growth between India and China
that you see there however when you look
at GDP per capita which is the share of
the pie that you get to take home the
figures are not that impressive China
has less than a seventh of the u.s. per
capita GDP and rank much lower in India
has half of China's per capita GDP so
relatively speaking we are still talking
about two countries that are poor
now a lot of people have been credited
for the turnaround in Indian fortunes
but I would like to acknowledge the
writer of Indian origin who actually was
born and brought up in Trinidad but then
moved to england vs and I Paul so VS
Naipaul traveled in India between ninety
nineteen eighty eight and nineteen
ninety and he saw a sense of energy and
enthusiasm that he had not seen before
and he thought that this was the
beginning of a new way for many millions
a part of India's growth part of its
restoration and he documented all this
in his book India million mutinies in
1990 whether it was premonition or pure
luck in 1991 india fest a huge crisis a
balance of payment crisis and india did
not let a good crisis go waste so it
enacted a series of reforms which took
it from being a closed economy from the
point of view of traded practices import
substitution most of its you know heavy
industries were under state control it
had a high tax rate and it had all kinds
of foreign exchange controls and it
became a country that was much more open
and integrated with the with the world
it lowered and simplified tariffs it
became a signatory to the World Trade
Organization or WTO its current account
became convertible the tax laws became
much more reasonable and this process is
ongoing in 2005 India assigned a patent
law reform which respects intellectual
property right so all these reforms I
took India from a very low growth rate
so if you look at the x-axis it is a
calendar year on the y-axis you have
real gross domestic product which is
adjusted for inflation in trillions of
indian rupees you can see that before 80
India was growing at three point five
percent a year and it became dubbed the
Hindu rate of growth presumably because
Hinduism is a very Pacific religion and
people were willing to accept this this
growth rate but since a DS reform
started in a small way which increased
the growth rate and after 91 when
reforms were fully enacted you can see
that it made a big difference in growth
rate and in fact if you look
the more recent years India has been
setting a fairly blistering pace and
growth rate growing at eight to ten
percent a year so you can see that in
this graph with those red bars with our
which our annualized real GDP growth
rate and the line which is a smooth
average which grow which goes up much
more smoothly and this points out to one
caution we need to exercise in
explaining away economic performance
based on religion and culture it's not
as if a billion and a half chinese and a
billion and a quarter Indian suddenly
converted and became Protestants and
that's why these people started growing
economic incentives and sound economic
policies have a way of you know taking
effect in the population and improving
entrepreneurship so what does all this
mean for the US which is the meat of the
talk I want to focus on six implications
this is not meant to be a complete list
in fact I'm not even going to focus on
the the implication that you often hear
that India by itself has a middle class
that is larger than the population of
the US and therefore ripe market for for
Western companies but instead of I want
to focus on the perceptions that
americans and indians have of each other
and after talking about the flow of
goodwill I want to talk about the flow
of goods and services trade flow of
capital in the form of investment flow
of ideas in the form of entrepreneurship
and flow of talent in the form of labor
and then finally talk about whether the
US should think of India and China as a
monolith or or separating okay so the
first and the good news is that
americans and indians like each other it
was not always this way when during the
time of the Cold War India was viewed as
firmly being in the Soviet can even
though it was officially a non-aligned
country and many Americans are regarded
India and Indians with suspicion and
that suspicion was mutual because the
Indians were suspicious of the Americans
as well but in a 2005 few global
attitude survey among the 17 countries
surveyed Indians had the most favorable
opinion of the u.s. about 71 percent and
the reason I
in that particular year is that that was
a year when not many people had a very
high opinion or a favorable opinion of
the u.s. so even in that time the
Indians had a favorable opinion and
since then consistently India has been
among the top countries you know as far
as favorable opinion about the u.s. goes
in the most recent survey 2010
two-thirds view the u.s. favorable
likewise in a BBC World Service appalled
in 2010 us perceptions of India we're
nearly at the top among 28 countries
Paul just a percentage point below South
Korea so this is a good base from which
to build on if you will now looking at
trade if you look at this picture on the
x axis you have year and on the y-axis
you have billions of dollars in trade
the blue line is US exports to india and
that orange line is US imports from
india and both of these have been you
know steadily increasing which is which
is good news there's been a little bit
of a dip in the last year but that was
because of the global economic slowdown
and world trade at large slowed down but
just to place this in perspective if you
look at US exports to china it was about
70 billion dollars in order of magnitude
higher than this and of course imports
are very high close to 300 billion
dollars the you china is the second
largest trading partner for the US after
canada where is india ranks much lower
it at number 14 and China is also the
largest trading partner for India and
recently china overtook us as the
largest trading partner but one of the
themes that's going to be recurring
throughout this presentation is let's
get away from just the aggregate and
abroad numbers and dig a little bit
deeper to look at the composition of
these numbers okay so if you look at
Indian trade in this graph on the x-axis
again you have yours on the y-axis you
have the percentage of trade that is
accounted for by services and if you
look at the Chinese line which is the
purple line at the bottom it's been flat
or even decreasing but Indian share of
services in its
God's has been steadily increasing and
that is the green line okay so Indian
trade is more like a developed country
trade even though in absolute numbers it
might be lower than that of China so
recent report from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Dallas from where this graph has
taken says that globally traded services
tend to be knowledge-intensive requiring
more educated and productive workers and
indian exports are much more likely to
be at the top end of the services
hierarchy so what are the implications
for the u.s. there's a good reason why
Canada is a largest trading partner for
the u.s. because it's tightly integrated
in the complex production chain that the
US has some of the goods intermediate
goods are made in Canada some of them
are made in the US and then they're put
together so India is likely to have this
collaborative possibility with the u.s.
rather than just selling lower end final
goes at the same time this also gives
the chance for India to turn our own and
compete with some of the goods that the
u.s. is making so this is a slight twist
on the aggregate numbers that that I
showed you so what can hurt well the
protectionist measures that always come
to the fore during during recessions and
slowdowns can clearly heard this trade
flow so for example India recently
complained at the WTO that the state of
Ohio has imposed a moratorium on IT
outsourcing and kaylee India would be
one of the countries that would be
affected what would help is the stall
Doha Round of trade talks if those could
be revived not just Indian and US trade
but world trade as a whole will increase
next let's look at flow of capital
rather than just goods and services
Ernst &amp;amp; Young ranks India fourth in
attractiveness for foreign direct
investment or FDI China is ranked number
one and if you look at this picture
again on the x axis here y axis billions
of dollars of FDI inflow before 2005
there was not even much action in india
so i'm just showing the picture from
2005 and you can see that the lower line
which shows the foreign direct
investment in flow into india
has been steadily increasing but again
dwarfed by the Chinese figures okay but
again I want to point out let's look at
the composition of it and services
attract over twenty percent or more of
inflows into India followed by
industries such as construction housing
telecom and auto whereas if you look at
the chinese foreign direct investments
talk a majority of it close to sixty
percent of it is concentrated in
manufacturing so clearly the type of
foreign direct investment that each
country is getting is a bit different
the US investment in india has evolved
beyond call centers so if you look at
the picture to the left this is the
result of us multinationals now doing
more than just you know outsourcing
they're doing R&amp;amp;D they're establishing
R&amp;amp;D centers so the picture there shows
the patterns that have been filed in
india in 2001-2002 the light orange
circle and the darker in circle which is
exactly those figure 4 2007 2008 and you
can see that both in the number of
patents you know filed in india and
granted in india there's been a huge
increase thanks to this you know
increased R&amp;amp;D activity this is leading
to reverse innovation to your right you
can see the electro audiogram a portable
version produced for under thousand
dollars and selling for under thousand
dollars by by GE and the the interesting
twist here is that this was designed and
developed in india so that the rural
physician that you see there who's
making household house calls can
transport it with him and this is now
being adapted to the US and they're
planning on you know marketing it in the
US and this is called reverse innovation
and this is going to become the wave of
the future and this is not just a luxury
i think the US firms need to reverse
innovate and find how you can sell low
cost products globally because you know
this is another picture you would have
seen the Tata Nano it's a car that's
priced for twenty two hundred dollars if
the US firms me to come
it with these products they need to
engage in a lot of reverse innovation
now India signed global patent laws in
2005 which protects intellectual
property and one of the brightest scenes
in the Indian economic landscape is a
bio farma industry and many US
institutes and companies have joint
ventures in india india is expected to
conduct fifteen percent of the global
clinical trials by 2011 netting about
six hundred million dollars I think
there is a good chance for India and the
u.s. using their comparative advantage
when it comes to basic science research
whether it's in universities or research
institutes which are either private or
government the u.s. clearly has the
comparative advantage and India and you
know China and other developing
countries might have the comparative
advantage in taking these fundamental
ideas and translating them into products
and together that could well be the
right win-win formula that that is
likely to emerge in the near future so
what can hurt here indian retail which
is a three hundred billion dollars
sector is still largely closed to
foreign direct investment so it's not as
if foreign companies are not in india
but they cannot set up multi-brand
retail venture so they are using all
kinds of loopholes and backdoor entry
mechanisms to get into the market so
sectors that remain closed will
obviously impede capital inflow into
India Indians themselves are becoming
adventurous and are investing heavily in
other countries so for example the UK is
a big recipient of Indian capital and
you've not seen that yet in the u.s. in
the UK India is the second highest
foreign employer after the US and
there's not such an activity happening
in the US and this is probably something
that we can expect to pick up in the
near future now when we think about
India or when we hear about India and
the news we hear a lot about you know
rapid growth of India the software
companies and so on and some of the you
know rich Indians so
you know to your left is a picture which
shows that two of the top five people in
the folder richest people list are
Indians Mukesh Ambani and Lakshmi Mittal
are there at four and five and there are
many others further down the list but if
you look at the broad Indian picture
things are a little bit different so if
you focus on the top panel to your right
the purple a part of the pie shows the
fraction of labor that is engaged in
agriculture and that is about sixty
percent services are about thirty
percent and industry accounts for the
remaining ten percent but if you look at
their value added a bisector in other
words what they contribute to the Indian
GDP as a whole agriculture contributes
you know less than twenty percent and
most of the value addition is in
services okay over over fifty percent
now this is good from the American point
of view for reasons that I mentioned
earlier Indian trade capital investment
looks a lot like a developed country but
it's not clear that it is great from the
Indian point of view because a good
majority of the Indians have not fully
benefited from the opening up and the
growth so a recent research at Rand
argues that you know inclusive growth
has become sort of a mantra in the
Indian policy circles and
entrepreneurship might be able to bridge
the gap how improvements in
infrastructure education and health can
aid both inclusion and growth the poor
and the rich are both likely to benefit
from these from these improvements but
moreover entrepreneurship by its very
nature uses creative approaches to deal
with constraints so even when there are
constraints in these sectors like
infrastructure and so on they can work
around it even when those sectors are
are developing so entrepreneurship is a
solution for the here and now it also
spans a huge socio-economic spectrum
village dweller to venture capitalist
under research done with the Indian
School of Business shows that what India
might want to focus on is in developing
an overall business-friendly environment
rather than trying to give a lot of
subsidies which might reach the
people and might encourage you know well
the entrepreneur is more than the poor
ones so why shouldn't the u.s. care
about inclusive growth in India even if
the u.s. does not care about you know
the benefits reaching to the sixty
percent of the people in agriculture
that I mentioned you know protests and
social unrest can derail reforms and you
know push back the gains that have been
made in the bilateral trade and
investment which have been increasing as
I just show moreover the leg Adam
Institute which was a sponsor for our
research and entrepreneurship they did a
recent survey of entrepreneurs around
the world and they say that the Indian
entrepreneur looks a lot like the
American entrepreneur their risk taking
and they want to make money and so on
but more importantly both of them want
to make a difference okay so this is not
just a perceptions issue even though
indian entrepreneurs admire and look up
to American entrepreneurs but i think
the collaborative possibilities increase
if there are that many more indian
entrepreneurs than there are right now
so what can hurt you know clearly india
has to improve its business environment
it takes more than ten procedures to
start a business in india compared to
Singapore's three procedures as you see
on the graph on the on the left-hand
side and as you've seen the chart on the
right-hand side it takes 30 days to
start a business in India and only you
know two to three days in Singapore so
clearly India has to work more on making
it easier to start a business to turn
our to movement of of labor thirty
percent of the world's software
engineers or Indian i'm sure you have
come across them a third of engineers in
Silicon Valley or of Indian descent as a
researcher Vivek Wadhwa is documented
over a 25-year period you know over
fifteen percent of Silicon Valley
companies were founded by engineers of
Indian origin and as the Berkeley
researcher Annalee saxenian has pointed
out in her book the new Argonauts many
of these indian entrepreneurs have gone
back and seed entrepreneurial then
cheers in India and and in other
countries of course so the buzz word or
buzz phrase brain drain has given way to
what's called brain circulation no it's
hugely perceived though that the u.s. is
not very friendly for indian or foreign
entrepreneurs to come and set up shop so
the UK for example has this global
entrepreneur program which you know
makes it easier for foreign
entrepreneurs including Indians to come
and set up shop in the UK whereas I with
the US you know the situation is not is
not similar and this this comes at a
time when Indian engineers and
entrepreneurs are anyway either staying
back in India returning to India because
opportunities there abound at least they
are much higher than they used to be
immigration to the US is viewed as being
increasingly difficult and in fact
recently the u.s. proposed increasing
the fees for h-1b and l1 visas so in
addition to complaining about the Ohio
IT moratorium on outsourcing Indians
complained to the WTO about the
increases in these fees so these are
things that could hurt the flow of
talent so finally how should India and
China be considered for some reasons it
might actually help to think of them
together if you look at this picture on
the x-axis is the year and on the y-axis
is the PPP adjusted gross domestic
product the light blue line on the top
is american gdp the purple line or the
pink line at the bottom is the japanese
gdp on the blue one that has grown
exponentially is china and india put
together so I call this prosperity
regained for these two countries because
around 1600 these two countries had the
highest per capita gdp in the world they
missed the boat when it came to the
first Industrial Revolution in the 1700
1800 but boy are they catching up in a
hurry and this can only be good news for
the whole world because hundreds of men
millions of people are being lifted out
of poverty because of this rapid growth
and if forty percent of the humanity
benefits I think it is good for the
world as a whole but from the American
point of view it might still have to
deal with India and China you know
separately because they are very
different India is more service-based
China's manufacturing base when we
looked at the education India started
focusing on basic education only
recently it's focused much more on
higher education whereas in China
there's much more broad-based literacy
and education and at the risk of
oversimplifying India seeks to be the
laboratory to the world whereas you know
China a lot of people would claim
already is a factory to the world I
mentioned this to burn two percentage
point gap that remains between China and
India in growth so people have come up
with explanations for it one of the
explanations is that India is a chaotic
democracy it can never get done anything
fast sometimes that explains things well
but sometimes it's just an excuse a lot
of people say that if infrastructure is
attended to you can bridge the two
percent grab still other people say that
governance in India is is poor the joke
in India is that India grows at night
when the government is asleep I think
it's little bit of a harsh assessment
given that India did wake up to the
potential of its human capital and
enacted policies but there is some truth
to the fact that the aspirations of the
private sector are growing at a much
more rapid rate than how the government
can can keep pace so for example in the
recently-concluded commonwealth games or
other run up to it this issue with
infrastructure and governance came into
play to the left is a bridge that
collapsed while you know preparations
were being made and it attracted a lot
of negative publicity but India did
bounce back from it and staged what is
called the largely acceptable games
including the spectacular opening
ceremonies you know that are that are
showed there and more interestingly most
analysts and commentators fell that the
private sector has not been affected by
you know this negative publicity about
the governance and
for a structure which is which is good
news for India so in closing I think
India and the u.s. would you know remain
culturally different for for a while but
I think all these are going to be
dwarfed by the gains that are achievable
from win-win situations because in 1991
it's not just the policies that changed
in India but the approach to dealing
with the rest of the world became a lot
more pragmatic foreign direct investment
was not viewed as another vehicle for
philanthropy and instead people started
looking for win-win solutions so you
know Prime Minister Singh and President
Obama have already met eight times in
the last 18 months unless you know
President Obama is going to be visiting
India and the first week of of November
so I think what you've seen from India
and the u.s. by way of Economic
Cooperation is is just being thank you
very much thanks for the great questions
and comments it's been a pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
