so today I'm happy to introduce
professor Russ Altman who is a professor
of a genetics and medicine at Stanford
University and computer science by
courtesy rest is very involved in many
biomedical research projects at Stanford
including being the director of the
biomedical informatics program the
bollocks program you are I forget your
particular position out Hedley melon the
ballet except program and the principal
investigator for the pharmacogenomics
knowledge base this video is going to be
made publicly available through google
video so if you guys have any questions
there are Google proprietary make sure
you save them to the very end when we're
not live anymore I like to introduce our
professor Ross Holman thank you thanks
very much i'll also add that one of my
feathers in my cap is that i was Mike's
PhD advisor which he forgot to mention
but very proud of him and I'm happy to
be here and today I just want to tell
you about what's colloquially known as
personalized medicine and some of the
foot one of the forms it's taking is in
pharmacogenetics and I'll tell you a
little bit about what we're doing really
to get a conversation started to see if
there's any interest in what we're doing
and for the potential further
interactions so I want to start out real
basic cuz I know that this is a very
eclectic group with different
backgrounds the human genome is made out
of DNA which has four bases 80 c and g
the famous four bases and three billion
of those bases make a human plus a few
other things but basically the genetic
plan for each human is in 3 billion
bases 99.7 percent of which are the same
across all humans so obviously that
remaining point three percent makes a
huge difference and is responsible in
addition to the environmental factors
with why we all don't look like clones
of each other right now now there are
about a million position so if you think
of that literally as a long string of
A's T season geez
out of those three billion there are
about a million that change across human
across all humans at a significant
frequency so we may have mutated
mutation would be something that might
be very rare you might be the only one
who has a certain DNA change from like a
2g at a certain position but there are
other changes that are quite common in
the population and are actually come
from the fact that we share a common
heritage kind of the out of africa
hypothesis and a few tens of thousands
of humans about a hundred thousand years
ago who are basically our ancestors
those humans generated some diversity
and then there was a huge population
explosion similar to the growth curves
you see for Google actually and that
population explosion meant that a few of
the variations that were in the
population when we were only a hundred
thousand have now fixed themselves in
ten percent five percent fifty percent
of the population so T turning into G is
one example and there's about a million
such examples depending on how you
define it in the human genome one of the
consequences of all this by the way is
that there are many possible human
genomes if we differ even if we only
differed at a million positions with
four choices at each position that would
basically be four to the million
possible humans so we haven't even begun
to sample human diversity that's good
news because if we have a lot of
problems to solve you can be sure that
there's a lot of humans still left to
make before we have to recycle and start
making the same ones over again now so
we sequenced the human genome it was
announced a couple of years ago that the
human genome the average human genome
had been sequenced that was the ninety
nine point seven percent that was shared
then it became of great interest to
understand for humans where don't we
share the genome and what's the
consequences of that so for the last
five years in particular there's been a
lot of activity within what they call we
sequencing or genotyping we're okay we
know the 99.7 that's all shared let's
look at that small percent that's not
shared and let's characterize the ways
in which it's not shared what are the
choices T&amp;amp;A for example which
populations african asian cock
asian which populations show what
frequency of those variations and so
that's the second bowl but bullet point
characterizing the variation in the
genotype but we're not just doing that
because it's fun to do we're doing that
because we believe that with that
genotypic information we can if not
predict perfectly we can adjust
probabilities of things like probability
of disease or probability of responding
well to a medication which is what what
I'm interested in and those are what I
call phenotypes which may be a word that
you're familiar with or not but
basically a phenotype is any measurable
feature of an organism that's not its
DNA sequence so the DNA sequence is the
genotype and the how its molecules cells
organs and organism how that responds to
various stimuli would be the phenotype
and what we'd really like to do now is
understand the relationship between this
very easily measured genotype and
phenotype that we care about like risk
for disease or likelihood of responding
well to a medication and a variety of
other health related outcomes you could
also have non health related outcomes
having to do with as well it's the
Olympics athletic performance and though
there's a lot of interest and the
phenotype would be I skate fast and the
question is what's the genotype that's
not a particular interest to me there
are people in the world who care about
that deeply so I man in fermentation I
do informatics I guess many of you in
some form or another do something like
that and the challenge is in in in this
field of post-genomic post genome
biomedical research first of all it's to
exchange clear information I'm not going
to say much more about that you all know
that that's hard and boring but but very
hard and so we work on that we also want
to understand the statistical
relationship between genotype and
phenotype if I give you a genotype can
you predict a phenotype even if you
don't fully understand why that genotype
and phenotype of car lead kind of a
machine learning data mining approach
and for some people in the world that's
fine for example the FDA approves drugs
because they work statistically it
doesn't approve
uggs because there's a really good story
about how the drug works I'm a physician
I practice medicine on Friday more
afternoons and there are a lot of drugs
that I use that we don't have a good
story for how they work but we know that
they do work and that's all really that
physicians and patients care about so
don't you don't want to dis the
statistical story even though many
scientists want to have a much more
profound mechanistic understanding tell
me the story about how this DNA
variation leads to changes in the cell
that leads to a different phenotype a
perfectly legitimate question of
interest to a different set of people
we're interested in both and then I
think you can imagine that as we begin
to be able to predict phenotypes based
on genotypes plus some environmental
variables like do you smoke do you drink
benzene at night stuff like that that we
will be able to do a better job at
making prognosis for disease which is
basically the anticipated time course of
the disease diagnosing the disease in
the first place and treating the disease
so let me just make this a little bit
more concrete here I have two fragments
of two genomes so that's about 25 bases
imagine three billion of those it's very
finite right so three billion is a big
number but it's not a big number here at
Google it's not even a big number to my
kids because it fits on all their iPods
right your genome fits on your ipod and
you still have plenty of room for more
music it's it's three mega bases and
there's only four bases so there's only
a couple of bits you need to represent
that information so but here we have two
individuals and there are exactly the
same except for that one position where
the one guy at the top has a tee and the
guy at the bottom has a G that's called
a snip single nucleotide polymorphism
single because it's one position
nucleotide because that's what they call
the AG's and CS and T's and polymorphism
just is a fancy word for a difference in
the population so that's a snip because
there's a tea in some people &amp;amp; G and
other people what we'd like to do at
least from a machine learning point of
view is relate that by some complicated
probably nonlinear function to
observable phenotypes that we care about
like whether you
respond well to a cholesterol medication
or not that's essentially what
pharmacogenomics is and I but I'm gonna
tell you a little bit more detail about
this so pharmacogenomics and
pharmacogenetics are the study of how
gene genetic variation leads to
variation in the response to drugs if I
were to give you all a drug right now
which in the state of California I'm
allowed to do since I'm licensed you
would all probably have a slightly
different or maybe a vary depending on
the drug of very different response some
of you might get a headache some of you
might get take not me get nauseous some
of you might actually have the desired
effect of calming you down others it
might make you anxious and we'd like to
understand that because as physicians we
don't practice particularly personally
inform medicine now of course we talk to
the patient we understand what's
important to them you know doc it would
be bad for me to be sedated tomorrow
because I'm given a big talk at work and
I would like to be awake for it so of
course doctors do personalized medicine
at that level we're talking about a
personalized when you see personalized
medicine in the press it often means
genome informed and in fact I'm starting
to use that phrase more because I don't
insult my fellow doctors to imply that
they haven't been doing personalized
medicine for the last couple of hundred
years but they have certainly not been
doing genome informed medicine which is
if I have your genotypes I can make
better decisions this is one of the prop
promises of the genome project we got
the US government we got the congressmen
to pay for this by promising them that
we would address important health issues
like heart disease and prostate disease
which is what congressman get and so we
want to deliver on that let me give you
a couple of examples so codeine is a
pain medication many of you probably
have been prescribed codeine it's in
Tylenol number three if you ever gotten
tylenol number three it's the it's the
thing that makes the number three
necessary as and why you have to get a
prescription for it instead of just
getting it over the counter and it's an
opioid it's in the morphine family but
when you take codeine it is not active
there is an enzyme in your liver that
turns it into morphine actually it does
a little chemical reaction that changes
coding to morphine and then of course
you get all the benefits of morphine
which are quite considerable
especially if you had a tooth extracted
or surgery recently the name of that
protein is it's an ugly name I apologize
I didn't name it is cyp2d6 there's an
elaborate gene naming system which is a
whole nother topic but there's a gene
called cyp2d6 and it makes a protein it
encodes for a protein in the genome that
performs this metabolism and as you can
see in the third point seven percent of
Caucasians have a version that is a snip
or and there's actually a number of
different snips that can cause this that
renders cyp2d6 totally inactive in their
liver which means that for seven percent
of Caucasian patients codeine is like a
placebo it does absolutely nothing now I
don't know if there's anybody probably
statistically looking at the crowd there
is probably somebody here who has been
given coding and they said geez it
really didn't help my pain very much if
that happened this is one of the most
likely reasons I assume you took the
medication as a physician whether the
patient took the medication is actually
just probably more important in terms of
assessing whether the medication worked
but once you know that they took it the
genetics plays a role so coding is a
very common question cyp2d6 is the
enzyme that does the transformation so
there is this idea of markers where they
correlate with things that we either
know or don't know in this case this
snip and there's a bunch of them that
can do the same thing causes the
inactivity of cyp2d6 so in this case we
know a mechanistic story so that's a
good point because I was talking about
it could be a car let correlative story
where I just genotyped a bunch of people
saw that there was this snip that
whenever I saw it coding didn't work and
that would have been a perfectly useful
thing for clinical practice but we
actually know a little bit more in this
case one more example that's been in the
press recently is a medication called by
dill it's actually a combination pill
that two different medications that we
use separately but some company probably
was running out of patent time and
needed something to patent and created a
pill that had the two medications group
together and the bad news was they did a
trial on the general population and it
showed no overall benefit for heart
disease this is a pair of drugs that are
used for heart failure and they gave it
they did a big trial you know 3,000
people get it 3,000 people don't get it
there was no statistical difference in
the outcome and they were bummed because
wow this could have been a good drug but
it's not their their actuarial
statistics guys looked at the data and
they notice that African descent
patients in this study with 3,000 3,000
showed a little bit of benefit now you
can't get FDA to approve a drug based on
a subgroup analysis that's not the
primary goal of the study but it was
enough for them to go back into another
study focused on African descent
patients and they showed that actually
improved outcome quite quite well and so
the fda gave them approval the Food and
Drug Administration in the United States
gave them approval for using by Bill in
African descent patients well why is
this genetic I didn't mention any
genetic tests well I have mixed feelings
about this the genetic test that they're
using is looking at the color of the
patient's skin that's not a great
genetic test for a number of reasons
which I can't go into some day and I
hope soon we will do the work to find
the genetic variables that are actually
responsible for predicting the the
success of this drug and then what we'll
do is we'll test all patients African or
otherwise and if they have this snip
then we'll know that they should benefit
from Bible and if they don't they won't
right now the genetic test is staring at
the color of the patient's skin and it's
been approved and it's a very
interesting story you can imagine that
bioethicists ethicists are having a
field day writing about this and what
its implications might be but the fact
is it's on the market and it's helping
some people and so that's good so I
think you can see the clinical promise
of pharmacogenomics focused treatment by
finding people who are likely to respond
not giving it to people who are going to
have bad adverse reactions that's
something I'd like to come back to and
then for the drug companies as in the
case of by adil it's a way to save drugs
that they were hoping would be everybody
one size fits all and instead it's one
size fits some people and if you're a
drug company trying
make some money it's not bad to get a
drug that at least you can sell to half
the population or whatever and then from
a scientific point of view we'd like to
understand how drugs work better and
understand the genetic basis for drug
response is it in routine use not really
there are a few cases there's a there's
a breast cancer medication that before
you take it you need to get a genetic
test I do not test cyp2d6 before I give
patients coding what I do i give them
codeine I say if it doesn't work give me
a call and if it if it doesn't I give
them vicodin or percocet or whatever but
for whatever reason it is not entered
practice even though in principle you
could check cyp2d6 levels once early in
life and then tell the patient forever
don't do coding it's not going to it's
not going to work for you there's a
little downside for the drug market for
the drug companies because they don't
really like splitting their markets if
they don't have to so they're a little
bit schizophrenic about this do we like
it or not can't quite decide there are
lots of snips in the genome that make no
difference at all so we have still
science to do to try to figure out which
ones really matter genotyping the cost
of testing for DNA sequence is not
expensive but it's still not cheap
enough and the QC quality control hasn't
been done for routine clinical
applications that is going to go away
very fast there are a lot of companies
working very hard to get accurate
genotypes very cheap I think you can
look in the next five years for your
genotype being available for the same
amount that you pay for a head MRI or a
head CT you know an order of hundreds or
thousands of dollars not tens of
thousands of dollars there are companies
/ legend right down the street will do
it for five thousand dollars if you do
it in bulk but that's for research
purposes and there's a certain challenge
of QC for clinical purposes there are
ethical issues and testing individual
patients what do you do with the data
where do you put it who gets to see it
to insurance companies get to see it to
employers get to see it and what are
they allowed to act on what happens if
you have genetic background that
increases the risk of certain diseases
that will make you an insurance
liability to yourself or others it's
also in America today
this might be a challenge for google
totally unclear how to deliver this
information to a practitioner when I'm
practicing medicine 12 to 15 minutes per
patient that includes saying hello
talking examining about 1 to 2 minutes
for making drug prescription decisions I
have 30 medications in my head that I
use a lot that I know really well and I
can make the prescribing decisions if
you tell me that the world is a much
bigger place and I am every patient is
going to have a genetically informed
prescribing decision I need to have a
terminal next to me telling me what the
right answer is and giving me the
information to both agree or disagree
and to explain to the patient what the
plan is we don't have a health
information infrastructure in the United
States today as maybe you may be all
aware and so how to deliver that in the
United States today is entirely unclear
it's much clearer on how to do that in
UK Canada estonia Iceland because they
all have some sort of centralized effort
where you can imagine putting in a new
app for drug prescriptions or
integrating it really with the existing
apps that's not happening so there's a
big big challenge and I know that Google
is looking at stuff in that area we
think about it a lot as well ok so we're
building the farm gkb the
pharmacogenetics knowledge base this is
not meant for you to really read we
tried not to innovate too much on user
interface because you guys in Amazon and
eBay are doing all the user training for
us and so we try to you know tabs like
Amazon search boxes like you the real
meat of our stuff is in the upper left
external links or I want to buy this
information you don't really buy it but
the download buttons are always in the
upper right just where you have the Add
to Cart type buttons etc and this is a
database and what's our mission i'll
tell you a mission in a second i'm going
to skip that pharmgkb was funded by the
national institute of health because
they wanted there to be a public
pharmacogenetics effort drug companies
are doing a lot of this work but they
are not charged with sharing the data
perfectly understandable that means that
the public if they want to get data in
the public so that universities and
nonprofit
can do research in this area they're
going to have to pay for it and so NIH
kind of pony it up a bunch of money
funded a bunch of centers to do
pharmacogenomics research about 12
national centers and they funded one
database that was us to kind of hold the
data so produce a public repository with
broad applicability that was this is the
NIGMS at NIH which is who funds this
that's not really important right now
this gives you a sense for the things
we're looking at in our network of
researchers a lot of heart disease and
lung disease along the left cancer in
blue and a lot of drug metabolism on the
right and then we're in red in the
middle because we're the database and
this is really a national network our
goals are to create a national data
resource with high-quality data linking
genotype data with phenotype data both
laboratory phenotypes as well as
clinical phenotypes we have to figure
out how to represent the data the data
model tough problem provide analytic
functionality so that our users can do
stuff with the data and link with all
the complementary databases that we
don't want to do but we need to
integrate with you know we're excited
about this because it's an incredibly
complex domain we have the core data
that we have to worry about in green
genotype data molecular phenotypes
clinical phenotypes in order to make
sense of that our system has to know
about individuals on the far right there
the environment in which they operate
the drugs they take and the molecules in
their body that deal with those drugs so
from an informatics point of view it's
kind of a fun representational challenge
our mission can be simply and
graphically some rated as these three
little balls that intersect we have to
curate data and knowledge so the data
that comes in is raw data but we also
curate it and kind of represent it for
the community as digested knowledge we
have PhD level curators who do that we
have our user interface and
functionality the website the database
and then we have outreach and
dissemination which we're doing right
now and both to users and two people who
submit data
so this is the site again again I don't
want to really go through the details
it's a site it has lots of information
you type in words you get hits I just
want to point out kind of some of the
key features this is a gene page a gene
page would have genotype data what are
all the variations in the human genome
in that gene that we know about I'll
show you a little bit more detail if you
press on that link we have phenotype
data what are measured phenotypes known
to be related to that gene that we have
in the database so that's data we also
have pathway I would call it knowledge
which is we've put together pictures and
I'll show you one in a minute of how
genes work together to metabolize a drug
or to respond to a drug so it's more of
a systems level view not a gene by Gene
view that's in our pathways and then
finally we have at the bottom if you
scroll down we have annotated literature
data where our curators are constantly
looking at the literature and hand
annotating for important articles that
are giving pharmacogenomic information
so two types of data genotype and
phenotype two types of knowledge
pathways and literature curations when
you look at a gene page this is kind of
scientific detail which I don't think
most of you care about but that's the
genome in that big thick bar and all of
those little tick marks that look like
the skyline those are all the locations
in the gene where there's no narrations
in humans and there's a table at the
bottom it tells you the percentages so
for example that first that first snip
is a TA snip you can see at the bottom
left which fifty two percent of the
humans we've looked at have a tea
forty-eight percent have a have an a and
then we gather that data for the entire
genome provide browsing and links which
I'm not going to talk about I should say
that it's very important though to have
the population breakdowns because as I
said before different populations most
populations share all these variations
but their frequencies can be very
different so the right average drug in
Asia might be different from the right
average drug in Africa but of course we
don't do average drugs but if your make
decisions about formularies and what
drugs our country should by then the
frequencies are going to matter the most
exciting thing about pharmgkb is when we
have a genotype for which we also have
one of these little green Phi's and
that's third to last column that green
Phi means that we've measured phenotypes
on people for whom we've also measured
that genotype for that row and that's
what it's all about it's if it's that if
this whole effort is about relating
genotypes two phenotypes then you need
to have a big data set of genotypes that
you've measured and phenotypes that
you've measured on the same people when
you see those green Phi's it means if
you press that you basically get a huge
Excel or SAS spreadsheet which is going
to have each row is going to be a human
which has a bunch of genotypes and then
a bunch of phenotypes and then you can
go to town trying to figure out what's
the functional relationship between
those i should add environment is also
important so if you want if you want to
put it very succinctly phenotype is a
function of genotype plus environment
and what that f is is really what the
name of the game is for the next 10 20
50 years the functional form of that F
and then which genotypes matter which
environmental variables matter so this
is a phenotype file which is not
particularly it's a bunch of
gobbledygook about pharmacology but this
is the exciting table I was telling you
about where each row is a human the
identified of course to get to this data
i should say you have to register and
login which i hate because we want to
disseminate as much information to the
world as possible but we have to protect
the privacy of these patients even
though they're de-identified we want to
make sure we know who sees this data so
we have a lot of information on the site
that you can look at anonymously and
that the google in fact the Googlebot so
the number one hits on many of these
pages but then there's a certain level
of data where we have to ask people to
log in and of course we lose a lot of
people at that point we lose most of the
drug companies for example because they
don't want anybody to know what they're
looking at so if a drug company does
login they download the entire database
so that they can look at what they're
really interested in but nobody can tell
what it was so it
this is just an example of a bunch of
phenotypes each row each column is a
phenotype that's been measured and each
row is is a person and behind that hot
link is the full genotype collection for
that person that's a person circled and
that would be their genotypes which I
don't need to show you of course the
other side of farm against question we
have some gene expression data and we
have a roadmap to kind of integrate that
more tightly in the pharmacogenomic
field there's been remarkably little
data created in in gene expression and
where a lot of times we're driven by the
data that's submitted to us but we we
are seeing an increase in that and so
we're building up for that so right now
we have some i would say modest bud and
the woman for ahead of you into the left
it's my left your right is in charge of
the gene expression effort Tina so we
have drug pages as well because its
genes and drugs so you kind of a very
parallel universe we have the phenotype
data sets pathways very similar
situation links to outside like the
pubchem which you may have heard of
which is a national effort to give drug
information and chemical information
very valuable cuz it saves us a lot of
time of having to download a lot of drug
structures and then we have the
annotations this is the converse list of
genes that are known to be involved in
that drug before I showed you drugs that
were known to be involved with a gene
this is a pathway it's a highly curated
made by scientists who have conference
calls and argue about it until our
curators say enough is enough let's stop
and let's put it up on the web it's a
great user interface for us because
instead of having to type things in you
can look at pictures and click on genes
or drugs and go right into the database
so we have a fairly big effort building
pathways curating them making sure
they're high quality and providing links
to the supporting data we have templated
queries and kind of all the things you
would expect so that users can type in
fill in a blank and we can give them
formatted output meant especially for
them based since we now know what
question they're asking as opposed to
the Google type text box where we
basically give them a list of everything
that was hit
that is scored but we don't really know
what they're thinking whereas here we
kind of know what they're thinking
because they've chosen one of the
templated queries we do all kinds of
search features which nobody ever uses
except like me and the project director
you know a boosting and spelling and
people just type in words and I think
you guys know that better than me we
have almost two thousand registered
users and I'll show you the data for
total users but this is a small fraction
and that that's why I hate it but these
are people who actually want to download
the identify the de-identified
individual data and that's why we have
to keep an audit trail we have about
1300 yes I'll show you but we we opened
in about when we started in two thousand
and had no hits for about four years
because we had no data and then I'll
show you the kind of the hit rate we're
getting about 100 per month and that's
kind of growing so we're happy about
that we have about 1300 manually curated
articles for by our curators we have
primary data on about 613 out of 25,000
human genes so this is very curated i
would i would say especially on kind of
if you're thinking from a google type
perspective 407 drugs that we have
primary data on a total of 74 phenotype
data sets but that's growing pretty
significantly 16 pathways that's growing
and we have about 21,000 people in the
database for whom we have genotype data
and about 9,000 of those also have
phenotype these are our unique IP visits
per month you know this is the most
intimidating slide to give to this crowd
I have to say so we're getting about 30
to 40 thousand unique IP addresses per
month and you know you guys got about
500 million a day I don't know so you
know give me a break but you can see
that when we started getting data in
late o 3 we had a big rise in hits and
then there was you know there's always
these drop there was a drop but then we
released a new set of features and I'm
we're hopeful that we're now back on a
growth curve or at least up around
thirty thirty-five thousand if you look
at other biological databases the most
successful is genbank which holds the
raw DNA sequence data
they are used by all biologists
everywhere every day and they get
400,000 unique visitors a day and so I
think that's an upper bound on what we
could ever do because we're a subset of
the biologists who care about drugs and
stuff so you can do your own calculation
but an upper bound is at least is about
400,000 a day and i would say probably a
40,000 a day which means we have at
least an order of magnitude of growth
that i could expect to happen and not be
surprised I would be disappointed if we
stayed constant here and I would be not
surprised if we went up by an order of
magnitude in the next four or five years
two years whatever this is our user
profiles as you expect since it's a
public effort it's mostly educational
the other is all educational from non-us
sites so it's really 50 plus 20 it's
really seventy percent educational maybe
sixty five percent and then 23% dot-com
as you know in fact I learned on my last
visit to Google was in that other place
down on 101 it was a cozy little shack
and this is much bigger so
congratulations but one of the things
that we can do just like you do is we
can look at what people actually type
into the search boxes to figure out what
they care about and so it's marketing
research for us and for 13 month period
or whatever the remember what the period
was these are exact text matches and of
course you could get much better
statistics if you do spelling errors and
stuff but this gives us a sense of what
the community of users wants and that's
great for us because then we can say how
are we doing on searches for these drugs
these diseases these genes we are
entering a new phase now where people
can now measure all the snips in an
entire genome whereas for the last five
years it was much more focused so we're
having to build kind of chromosome level
browsing capabilities question
yeah so for those 21,000 people we
probably have an average of only 20 to
50 snips each but in the next three
months we're going to be starting to get
300 400 thousand snips per individual so
there's going to literally be this
qualitative and quantitative jump
because of the technologies that a theme
ettrick seeeeee alumina pearl engine
which is right down the street there's
this quantum leap and we hope to be the
first or if not one of the first I'm
hoping the first database that can
accept that data and vend it out to the
public and our team is working very hard
writing code to parse those binaries
display them in fact that's exactly what
I'm showing here you'll be able to look
at a chromosome we will label all the
regions of the chromosome for which we
have data today it's only three because
we have low throughput data but then
we'll show segments of the genome with
little tick mark showing all the g did
snips where they are what the
frequencies are and so we're about to
enter a very exciting time I have a
little blog this is not this is in beta
but I made my own little blog which is
news items and it's the amazing thing
about Google is you guys found it and
made it my number one hit on my name in
like two days before I even announced it
so way to go so in return we used google
groups as our key way for a technical
support with our various users and stuff
and so there's a beta google beta google
groups i knows in beta and we're also
using it for own beta a technical
discussion group just set that up on
last week now i just want to finish up
talking about some opportunities in a
vague way i don't have a plan but i want
to do this group to hear about this so
first of all one of the things that
drives pharmacogenomics is two things
getting drugs that will work better and
not using drugs that will cause adverse
events and there's been a lot of press
about adverse events recently there was
a study out of a blue-ribbon panel that
said 60,000 preventable diseases in the
United States a year because of drug
errors if you look at the most common
drug a dr's as adverse drug reaction so
it's like an adverse event due to taking
a drug the three most common are heart
arrhythmias
and QT prolongation is a technical or
but it's basically arrhythmias from
drugs that mess with your conduction
system of your heart liver responses
that are fulminant and bad and severe
dermatological rashes those are the
three most common I'll tell you how I
know that in a second and there are many
other minor ones some of you may have
had some of these when you took your
favorite drug rash stomachache dry mouth
drowsiness headache the united states
food and drug administration is charged
with tracking these because they're
charged with then going back to the drug
companies and saying hey we got a
problem we're finding a lot of reports
of your drugs causing trouble and they
haven't the a ers the adverse event
reporting system where they get four
hundred and two thousand four they had
420,000 adverse events reported which
they estimated a are totally biased by
the people who actually like making
these reports and there's lots of people
who don't do it and this is at no more
than four percent or five percent of
total adverse reactions because it's
kind of a pain a health care worker a
pharmacist a doctor and nurse has say oh
you have a bad effect I think it's from
the drug let me fill out this form and
fax it to the FDA they don't even have
an online system yet okay based on this
FDA scientists look at these four
hundred twenty thousand adverse event
reports I have no idea how they do this
that they're a little bit but they have
a way to do it I don't know what it is
but they generate about 600 studies a
year saying we look at this drug and we
think we better think about modifying
the label of this drug because we're
seeing adverse events here that are not
listed and that the world needs to know
about and then these 600 reports are
done by forty scientists working at the
FDA doing these studies and you can even
find it by using google now the great
thing is they this is all d identified
and so they make it absolutely public so
you can go to their website you can
download all four hundred twenty
thousand reports from 2004 and for a
number of other years back and what you
get is patient demography what basic
like gender age I don't know if they
have ethnic background some of the drugs
they were taking what
happened that was bad why they were
taking the drug in the first place
whatever happened to the patient the
outcome some dates and and a few other
things so pretty minimal report but very
very valuable I'm mentioning this
because I'm just going to leave it out
there that I think there are ways for
FDA maybe pharmgkb and Google to partner
to do a much better job at tracking drug
events adverse drug events in the
population and potentially really
accelerate the time to when we see the
event in statistical fashion come up
with a research plan for addressing it
and then hopefully changing the world in
terms of how that drug is used in the
events that it causes so I'm just
throwing that out there because i was
thinking boy you know they're not doing
a great job at capturing these and think
about how many you guys probably know
how many people type in drug names
because they've just vomited they just
took their first dose of a drug and they
won't say huh let me type it into google
and see if this is a known effect and
there's a moment there when addition to
giving them information we could
potentially do stuff that would help the
population in a so there's the idea we
have done some this is just a finish up
we are interested in data mining
ourselves or an informatics lab and one
of the things we recently published was
a scan of the medical literature for
pharmacogenetics articles so which
articles should i tell my curators or
ask I don't tell my curators anything
should I ask my curators to annotate
right now they have a very large pallet
of 15 million articles to kind of
consider so we wrote a machine learning
algorithm that was actually quite
accurate at picking out articles based
on word usage so it's a statistical
natural language processing it didn't do
any language models or anything like
that and we picked up about 5,000
pharmacogenomics articles that when we
did a subset of them manually kind of
checked we had about a ninety two
percent agreement with our curators so
pretty good definitely has a screening
method for finding articles and we're
just updating that now so we'll have an
updated list and that allowed us to kind
of do things like create a web resource
where you type in a drug and we tell you
all the
genes that have ever been mentioned in
the context of that drug in an article
that we think is about pharmacogenomics
and I let you read that article if you
find that useful so I want to have some
questions and stuff so I want to stop
thank the team Terry Klein is here today
and she's the director we have some of
the curators here some of the technical
staff it's nicer to look at their
pictures so I'll stop and we can take
some questions hope I give you a flavor
for what we're trying to do Thanks yes
question is how clean is our data the
genotype data which is the variation
position of the DNA is extremely clean
because we have written a lot of quality
control both automatic code for like we
take in an XML and we do a lot of
syntactic as well as semantic validation
and our curators look at it yeah yes the
people who generate the data are working
pretty hard to have high-quality data
because since we're relatively low
throughput or have been there's been a
premium on becoming the site known for
good data and so they have social
mechanisms and social pressures on them
to do a good job because they use this
data then published papers that are
peer-reviewed and appears take a look at
it very closely and so the sword the
best source of data for quality control
is the fact that sometimes people
measure the same thing in two different
labs and then the concordance is quite
good and that gives us confidence that
these people are collecting quality data
so when they i would say that five
percent of our data has been collected
by two different groups so it's not the
majority of it but it's enough to get a
statistically reasonable sample for
doing concordance analysis now
phenotypes are much harder because
everybody measures them differently and
the only quality control they are again
is the peer review process getting the
paper published and having people say I
don't like the way you measure blood
pressure I reject this paper so that's
the primary pressure there again there's
nothing we can do technically we have
we're relying on these other sources for
quality control this kind of tongue in
cheek but how many give it all the data
that already exists you have any
intuition for how many but PhD theses
are out there that would require no more
work in the wet lab just it's just a
matter of integrating data from all
these different sources to make a new
discovery that we didn't know before
well there are probably on the order of
a thousand PhD candidates in biomedical
informatics around the country right now
most of whom don't generate primary data
themselves but have collaborations or
use publicly available so I think
there's a sense there's a sense that
there's a lot of data and a lot of
discoveries to be made on the other hand
clever biologists every day generate new
experiments that are smaller and faster
so it's even better than the scenario
that you're painting because in addition
to a lot of undiscovered stuff for
mining I think that the we're really on
the beginning exponential of clever
biologists generating large large
datasets there's now an ethic and
biology that if you can do it why not do
it fast and small and in high-throughput
and that puts people who do informatics
in a very good mood so I'm quite um
bullish on informatics you have people's
genome even though it's D personalizes
of death it
concerned that's like a fingerprint that
you can find the person says when they
have seizures and everything else yes so
thank you very much this is one of those
beautiful moments on your next slide so
you only need 60 to 100 snips I told you
we have about a million snips each you
only need about 60 or 100 of them to be
a unique fingerprint so this DNA even
though I've removed your name and
address and social security number if I
get a piece of your DNA I can very
cheaply figure out if you're in the farm
gkb or not so there's 20,000 people who
when they signed a disclosure basically
took that risk and we're very grateful
for that but there is a worry about
genetic databases in general and it's
one of the reasons we have that password
step for getting to that identifiable
it's not identified and it's might not
even be identifiable but it's risky
personalized data there's definitely
some risk there and I'll just tell you a
story and I wrote I've written about
this basically there's a trade-off
between what you need to do research and
what you need to guarantee privacy and
their attention but you may have heard
about a month ago two months ago a a
teenager in the UK who would so here's
the story father donate sperm
anonymously 15 years ago teen 15 years
later is interested in his heritage teen
and UK uses a commercial kit to Jake
variations in his Y chromosome okay y
chromosome you get that from your father
not mom doesn't have any say in the Y
chromosome there's a company that has a
website that if you say you'll make your
Y chromosome information available
they'll let you see other people who
have also made their Y chromosome
available so the kid is smart and he
says you know what the only there's two
things I inherited from my father his Y
chromosome and I would have inherited
his last name if I knew what it was so
he goes into this database and he finds
two men who have a very similar Y
chromosome and they both have the same
last name he doesn't know who these guys
are but he says I bet my father had that
last name or a version of that last name
he knew his father's age and he knew his
father's the part of the country where
he came from so he combined this with
some voter records or some VMV
equivalent records cause his father up
he says hi dad I'm your sperm donor
child 15 years old this happens in the
news on November third so I used to talk
about this
and have to make up these are you know
hypotheticals and this kid saved me a
lot of time so there is no doubt that
you can link multiple databases if
you're clever and if you have any access
to genetic information and then you can
do some or redundant fake identification
we identification can be going down to a
single person but it can also be
narrowing it down to a relatively small
group of people which could be just as
damaging so this is a concern and we
wound up writing a lot about this
because if we ignore this problem it
could bring down the entire genomic
research all you need is one bad thing
to happen you know worse than this and
then Congress has no more genetic
databases and then I'm out of business
then i'm applying to google for a job so
thank you for the question so this is a
risk but this is an acceptable risk yes
so that we do our best to de-identify
when people register we make sure that
they have bona fide research questions
they can be industrial industri is no
problem academic but like hotmail
accounts not like why do you want to see
this data then we have course have the
weblog so we know who has seen or at
least at the IP level and and Owen since
we have since they login we actually
know who they are who saw data and so if
we get into trouble we could roll back
some of that data and figure out you
know if the judge asks us we could
figure out and then we find ourselves an
exact same position that you guys have
found yourself in regional recently so
we have written about it we've publicly
declared it we have a trillion usage
policies that when you register you have
to agree to and there's a sense that
we've done due diligence but I would
never claim that we're bulletproof yes
so you actually see snips throughout
both coding DNA and the so-called junk
DNA in fact the junk DNA has a little
bit more because they it's less
sensitive in some sense it's if it's not
coding for a protein it can tolerate
these variations you know a random
cosmic ray hits your ovum or your sperm
a dna-based flips and nobody cares
because it's not a critical part of the
genome whereas if you hit a critical
part you might be very sensitive so the
rate of snips tends to go down in in
regions that are very important and that
have been conserved over many billions
of years or millions of years yes there
are snips that correlate very beautiful
with phenotypes and those snips are
hanging out in the middle of nowhere we
have no idea why that snip is
correlating with the phenotype we care
about it just shows you how much biology
we still need to figure out it probably
isn't junk is the answer question the
back
one more you may be alluded to this with
your adverse event reporting better can
you think of ways I mean expand the
client base from even 400,000 for you
bite like what's the the ultimate number
of users so the ultimate number of users
is all the people in the face of the
earth are genotyped and that information
is used responsibly by their various
health care systems to do optimal
medical decision right so six billion
people on earth six billion data files
with all of their genotypes and enough
phenotype information to make
predictions for all of them and say use
these drugs use those drugs and then of
course you need a delivery mechanism I
kind of alluded to that it's a challenge
in America it would certainly be a
challenge in Zimbabwe or in my South
Africa and so that's the big challenge
there's an issue of how who carries
around the genotype is it centralized
certainly the healthcare providers need
access to the data but does it get stuck
on a chip on your tooth do you carry
around it on a card is it in the central
government database these are as you can
imagine very excite is it on Google with
a password as long as you don't give
your google passwords anybody your
genotype is safe so these are very
interesting kind of sociological
discussions society hasn't made a
decision the societies that have
centralized medical facilities have an
obvious default answer which is let's
put it in with the rest of this stuff we
don't have that in the United States and
so I've written a little bit about a
distributed patient controlled system
where the genotype is measured but then
you're in control of it it's you know
there's a public/private key
infrastructure is in place and for any
individual healthcare provider you can
say go ahead and use my genotype and for
a researcher like me you can say you
know what I think pharmgkb is a good
thing you may have my genotype and
phenotype data for research please use
it responsibly and I trust you will
because I've read about you and I can I
trust you that kind of infrastructure it
really is technically not that for you
know that's within reach and it's really
a lot of sociological agreement that we
need to get that to happen or somebody
to do it and just do it well and say
look this is a good thing any questions
yes yep so the question I'm sorry i
haven't been repeating the question the
question was the genotypes of cancer
cells can be different from the genotype
of the host that's absolutely the case
in fact one of the causes of cancer is a
rearrangement or messing up of the DNA
which creates multiple copies of genes
missing copies of genes or mutations or
polymorphisms snips in those jeans and
so it is of great interest so sequence
those and in fact yes the National
Cancer Institute has a project called
the Cancer Genome Project where their
sequence anut humans butt kicks cancers
from humans we also interested in that
data you can use all the same
measurement technology you just have to
remember that it's not from a normal
blood cell it's from an abnormal cancer
cell a big issue there is the number of
copies of a gene terms that that's one
of the big things that happens in cancer
you get extra copies and so the fine
balance that's established in a normal
cell is messed up because you have ten
copies of one gene and so it over does
it's overeager and it just causes the
cell problems so let me stop here since
it's noon and thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
