agenda for you so let's kick it off
another reminder that we're live
streaming and recording if you forgot
from yesterday just remember that you
may show up on videos somehow need to
get that of the way I wanted to give a
little background on our logo as well
our logos actually have some thought put
into them so we wanted to get a
explanation from the designers I thought
it might be interesting to showcase how
the logo came about each year and this
year we they actually put a lot of
thought into the colors to represent the
Google colors and show what everything
that Google stands for there's also a
emphasis on the site we hold it so they
wanted to incorporate a little
background about Sunnyvale and what the
location it is so I wonder what next
year's logo is going to look like we'll
see all right little stats on
registration we had over 1400 attendee
applications out of which we chose a
little over 250 of those to actually
attend in person so you all are among
that group that we narrowed down we have
and actually as scientific process as we
can get out of this there's some random
selection and waiting based on getting a
diverse crowd representing different
geographic areas backgrounds history in
the industry we got a number of factors
that we plug into it to dry and get a
great overview of the industry so
everyone here can share ideas take it
back to the company's you
from and showcase those ideas but for
the people who couldn't come we of
course have the live stream we present
all this information out there in the
world for free so hello to everybody on
the live stream thanks for watching this
is great now that I'm on YouTube I
finally have done something my daughter
can be proud of she knows she knows what
that means and 208 speaker proposals
which we also had to narrow down by a
similar process to get just the great
overview that we've had so far and that
will have today of different types of
challenges that are going on in the
industry and things everybody is dealing
with so I'm glad we could talk about
that another great thing we were able to
do this year is to provide diversity
scholarships for people who may not have
been able to come otherwise we had we
put up a notice for applications for
that Google put up the funding for that
to be able to include those people as
well we had an overwhelming response to
that 273 some scholarship submissions we
originally had budgeted for six
scholarships but just out of the
overwhelming number of applications we
got we asked Google for more money
they're used to people asking for more
money and we were able to get that and
double the number we were able to
provide this year so that's been great
okay a reminder about lunch we I think
yesterday went pretty well but everybody
kind of has a system down you know what
lunch is all about so here's a reminder
of the cafe's again over here we have
cornerstone with their local menu we
have fresh market which has the big
salad bar and sandwiches in TC 1 and
then TC for is the one the big area with
all the variety of options so what we're
going to do for lunch today here's the
other options
40 °c for what we're going to do today
is will have three organizing members
outside here at lunchtime they're going
to have signs they'll be holding up
similar to what Ari is holding up in the
back there so it'll look at it don't
worry he won't Club anybody with that
that's it's only for for illustrative
purposes but we'll have signs up with
each cafe if you're interested in
specific cafe find the person with that
sign and they will be leading the group
to that building and letting you in for
lunch another reminder about the
question page on the live stream if you
have questions please submit using a sly
do app that we have use the event ID
gtech 2016 to ask your questions we are
trying to achieve a balance between
staying on schedule + getting enough
questions answered you know after each
talk and making sure everybody gets
questioned answered and staying on track
it's a tricky balance trying to to
manage that in real time but that's what
we're trying to achieve so don't feel
badly if your question doesn't get
answered the benefit of being at the
conference's then you can go up to that
speaker specifically and say hey I was
wondering about such and such you know
my question didn't get answered I'd like
to talk about it one thing feedback we
have gotten though is that we don't have
a way for questions that didn't get
answered to be archived and answer later
which is one thing we'll need to look
into for next year I think that is all I
had trying to stay on schedule myself
and the other things
I want to announce we will have the
real-time translation going on here over
here if there's anybody who has a need
for it and didn't know that we are
providing it on the screen over here go
ahead and make a seat if anybody does
need this service and you're sitting in
a seat they might need in order to be in
front of the screen please give up your
seat for that and all speakers don't
forget to check in with the audio team
in the back before you talked during the
break or if you know your talk is
upcoming go get Mike tup for your talk
so that you're ready to go on time and
today we'll try to keep it on time and i
think i'm doing well i think i'm ahead
of time so since I'm ahead of time I did
not get any more emails from my mom but
that's okay because we now have google
assistant so i can just add google is
not making technology to replace moms
that's not it's not the intention but we
do have the assistant you might have
heard of so i can have a assistant how
how am i doing today so it says i have
no friends but that's that's actually
correct that's a correct answer that's a
valid response so it's working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
