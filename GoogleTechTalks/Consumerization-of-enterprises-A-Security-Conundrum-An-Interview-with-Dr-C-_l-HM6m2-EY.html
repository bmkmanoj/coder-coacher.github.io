see van a leading expert from forrester
about cloud computing and security thank
you dr. Wang thank you one of the things
I wanted to ask you about is cloud
computing there is a lot of buzz about
cloud computing your thoughts on cloud
computing and its applicability to
applicability to businesses so we
actually written extensively about cloud
computing and its relevance to
enterprise businesses our position is
cloud computing is is a great tool for
extending your businesses extending your
enterprise computing for the reason that
capacity planning and you know that to
balance time to market with the the
planning of resources internally to do
it entirely internally in this global
economies is very difficult so utilizing
cloud computing or third party service
providers to augment your resource
planning augment your time to market
pressure is a great business tool got it
in terms of business adoption where do
you think the market is and what
technical factors will help the adoption
bro so we talked a little bit today in
my talk about consumerization of
enterprises one of the major factors I
think for cloud computing to be more
widely adopted by businesses is to
support enterprise management needs such
as control of data control policies
being able to give businesses visibility
of activities and confidence that their
policies are being enforced today data
is being kept confidential and their
service level agreement is being met got
it and among the many IT services that
customers can adopt one of the things
that we hear from our customers is email
security archiving or ease events for
the IT organization to show how cloud
computing can benefit them mm-hmm your
thoughts on do you see this trend or do
you see the next set of things
absolutely i think i think email
security is a no-brainer
so I have customers a large financial
services firm gets 15 million emails a
day and over 14 million of which is pure
junk right so why do you even need to
put a an on-premise server and process
that 14 million messages although you
know most of them you probably do very
quick processing but you still have to
accommodate the computing resources to
do that and it's not just enough to 14
million this year next year maybe 18
million so you have to continue to
invest more resources on premise to deal
with the capacity problem so this is one
of the very straightforward business
issues I think an outsourced to a cloud
computing service provider got it and we
have nearly 40,000 businesses do that
and I think this is we see that as a
trend what are your thoughts on
archiving or then apps that are
different and email security archiving
is slightly more complex because email
security in most times like like I said
14 million of junk email you're dealing
with things you don't want the first
place right archiving presumably you
archiving content that you want right so
you care about how well these these data
is being preserved the Integrity's being
insured and the way you can access it or
do it ediscovery policies for instance
you can your cloud computing provider I
can enforce that for you and all these
requirements are slightly more complex
just saying please get rid of unwanted
emails for me so archiving while it's a
little bit more complex it's again it's
it's a great application I think to
think about outsourcing because you may
be a company that is in the business of
providing
quite an entrance them but financial
service online banking again and you're
really not and an archiving expert yeah
you don't have a team of experts running
your storage services for archiving
purposes right so you may want to think
about bringing external company that
that who does this as their business
that's what they do every day right they
are in better position to understand the
best practices for archiving for
enforcing the privacy security of
content and I think it's while it's a
little bit more complex than that email
security it's still a war file
proposition got it shifting a topic
little bit we talked about technology
and services focusing on the users we
talk in terms of consumer users and
business users isn't this distinction
sort of going away aren't we all
consumer users and business users at the
same time yes so we are you and I are
both consumers of some consumer
applications we also business users
while today they're still you know I see
myself having different roles business
users i use business applications and
and as a consumer I use different set of
applications primarily because those
applications are separate and they
provide me disparate experiences while
that is still the case today I see the
line blurring you know many people using
iphone today to access business emails
and this is just an example of consumer
technologies increasingly being used for
business purposes so when you're using
an iphone are you the consumer or are
you the business user right so so
there's not a clear division there and I
see this line increasingly getting
blurry
and as as we talked about today in my in
my talk I think the vision the eventual
vision is that they can sue that the
distinction between consumer a business
user is going to disappear got it now as
you know as a recommendation to Google
as we expand our focus on users to
include all types of users what would be
your recommendation to our product team
on key factors to focus on to get our
applications adopted by more business
users or users in working in enterprises
key factors you mean features that the
product features by framework you talked
about policy management security mm-hmm
in addition to that all their things
that we should be spending more time on
those are areas that we are spending
time on today okay but all their things
that comes to your mind that our product
team should say you should take care of
this so we talked about policy
management we talked about security
right so one of the things we talked
about doing the talk is identity
management and I think one of the very
difficult things is identity management
for you're talking about cloud computing
right if you are a service provider you
typically don't have visibility into
people's corporate directories and I
have clients who have 20 service
providers and their users have to have
different user accounts to access these
service providers this is ridiculous
right so why do I have to do this with
you know keeping different smart car is
different USB keys to access different
services this has to be more seamless so
one i won my pet peeves is the cloud
community service providers have to be
have to give the more seamless
experience to business users so I use
you know post a nice email service
should be exactly same as he is my
outlook shouldn't be shouldn't be a
disparate experience got it thank you
dr. Tom chintzy man and appreciate you
I'm and at me a guitar and there was a
great interview that's it for us thank
you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
