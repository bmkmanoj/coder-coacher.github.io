privilege and opportunity to come speak
to an audience like this I actually
personally will admit that I am NOT a
scientist and don't know a lot about
science and so I'm sort of of the
audience that that would also be
interested in learning more about how I
guess you think of yourselves and your
work and what type of role you see
either the public or people who use
social media or people in general sort
of making better use of the information
and the ideas and the thoughts that you
guys generate and half I think that
there's a really interesting opportunity
there to build out conversations over
time and so what I figured I'd talk
about today and I'll tell you a little
bit more about myself in a second is
actually I guess presenting a few
experiences that I've had using social
media over time so you know I don't I
don't presume that any of you know who I
am I joined Google about a year and a
half ago prior to that I work for myself
doing consulting in social media working
in design and open source communities so
i'm actually not an engineer you know
one of those few people at Google that
sort of got through the door by
pretending to be one on the internet but
they apparently didn't Google me but uh
I've worked in sort of open distributed
communities for quite a while I helped
start a community event model called
barcamp in 2005 and I've also worked on
another project called co-working about
creating independent work spaces for
mostly knowledge workers and
independents and designers and so on
I've you take a look at these things
you'll sort of like learn more about
them but these are some projects that
I've been involved with that ultimately
spread around the world and that a lot
of other people sort of picked up and
carried forward even after I'd moved on
to sort of subsequent projects and so I
think there are some lessons and those
things but what I actually want to talk
about today are three things related to
my past experience so let me talk about
spread Firefox essentially the initial
marketing of the Firefox web browser
hashtags this concept called
generativity show to be in with the
spread Firefox project is sort of an
interesting one how many of you guys use
firefox today okay it's pretty good have
a chrome actually I should ask that
question okay I'm not gonna ask the
other question because you need to
switch safaris okay it's built on web
kits that's cool and that's open source
but so the spread Firefox project
actually sort of got an interesting
start back in 2003-2004 so I went to
school in Pittsburgh at Carnegie Mellon
and I got a degree in design and so I
moved out to San Francisco after I
graduated and you know decided that that
I wanted to sort of get involved in
something to do something and so at the
time I was reading these these like
Mozilla blogs because I was a web
designer on the side and firefox is one
of these few projects that actually was
building a browser that got web
standards and what did web standards
correctly whereas the competition at the
time did not and so I was really excited
that it actually a browser that sort of
moved the web board and created this
platform that people could build better
and richer applications on so this post
was by this guy Stephen Garrity who runs
a company in Canada called silver orange
and silver orange was doing a lot of web
design for Mozilla at the time and you
know I was reading his blog because I
was subscribed to his podcast and you
know I read this post where he was
calling out for designers design
volunteers basically for this
open-source project and it seemed you
know there was like nope a bad hours you
know it was like yeah timelines were
short you know all the things that
designers look for a good project I was
like how could I resist this this is
like made for me so I sent him an email
and said sure you know sign me up like
you know I'm willing to help out so we
sort of like got this little cabal of
people together and we sort of like sort
of brainstorming ideas and stuff like
that now the other thing that sort of
relevant to point out this is sort of
like what got me into working
the Mozilla project but that back in
like two thousand four you know the
aesthetic of Mozilla was one that was
very come community oriented and and so
for some reason I couldn't help but be
drawn to this aesthetic you know it was
sort of like putting a flag out there
and saying you know this is kind of what
we're about and you know for what it's
worth of course being an open source
project these guys were crazy about
sharing their source code and at the
time it was crazy and so of course you
would think of them as being aligned
with former fascist regimes but the
interesting thing is that you know they
sort of carried through this aesthetic
over time and they they actually owned
it so even though there was like you
know a lot of people in the business
world would like you know call them
Communists and so on they were like well
hell yeah like that's kind of what this
is all about right I mean this is a
their 1999 invite release party
invitation or whatever and you know you
can see sort of like the symbolism there
very clearly depicting like hey you know
this is this is who we are and of course
you know on the other hand Microsoft was
sort of seen as the the alternative and
and so it created this this really
interesting I guess attention you know
that the people kind of like started to
realize was like you know actually this
is something real is going on like
there's this huge big company and
they're making this product and if
they've kind of like they've forgotten
us you know we are we are the web
designers and we are like the web
developers and we are creating the next
generation web and they basically make
our lives a living hell out of em you
have done any like web design but if you
ever try to like test and build stuff
for internet explorer or six it's just a
losing battle in fact you know I can
probably say these things now because
even microsoft says you know stop using
that browser it's not a good browser
it's not the right product you should be
using anymore but what was interesting
you know at the time is that Firefox
sort of tapped into that very sort of
like you know rich vein I guess in a
gold sense where there was this pent-up
angst this desire for something better
this desire to move things forward
Microsoft and like Bill Gates it sort of
said you know the web's the future the
road ahead and all that and then they
kind of like forgot about and they were
like active
you know do that and I think that left a
lot of people feeling kind of like
bummed that they dropped the ball and so
anyways this this sort of led to this
great opportunity to create this tension
between these two characters so Mozilla
was was in effect kind of creating like
the sports team for like the Nerds on
the web it was like this is the team
that you wanted to rally behind this was
like you know I don't know if it's I
mean I come from New England so maybe
it's the Red Sox and the Yankees or
something but you know you finally had a
team that sort of got you that
understood where you came from you know
as someone who used the web or you know
we're in forums or using IRC and so on
like Mozilla was of that ilk and had
that sort of genetic influence and so
people could relate to it and it was a
story that they they felt really
passionate about now it's also worth
pointing out that back in the day there
had been no commercial like open source
i should say no consumer open source
successes really open source was really
the realm of servers of back-end systems
linux and the like and so when you talk
to people about open source so like oh
yeah like that's what stuff that no one
knows how to use and they'd be right so
this idea that there was gonna be this
open source browser that you know
anybody beyond sort of like the geek
kids would use was was crazy not to
mention the fact that they would ever
finish it because open source is never
done but even though people didn't
really expect it to happen november two
thousand for firefox one point oh of
course was released and you know this is
this is basically the the post that sort
of describes it and you know i mean even
here like you know coming out with his
consumer release they've got like the
dirigible up in the left-hand corner and
stuff I mean they hadn't really gotten
the marketing thing down and so or maybe
they had but but it does it wasn't
actually going across the chasm to the
broader audience that needed to be
reached in order for this thing to be a
success to basically reintroduce
competition into the web marketplace so
part of my role in this and part of the
team that was created after that Stephen
Garrity posed was essentially this this
group called spread Firefox and so we we
launch this site that basically looked
like this
that was built upon an open source CMS
called Drupal and in fact it was a very
specific instance of Drupal which was
built on the software called civic space
and civic space came out of a Howard
Dean presidential campaign so the same
software that was used to organize
Howard Dean's unfortunately failed
presidential campaign you know which was
if you remember was sort of like the
precedent for Obama's campaign in terms
of activating the grassroots you know
marketplace we use the same software the
same ideas the same techniques to market
Firefox and so you can start to see how
like the shift around social media
what's happening in 2004 and that
Mozilla success in a large degree is
because of their early recognition and
adoption of the the techniques of sort
of community conversations so if we
actually look at the the posts that sort
of launched spread Firefox I think
there's some interesting things to pull
out here because these things can still
be relevant today if you're to launch
something today and use these words you
might be able to at least start off in
the right direction so in this case you
know welcome to spread Firefox you are
our marketing department like those
words right they're kind of like set the
tone it's like we need you we can't do
this alone and in fact we're going to
fail if you don't get involved you know
yadda yadda will provide the tools but
you will drive campaigns that will be
rolled out here over the coming months
so this is the the convening place this
is where we want you to come back to to
learn about what each other is working
on we are going to create this
environment but it's up to you guys to
actually you know bring the party and
bring the beer if you know what I mean
it's going to be your music on the
turntable as spread Firefox will
coordinate a series of volunteer efforts
to promote Firefox run campaigns to
focus our communities energy on very
tangible specific goals so these are
also some important things it was very
specific it was like these are not going
to be just sort of like abstract like
lets you know convince the world or
doing these things there was plenty of
those were like platitudes but when it
got down to it the the most successful
campaigns were the ones that were
time-bound specific concrete that gave
people something that they could do you
know we laid out a bunch of shovels and
we said we're going to take a four-foot
hole and then we did it and then we
celebrated it and then we dug another
hole
over again do we get to China or
something and so the first campaign that
we did was actually to get to a million
downloads of the Firefox pre-released
this is before the one point I even came
out and we wanted to do it in 10 days so
this wasn't like two months this wasn't
like a year like 10 days we get it done
or we go home and you know back in the
day I don't know if you guys have heard
about this sort of like buzz buzz word
now about gamification but we were doing
it way back then where you would get a
point for everybody that downloaded
firefox from one of the links that you
put on your blog or your site or you're
aware as site or your porn site or
whatever turns out that porn sites were
very good at promoting Firefox those
little own little little known facts you
know it's the whole anyways um we heard
about the stats in the last talk right
so so anyways so so we would basically
acknowledge your contribution as small
as getting like even you know you or
your mom your dad or your brother your
sister to click on a link you would get
some recognition and we would put you
basically on the homepage of this site
and so now people had a way of being
recognized for their contributions and
there was all sorts of gaming and
spamming and also that stuff that went
on but that meant that it was working so
it's also sort of important to keep that
in mind that this is like an organic
system where we needed people to
actually be involved and so there had to
be these abuses that would occur and
though he would just adjust like any
organized system does so the whole game
here you know in terms of like you know
getting the number of points and sort of
getting up to the the leaderboard and so
on was really predicated on the notion
of just spreading this little button and
you know it's a little hard to read but
it basically says take back the web and
so you would see these buttons pop up
all over the place and this is this is
how we launched a campaign to basically
take back the web with Firefox we also
did a number of other things though
where we put out these different calls
for volunteers so we created lots of
different ways for people to own parts
of the project in a way that allowed for
people with different skill sets to to
be involved so it wasn't just you know
we want engineers we want you know
marketers it was like whoever you are if
you can type and you have a browser or
even if you don't we've got something
for you you know we will have a very
small
all very lightweight shovel or a very
you know gold-plated heavy shovel
whatever it is we want you to be
involved and so it was very important
that we thought through all those
different ways and different people that
would be coming to us to give them all
something to do in fact we even had
eight different teams that were sort of
mostly actually run by volunteers
through the community where they could
self identify self selects and fines for
their tribe that gave them something to
do and some way to contribute and so it
was that personal hook that made this
work relevant to them and made them keep
coming back over and over again because
they now had a shared outcome or goal
that gave them a reason to sort of hang
out together like this is one of the
things that I think people don't often
understand about Twitter it's like
Twitter is full of dumb stuff because
you don't know the people you're you
know reading half the time but if
Twitter was full of all the people that
you knew you know the people you did
hang out with your colleagues you know
or people that you admire or whatever
all of a sudden Twitter becomes much
more relevant and then it is relevant
that so and so had you know Cheerios for
breakfast or whatever if they're doing
it wrong and tweeting about what they're
having for breakfast because you're like
oh hey I saw you had Cheerios for
breakfast I did too we have something in
common and I feel so much more connected
to another human being and that's
basically how it works I mean that's the
whole point of twitter right there it's
like so you don't feels alone on the
internet because you know the Internet's
a very lonely place all right so so
anyways so we had these different ways
for people to get involved all these
different touch points all these
different like surface areas that would
allow people to come and join us and we
sort of created this model where we
wanted to be able to understand kind of
like you know Maslow's hierarchy of
needs but applied to like you know
spreading Firefox where there were
people like oh well you don't have the
browser Wow first thing you got to get
the browser so we'll give you the
browser and then the second thing is
like okay well you know we'll start
getting you into our casual community
where you start having problems and you
start blaming Firefox for your computer
crashing and you know Excel doesn't
launch and it doesn't add numbers
correctly that's firefox problem so we
start getting you into the community in
the forums that way and then once you're
in there you're like oh these people are
kind of nice then we start moving you
into deeper and deeper levels of
commitment you know possibly not unlike
a church but whatever
there's sort of a religious you know
vibe of without this whole thing but it
was really thinking about those those
sort of expertise levels all right
giving people like steps you know like I
know if you guys have ever played like
you know Mario Brothers right we'll go
way back just just to make sure sorry
that's not how I meant it I just mean
it's very general that's way back I mean
anyway so the point is just about
everybody there are a few exceptions but
just about everybody can usually save
the princess on the first level I mean
that's usually I mean if you can pick up
the controller and you sort of throw it
around a little bit you might be able to
figure it out and the reason is so that
you want to go to the next level you
know it's not about the first level it's
not about how easy the first level is
it's about getting the second level and
then on and on and on so in a similar
way we need to create those levels of
engagement so that people didn't feel
put off when they first got there like
they have to like check out the colonel
and I compile it all this stuff it's
like fact I work sorry and so so another
way to sort of like think about this is
to think about sort of like like an atom
where you have these people who are sort
of in the and by the way again I'm not a
scientist and I study the stuff in like
sixth grade so there's probably wrong
but you know yeah he's like valence
things you know these orbits or whatever
I think those are the right words and
there's electrons and neutrons and you
know poles anyways the point is at the
outer layers you have a very sort of
weak attraction these are the people
that sort of like accidentally see a
button and accidentally click it because
they're like when to close the browser
and the button is like in the right
place or whatever that's like really
really weak you know they'll probably
just fly off and go to like some other
atoms somewhere else like the next vlog
or something however as you move further
and further in you start to create like
a stronger gravitational pull towards
the center and that's what you really
want to be thinking about is how can you
move those people who are outliers and
who really don't care that much about
whether you live or breathe to the inner
layers where they start to care more and
more and they become more activated and
then you sort of spit up your
gravitational pull and you eventually go
from adam to a whole planet I don't know
how that stuff works you guys can tell
me later but like you get the idea so
you're constantly pulling people into
the center and it's because you're
involving them personally in the story
you're giving them something to do in
fact we're the great things about the
Firefox story again sort of this hero's
journey thing is that people could tell
us the story of Firefox
to just about anybody you know the the
grandkid could go and install it in
their grandmother's computer and the
grandmother can not tell the story about
how the grandkid installed this browser
and it solved all of her computer
problems and that's a personal story
that she can then tell someone else her
you know a bridge you know this this
worked for me and I have a personal
connection to how I got this thing and
it came through a trusted source and so
therefore you should do it too and
that's that's mostly how that
word-of-mouth marketing kind of worked
before there was Twitter really before
there was Facebook Collins other stuff
if you look at the architecture spread
to Firefox it was largely focused on
what our volunteer contrib contributors
were doing so this these were their
blogs these were not in Mozilla blogs
there might have been a few maybe like a
dozen or so Mozilla employee blogs I
would by the way throughout this entire
process I was never employed by us out
there anything I do for them I was just
another volunteer like anybody else and
so the whole architecture of this is
predicated on putting the community
front and center and making them the
heroes of the story the more that
Firefox succeeded the more the community
felt like they were making success
together and so just again sort of
created that snowball effect now one of
the things that was really important for
us was you know I mentions for like the
time bound challenges that we had you
know a million downloads ten days and so
on well whenever we would sort of you
know create the sort of thermostat of
success to get people to do a certain
activity whenever we would hit that
number and we all we always did I would
go into Photoshop and create some sort
of flaming fireball of Awesome that the
community would then sort of like take
as a badge of honor that they had all
collectively one and then they would
turn these things into essentially
social objects that they would publish
on their blogs or they would share up to
their friends you know when we hit 25
million downloads in under a hundred
days you know I sort of like up the
flaming ante and and so this was the way
that we celebrated to ourselves we
didn't really need anybody else to tell
us we were doing well or not we sort of
had our own deadlines and our own goals
and met them and so you know we also
just you know created these things that
people could use just really tell the
story and and share this these concepts
you know and and the community actually
created a whole gallery full of these
things which is pretty awesome so so
anyways
this also culminated in this this ad
that I did that ended up in the New York
Times that announced the launch of
Firefox 10 and you know again it was
sort of like there was a limited budget
we had a limited amount of time to get
it done you know a bunch of corporations
were like oh you know we're going to
like put in some money make this happen
and we were like well we should probably
you know ask the community you know if
they want to like get involved or
whatever and so we basically had this
ten-day campaign to raise I think it was
like $20,000 or something you know
Howard Dean style and so we put this
campaign out there and in 10 days we
raised a quarter of a million dollars
and we're like a great now what do we do
so well we went from a one-page ad to a
two page ad as you can see here and and
it also changed the way that I thought
about the design of this ad right like
the idea was just to tell the world a
Firefox is here go download it but it
occurred to me actually the thing that
we're launching is not so much the
browser because that's going to
constantly change its we're launching
this community we're launching this team
you know team Internet is here bitches
and so if you actually look at the ad i
took the ten thousand donors and i put
them in the ad basically and tenaya i
was using a power mac g4 would like quad
whatever nonsense and i kept crashing
illustrator the night before the ad
launched I had an Adobe technician call
me on the phone the guy who actually
like wrote the text rendering engine for
illustrator and was like dude what are
you trying to do like illustrator does
not do this I'm like it will be done so
anyways so we have like these ten
thousand names and this basically is
sort of like proclaim to the world like
this is what this is all about Mozilla
is not the product of one company this
is the product of ten thousand and
hundreds of thousands of volunteers
around the world so y'all are notice and
this is continued to this day so you
know firefox four came out in March they
basically did this sort of campaign
around the world to like you know have
these Firefox parties you know you could
join a party with it with something as
simple as a tweet so again sort of like
those levels of engagement and this time
within two days you know the
had like 16 million downloads and you
think about that like 16 million people
downloaded this browser people never
updated their browsers before people
still don't even know what browsers are
and yet they want Firefox whatever that
thing is and now three months later
they've had 214 million downloads right
so if you can imagine one of your papers
being downloaded to earn 14 million
times you know it's aspirational right
so you know you think like what is the
equivalent of 214 million downloads in
three months for like the climate change
movement I don't know what it is but I
hope you guys are thinking about it so
I'm going over when I'm going to speed
up a little bit so one of the things
that was really interesting about this
campaign that they did for launching
Firefox was this little thing here where
you could basically add this these what
three four characters to your tweet and
you would join a party this is what's
called a hashtag how many of you know
what hashtag is okay so that's cool so
hashtags are sort of an interesting
story because they they came out of
there there there a reaction to a
limitation of a medium where the medium
itself was sort of like the art form and
I'm talking specifically of course about
Twitter so you guys know what the first
hashtag was you want to see it so this
is the first hashtag that would used on
Twitter and the the reason why like I
proposed this idea was because we are
you know the early adopters of Twitter
wanted to be like in every social medium
that comes out they wanted to be able to
group together and have conversations
about things well Twitter didn't want to
have groups they didn't want to have
those places for people to come together
it was just one continuous stream which
led people to be like oh it's like you
know so-and-so had Cheerios for
breakfast who cares well the the cheerio
fan club people care right so it's like
how do they you know meet each other how
do they find each other and another
problem that we had back in the day was
that you know 80 just did not provide
networking services no matter how much
you paid and so
you want to go check your tweets or
you'd want to like contribute a
conversation and the network would be
down the only thing that would get
through of course were SMS is and so if
you think about what Twitter is and what
blogging is so if you go back and you
look at Ewa Williams career you got it
started bloggers and Twitter with some
other people blogging is just email but
like with a to everyone you know email
address and Twitter is just SMS which is
like a one-to-one communication channel
like to everyone so we just like kept
co-opting these you know channels that
were private before and making them
public that's all these things are and
then with Twitter it was even dumber he
like took blogger and he cut off the
body of the post and was like you don't
need the body the post will just use
titles I mean that's all it is right so
anyway so you can blog you know by like
sending an SMS but yet then you can't
sort of meet other people and so we
needed a system that would work over you
know a text based text only medium right
like this is like whatever that like
turn based system you know you've come
to a dark end of the hallway turn left
turn right like that's what Twitter is
noise it doesn't make any sense so so
this is sort of like where it started it
was around you know collating
conversations around some some topic or
nugget or token or whatever and the
place where hashtags really took off in
the beginning was not if you guys like
like saw this but there was this huge
like fire in san diego in 2007 and so a
friend of mine who lived in san diego at
the time Nate Ritter started tweeting
you know using Twitter as a broadcast
channel what he was doing was he was
listening to like CB radios or like cop
radios fire radios reading you know
blogs and news you know TV stations what
collating all this information just
constantly pushing a stream of
information out there so that he was
sort of like a source of information
he'd never done this before he had no
authority to do this but he was the only
one who was doing this when all these
other media channels were sort of like
providing conflicting information and
what he was doing was he was prefixing
all of his posts with sands space Diego
space fire and of course that's you know
perfectly logical if you want to read
those posts but if you want to search on
them it's not so great and you know i'd
recently sort of proposed this this
hashtag idea i was like oh man this
could like be really good so i went on
to flickr and i looked at their
trending topics and the the folks anomic
sort of representation of the San Diego
fires happen to sort of come in a number
of different forms Santana wins Harris
fire San Diego fire which fire which of
these is the most obvious to people who
will read this and they're in Texas or
they're in New Hampshire or wherever
they are and they will be able to get
the context for this so it's like dude
just you know start using San Diego fire
all one word put a hash in front of it
and you're done and so that's what he
did and so he started doing this you
know over sub-period days the media is
sort of picked this up picked up this
behavior and you know they kind of like
ran with and told that story now Nate
rid of course works in technology so
this was sort of okay for him to do it
wasn't like a big deal but what was
interesting about this was that it was a
behavior that was very easy to imitate
so his followers or other people's
followers could sort of see this see his
tweets coming out in some of the
contacts be like oh I see what you did
there and I could do that too and so
they started doing that in you know
rapid fashion so now of course you go to
Twitter and you go to like Twitter
search one of the things that you can do
you know as you see they're trending
topics there now include hashtags which
at one point they filtered out entirely
you know you can do a search for like
ash climate change and you can basically
find all the people having conversations
about this stuff and now Twitter is
aggregating video and if there were
photos that were tagged with the stuff
you could see that so it starts to
create this sort of channel of
information that people can very easily
contribute to very quickly you know very
low bar and I don't if you there was a
story about hashtags in the Sunday's
fashion section of all places about how
hashtags are starting to us like break
out into other mediums because they're
so simple I mean these are this is like
the stupidest hack ever and yet it
worked because you can use them when
you're drunk I mean that's like the
touchstone of like social software that
works yes that's I mean that usually
takes a couple you know bottles of beer
and I can figure out yeah that's going
to work her I have no idea I prefer to
avoid Red Bull because that'll give you
cancer
I don't know that that's totally
uncontained dist anyway so you know
you've seen like how hashtags have been
used more recently because people were
able to figure this stuff out right so
you know whether it was like the iran
election and all the protests that have
been going on in like the middle east
you know or what happened in egypt with
this hashtag i mean these very very
simple concepts were able to spread
mimetic alee because people could sort
of mimic them you know they were obvious
they were and they also created sort of
a common like communication currency
that people could sort of spread amongst
themselves so how does this all come
together well I think one way to sort of
think about this and to think maybe
differently about social media because
it's less to me in my mind about the
huge numbers I mean you're like if I
could give a presentation on like the
numbers of people on planet earth and
you'd probably be like if I were
choosing a plan to live on planet earth
would probably better than say Mars you
know and you'd be like well that's where
I want to have my social media campaign
of course you know or like that's where
I want to get my oxygen because they
have the most of it or something it's
not so much about the numbers I think
it's more about how these communications
channels have wide distribution and
availability and very easy availability
to lots of different people who are
going to use these things for lots of
different purposes and then therefore
you can sort of join those things and do
whatever you do already and then people
will sort of like follow that and though
though they'll internalize what you're
doing and if it's interesting to them
then they might actually get involved if
you leave those those surface areas out
there for people to sort of jump in you
know and spread a hashtag or whatever
and so a way to think about this is
basically what Jonathan Zittrain talks
about in his book the future the
internet and how to stop it have you
guys read this book no okay well if you
haven't I recommend that you steal it
from his website because he's a
communist and he is giving it away under
Creative Commons license just kidding
he's not a communist but you can you can
download it and he basically he calls
out these five principles the first one
is how extensively a system or
technology leverages asset a possible
task so basically how dextrous is this
thing like again hashtags were stupid
that's why they were useful you could
apply them to just about anything any
channel that supported text you know you
can use hash so I've started putting
hashtags in like the subjects of my
emails you know because I'm weird like
that and again like you know how how
well can this also be adapted to like a
range of different tasks how easily can
new contributors master it it's pretty
easy to master hashtags just like super
mario brothers how accessible is it to
those ready and able to build on it so
people are just sorta like waiting for a
solution there were all these people on
Twitter waiting to get together to have
some sort of group solution and this is
the easiest possible thing that they
could do to sort of solve that one
problem and then how transferable are
any changes made to that system to
others you know including and perhaps
especially for non-experts so you know
with like the spread Firefox campaign it
was like if you can write a little HTML
you can join the movement you can move
you know do something if you if you
don't know HTML you can't write HTML
look just click on the button a bunch of
times and download it you know that will
help our numbers that kind of thing so
you know you go from like something like
this which is very simple you know and
mozilla is continuing this today and i
encourage you to look at their drumbeat
projects because they're taking some of
these ideas and trying to help move the
things their efforts forward to keep the
web open and free and and you think
about how this creates again kind of
like Mozilla is like putting out these
flags for like team Internet you know
come join us come help us that we've got
a bunch of work to be done and this is
the place where you should go for that
to other types of efforts that are
really about inclusivity inclusivity
yeah anyways participation giving people
a story that they can own that they can
retell over and over again a very
lightweight way of actually getting
involved in all the things that are
asking for their attention to the point
where finally you sort of you know show
back to them the power of their
engagement as a whole you know what is
this sum total of your participation so
that you feel like you made an
individual dent you know in the universe
is whoever it is that said that said
that and that they're part of something
bigger and more interesting than they
could have been otherwise I mean this is
the this is the draw of social media
again it's so that you don't feel so
lonely on the web and that when you're
not feeling so lonely it's because
you're connecting to a bunch of other
people and really interesting
meaningful and important ways so anyways
I'm over but that's all I got today
thank you okay we have 10 minutes for
questions and we will also both be here
for the rest of the afternoon yeah yeah
questions so I mean maybe both the the
crash and the right answers you don't I
you know I used to go by this user name
this sort of a moniker factory Joe on
the web mine factory GECOM I was factor
Joe and Twitter and you know I ended up
speaking at conferences and people come
up to me it's him and they'd be like
they'd be like Joe that was a great talk
and I'd be like that's not my name so
what ended up happening you know from my
2004 to light 2008 is that that ability
to like keep everything separate sort of
went away and in fact one of the ways in
which you derive your your authority is
by owning like your identity you know
both offline and online and so if you
understand that social media is a way of
continuing to develop like both your
personal brand and the work that you do
and it's an amplifier for the things
that you're already passionate in then I
think that's actually a much more
effective way to do it now in terms of
light dealing with like you know the you
know the kindergarten friends and all
that stuff that's sort of an unsolved
problem that I hope gets better over
time but I do think that there are
different mediums that are better suited
for certain types of interactions so I
tend to be you know pretty careful about
how i use facebook i mean you can use
like facebook pages or things like that
but you kinda have to be really
dedicated to that and unless like that's
that is like a sort of full-time job it
becomes hard to maintain so I find that
I use Twitter mostly to sort of like
talk about all sorts of random stuff
that people in my field might be
interested in and like Facebook's like
but something i use personally I don't
think of it as like being like a ver
like private channel but i also don't
engage in it in a way that I do on
Twitter so they're just different
mediums for different things it's like
you watch MTV for one thing and you
watch the Discovery Channel for
something else there are settings that
you can have on your page on page where
don't everybody he doesn't see all of
this stuff but it's true i get i kind of
cringe with somebody post something
that's a friend of mine and it's you
know i'm going out to the grocery store
now I don't care why are you doing this
on my Facebook page but there's also
there also fan pages and those are not
as interactive but that's a way you can
yeah I mean they can be i think i think
part of the challenges it's more about
your behavior and adopting techniques
that are natural to you right like it
would be sort of unnatural for me to
actually use a fan page too often so
it's better for me to use the mediums
that i already feel comfortable hosting
to whether that's my blog or whether
that's twitter so i think it's also
about just effort why why but but one of
the things that we face in our area is
that we were and social you know her
radio show recently had deceived Walter
Reed show about alphas parenting was
served to stop even get nasty in college
other needs what we would really like to
do I think taking abuse from them for
med bay backs work sort of have a
constructive engaging with the
seventy-five percent of the population
that that devil is reachable and curious
on climate change and there's this ten
percent of population that wants to
actively undermine that effort can they
just slink make it impossible
you know um yeah I mean we had this
problem with like you know Mozilla to
right i mean you know and so part of it
was we you know embrace the Communists
sort of visuals and that became
something that they couldn't use against
us anymore so we sorta like turn that
around that obviously doesn't work in
all cases but i think that there's
there's a way to think about this where
there's your sort of space which you
curate in which you know you're in
charge of the house rules versus going
over to you know perhaps a more public
forum or place where you don't control
the rules where that type of behavior is
sort of what's encouraged or or desired
right so it's it's a you know i don't if
you played any like first-person
shooters but the goal is to kill your
opponent and so if you took that part
out of the game it wouldn't be
interesting the people who are there so
if you create like an alternative
version or an alternate place to like
have these conversations you might have
an open-door policy but you have very
clear guidelines i think a good example
this is probably stack overflow which is
mostly targeted at developers who have
questions about coding and what they've
done is they sort of put up this wall of
text before you sign up the basically
says look if you're if you're going to
come into our place these are the house
rules and we reserve the right to
basically like kick you out silence you
you know or will have a troll filter
where you can keep posting your vitriol
but no one else will see it so you know
have at it but you know it's not going
to be that much fun for you because
you're not going to get the responses
that you're looking for and I think it's
probably more important to do
experiments because you still want
people to be engaged you just want
people to over time to sort of lose
their momentum in making perhaps claims
that just don't have any basis or what
we've also done in another community
that I would have been involved with
called microformats is that we actually
sort of adopt a version of the
scientific method where we have everyone
do certain types of homework before
making claims and so we built the
culture that actually requires people to
go out and then we spread that culture
so that everyone who joins is basically
hazed if you will you know they have to
sort of understand like look if you're
going to make some proposal here you've
got
basically batteries also have open
source talk a little bit about how
balanced letting ya so one of the things
that I think a lot of people don't
understand about open source I think I
did neither is that open source is not
like a free-for-all it doesn't mean that
everyone who sort of contributes to it
has their changes you know made to the
core product so the way that open source
works is that there is typically a bit
of benevolent dictator of some sort that
has some sort of clear vision and that
that clear vision actually has to be
made like very explicit crystal clear
and that person's job is basically to
repeat that stuff over and over and over
and over and over you get the point
right again and they are sort of like
again the ones who like have the flag
and kind of like lead it forward but
they allow other people to like pick up
pieces of that and move it forward as
well and then when they contribute and
their patches or contributions are
accepted then that's sort of the way
that you win at the game of open source
so it's not that all these different
patches and contributions make their way
into and change the fundamental product
but that you leave the door open for
those types of contributions the second
thing that's really important and I was
going to talk about github but I didn't
have time is that github is sort of this
this developer community site that's
sprung up that sort of trailed in the
footsteps I guess of google code and
sourceforge so it's basically the
community place where developers will
share a lot of their source code now one
of the things that's very interesting
about github is that they made one very
important change to the open-source
culture which is that they took the act
of forking which is basically taking a
project source code and creating a copy
of it and then working on it on your own
as your own version of the thing which
used to be kind of like a big f you like
I don't like what you're doing i'm going
to go take your stuff and do my own
version of it to an act of love so if I
fork your project it because I think
it's actually pretty good and I want to
actually make my own
and sort of you know contributions to
that and what ends up happening is that
those people who do that it's very hard
for them actually to build up both
community credibility as well as to
overtake the original project unless the
original maintainer kind of like falls
off the face of the earth right so the
original project kind of still maintains
all the momentum and all the community
interest but they're going to be a fork
or many or thousands of forks there are
all different sort of variations of the
same theme then actually allows for the
distribution of work over time and over
lots of different people that then
actually ends up leading people to
contribute their stuff back because it's
too much work to maintain these branches
so the point is that you're sort of
allowing people to fork off your ideas
or the expression of a certain truth you
allow them to sort of experiment perhaps
they'll gain some traction and in some
way but that you're still the the bearer
of a certain truth which you maintain
over time so it's the consistency and
it's the dedication and the passion for
that original I guess expression of the
idea or concept that people are drawn to
it's not just the idea itself so I think
that it's sort of okay again as an
experiment I'm not saying this is like
going to work in every context but to
allow forks of ideas and see what
actually happens and then if people
won't actually contribute back then you
provide the means to do so it's the it's
when you cut off the ability for people
to contribute in meaningful ways that I
think you end up with kind of like these
very destructive behaviors because
they're the only expression that people
can actually use to get attention
obviously being used
yeah you see that going sure so so on
your first point about the sort of like
gentle rebuke I think it's always
important again sort of with a with
community guidelines and there's a less
sort of restrictions on what you can and
can't post this isn't usually it's not
meant to be like draconian if you want
to look at a good set of like community
guidelines slickers are pretty good it's
more about sort of having that back
channel and saying look you know that
really wasn't cool and you know if you
keep that up like we're going to have to
sort of like silence your account for a
little bit or something but you
basically have like a de-escalation
approach as opposed to sort of like
hashing it out publicly in the comments
so I think that's a very good point with
regards to the kind of almost like poll
based way that people are using hashtags
today I think it's it's more a testament
to like the the dexterity of the form
than it is about any particular thing I
mean it's interesting and it's fun and
again it's like these sort of like
bandwagon things where people can jump
on a topic like I think what was it it's
like you know funny movie endings or
strained who I don't know whatever was
like where and I think this is also a
good example of the way that hashtags
work from a folks anomic perspective
where they might actually gather some
steam but then completely dissipate and
then maybe they'll come back a couple
months later or maybe not the whole
whole notion is that instead of having
this sort of like top-down group
architecture you allow these things to
sort of blossom where they will and then
die and so you're actually introducing
the notion of decay into social media
and that that's just part of it if your
hashtag doesn't take off today keep
doing it for another two weeks and see
where it goes and it doesn't work try
something else we have to end it now but
won't be here and really appreciate your
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
