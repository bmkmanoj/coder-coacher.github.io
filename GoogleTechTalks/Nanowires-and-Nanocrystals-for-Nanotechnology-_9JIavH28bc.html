Professor III from Stanford to give us a
talk today prophase degree is one of the
most famous young scientist working our
nanotechnology area because his
bachelor's degree from University of
Science and Technology of Japan ER and
got his PhD degree in chemistry from
Harvard University
yeah professor gh3 is running our
persistent problem as a at Stanford
University
yeah let's welcome professor you see
first of all let me thank a chuck for
his invitation it's a pleasure to be
here the first impression I have after I
got here is the Google is a really
dynamic dynamic place that's probably
the most impressive point I have seen up
there with so many companies it's also
great to see several lumini from
university of science and technology of
china sitting in the front that's a big
part for me so in return I'd like to
tell you what I'm doing and the last
several years also using the inner wires
in nano places for nanotechnology this
is a title but I do recognize this is
Tom Foyle
it's like general public talk it would
be a good idea to give you some
introduction about the history of
nanotechnology first of all what's Nino
technology and the most general level
the nanoscience and technology it's
defined by the size scale it's defined
by this nanometer unit usually it
defined as a science engineering on the
100 nanometer scale or below so it's the
size solution between the atomic level
and the bark level you have seen so one
nanometer is a wrong
ten one out of ten to the nine field
meet meters also so to give you an idea
how small it is if you like soccer you
probably are very familiar with this
this picture so you see that she does
still have some hairs so the size of the
hair is the wrong
50,000 nanometer also that give you an
idea and the animator unit is a really
really small and how small it is now let
me give you some example to let you
build out the intuition how small a
nanometer is you probably all learn
about atoms atom has the size around
count one nanometer also so going up you
you start to see in the enemy to loosen
the size of the nanometer Lucian
includes you know typically molecules
DNA is for example proteins and
currently a really active research area
carbon nanotubes quantum dots proteins
tell in this nanometer regime going up
slightly to 10 nanometers also
semiconductor near no wires and all
other NEOWISE I'm going to talk about in
just a few minutes and the viruses has
the size of close to a hundred the
enemies are also in the pending painting
fold chip have the size of roundish a
hundred nanometer to a micron also and
going up single biological cells has ten
micron also so 1 micron equals to a
thousand nanometer 10 micron is ten
thousand nanometers and micro fluidics
level level achieved of science care is
in micron scale 100 micron scale also
you know human being will be all the way
to descend right hand side so nanometer
scale is really a small size illusion
but it's not the smallest size even be
never studied chemists and physicists
used to study the size scale
and the atomic size so that's smaller
than one millimeter and we are also very
familiar with the size solution very
very big size regime so nanometer Lucien
is really between the atomic size and
the box size that's something you will
expect new new properties happen you can
take advantage of these new properties
to come out new applications so look at
the history of a nanotechnology people
working in this field always use famous
encourage in the speech as the starting
of the nanotechnology so in 1959 Richard
Feynman a physicist in Caltech give this
a famous speech he described the
importance when you decrease the size of
material size of the objects to really
really small you can do something new
you can do something important so I
highlight this sentence right here you
can be decrease the size of things in a
practical way I now want to show that
there is a plenty of room what he means
plenty of room is to use those plenty of
things you can do in this size scale so
after he gave that speech if I may use
his own money to set up a final price to
5:05 mine prices so anyone who can do
this one of these two things will win
this prize so the first one is that was
a 1959 anyone who can build a motor that
will fit into the size of 1/64 inch by
by 64 164 pounds and the second one is
anyone who can write a page of tests
with letters that that are small enough
for the Encyclopedia Britannica to be
printed on a pinhead size
as soon as the fireman announced these
two prices and the first one God got
claim right away
bill McMillan's did a really good job
but just by using hands to make a small
motor which is small enough to fit into
the size to win the final price right
away but the second fine meant price
didn't go claim until very late until
1985 second so that's her somehow 20-30
years later Tom Newman of Fabian peace
fortunately of Fabian piece is a
professor at Stanford I got to meet him
a couple of times a month so use even
lithography to write a part of our tale
of two cities in the land scale required
by my so they claim the second farm
price after a couple of decades so
what's the big deal about decreasing the
size of objects so what's the big deal
of these nanometer scale size let me use
one most important example to illustrate
the importance of decreasing the size of
the object we all know about the first
transistor the transistor was invented
in Bell lab on the Christmas Eve of 1947
so the inventors of won the Nobel
physics prize in 1956 the first chance
this is really really big
so you can just use your hands to catch
it so over so many decades people people
keep pushing down the size of
transistors
now they state-of-the-art transistor
fabricated by Intel has the great lens
around the 30 nanometer or below and so
all the all the important land scale
right here like like the gate dielectric
thickness a cap on the air meter and the
sauce enjoying hung high all gets very
very small so it's due to this
development due to the decreasing of the
size
you can make more and more powerful chan
system more and more powerful computer
chips and decrease in the size allow you
to pack a lot of things within a tiny
areas so this along this line along the
line of electronics integrated circuit
is it's the the most famous example what
important things you can do when the
size gets small so you can integrate
things together into tiny areas Jack and
Kirby when the Innova physics Prize in
2004 the invention of integrated circuit
so it's the size size decrease which
motivate which drive the transistors
smaller and smaller in the transistors
the computer to become help and powerful
this comes the most famous Maurice law
it is quite about every two years also
you can you can double the size double
the number chances that within the same
chip
so giving this example now what does
Nemo technology do so people have
developed of transistors get down to
about 30 nanometers I scale also
so what nanotechnology do is it would
like to develop the new tools to study
to see the size and the deep nanometer
scale even atomic scale and also the
second area is to produce the structure
and a nanometer scale size you know you
can use photo lithography to pattern
computer chip down to 30 nanometer scale
also but out that is not enough for
nanotechnology so what are the new
applications giving you can produce
these nano structures you can you have
the to to to see the nano structures now
let me give you some of the research
people have been doing in these three
areas some of the example just come from
my own research the first areas tools
for studying in a nanometer scale the
most important tools up one of the most
important too is scanning tunneling
microscopy so this technique is like
this if you want to look at a sample of
substrate you cannot take a really
really sharp metallic tip scan over the
sample so the tip is sharp enough only a
single atoms terminates at the tip so
your prior wattage between the tip and
the substrate you have current flowing
through between the tip and the
substrate and by moving the tip scanning
the tip since you have atomic size a
single ad for metal at a tip so you have
the resolution to look at the substrate
down to atomic scale so people use this
technology to look at a for example this
is a solid-state substrate you can
clearly resolve single atoms and you can
even use this tip to do some
something like medical operation so you
can use the papaya voltage to pick up an
atom from the substrate and then move it
a chance chance for this atom to a new
place and deposit into a new place by
doing this you can use atom to
manipulate to form this special pattern
you would like to study what happened in
the nanometer scale the inventors of STM
won the Nobel physics prize in 1986 in
the same family of scanning probe
there's another technique that is atomic
force microscopy this also take
advantage of a very sharp tip so you use
the laser to monitor this to monitor the
cantilever position so we're dealing
scanning the tip you can maintain the
force interaction between the tip and
the substrate as constant why you are
scanning your tip if you have surface
topology change it's going to change the
force so you have a feedback loop to
pull your tip up and down to monitor the
surface topology by doing this way and
having a really sharp tip you can look
at the the structures for example like
proteins like DNA s the difference
between atomic force microscopy and
scanning tunneling microscopy is
scanning tunneling microscopy used the
current as the signal and I told me
force microscopy is the force
interaction between the tip and the
substrate so they have a deep enough
usage and different areas the inventor
of atomic force microscopy is bending
quite in Gerber among all these
inventors quit is a professor at
Stanford
another technique to look at the size
scale and the nanometer is the
transmission and scanning electron
microscopy so you have a electron gun
shooting electron how passing a lot of
electromagnetic lens and focus down to
your samples since the wavelength of the
electrons is very small you know the
imaging resolution is limited by the
wavelength of the lies of the electron
waves so using a short wave wavelength
of the electron beam you can look at the
structure for example you have a condom
dots right here down to the atomic size
resolution so this technique are really
important for the development of
nanotechnology now let's come to the
second areas how do you produce the
structures in the enemies of scale there
are two philosophies and making things
smaller one philosophy is you can take a
piece of big object and then cut it down
into a small piece this is so-called
top-down approach so going from big size
to small size second approach is so
copolymer approach you use the molecular
precursors starting from molecules and
then you do chemical synthesis the these
precursors start to nuclear and grow go
into the nanometer scale size object
this philosophy did these two philosophy
represent different ways and into doing
almost the same thing the industry has
been motivated by the top-down approach
you know the whole transistors
development is very relying on the
top-down approach it's the bottom of
approach and the last ten years also
really make the nanotechnology really
really exciting you you can do something
new using the Dipsy support of our
approach
so I'm going to skip how people do the
top-down approach you probably all
familiar with photolithography idea now
let me come to you know the bottom-up
approach how people produce nanoscale
structures nanoscale materials using
bottom-up approach one example is the
cover 60 cover system was was discovered
by these three people they're the winner
of a Nobel chemistry prize in 1996 so
taking a graphite structures where Phi
has a layer by layer crystal structure
if you use laser to Eve a price graphite
you have certain catalysts or wrong you
can produce this beautiful about one
nanometer size also a ball of people
corridor buckyball so he has a tough
Pentagon's and 10g hexagons
it is exactly like a soccer ball this
structure this pocket ball has a
beautiful structure which is beautifully
enough to get awarded a Nobel Prize to
these people and second important
nanomaterials is carbon nanotubes carbon
nanotube is a structure also based on a
graphite if you take up a piece of
graphite sheet and then roll it up it
will become a nanotube depends on how
you roll it up you can get you know
different chirality of tubes and you can
have semiconductor behavior you can have
metallic behavior so carbon nanotube
becomes a very active research areas
about 10-15 years ago also so another
time on the enema theorist I have been
working on in the last three years also
wire was their poster at Berkeley a
semiconductor nano crystals so this tiny
crystal has the size between about one
to 10 nanometer also it's
based on purely chemical synthesis and a
very hot organics effect and you can
injure molecular pickers into this flask
and these precursors decompose to
nucleate and grow into these so-called
zero dimensional nano structures and
depending on what kind of molecule is
the fact that you have in a solution you
can produce spherical shape of quantum
dots miano rods one dimensional
structure or even branches structure we
call it in this case he has four arms as
a tetrapod
now one more type of nanostructures
produced by chemical synthesis produced
by a bottom-up approach its
semiconductor near no wires there's many
ways to make a one-dimensional inner
wires one particular powerful way I have
been working on is the so called vapor
liquid solid growth of nanowires it
comes from the ideas you can take of a
tiny tiny seed particles nanoscale
particles function as a catalyst for
example if you want to grow silicon
nanowires you can take a go to
nanoparticles and heat it up above say
400 degrees C also and passes the
silicon no precursors it could be silent
and it district ursus decompose and
deposit into gold nanoparticles if you
look at a phase diagram when you mix
gold and silicon together they melt a
really really low temperature you know
go along the melting point is about 1000
degrees C and a silicon along the
melting point is about 1400 degrees C
but when you manage to thing and you mix
these two things together the melting
point is 360 degrees C it's really
really low so using these properties at
about 400 degrees C also you can add
silicon and to go and then make a liquid
droplet so if you keep adding silicon
into this chocolate then silicon
supersaturated to nucleate and grow into
one dimension and you know or Nino wire
structures its due to these or tiny
sites which defines the name the
nanowire structure
here is the transmission electron
microscopy image is showing you about
the particle at the end of a silicon
nanowires and you can produce beautiful
single crystalline elias so there are
other nanoscale structures made by
Nature in addition to this artificial
nano structure made by human being
DNA's is one type of powerfully enough
structure proteins and viruses and
organic molecules so giving all these
structures so what kind of things you
can do what useful things you can do to
the human being so you have carbon
nanotube semiconductor knee and a wire
semiconductor quantum dots DNA's
proteins you have couple 60s so over the
last 15 years people have been really
creative and using this materials for
different type of application now let me
give you several examples so I give you
a list right here
the top two cosmetics and catalysis it's
not something new we happened for really
a long time it's it's there and the new
things is in the area of nanoscale
electronics molecular electronics
biosensors for healthcare and bio
warfare detection and renewable energy
and battery technology for example so I
don't know need to say too much about
cosmetics just by pointing out the
sunscreen you use has nanoparticles in
it so nanoparticles which has the
semiconductor nanoparticles has the
semiconductor bank of large in knowledge
can observe you will like and can be a
good materials as sunscreen so we move
the UV light and pitarrio skin and for
catalysis the whole oil industry relies
on this technology they used metallic
particles are seen as catalysts for
cranking up the the oil and decompose
them into different components
so it's a big industry already now for
better and faster transistors people
have been demonstrating using carbon
energy one of my colleagues in Stanford
University hungee diet level chemistry
have show using carbon nanotubes you can
produce the transistors which is way
more better than the transistors and
here can made since carbon nanotubes has
described fine structures it blow up as
a as a tube structure there's no surface
dangling bonds on a surface so that
means many electrons moving along the
nanotubes they won't get chopped
that also mean electron can move very
very fast and nanotubes so using the
energy of contact by two you lecture one
is Jane the other is sauce and you can
have a KT lecture whether it's using
substrate as a gate or you can fabricate
so-called top gate people may really
high quality of transistors and
demonstrate the mobility is like
infinite is high because these the
chance for the electron doesn't get
scattered along in the energy of its lab
for electric transport and these many
companies are pushing very hard
especially of IBM try to use near
nanotubes for the next generation of
transistors and another example coming
out of my own research work is to use
semiconductor Nino wires for making
batter transistors
no carbon nanotubes are nice their
performance is a very well but happen is
a new materials for the whole silicon
industry so why don't we just use a
silicon nanowires because anything
related to silicon has been developed
all the etching process or the chemistry
on all the fabrication so till during my
work in PhD I actually demonstrate using
a silicon nanowire contact by two
electrodes you can fabricate the
transistor which is better also battled
the calendar intelligence system so the
mobility of the charge cameras becomes
higher that also suggests the you can
have a faster transistors the reason for
that is it's based on the same material
silicon silicon nanowire the reason it
can be better is really due to when the
size of this onion oh what gets smaller
along the cross section so the corner
confinement changed the electronic
structure of silicon so it make the
continuous energy band became a discrete
energy band this decreases the
probability of electrons got scattered
when they are transferred along these
nanowires we are still developing this
and this average had to make a better
chance sisters for the next generation
of a computer chip so I mentioned to you
for all the nano structures molecules is
one time on the inner structure they
have size scale along and the enemies
are also in the last ten years also
several research group especially Jim
his crew and Caltech and startup
Williams group and UCLA stuff belief
startup group stem villain school and HP
they are developing molecular
electronics and try to use really tiny
size of molecules function as a switch
and this structure this yellow color
indicates the metallic electrodes so
this indicates the Amala killed so the
sandwich molecules between two set of
electrodes try to apply a voltage to
induce the change in the molecules they
can store informations right there they
can made a switch this also also is a
very active research area
so due to the work and the area of our
nanowires and molecules
indeed this book may into the cover of
science and 2001 so this this is read as
the breakthrough of the years using
analyze and molecules as transistors as
switches to make better electronics so I
would hope someday you know you can
really you know get these such as
sisters make them small enough make them
powerful enough made them reproducible
enough might have danced in enough to
produce baton baton electronics it
should be Gopi young iPod Nano so he has
a nano in it but it's not really the
Nano we are looking for yet so after
giving you two examples of the
application and electronics you know if
you ask me how long would you expect you
know the Nano can do something for the
transistors to play centers chances I
will tell you I don't know it's going to
be very long doing electronics is
probably the hardest things in
nanotechnology it's the major driving
force ten years ago but now the driving
force come from all the directions some
electronics publish the latest average
you can impact in nanotechnology other
areas of technology might be possible
might be earlier than the electronics
one area is in biosensing for medical
cares for hit for human health now let
me give you one example coming out come
out of my own research so we made this
event I mentioned on the inner wire
structure semiconductor Nino wires the
owner semiconductors has field effect so
if your pile voltage you will play a
lecture feel close to the semiconductor
you can change the charge carrier
concentration and semiconductor you can
change is it's a conductivity
using these ideas if you take the
nanowires contacted by two electrodes
and then you put certain receptors which
function as a recognition reagent
to recognize certain molecules you want
to detect if this molecule comes in and
bind onto these receptors
if these molecules have charges it's
going to function as a gate voltage
function even have electric fields
interact with on the inner wires change
the carrier concentration in the inner
wires by measure the conductance you
will see the conductance change you
would be able to detect the existence of
this red colored charged molecules so
based on these ideas we think we can
develop a new type of sensors since the
nanowire they're so small they must be
really really sensitive to any charge
molecules so we know the proteins DNA H
they have charges so this is the idea
for detecting something and the human
body the other one teaches of this
technique is since the wire is small
it's sensitive as I mentioned in a
second this is purely based on the
electrical current in conductors
measurement you don't need to label any
molecules this is really different upon
the existing current technology so then
they need to go through extensive
radioactive labeling for example so a
nanowire sensor doesn't need to do that
and imagine if you can pin a lot of me
analyze together you can do a great ways
of sensing if you have a thousands of
this nanowire each one has people
receptor you can detect people molecules
at the same time
here's one example we were doing the
cancer marketed at detection so for many
type of cancers before the year the
cancer really developed to the late
stage the human body already have some
change in the blood for example for
prostate cancer prostate cancer is is a
killer and both it's a killer in u.s.
for the man he has a specific cancer
market is called prostate of Pisco PSA
PSA prostate specific antigen it's a
protein if a man gets a prostate cancer
in the early stage this protein
concentration will go up so if we can
find an antibody we label the nanowire
which the antibody of these cancer
markers then you can be taken in a
really early stage so here I show you
one example having three nanowire each
knee know why modified by people anybody
they can be protective on cancer marker
antigen they're all proteins indeed you
can do that quite successfully here you
can just simply measure the Cavanaugh's
a conductance versus time and different
time and you flow and the different
cancer markers onto the narrow wires for
what food for this nanowire number one
he has a psh antibody so when PSA goes
in you see the conductance goes up but
the other two nano wire doesn't have
response right here and you can do the
same thing for the other two Nia no I
have different cancer markers like CI
comes in mm you see company it
corresponds to different type of cancer
so we can detect them really well indeed
we can go down to the concentration
about picogram per meal and even close
to pentagram famille it's like a hundred
times more sensitive than the current
technology so using this nanowire sensor
detection scheme it's possible to
discover
in really early stage
so biosensors are big areas another big
area is just coming up become hotter and
hotter is the energy related areas as
the gasoline price goes up you're on you
all understand why this area is
important the key things for making
solar cells collect sunlight energy and
make it into electricity is to come up a
way you can collect the sunlight and
convert it into electricity and a very
high efficiency with very very low cost
that's something nano can do so we made
these nanowires we made these nano
crystals especially nano crystals that
dissolve an organic solvent they can be
processed as chemicals if you want to
make a solar cells what you do is you
take a substrate or glass and then you
just sprinkle these nano crystals or
just simply by printing spinto and
printing is very very cheap technology
so you can color really have large areas
and for example making solar cells for
all this window convert it into solar
cells and that's what nano can do and
this examples you mix nanoparticles nano
crystal together with organic polymer so
organic polymer and nano crystal will
form a junction and this Junction if you
look at its electronic structures this
Junction can separate electrons and
holes to create electricity electron in
house will are created by sunlight and
sunlight comes in the photon energy
create electron hole pairs excite them
and then you separate them you can
collect as electricity so my post
otherwise the polymer circles was
working really hard work li in these
areas in my research school I also have
programming and doing that too
but we sleep an idea from Paul I'm a
colleague of Mike McGee at Stanford
material science is an expert and using
an organic nerve nanostructure brand
together with polymer to make better
solar cells
so what about for battery you're all
familiar with a lithium-ion battery now
you know the laptop you have it's
powered by lithium-ion battery so
although your cell phones are powered by
a lithium ion battery lithium fire I'm
better will really dominate the positive
portable electronics now we are thinking
very hard can we use lithium ion battery
for doing something even bigger one area
is is electrical vehicles can you use
battery to power vehicles as the sole
power source instead of using gasoline
gasoline is really polluting the whole
world a power culture of greenhouse gas
comes from the you know transportation
consumption and gasoline so it would be
nice if you can use battery to power the
electrical vehicles but what's the
critical problems in batteries one
critical problem is deep you need higher
energy and power density higher energy
density means you want to have a battery
in your car and then you can drive for
300 miles without charging it you don't
want your car to be charged like every
50 miles that won't be good and higher
power density means if you want your car
to accelerate to the certain speed you
really really need to crank up the power
a lot the current battery technology is
not good enough for doing that yet of
course you want it to be cheap and the
current technology battery technology is
not cheap current elite in mind bad
battery technology is using lithium
cobalt oxide copper is very expensive
it's toxic and also there's no enough
cover in the world to supply to go into
electrical vehicles so we are coming
from the nanotechnology standpoint we
want to impact these areas a lot
especially to improve the higher energy
the power density when you look at the
problems and lithium-ion batteries now
how can you increase the power for
example so power is life you have higher
kaolin you get higher power that also
means if you can you can get lithium
very fast into the electro and all that
we lack shows the battery lectures then
your power gets higher so the key thing
is you want to maximize the surface time
to areas between the battery electrode
and the electrolyte so that's what nano
can do nano nano materials has really
really high surface to volume ratio so
surface area is high so you can have
high interfacial area with electrolytes
so in my group we are using nano wires
and contact by this red color
electrolyte so you can see the surface
area gets increased by a lot compared to
the color lithium ion battery technology
by doing that that we hope the power
density can can goes higher we also have
the reason why the energy density can go
higher apologize don't have time to to
mention that to you so we are also
looking at the areas try to make a
better non-volatile memory and I'm going
to just give this and come to the
conclusion so I give you the examples
and three areas of active research
develop the tools for a nanotechnology
produced nano structure engineer the
structures and the animator skills so
the first two areas are pretty much more
or less mature so we know how to
maintain all structures we have really
powerful tools to look at the Nano
structure what we need is can we really
impact the application with nano
materials that's the key thing the
public has been looking into nano
technology for a while they're eager to
see some meaningful some critical
application coming out of the nano
materials so if this application can
range you from trans
non-volatile memory battery technology
solar cells and biosensors it's hard to
predict which one will stand out first
but all them all have the potential so
thank you for your attention and I will
be happy to entertain any questions
the nanotechnology-based solution is low
at this moment so conventional solar
cell if you look at a single crystal
silicon nickel up to 18 19 percent poly
crystalline silicon about Tzeitel
percent also and Collin nanotechnology
solar cell based on the organic polymer
plan together with an organic structure
go up to five percent seven percent
there's still a long way to go for me a

or so so it's certainly still have the
potential to go higher
