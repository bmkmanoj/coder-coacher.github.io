the next installment of the quantum AI
speaker lecture series today we're gonna
be hearing from Professor garnet chan
who is now professor at Caltech having
very recently moved from Princeton where
who's a professor for several years
before he was at Cornell garnets group
is known for being one of the most sort
of prominent research groups in the
development of methods for electronic
structure theory which comprises
theoretical chemistry and also some
material science so in particular his
group is known for developing very
efficient high accuracy methods for
simulating quantum systems and also
techniques for sort of using those high
precision methods to gain useful
insights about real systems so without
further ado it's professor Qian all
right
thanks Ryan sure it's all working okay
great so because I work I can only so
think of one side of time I mainly point
at this side they don't get a point okay
so so it's really great to be here
and you know this is the first time I've
ever been on the Google campus so it's
it's very interesting to see how it's
all laid out and I've already had a
chance to sample some of the free food
and you know it was great and you know
they were I can remember periods in my
life where I basically go anywhere if
free food was offered so you know one of
the reasons why I'm here
but of course now's the time to to do
some work and so and so here I'm going
to tell you a little bit about some of
my research so so the title of my talk
is simulating the quantum world on a
classical computer but but before I saw
get into talk I would just say a little
bit about the level that this talk has
pitched at so when I was doing this talk
together I emailed Ryan my host and
asked you know what sort of people were
going to attend and he said well they're
gonna be people who are experts in quan
mechanics and quantum computation you
know there'll be some of the people and
then they're gonna be people who are
soft
computer scientists who are who are you
know very tech savvy but might not
really be be physicists and then in
addition you know there might be people
this might be on YouTube and there might
be people anywhere in the world watching
it so you know I'm used to teaching
classes in college where you have a
range of abilities a range of
backgrounds but you know that's a really
big spread in preparation for this talk
and so what I've tried to do and this
will be an experiment is I've tried to
make a talk which has a little bit of
something for each of those three kinds
of audience members and so if you're
someone who is an expert in core
mechanics take on computing then you
know you know just sit back and relax
and you know have have a little fun with
me in the first half of this talk and
we'll get to the to do all the detailed
technical stuff towards the end and if
you're someone who really doesn't know
any qualms mechanics then then I'm
really going to try and hold your hand
all through the first half is talk and
try and teach you some core mechanics
and then when they get to the second
half I would let go of your hand but
hopefully you'll have absorbed enough
that the general gist of what I'm trying
to say will make some sense okay so
let's start and let's start with who I
am and perhaps what I what I am so so so
I'm a theoretical chemist and that means
I'm the kind of chemist who doesn't do
any experiments and in fact I remember
precisely the last time I did an
experiment and it wasn't actually so
long ago was that six years ago in 2010
and it was when I was doing some
community outreach in an elementary
school and teaching the little children
how to make batteries out of a piece of
fruit in some pencil led and and I
distinctly remember out of the various
things on that day not being able to do
that experiment so so so there's a
picture of me where the kids are helping
me with my battery and and that's why
I've ended up a theorist so so what do I
do is a theoretical campus well in
essence what I try and do is I translate
the world of chemistry on a computer
rather than do experiments and and since
the world of chemistry is a world of
atoms and molecules and the atoms and
molecules are governed by the laws of
quantum mechanics this this is basically
the same thing as similar
the quantum world so in the first part
of the talk I'm going to try to explain
what Quan mechanics is and what the
quantum world is and then look at why
trying to carry out the simulation of
this world it appears to be very hard if
you just have the kinds of computers
that we have today the classical
computers and then in the second half of
this talk I would sort of turn this
question on its head and and and point
out some of the reasons why we now
believe actually simulating common tanks
isn't as hard as we first thought and
can in fact be done on classical
computers and I'll give you some reasons
why this is the case and some examples
of these simulations and the reason why
this complexity of Ko mechanics is often
really just an illusion is actually
related to many ideas that would be
familiar if you have a background in
computer science from machine learning
and so I'll draw the connections to
machine learning and of course the
implications for corn computing at the
end of the talk okay
but first let's begin with what the
quantum world is and so the quantum
world is the world of atoms and
molecules and understanding that the
world around us is made of these
discrete units
you know atoms and molecules is perhaps
why the most fundamental insights we've
ever achieved as a human race and that's
that's something that Richard Feynman of
course the famous physicist at Caltech
pointed out very eloquently where he he
said well you know if all humanity's
knowledge was wiped out in some sort of
catastrophic event and you could only
preserve one piece of wisdom to pass on
to future generations
you know what would that be and as he
argued that would be the fact that all
things are made of atoms now for such an
important fact you'd think we would have
known about this for a very long time
but as it turns out the acceptance of
this atomic hypothesis is a relatively
recent event I mean even up to a hundred
years ago whether or not matter was
discrete you know was made up of
individual units or just some continuous
substance what was was widely debated in
a hundred years is is not such a long
time and that people on the planet who
were more than a hundred years old so
they were around when this was this was
a question that people thought about the
the the the the
was finally settled in a nice
collaboration between some theoretical
ideas from Einstein and expert careful
experiments by French physicist called
Perrin who who was a Nobel laureate in
the early part of the 20th century and
the experiment he carried out was to
take some very fine particulate matter
so so that could be like pollen grain or
it could be say a starch granule you
know if you take a potato and squeeze it
you can get some starch granules out and
you place that grain on the surface of a
fluid so that so that might be like some
water and you and you observe what
happens under the microscope
now if the fluid water is really a
continuous substance and you ask well
what should I expect to see for the
motion of the pollen grain well well
perhaps a pollen grain will stay
stationary or if there are some currents
it should move smoothly around the
surface of the water but that's not what
you see what you actually observe if you
mow if you follow the path of the pollen
grains you see that's very jagged motion
where the particles seems to change
direction very abruptly at various
points in time and the only reasonable
way of explaining what what happens and
this was what what Einstein worked out
was to deduce that water is not actually
a continuous substance but made up of
little bits little bits atoms and
molecules and these abrupt changes of
direction correspond to those molecules
bumping randomly at random times into
the pollen grain or starch granule
imparting some momentum ok so so this
was really experiment that sort of
convinced scientists that the world is
made of discrete units atoms and
molecules but as you see it's really
quite an indirect type of evidence and
if we go now to the 21st century to the
modern day
we have much clearer evidence that atoms
exist and perhaps the most evocative
image of of the reality of atoms is
provided by an instrument known as a
scanning tunneling microscope the
scanning tunneling microscope is its in
essence just a circuit which has a
battery and some wires sticking out and
the special thing about the wire is that
the tip of the wire is extremely sharp
so you can make these wires so sharp at
the bottom that they're essentially
just one atom sharp or one atom thick at
the very end and and the way you use
this microscope is you attach it to a
material so you attach one end of the
wire to the material and you take the
other end and bring it around and bring
the tip all the way down to the surface
of the material now if you made the tip
touch the material itself then you would
complete the circuit and the current
would flow but as it turns out you don't
have to bring the tip all the way down
to the surface you can leave a little
gap and and some current will still
cross that little gap that's called
tunneling or the current and the amount
of current that crosses that gap the
strength of the current depends on the
distance from the surface of the
material studying and so so because
atoms are you know kind of round so if
you move the tip and it goes across this
of top round bill the atom you get a lot
of current because you're close to the
top of the atom and you move into the
bits in between the atoms where you can
be atoms dip down you'll see a small
current and you can register this as you
move the tip scan it back and forth and
so and so you can see an image where you
produce the image of the shape of the
atoms with the with the scanning Tahlia
microscope and this is a beautiful
example of corporate research because
the scanning sorry microscope was
developed at IBM as you can see it turns
out that you can even pick up atoms with
this technique you could bring it down
the eyes one size to stick to the tip
and and so they position the atoms and
scanned by moving their tip across to
produce this very nice image now almost
30 years ago so so today we do have
direct evidence of atoms and we can even
manipulate the atoms themselves we can
pick them up with these very precise
machines but these are not easy
experiments and these are not you know
cheap pieces of equipment you know you
don't have them in your kitchen and and
fundamentally even though we can't
directly access atoms there's still it's
still not it's it's never going to be an
easy task to directly interrogate them
and it the answer is very the reason for
this is just very simple it's because
you know humans you know we have these
like fat pudgy fingers right and atoms
are extremely small and there are ten
orders of magnitude and scale between
the size of
human human finger and the size of an
atom and try bridgett scale
experimentally is always going to be a
challenge and so that motivates a
different way to try to interrogate the
world of atoms and molecules and that's
to not try to study it experimentally
but to try and recreate it digitally
inside a computer and so you can study
just the simulation of the atoms inside
your silicon chip rather than having to
carry out a complicated experiment and
so the goal of this of this this type of
project is to really produce the same
sort of thing as you see in the movie
The Matrix right so so if you remember
in the matrix what you had was some race
of beings who had created some
simulation of the world to which which
was so realistic that when you start the
humans inside of them they couldn't tell
that world was real or if it was was a
simulation and that's what we're really
trying to achieve now but for the more
modest goal of simulating the world of
atoms and molecules not the entire world
around us now of course you know when we
when I say simulate this world I don't
mean you know generate computer graphics
or some kind of animation you know you
really want it to be actually faithful
to the true world and that means that we
have to follow the physical laws that
govern atoms and molecules which are
laws of quantum mechanics and trying to
faithfully emulate these laws you know
as precisely as possible on a computer
is a go of what I try to do any and
essentially what my whole field of
research quantum chemistry is about um
now if you're not a scientist and
perhaps not everyone in this room is a
scientist this statement is sometimes
surprising and this Dame is perhaps less
surprising if you are scientists it
turns out that the laws of nature are in
fact for all intents and purposes
completely known now aside from some
very very extreme cases for example at
the very very beginning of the
university an adjuster of the Big Bang
or perhaps on some minut scales of 10 to
minus 35 meters something basically you
never probe experimentally we know
exactly or how all the fundamental
particles work and how they interact
with each other
and if you make this kind of statement
you know you can have sort of two kinds
of reactions so you might have the
reaction well we know all the
fundamental laws of physics well that's
the end of physics you know that's the
end of the world and you know one can
adopt that attitude but but actually
what most people think today and the
attitude that that I have myself is that
actually this is not the end of the road
but it's the beginning of a new a new
and beautiful journey and the reason why
it's it's a start of a new journey is
because just because we know the
behavior of the individual particles and
how they interact with each other in
pairs this doesn't mean we understand
how all those interactions combine when
you have assemblies of thousands or
millions or billions of particles to
produce all the complexity that we see
in the world around us like like life
for example so so the situation I would
say in physics today is is is is can be
illustrated by a chess analogy so the
way physics is today we basically know
the rules of chess we know all the rules
of chess
there aren't any like missing rules like
catching a porn on pass on that we
haven't yet put into the game so we know
all the rules of chess but even though
we know the rules of chess that's a very
different thing from understanding how
those rules build on top of each other
when the many pieces in a game and you
apply the rules many times to generate
the game of chess so so this fact that
having just lots of stuff around even if
you know the fundamental laws can
generate some unexpected complexity
which is really encapsulated a nice
phrase by my former colleague at
Princeton Phil Anderson that more is
different and more is especially
different when you go into the world of
quantum mechanics so when you have many
quantum particles interacting they can
produce some truly exotic and unexpected
behavior and it's a challenge of
capturing these unexpected types of
phenomena that that is the sin that is
that is the challenge of simulating the
quantum world okay so now let me talk a
little bit about quantum mechanics and
what the quantum world is and
and to sew place chroma keyers in
perspective is it's it's useful to
understand where we apply it as
physicist the kinds of phenomenon which
we apply it to it's for this is and so
we can divide the phenomena in the
universe or in the world into sort of
different categories based on length and
time scales and so on the larger scales
of the universe then really the right
theory to use to answer questions people
pose like why galaxies distributed the
way they are in space is a theory of
general relativity and then when we go
down perhaps to the human scale which
the scale of about a meter in size or a
second and time then the sort of most
convenient theory to apply is the good
old Newtonian mechanics that Isaac
Newton worked out four hundred years ago
I mean it's not an exact theory it's an
approximate theory but it works it's so
well that and it's so easy to do that
that's the best thing to do for for
human size phenomena and then when you
go beneath that scale down to say ten to
the minus six meters or or below then
that's the regime where quantum
mechanical effects become important so
so I'd like to say that Co mechanics is
really the theory of the small but even
though it's a fear of the sport has very
big consequences because almost all the
properties of materials that you see
around you do you not sure cannot arrive
if you just do classical mechanics they
arrive they arise due to intrinsic
quantum mechanical behavior so if I were
to look at say asked likewise the
materials here in color or you know why
is something and metal and why some an
insulator or even something like if I
take a gecko why is the feet sticky you
know these are all things that arise due
to quantum effects and they don't exist
in the classical theory or in relativity
okay so um so we're going to look at
quantum mechanics applied to atoms and
molecules and if the last time you did
three so chemistry was in high school
then then this would maybe your picture
of a yachtie so you have a nucleus and
the electrons are fizzing around in
orbits and maybe if you did you know AP
chemistry or then you'd also learn that
the molecule has has bonds in it and
those bonds are made by sharing pairs of
electrons with each other
now since you know everyone in the room
is is another out so I think it's safe
that I can say this that you know
everything you learn in high school
chemistry or physics is is it's a
complete lie right completely force
because that's not really what an atom
looks like it doesn't look like this you
don't have these well-defined particles
going in nice orbits really an atom is
is kind of fuzzy and and and that's a
general feature in core mechanics that
everything is everything that you think
of as normally being a very well-defined
object is is kind of fuzzy around the
edges now fuzzy is not a very precise
term but but the technical term for
fuzziness is that things behave like
waves and so the motion of a fuzzy
particle is not the motion of a point is
not a motion of a point like particle
it's a motion of a wave and we see this
from the following so if we imagine a
non fuzzy particle like a billiard ball
okay it's very soft discreet and hard
and you and you think of how its how it
moves through space you can describe its
position for example from its center of
mass at every point in time and it's
very very clear but if I take a fuzzy
object you know its fuzziness means that
it has some shape and if it has some
shape then while traveling you can the
shape can also distort so so far the
object will be something whose shape can
change with time and mathematically the
motion of something with shapes is just
wave motion the wave is just something
that has a wave form and that wave form
it can move around in the wave form the
shape can change with time
so so the individual quantum particles
like the electron or like the proton and
so and so forth they have this intrinsic
fuzziness which means that when they
move around the motion is best described
by mathematical equations which look
like the equations that describe wave
now the juxtaposition of these two words
wave and particle that in colloquial
usage have very different meanings
causes all sorts of angst when you first
come across core mechanics and and you
can see this angst when you go into the
Internet
and let's say you type something into a
search engine like Yahoo and and I
report here a something that I actually
the precise in a verbatim thing that
came up when I search wave particle
duality so it's this thing on Yahoo
Answers right in corn physics how come
one particle could exist in multiple
places duh
it's notable because I don't know if
that's a question or an answer actually
but but the basic issue is of course if
something is fuzzy around the edges it's
quite hard to say where it is so if you
were to look at the wave just a
classical water wave and you just say
well is it here or is it here or is it
there or maybe it's a maybe it's a
little bit in all the places well you
know it's not entirely clear what you
would answer and there's the same
difficulty in arching the question about
where fuzzy particle is and quano
mechanics so if I take this fuzzy
electron and I say is it here is it here
is it here I carry some measurements to
detect where it is you actually find
that your measurements report that some
percent of the time they'll read out
that the electron is here and some
percent of the time to read up the
electrons here and some percent of the
time the read of electrons there okay so
so quality Kanaks because of its
fuzziness it gives rise to an intrinsic
probabilistic spread in the results of
measurements if you ask is something
going this way or that way you don't get
a definite answer you get just some
probability that you see this or that so
another way that we can think about this
fuzziness approach is that really the
particle is a combination of different
scenarios with different measurements so
a single particle if you carry a
measurement might might seem to be here
10% of time and here 20% of time here
40% of the time and so I can actually
think of a particle as being a
superposition of all these positive
possibilities weighted by some
probabilities and again write down a
function a probability function
probability density for observing to the
particle here or here or here and this
probability density is just one step
removed from the most fundamental object
and call me
which is the wavefunction which is the
quantity on the right hand side and so
this wave function is the mathematical
object that behaves a bit like a wave
but it really is a wave of probabilities
of different measurements that's the
wave that is being propagated in the
equations and indeed if I look at the
mathematical equation for water wave it
basically tells you the height of the
wave at different positions on this
coordinate and this mathematical
equation looks almost exactly like the
quantum wave equation except the only
difference is now we interpret this
height of the wave that you're being
sold that's being sold for
mathematically as telling you the
probability of seeing different things
in your quantum mechanical experiments
now you can ask well how do I solve this
equation you know it's a differential
equation and you know in certain simple
cases you can solve it on a piece of
paper and you know like when we teach
this to our undergraduates you give them
the special very special problems where
they can solve on a piece of paper but
let's say you can't solve it on a piece
of paper it turns out this equations
it's still very easy to solve on a
computer because if I take this this of
probability wave you want to find out
its value at different positions in
space so what you do on your computer is
you put down the grid in space maybe a
billion points but a billion points a
billion numbers is a very small set of
numbers for a modern computer ok so even
if you put down this very very dense
grid with lots where with many many
points all over space to try and solve
this equation it's actually very easy to
do so solving this kind of shredding
equations is essentially trivial on
modern fast computers and so does this
mean that simulating car mechanics is
very easy I told you the equations used
to solve and the answer is well no
because so far I've only talked about a
single particle so now let me talk about
two particle and many particle core
mechanics which is where things start
become mysterious and harder okay so
first let
talk about two particles and I'm going
to illustrate in some abstract way
because I don't know how to draw out
some quantum states of two particles
that say somewhere distribute in the box
and in just the same way that I could
think about the state of one particle
one fuzzy electron as being a mixture of
probabilities of an electron being here
or an electron being here an electron
being there I can similarly think of the
state of two particles as being some
superposition a mixture perhaps of the
two electrons being distributed like
this or the two electrons being
distributed like this that'd be an
example of a fuzzy state of the two
particles now now the interesting thing
about this particular mixture of of
positions is that that it actually has
what we call correlation between the
particle positions in other words if I
just look at these two is a set of
possible set of possibilities for what
the system is doing you'll notice that
if I make a measurement and I see a
particle on the left-hand side of the
box then you will know because these are
this is the system's only made of these
two possibilities that there will be a
particle always on the right-hand side
of the box so so the so the two parts
always seem to be correlated if you
measure one on the left and the other
one we find the right found on the right
you measure on the right one will be
found on the left
so there's correlations between the
properties between the measurements on
individual particles is what is known as
quantum entanglement
now entanglement is yes another of those
say those aspects of coma cats which
causes a lot of confusion and and and it
makes people unhappy and and so once
again if you go to Yahoo Answers you see
something like this I I read about this
phenomena and seen quantum entanglement
transmit data with internet speed is
this correct
now you notice the internet so you of
course it's not correct and this is the
most common misconception about
entanglement that it allows particles to
transmit data very quickly between
places but I think it's worth
understanding how this misconception
arises and this misconception
because we build a mental model that
that is actually actually has a floor in
it okay so so the way in which you can
look at a problem that makes it seem as
if data is being transmitted with
infinite speed is the following so if I
say let's take the same exam system that
exists in this superposition of these
two possibilities and I ask what's the
probability just overall of seeing a
blue particle on the left or the right
you'll find that there's a 50% chance
that the blue path on the left and the
50% chance that the blue particles are
right and the way we usually think about
this is that this is an intrinsic
property of the particle in all ways if
you are the blue particle then you'll
have a 50% chance of being a left blue
particle 50% chance of being a right
blue particle and similarly you can say
the same thing for the red particle
right so you can say well if I'm the red
particle and you look at and there's a
50% chance that it's on the left or the
right and you think of that as an
intrinsic property of the red particle
and so it becomes very mysterious with
this kind of mindset that if you find
the blue particle on the left then all
of a sudden you see the red particle
with 100% probability on the right you
seem to have changed some fundamental
intrinsic property of the red particle
and if you think from that that kind of
mindset then it seems like the blue
particle has told the red particle to
suddenly appear on the right and this is
what makes people think that you can
transmit information through
entanglement but it's of course just
that the wrong mental picture because
what your mind is is really constructing
is solve the following so you when you
when I tell you there's a 50% chance to
see red particles and left and right you
make this mental image of where the
particles are and then when you see say
there's a 50% chance of blue possible on
the left right you make this mental
image and then for the total combined
states of the two particles inside your
head it's most natural to think that it
really looks like this that there's a
25% probability that the states the
system is in this state or in this state
on this state on this state but in
actuality there's no reason why when I
built the quantum state of two particles
that I had to prepare it
away there has this set of probabilities
associated with it in fact the
particular Quan state I prepared did not
even have these two possibilities it was
just a mixture of these two
and so all that's happening when you see
a kind of odd effects of entanglement is
it just reflects the way that the
quantum state was prepared in the
beginning not as perhaps the most
intuitive set of superposition of states
where all these possibilities allowed
but as perhaps some slightly
non-intuitive or peculiar combination
okay now so far I've been talking about
one particle two particles you'll notice
that even when I was talking about two
particles even if these particles only
had the property that they could be on
the left or the right there are still
four possibilities that had to keep
track of in principle for the different
possible things I could see right so I
could I have to keep a track of the
probability that I see this event or the
probability that the distribute this or
like this or like this so they're four
possibilities there and I've written
down numbers 0 means particles on the
left one is parts on the right and and
the probabilities are this function side
now it's not a hard to see that if I now
go from two particles to many many more
particles let's say a thousand particles
that you'd have to keep track of many
many more probabilities so in particular
if I had a thousand particles and each
particle could be either on the left of
the right and I had to keep track of all
these possible configurations that can
be mixed together in the quantum state
then I'd have to write this wave
function that that is a function of a
binary string of numbers where you have
1,000 zeros or ones and that's an
enormous set of numbers so 2 2 that's 2
to 1000 and that's that's this is this
is not correct that's 10 to the 300 but
in any case it's a very very large very
large number of possibilities and it's
this it's this gigantic blossoming of
possible ways of particles behaving
simultaneously that makes more increment
Kanaks very very hard
this leads to a kind of depressing
viewpoints on car mechanics because what
we're saying is we know these
fundamental equations of nature but when
you have more than just a handful of
particles you have to keep track of an
exponential set of possibilities and and
and that just doesn't seem it doesn't
seem feasible and indeed if you were
going to the go back to the 20th century
you see statements written all the time
that are really quite depressing so for
example this is from the year 2000
no David pies and Bob Laughlin both very
famous people Bob bluffin was a Nobel
laureate in physics for the fractional
quantum Hall effect and he wrote the
training equation cannot be so backed me
when the number of particle exceeds
about 10 and then they go on to make the
precise prediction that no computer
existing or that will ever exist you
know can break this barrier because of
the catastrophe of dimension by which
they simply mean that if you increase
the number of particles and keep and
have to count how many possibilities for
the drawing
behaviors all these particles it's
growing so rapidly that you will never
be able to tackle it on an augury
computer but what we've really learned
though in the last 15 years you know the
time since this type of statement used
to be popular is that this complexity is
in almost all cases not actually really
there
you know it's what we call an illusion
of complexity it appears to be there
when you write the equations down at
first but if you actually look in the
world around you for it you don't
actually see it so basically there are
all these possibilities for how a
quantum system will behave but they're
just very very hard to observe so so a
concrete example of this is if you take
Schrodinger's cat okay so sharing is cat
is a quantum state that's a mixture of
the other state where all the atoms are
in such a way that the cat is dead with
a cat whose atoms are in such a state
that the cat's alive again look then so
you can take it's a valid quantum state
to say I'm in this fuzzy picture where
the cat is 50% dead and 50% alive but
but as we all know if you actually true
to look for sharing his cat you you
never you never see sharing his cat in
reality so so for most physical systems
I like this cartoon yeah so for most
physical systems this exponential set of
possibilities is not real and and you
can sort of go back and ask why why is
nature why does nature not allow this
complete exponential set of
possibilities at least at the energy
scales that we usually look at and and
and the deep reason is that we live in
quite a special type of world it's not
like a world where you have arbitrary
interactions between all the particles
so if you take the fundamental particles
they only interact pairwise at time and
the interactions between the pairs of
parcels are very simple so if I were to
take in atoms and molecules the Coulomb
Coulomb's law Coulomb interaction is
just something that's strong when the
strong interaction when the parts are
close together and when you go very far
away sort of dies off to zero so it's a
very simple nature of these interactions
which which I essentially applied many
many times so when you have a system
that is the where the where the
electrons are bumping off each other
many many times they feel these
interactions many many times these
simple interactions impart the structure
to the resulting quantum states that we
see and make them also correspondingly
very simple so so the type of
possibilities that we see the type of
super positions of many particle States
that are physically relevant are not
these generally entangled States which
are mixtures of arbitrary possibilities
for the quantum systems but only what
are so-called locally entangled States
and by local entanglement I kind of mean
that I mean that if you take a system
with particles that are so stuck in a
small region of space then then over
this small region of space you do need
to keep track of all the possibilities
for what the quantum particles can do
simultaneously but if I go to a larger
problem where you have some well
separated regions for the for the
different compartments then if you find
that if you make measurements on
say you know the part of the system here
and the part of the system which is
outside the door then in the typical
state that we see in the world there's
no correlation between those
measurements they behave as if they're
independent and so this the cavity
principle is a principle that you
generally only see document Angwin means
that you don't need to keep track of
this exponentially growing set of
possibilities but only the possibilities
that incur together in small nearby
regions of space and this removes the
complexity and one can see in some
qualitative sense and then the technical
question is how do I rewrite the laws of
quantum mechanics or rewrite the
mathematics of car mechanics to build
this physical simplification in okay so
so to do this I'm going to have to
introduce what entanglement is it
slightly more mathematical way but not
much more
so so consider a system which has got
two regions in it okay so it's got left
region let's go right region okay one
and two and and and this symbol n will
denote some property that you measure in
the region so so for example you might
think n denotes the number of particles
you find in a given region so you can
write down your wave function which
describes the probabilities of finding
itself particles in region one or
several particles in region two and if
you have no entanglement then this wave
function this probability function would
just factorize so that tells you because
the probability is factorized that
there's no correlations between
measurements in regions 1 and 2 ok so
what does it mean for you have an
entangled State
well in that case this wave function
doesn't factorize and instead of writing
it just as a product of probabilities
you now have to write it as a sum over
products of probabilities and there's
this index of summation here
and it's the summation over many types
of positive probabilities which
generates the entanglement loosely
speaking if you have more terms in the
sum then you have more more entanglement
in the system and you can think of these
individual probabilities appearing now
as kind of conditional probability
amplitudes so this basically says what's
the probability of measuring the
property n1 in region 1 given some
information I that has been communicated
from the neighboring state to ok
neighboring region 2 okay so so we can
see now mathematically how you can
generate entanglement
just in in these mathematical symbols
and that now allows me to explain what I
mean by local entanglement so so in a
state with no containment let's first
consider a system well with 3 spatial
region so that's generalized a little
bit and first the state with no
entanglement the process probability
this wave function probability amplitude
then again just factorizes into three
sets of probabilities and now I know
that if I want to put entanglement back
into the system I have to write it as a
set of sums of probabilities but I write
in a special way so that only locally
regions are coupled together and so this
would be a locally entangled state where
I'm now summing over sets of
probabilities associated with regions 1
2 &amp;amp; 3 but the summation is such that the
probabilities in regions 1 &amp;amp; 2 are
directly coupled and the conditional
probabilities in 2 &amp;amp; 3 directly coupled
so if it were more genuine tangle States
I also have a couple you know 1 &amp;amp; 3 as a
region and so this is a mathematical
form of the wave function where there's
only entanglements explicitly between
regions 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 which which if you
imagine the regions on the line means
that the entanglement is only present
locally so I can generalize that to
arbitrary regions so let me now not just
have 3 regions but an arbitrary number
of regions all regions and now this
complicated wave function is again
written as a product of probabilities
that all coupled together in this in
this local way and usually you know this
is a formula with lots and lots of
variables and indices and we it's kind
of tricky to write out all the time like
this so so usually we use a notation
that is more of a picture and so I say
well on this left hand side I have this
gigantic set of numbers it's a gigantic
array of numbers and that's inside the
wave function or gigantic tensor and I
draw this array or tensor like this
where these are the indices
the array or the tensor here I've just
drawn three indices now L indices but
just for simplicity and then this type
of approximation to this tensor is
equivalent by saying I can rewrite this
picture in terms of these little
probability objects these lower
dimensional tensors lower rank tensors
and connect them all together sum them
over these over these indices i1 i2
which is denoted by these bonds now the
achievement in reduction complexity
moving from this picture if for storage
is of course immense because on the left
hand side you have an exponential set of
numbers exponentially large set of
numbers in the tensor and on the right
hand side you only have a linear linear
complexity in terms of how much storage
you have as a system size grow so going
from an exponential to linear is
ofcourse you know this of course an
amazing reduction in cost but the only
reason why we can achieve this is
because the types of states we see
around us are very very special quantum
states in not the arbitrary types of
quantum state states in principle
allowed ok so um so here I've generated
local entanglement in that in some very
one-dimensional like way I've joined
region 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 and so and
so forth but you can of course connect
these regions in in an arbitrary Network
and so for example this would this was
the connection I showed earlier that's
suitable in the 1 dimensional geometry
and this is something known as a matrix
product state which people have studied
in physics for more than twenty years
now but you can also consider other ways
of joining all these tenses together and
this would be an example of how you join
them together to describe a two
dimensional system and you could put
join them in a cube to describe a three
dimensional system and so and so forth
ok so all this now presents a concrete
mathematical machinery to write down
only the relevant quantum states that
actually occur in nature and we can now
use this machinery to actually carry out
the simulation not just for one particle
two particles or ten particles but
really for hundreds of particles and
this is something that my group has done
over the last few years and you can see
I was just
a few examples of this so this would be
a simulation on the active site of the
oxygen-evolving complex which is saw the
heart of photosynthesis so if you think
why is it that plants do right they take
sunlight in and they convert water into
oxygen and other things and it all takes
place in a few atoms in the middle of an
enzyme and then we're going to show
those few atoms here I mean they're
surrounded by all sorts of gunk but but
I just show this at the important atoms
and if I were to try and write down a
wave function that described all the
possible quantum behaviors of the
electrons in these atoms even making
lots and lots of simplifications every
quick quiet very large number of
elements about 10 to the 18 elements but
if I instead build a wave function by
writing down tensors on each of the
atoms in fact you write down a few
tensors on each atom because as more
than one electron pattern then you can
represent this wave function essentially
all the way down to numerical precision
you mean in other words essentially
numerically exactly with a very very
small number of elements and given this
parameterization I can solve the wave
equation the Schrodinger equation and I
can ask questions about how this
molecule behaves and this for example is
just a pretty picture that just shows
you how the entanglement is is spread
out across across this molecule I'll
show you another example which which I
think realizes the dream we had in the
beginning of realizing the matrix you
know for atoms and molecules and that
was very creating the world of atoms
molecules so precisely that we can't
tell the difference between the
simulation and the experiment and so
this is something that we did for simple
material which is benzene crystal of
just crystallized
crystallized organic system and here we
asked a simple question about this
material which is what's the amount of
energy that's holding the material
together that's the so called lattice
energy and you can do this calculation
and it has lots of terms in it and you
so you compute all these different terms
and you add them all up and then you
obtain a number which is the theoretical
estimate just form quantum mechanics and
with no other assumptions for the
lattice energy of the system now now
this is a mode
material that has been studied many many
times and this last energy has been
measured through many many experiments
and there's an accepted experimental
number and the accepted experimental
number is is this number here 51 and a
half kilojoules versus 56 kilojoules now
you might say you know that's not so
different it's pretty good right but but
but actually they don't actually agree
within the error bars and so so that
needs you to two inescapable conclusions
only one of which could be right okay
and assuming that we haven't actually
made a mistake in what we were doing
so either because all we did was solve
chromic annex as exactly as possible if
we see this disagreement either you're
led to the conclusion that quo mechanics
is wrong or you're led to the conclusion
that all the experiments wrong and of
course the answer is that the
experiments are wrong right so so if you
go back and look at what the experiments
that are measuring you know they see
something on the dial and and they write
it down the lab book and then they have
to interpret what that number is and
there's a lot of stuff that's hidden in
the interpretation of the experimental
number if you go back through the
spiritual literature and do that
interpretation more carefully and more
accurately that will bring that
experimental number back up to into
agreement with theory which is really
how a theories like the world to work
and is an example of a case where we
really can simulate the world of atoms
and molecules in a real material more
precisely now than we can measure it
with accurate experiment okay now let me
I don't know what the time is but I
think I'm coming towards the end is that
right so let me finish with a few slides
that explain why I'm down here today so
the Google and I this is got two parts
and the first part is the following if I
take tensile networks and I describe
them which was this way I wrote down the
wave function right and I described them
just in an abstract mathematical way
then they represent the nonlinear
parameterization of a complicated many
variable function
and there might be some of you who have
seen this type of phrase used in
different setting because an artificial
neural network is also just a nonlinear
parameterization of a complicated very
variable function and so you can ask
well you know is this similarity a deep
analogy or is it just words and the
answer to this is no one really knows
for sure right now but it mainly looks
like it's a very compelling resemblance
between the two because if I look for
example at tensile Network we didn't
discuss this as a mirror eye but we
didn't talk about this one but this is
one that people also use you know this
picture looks really very similar to
this picture now the individual symbols
in the picture actually do not mean the
same thing so for example each of these
lines here represents the summation now
in this type of neural network picture
this just means an input okay so it
aligns or not so that it's not a direct
equivalence but there's clearly a lot of
analogies between the two and so one can
then ask a question well let's say is a
deep analogy then then what are the
implications so one of the first
implications would be to say well we
know a lot about physics qualm physics
and the physics of tensile networks and
we have all these well-defined theories
renormalization group theory of
entanglement that we use to understand
tension networks well perhaps these can
be used to understand how neuro networks
actually work we'll say for example how
deep learning works and people actually
have begun to embark on this task and
there's for example paper which I think
is well known by now from matron Schwab
which maps the renormalization group
which lies behind tensor network
algorithms on to the structure of deep
learning and vice versa
now another implication is we have so
many artificial neural networks in the
world you know I'm very new to this
field and all I can say it's you know
every time I read it you know you can
say Watson
what's an r3 from your network well
there's like millions of different kinds
right millions of examples and so
perhaps some of these newer networks may
in fact be useful in quantum simulations
and there quite a few people who are
actually thinking about this but but the
the first paper that appeared is is from
Mateus Troy's group where they
to use a type of neural network I think
CUDA recursive both machine machine to
simulate some quantum many-body physics
and then the final thing is a final
connection is even if we stay within the
net these tensor approximations these
networks of our respective domains so
let's say I just want to work with
tensor networks in physics and chemistry
because that's what I'm - I feel
comfortable with nonetheless there are
all sorts of algorithms and a
optimization algorithms for example
gradient descent algorithms and back
propagation all these kinds of things
which were invented in the artificial
neural network community which actually
haven't been applied in the regime of
physics simulations and you can try and
transport this information from one
community to the other and so that's
something that we did very recently for
example just just as a little fun
project where we implemented a
calculation using a tensor Network
representation of the wave function but
we we did it inside tensor flow so we
repurpose the neural network type
architecture test flow to do these
quantum simulations and this allows us
to do for example automatic
differentiation which has never been
used intensive Network simulations
before and here's they're showing a
simulation the hydrogen cluster using
the typical gradient descent algorithm
intensive flow so so I'd like to you
know it's really the beginning of this
field that's at the interface between
machine learning and many-body quantum
physics and it's something that I and
others of the field very interested in
and it's something that I think would be
interesting to have a conversation with
people here at Google who have so much
expertise are in the Minish in the
machine learning side especially okay
now that's the second reason why I'm
here the second part of the Google annoy
is that is is probably why I'm going to
spend most of my time today doing and
you'll notice that everything that I've
been talking about has been trying to
simulate chronic headaches
but usually the computers we already
have you know all the Intel chips and
you know you have a quantum AI group
here and they are trying to build a
quantum computer and one of the things
that trying to use the comp computer for
is to do quantum simulations and so the
key question to answer there if you
once established so-called quantum
supremacy where you can share a quantum
computer is better than a class computer
in every possible aspect is to try to
find the type of quantum problem which
you cannot simulate on a classical
computer and then get them to do it
right yet the company allowed to do it
and so trying to understand the
crossover between the classical and
common simulations of home world is is
really a very important question to
answer if qualm computing is to become
an accepted and useful tool for physical
simulations okay
and so and so that's pretty much it so
that brings me pretty much the end so so
I gave you as I as I mentioned the
beginning a kind of slightly odd talk
today that was kind of pitched at
different levels and and I only sort of
talked a little bit about the one part
of my research but generally speaking in
my group we try and understand many
particle core mechanics with tools from
chemistry physics and computer science
we work a lot on methods like the
tensile Network methods I showed you
before we think about different kinds of
material abdications and and that's
basically it so if you're at Caltech
come and come and visit and and thank
you all for your attention
so when you were talking about how many
interactions that you needed to simulate
in the early part of the talk and I
guess that was still while you were in
the simple part so you were basically
talking about things in a kind of a 1d
manner where you only had two particles
interacting at a time yeah and they
could only be left or right you know
then you got to benzene otherwise the
first thing I was thinking of was okay
well what about aromatics where you've
got sort of fundamental interactions
between six electrons at a time and I
thought about benzene and I thought well
but benzene has all these symmetries so
what about toluene you know just just
break the symmetry that way yeah how
hard is it to completely simulate
toluene I mean I suppose it's easier
than the photosynthesis yeah so you know
you don't really need to make any
assumptions of symmetry in the
calculations and so the idea that you
want to so the general framework in
principle and in practice not all of
this is developed but the general frame
which you say you know I put down the
toluene molecule I put down a grid in
space for what to describe the different
regions of the toluene molecule and then
I build up that what total wave
functions were system by putting down
little arrays on each of those grid
points and connecting them all together
and that's the vision of what one really
wants to achieve in practice how many
particles at a time do you have - what's
the dimensionality of this problem right
I mean if you put three dimensions for
every particle what's the dimensionality
of the whole thing that you have yeah so
if the particles don't talk to each
other you can see even if each so even
if each particle has a thousand degrees
of freedom associated with it
you don't multiply out that complexity
when you have many particles and that's
what this technique is allowing you to
do because in the arbitrary quantum wave
function if we represent one particle
one region with you know 100 bits of
information then you would need 4,000
regions 100 to the thousand right but
you're writing down the total wave
function the special way that you
actually only need a linear amount of
information in the number of particles
and the number and the size of the
system but that's only if you have just
the two particle interactions right what
if you
I mean I saw that you took it up to for
electron interactions for the benzene
Chris yes
so it's something which which you can do
so long as there isn't very complicated
many particle correlations involving all
the electrons generates at the same time
but that that's something that you you
do see in the system so I mean even if
you enjoin a system where the electronic
behavior of you know seven or eight
electrons close together appears to be
complicated if you ever were large
region in space
you know the behaviors tend to decouple
so it's always this there's there's some
finite sort of a cut-off on how complex
it can become thank you I'm not an
expert in this but I'm trying to keep up
and I was wondering I was something you
were saying in my head related to like
Bezier curves or NURBS curves as far as
trying to sum together what the how they
interact is that am I getting correct
mental model there of my way off-base
well I might think awesome
you know I'm not in the experience of
things that you're saying and but as I
understand Bezier curve is a sort of a
way of representing an arbitrarily
complicated curve by breaking it down
into little segments is that it seems
very similar yeah so so there's there's
there's some similarity to that but the
but the thing that makes a qualm probe
by the quam problem is kind of harder
than the problem of approximating a
curve so the so the prom approximating a
curve if you define the complexity as
being related to the length of the curve
like you should get hard and hard to
approximate longer curve but nonetheless
if your approximate curve that's twice
as long it's really only twice as hard
you need to you need to use twice as
many interpolation points or little
Bezier segments to make the curve point
to to approximate the curve being twice
as long but in quantum mechanics you're
trying to approximate not just a curve
that in this has this one-dimensional
line but it's it's it's some function in
a very very high dimensional space and
so you find that when you increase in
our past one one to two that the
complexity doesn't double it grow it's
it's quadratic
you know and and if you go from one to
ten the complexity grows you know
explodes
okay so there's some similar themes of
approximation but there's some ways in
which it's a harder problem is there a
distance at which you just disregard the
connections yes so yes it is there like
some distance beyond which you disregard
say two parts cool like different bits
the system Doctore color for example
some ways of doing the curves we were
just discussing is they might take n
where n might be four or five or
something yeah if there's a thousand
items you only ever consider nearby
neighbors as far as plotting the wave
across them because if it gets too far
away it's yeah so consequential so there
is a something like that going on so
that's again a locality principle and
that's also kind of what is saving you
here so it's kind of saying like if I'm
trying to describe the curve of the wave
function so to speak okay with this fun
it's funny function not then indeed you
only tend to need to think about
variables associated with behavior
nearby and that's this is that's the
locality how big n might be in that like
that like not I guess n at the whole set
but how far is it is it a handful is it
five or ten well so maybe the right
measure because it's a little bit hard
to compare the quantities you're saying
with so the quantities that enter here
but maybe the right measure is like just
how many so bits of information how many
numbers do I need to keep track of at a
time and and well you know we if you
kept track of more and more you'd be
more and more accurate so the way we do
our simulations is we always keep track
of the largest you know as a scientific
computing person you just keep track of
the largest and certain amount of
numbers you can keep on the biggest
computer you have right and so that
means billions and billions of numbers
because you typically have committed and
manipulate many gigabytes of data even
terabytes of data and memory these days
thank you
so I actually I'm faculty at ASCO -
machinery and I'm graphic um although
I'm just visiting so Oh Agra talk I so I
have a question about looking at how you
decompose using the tensor magnification
it reminds me graphical model and one of
the way of looking at powerful model is
it allows you to affect write a very
complicated joint distribution into
multiple you know summation of tractable
ones yeah that is when you start into
marginalization we need to conditional
probability yeah havoc so I'm just
wondering situation like this how would
you solve that second question is more
about you can easily imagine that a
special regions right now is pre
partitioned but it has to think about
maybe they evolve or in some way you
have to build a massive scale also over
here I could go on addition of a spatial
region the so you better track ability
in terms of computation right now I just
like to get some comments and I don't
know what I'm maybe I can grab him sure
also you're not so far away you see come
around the Pasadena get some oh you're
in San Marino okay yeah you're just next
door so yeah so there's a little bit
there's quite a few things in that
comment and so you brought up graphical
models and you know I have to say I'm no
expert in machine there but I mean -
time of graphical models is is they're
very close to statistical physics models
it's like you write down something that
looks like a partition function and the
the problem that we referring to is
something that I saw omitted talking
about but it's it's when you go from the
probability distribution itself down to
a single number that computation
formally can look like is np-hard or so
so that's like saying if I this actually
is a representation of the normalization
of the distribution which is obtained by
taking something the bottom and
contracting some of the top so so there
are techniques that are made if you just
do this naively the complexity of just
creating a marginal distribution a
reduced distribution
is it's very very high I mean it
actually grows exponentially but there
are ways in which every time you
contract tenses together you you reduce
the information of them every time you
add another contraction and you're in
that way you can control the growth of
the complexity but but while you're
saying is one of the key questions about
how to make efficient algorithms with
these things and perhaps we know from
the physics side some things may be that
aren't used in machine learning so that
would be an interesting thing the second
thing you were mentioning was whether
not one should have some hierarchical
distribution decomposition in space and
the answer is in principle yes language
already make the organs even more
complicated and no one's going around to
doing it I mean you know this is why I
like pieces of software like like tensor
flow or other things that people are
developing who are real computer
scientists you know is actually very
useful because it makes it easier to
implement these things but in principle
yes
I was curious so you described how using
tensor network methods you can conquer
what is just the seeming complexity when
in factors the numbers of degrees of
freedom are much smaller yes but in your
second part Google and I when you were
saying hey maybe we can use an emerging
quantum processor yeah to do chemistry
calculations yeah so this would of
course be most helpful for cases where
these methods break right down right
could you give us some ideas for
application areas where would where you
would expect this to happen
yeah so in some sense you know this will
be the Quahog why I hope to talk to you
guys about and we'll talk more but the
problems that speaking in a non rigorous
way okay and the people here who prove
real theorems and I'm going to say some
that's just very very fuzzy but you know
the types of quantum states that are
simple are states that are generated
through with the largest imprint from
the Hamiltonians
the physical hamiltonians and and so if
i think about eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian you know the way you if you
take the lowest energy eigenstate or the
highest energy eigenstate you know the
ground state or the highest and you say
how much in that if that's in some sense
arrived at by apply the Hamiltonian to
an arbitrary state many many many times
and projects out that state and so
fortunately it turns out that at the
energy scales we look at often were
interested in these low energy states
and those are very simple right but for
classical computers or relatively simple
but well what chrome computer can access
is going out to arbitrary states that
are higher our pin energy and and those
becomes much much those become much more
difficult described on the classical
computer so so there are so for example
I take a problem that that that we
didn't talk about high temperature
superconductivity
it's now possible to for the models of
superconductivity to do extremely good
simulations
of the ground state but what happens at
finite temperature and what happens with
the excitations of the system is much
harder I mean I don't know if it's
impossible for class computers I mean I
don't think so but then you know I come
from that from that side but if they
were easier on the chrome computer that
would be great so I think I you know
probably agree with your premise that in
general the complexity of the quantum
states that we see in nature probably
don't grow exponentially in system size
in the sense that there's you know there
is you know some locality to
entanglement and so once you get sort of
past a certain correlation length you
don't need to keep track of all of the
correlations yeah but there's a question
of for systems that we might be
interested in you know just how much one
does need to keep yeah or getting to
that point where the complexity stops
growing exponentially yeah it seems like
there are a variety of systems and
particular ones that you might be
interested in for catalysis or you know
and say material properties for like
high temperature super conductivity yeah
where you might worry that while you
know formally you don't have unbounded
exponential growth yeah
you need such large you need to keep
correlation in such largely yes that
it's just you know intractable and
practice classically or you might worry
that the structure of the entanglement
is sufficiently complicated that you
don't really know how to write down a
good tensor network on sites or maybe
you don't know how to contract it
efficiently yes so what's your feeling
about these things do you think that in
general for sort of all physical states
who will be able to find a good on sots
and that you know the correlation length
isn't so big that you can handle it
classically so yeah you know I I come I
agree with all the things you're saying
and and and again there's a couple
points there to address but but what I'm
saying is you know even if I say that
for most of the quam states we're
interested in perhaps even all the quam
States we interest in you don't have
this formal exponential complexity of
in practice the complexity could be very
high you know you have a polynomial
dependence on system size and it was a
high polynomial that would be a problem
and that that's very true whether or not
that type of problem is the best problem
to pit a quantum computer against the
classical computer in an in an early
test of con supremacy is an open
question because it becomes it comes
down more to a game of pre factors
because you know if something is
exponentially scaling you can always
beat it basically right and it's so bad
but if you have two polynomials and
let's say the two polynomials are the
same polynomial you're down to game of
pre factors and then I would say given
my perspective on science issues always
has I've always come from a classical
computing world the fact that we've done
cloud computing for so long
gives us an inherent advantage for some
time with pre factors that would take
some time to achieve with corn computers
I mean one day that pre factor might be
gone now there's there's just a
practical question though are there
problems which today we can't solve on a
class computer just right this moment
you know if I said you need to know the
answer tomorrow or in a month or and
three months you know could be fine and
and there are systems like that I mean
and those of course assistance which
drive our research right but of course
I'm very optimistic that one can push
the classical algorithms to study those
systems otherwise I wouldn't be so
working on classical simulation so I
would say I think that we we probably
still can do those and the classical
computer but but the honest answer is
you know right now or for the next three
months or six months and there there
isn't a computer to do it and those are
problems some problems of catalysis and
superconductivity fall into that
category
in terms of scaling this up to larger
problems and you know use and in more
areas as a general way of solving these
kinds of problems what do you see is the
issue in terms of scalability is that
the communication in the tensor network
is so high that scaling this thing
across many many machines is a problem
or just the availability of you know
yeah if you a thousand GPUs to run this
stuff on would you would you be able to
take advantage do you you know is it
there's not enough capable grad students
to be able to run all the experiments
you want to do what's what's a robust or
scaling problem yeah well that's a
really interesting question which I flew
you know fool about a lot recently and
in the practical sense you know we when
I started as a grad student computers
were really just getting faster right
and now all that's happening is
computers are getting cheaper and that's
a very different situation to be in and
and if we're asking can we push
classical computing further to get
another two or three orders of magnitude
of speed up it's it it's not clear that
you can do that with these
general-purpose trips so so be I I think
that there's a there's you can't
paralyze these things more and more and
more you know there's the there's
there's just some limit and we're maybe
not yeah that limit but we're close to
that limit and so that is a bottleneck
it's a bore neck that classical computer
is not getting faster and and these
systems are not infinite parallel these
these so so I really think that what one
should do is really build a custom chip
to do this type of computation and
that's similar to what we've done with
with ml it's similar to what I
understand you've done but I know none
of the details all because I don't think
his public we're no mo right and and
yeah I was talking to a Googler about
this and I was saying everyone builds
custom trip with tensor networks and he
was just saying they're silent the whole
time and then the next day that's now
who came out about you know these things
oh I also may be near about him so yeah
I knew about I can
anything so and it's actually really
fantastic because the way these tensor
network computer computations are set up
you're manipulating data you think of
these tensors as data that's held in
different regions of space you know they
represent and and the computations only
involve information from nearby regions
of space so if you set up a computer
that way it would never have to have
this deep memory hierarchy we have to go
to a global memory you get some stuff
from bring it back everything we just
hold this local data and move it around
next to each other and you know building
that in hardware would be fantastic but
it lies far outside my regime of
expertise but if you know you guys may
be ready already know how to do it thank
you
