COHEN: I just want to say that we have two,
there are two parts to our talk. I'll give
the first part today. And Steve who sits here
will give the second part tomorrow. We give
it together [PAUSE] because we worked on it
together for many years in the early 70's,
in the early 70's, for about two decades or
so [PAUSE] okay. Now, before we start, we'd
like to gauge how much your knowledge of the
Internet. So here is the surprise quiz. The
question is, in the &quot;IPv4,&quot; yeah, what does
&quot;v4&quot; indicate? You have time to think about
it until the end of the class. The grade will
not be given a [PAUSE] okay, the purpose of
the talk or why we like to give it, is because
Voice over IP became very, very popular and
practically replaced the old telephony [PAUSE]
in this business, it is over billion dollars
a year. For those of you who don't remember
what a billion is, it's like giga. It's a
giga-buck business by now [PAUSE] and not
only that it is big; it is also growing awfully
fast. And those are--here are some quotes
from the trade magazine, the trade publications.
You can see number, like, 30 billion and 33%
per year, and 40% per year and the [PAUSE]
all in all in 2008 we are 106 million residential
VoIP in the country and the rate just goes
up and up. There's a diagram for that called
Moore's Law for Voice over IP. Anything you
measure, it goes exponentially of that and
you get lots of data from IDC [PAUSE] what
I want to show next is that at the very, very
beginning. This is a request to start a new
program. It's a request from the ARPA IPT.
IPT stands for Information Process and Technology
or Techniques. And the Director of ARPA IPT
send this letter to the headquarters of ARPA,
which at the time used to be ARPA and later
they change to DARPA and later change to ARPA.
And now it is DARPA for the second time and
god knows for how long. And here the computer
office which is--was called IPT, sends this
memo to the director asking to start a program
in computer networks [PAUSE] purpose for which
the ARPAnet was build was for resource sharing.
I'd like to read you some of that. This is
for the same memo, the objective of the program.
This is what made the ARPAnet happen. The
memo is--writes from the same document which
was written in June 3rd '68. At least try
to remember this date, those are the milestone.
So the first [PAUSE] to a contract is [PAUSE]
government technology of a DoD and the government
[PAUSE] trying to get more communication lines
[PAUSE] this is the budget. Over the years,
most of the money goes to communication line.
Some of it went to the--just happens that
the [PAUSE] that was exactly a million dollar.
So, I think this is the answer to why 19.
If it was 20, it would be a million and 50
[PAUSE] okay. This is a--what I show before
was a timeline of the ARPAnet as predicted.
This is the timeline of the voice activity.
If you're--we have to really start from 1962
when Packet Switching was invented by Lenny
Kleinrock at MIT in his PhD dissertation and
he invented Packet Switching. And Packet Switching
is more than saying what routers are, Packet
Switching has to do with [PAUSE] packet switching
has to do with all the issues like buffering,
and bandwidths, and the--and lots of [INDISTINCT]
that we learn the solution in. It was the
paper--it was a dissertation that Lenny Kleinrock
worked on with an officemate of him by the
name of Larry Roberts, they were both students
at MIT, in the same room. Yeah. And Lenny,
which was not a great programmer as Larry
was, needed lots of help so Larry helped him.
And Larry learned about Packet Switching when
he was a student from Lenny [PAUSE] and then
when the ARPAnet started, the first problem
was, &quot;Will it really work as predicted?&quot; So
the first thing that ARPA did was to bring
the first IMP to UCLA and called and established
a network measurement center. In this center,
they could verify the theory against reality.
And it turns out the reality was not very
much different in what was predicted. Okay,
seven years later, Larry was at ARPA, in position
to start doing it. Larry started--start by
writing these memos that I showed you to his
management and asking a million dollar for
a network. That in retrospect, it was probably
one of the best million, best-spent million
dollars of the government. Then in 1969, it
was born. In '73, they have a crazy idea which
used Packet Speech for voice or telephony.
And anyone who knew anything about telephony
could explain why it was impossible, including
Bell Lab and AT&amp;amp;T. You know, there are two--to
follow this idea which was came from Bob Kahn
who was a program manager at the ARPA at the
time. He initiated the NSC Program, NSC stands
for Network Secure Communication. The idea
was that if we can do it digitally then we
can secure. At that time, encryption was very
complicated and he simplified it a lot. By
the end of '73, we had a Network Voice Protocol
running on the ARPAnet. At '74 we had several
compression technique like CVSD and LPC. By
the end of '74, the Cerf and Kahn paper came
out. This is a paper that defined TCP or defined
the Internet [PAUSE] '75 we demonstrated the
voice message system. In '76 we had teleconferencing
which should have [PAUSE]. In '77 Bell Lab
or--and again Bell Lab issue a patent on packet
speech. Yeah. We thought it was a bit funny
that we were already demonstrating it publicly
for three or four years, they invented it
later. The IP was split in '78. I'm sorry,
IP was split from TCP in '78, we defined UDP
in order to demonstrate it to other people,
we shot a movie of it [PAUSE] and then, the
network voice protocol had to be redefined
to run over IP. Then in 1995, Interim Voice
over IP [PAUSE] anyone knows, please let me
know. I noticed that [PAUSE] you find [PAUSE]
'73 to '95 is like 22 years after it was demonstrated,
Voice over IP was coined and it
is in wide use of, yeah. RTP for Real Time
Protocol was specified later as an RFC. In
IETF, we start working on SIP [PAUSE] protocol
that Steve spearheaded in through IETF. The
crazy idea of ARPA was to get real-time voice.
In real-time voice is different in FTP. Meanwhile
to do FTP, we know how to send email, but
real-time voice is very, very different [PAUSE]
one of the more interesting thing was that
the carriers, meaning AT&amp;amp;T and all the Baby
Bells did not realize that it was competing
with them. So, they totally ignored it, even
what they called packet was very different
on what we called packet. The objective of
the NSC was to prove--was to do proof-of-concept
of the feasibility of packet-switching network
for interactive communication among people.
Now, when you say interactive communication
among people, if it should be able to wait,
to understand every word, recognize a speaker,
and maybe even better, like saying, &quot;He is
mad, he is angry, he is happy,&quot; whatever.
It turns out that there is lots of source
information carried beyond just understanding
the world. It each [PAUSE] those were the
explicit objective of the project in addition
to have lots of implicit objective like high
quality meanings that you've [INDISTINCT]
as a people. Real-time teleconferencing, multi-media,
voice-mail, and interoperability with the
telephone network, all of that were obviously
requirement, that were unfortunately were
not written any place, but it was obvious
that we have to do that [PAUSE] it had to
compress the speech a lot. And the reason
is, that the network that we had at this time
had 50 kilobit lines and there are only three
of them across the country. Because of there
were so much--so little bandwidth across the
country, we could not devote 64 kilobit to
each telephone call because this is what a
telephone company does, 64 kilobit per second.
So, we obviously could not do it. So, we had
to do lots of work to reduce the amount of
bits that have to be transmitted for each
telephone call. And each speech compression
turned out to be much more complicated than
what we thought. People who have working on
it from the '60s and the '70s, though we used
compression that was developed by some people
on our project and some people [PAUSE] now,
the amount of--in order to do a real-time
voice compression, we needed equivalent of
a [INDISTINCT] it was a super computer job
and later there were several other array processors.
All computers which were performing of super
computer with [INDISTINCT] as much as memory
and [PAUSE] optimize for very specific tasks.
It was SPS-41 [PAUSE] this is a great machine,
the first of them a bit less. And the challenge
was to reduce 64 bit per second to 2.4 kilobit
per second [PAUSE] by a factor of 30 and do
it in real-time. Here's a picture of an FPS
[PAUSE] is array processing. It was a super
duper machine because it could do 12 megaflops
per second. And the--some of you probably
still remember when computers were that slow.
A little about the ARPAnet. In every site
of the ARPAnet it wasn't in--which is great
invention of Wes Clark. The original design
of the ARPAnet was a server host computer
that will be wired between the host computers.
So every host computer needed the [INDISTINCT]
interface and they were all different and
there was really complicated. And Wes Clark
suggested to have a machine, that we called
the IMP later, that will be exactly the same
every place, except the local interface to
the host computers. So, all the IMPs talked
to each other at exactly the same way, it's
simplified to no end. The IMPs were interconnected
to each other by 50 kilobit lines which [PAUSE]
303 modems and on the other side it was digital
at 50 kilobit per second and the other side
was a bunch of several analog telephone lines.
I forgot, I think they use six or something
like that. And it was particularly a custom-made
for each site. The designed called to--the
design was very, very forward looking. They
understood that there will be many computers,
so therefore they left six bits [PAUSE] and
this really was [PAUSE] which was one in each,
one in each site. And they, being forward-looking,
they also saw that in each site they may have
maybe three computers. But what the heck,
they gave it two bits. What was interesting
in the ARPAnet was total of eight bits [PAUSE]
and two for the host. Twenty years later I
was so [PAUSE] two bits factor of four; we
all know what happened later. About 20 or
30 years later, IPv6 replacing IPv4 with 128.
So, you can see this progression. Moore's
Law for Addresses [PAUSE] we have three data,
data points [PAUSE] point and I'm sure that
if you would keep going [PAUSE] we get a longer
messages. The--we are going to talk a--talk
mainly about the communication aspect of the
project and not on the speech compression.
However, those interested in the speech compression
[PAUSE] came out by Robert Gray who is a professor
of Signal Processing at Stanford and the book
is called, &quot;Linear Predictive Coding and the
Internet Protocol.&quot; It's an interesting book,
we highly recommend. That's what it looks,
it's Amazonic, it's so Amazonic, looks slightly
different [PAUSE] okay. This is what an IMP
look like. Since Impulse bought by ARPA, and
since ARPA is part of DoD, it was procured
according to the way DoD procure things. So
that our MIL-SPEC, that the IMP had to pass
[PAUSE] including dropping gate four, I think,
four feet or something like that and proving
that it can survive nuclear war, you know,
operate that the people may melt but the computer
will keep working [PAUSE] here in 1969, December
'69, ARPAnet [PAUSE] if you remember the milestone
called for a operation in December '69. So,
this is practically on target. Now, the [PAUSE]
because it has lots of things that are interesting
for routing, because it has the circle of
three [PAUSE] check lots of algorithms [PAUSE]
including the multiple [PAUSE] that was--UCLA
was a network measurements center. And every
few years, UCLA celebrates the birthday of
the Internet. And the birthday is considered
when the first IMP came to UCLA. Even in the
East Coast, they don't like it and there are
lots of arguments about it. In June '74, there
were no hosts. After awhile, it became impossible
to draw those maps. NCP was the Network Control
Protocol. Totally no any mail for everyone
because there was no IP, no TCP, and no UDP.
And the NCP did what this protocol did later.
NCP made sure that every bit, the integrity
of the messages that were delivered. It did
not allow for errors, flow control overflow,
and it recovered from errors by using great
transmission [PAUSE] act, if it wasn't acted
in time, it was either lost and re-sent with
a check-sum, and ten messages never made it.
[PAUSE] Those are the protocol [PAUSE] it
will define in BBNA and report number 1822,
which was a bible of the early work on the
ARPAnet [INDISTINCT] [PAUSE] to control [PAUSE]
and that it was okay. The data [PAUSE] the
type of service that you could get was what
everyone wanted, reliable error-free-in-order
delivery. That will [PAUSE] exempt correctly
error-free is obvious. In order was important
because the messages, separate messages, arrive
at different times and messages could ask
each other and arrive in [INDISTINCT] in orders.
The job of the NCP was to make sure that it
was in order or without yield, without errors.
No one wants on this data and no one want
to lose data. This was the only type of service
that was offered. The problem was [PAUSE]
everyone. But for us, it wasn't good enough
for real-time speed. [PAUSE] way NCP interim
reliability and error-free by repeating and
resending and retransmitting [PAUSE] files
properly, because it caused larger delays.
That you [PAUSE] so, in regard to these ideas,
there were three important properties. [PAUSE]
[INDISTINCT] low latency and the CERF is data
integrity. If you do FTP, which was what most
of us did, you need both data integrity in
high bandwidths. If you did Telnet, which
was interactive communication, we need data
integrity and low latency. But we in real-time
speech, we needed both high bandwidth and
low latency, in those lines to loosen the
integrity. It's very important to understand
that real-time communication is different
in all real-time communication. It took us
awhile to get it. [PAUSE] Real-time communication
new data obsoletes previous data. The problem
is, is that you have buffer overflow. The
host did not take all the packets from the
buffers and the communication lines bring
you more data. And so, you have to discard
some of the data. [PAUSE] Question, do you
discard the latest packets or the oldest packets?
The answer is, it also took us awhile to realize,
that if it is real-time communication, to
discard the old packets and keeps the new
packet. For, if it is non-real-time communication,
you keep the old packet and discard the new
packet. [PAUSE] and there, for example, if
you have weather forecast, I need to know--I
need now the forecast for now and I don't
mind if I lost the forecast for yesterday.
It's FTP of programs I need the beginning
of the program cannot [PAUSE] without it.
[PAUSE] Example of real-time--and other real-time
protocol, it was done in 1971. It was real-time
flight simulation with a pilot. [PAUSE] pilot
was, as a pilot that was at Harvard and the
computing was at MIT. And then, as the pilot,
they needs a joystick and some other devices
like a throttle and you have a screen on which
he saws the outside view and this mainly what
a pilot got. In order to run it, it have about--heavy
computers being at MIT we [PAUSE] packetize
a data, send it, give it to our IMP, gave
it to the BB&amp;amp;N IMP on the other side of town.
Then give it to the MIT IMP with the other
side of Cambridge. And PDP-6 was a computed
dynamics of the plane and the LDS-1, Line
Drawing System-1 of Evans &amp;amp; Sutherland, computed
in real-time the view. [PAUSE] this time was
something like few hundred lines [PAUSE] pixels,
no area, no shading--but it totaled a lot
about the issues in real-time. And when both
camp saw it, they said, &quot;That's exactly what
I need for voice.&quot; [PAUSE] but later we did.
The flight-simulator taught us about delay
and jitter. Delay is bad but jitter is worse.
Jitter is a variance of delay [PAUSE] better
to drop packets than to retransmit [PAUSE]
times that you want the latest information.
The other things that we noticed, that we
have to think not only of bit error-rate but
with the packet error-rate. The problem is
not if the bit is bad, the packet is bad.
And the packet can be bad because one bit
is bad or all of them. [PAUSE] so expensive
to retrieve, we invented another, where to
communicate, which we [PAUSE] and I showed
you before that there was only one &quot;A&quot; for
application on the left side of the slide.
Now, we have NVP, the Network Voice Protocol,
was added. [PAUSE] Both of them were then
through the NCP except that the NCP did not
give us the performance that we needed. What
we did here from the [PAUSE] right side [PAUSE]
bypass. Later it went through [PAUSE] bypass
[INDISTINCT] NCP [PAUSE] IMP, and the &quot;E&quot;
is the receiving IMP, looked at it. Had no
idea if there were lost messages, had no idea
if there were errors, just gave it to the
application as a side and let NVP decide how
to handle it. [PAUSE] the operations which
was called Type 3. Packet of Type 3, were
allowed to bypass the NCP. When we did it,
the BB&amp;amp;N who controlled the network operation
was afraid to let us do it because they think
if we don't use the NCP, we may overflow the
IMP driver and bring the network down. [PAUSE]
and we have to convince them not to worry
about it. This is the structure of the NVP,
looks the same driver on this side and the
other side there is a user with user interface.
So, there is a controlled protocol CVSD that
establish the connection, rings the phone,
answer or not [PAUSE] what's important it
handles the [PAUSE] the data protocol could
be one of several. Like, for example, the
LPC and CVSD that I mentioned before and PVP
for video and PCM and Delta PCM and there
are a list of about 20 or 30 different vocoders
in existence today. And part of the NVP's
Network Voice Protocol, was to agree on which
vocoding &quot;A&quot; to use. So, as an extension,
we defined the NVCP, which was conferencing
and PVP, which was video [PAUSE] packet video.
There were all on the market several video
compression machines, none of them were packets,
all of them were working with stream of bits.
[INDISTINCT] we have to address about it.
[PAUSE] like Speech Storage, like answering
machine, like you're doing. And the lots of
bits, so we had to send it to a machine called
[PAUSE] like online. Like the [PAUSE] it was
so expensive and so unbelievable so ARPA could
do it only in one place. All in all, that
the messages may be very long like, let's
say, 60 seconds. One 60 second, one message
[PAUSE] '09 I called Best Buy and they told
me that 500 gigabyte cost $75. I already showed
difficult [INDISTINCT] again and find out
how much it cost now but that's not, you know,
[PAUSE] about 2.7 micro-dollar we were going
cross-country in the past, today voice is
considered free. The Internet was born in
1974, [PAUSE] 1984. [INDISTINCT] idea of the
Internet can be summarized in one line. [PAUSE]
plan there the Internet works with O(N) interface,
can be [PAUSE] the Internet were doing it
not O(N2). The ways of seeing it, is the way
most people did it before in the past was
connecting each computer to each computer,
which is N2 operation and N2 software, N2
interfaces. Then we do it in N interfaces.
Once you do it for any computer type, you
can replicate it. That's basically the idea
of the Internet, O(N) rather than O(N2) [PAUSE]
that we have to replace the ARPA's NCP with
TCP [PAUSE] TCP's what makes the Internet
work. One of 83, the end of NCP, long live
TCP [PAUSE] and they move from the original
operation [PAUSE] seems now very fast in comparison
to the move to V6, but they know we'll get
there one day. What do--the operation with
TCP is [PAUSE] TCP can talk to application
like the [PAUSE] into the IMP, into other
application and get everything worked together
nicely. Type of services that we got was exactly
what everyone wanted: reliable, error-free,
in-order delivery. No one wants errors in
data and no one want to lose data. And there
was no need to any [INDISTINCT] and, again,
as before [PAUSE] time. So, UDP was added
later [PAUSE] I was asked to do [PAUSE] in
UDP [PAUSE] to the right, which was the Version
1203. Right side is TCP version four that
only handed applications that doesn't need
three time [PAUSE] to bypass TCP, you have
to use UDP and UDP is for real-time. So, this
is what we called earlier the split of TCP.
And this was done in IPv4. The V4 indicated
that this is version four of TCP; the five
Ps, it was never IP3. Everyone who had this
answer get two points [PAUSE] &quot;E&quot; that was
meant to be for everything that doesn't want
TCP [INDISTINCT] of the Internet of real-time
and the movies use UDP one way or another.
[PAUSE] And then when we got interested in
the history, we decided that the best place
to look for the history of Voice Over IP was
in Google. So, we googled Voice Over IP and
this is what we--so, if you look at other
places on what used in Google, you find out
that this is the [PAUSE] packet voice was
invented several times independently including
AT&amp;amp;T in 1977, which was [PAUSE] too bad but
the next generation will know that we will
know what is in Google as if they know what
really happened [PAUSE] well, about IP and
this is the other IP, the IP that lawyers
like, the intellectual property, but what
it sounds is nowadays in the 2000's companies
sue for infringement that occurred in the
'90s. Apple patents that were issued in the
'80s about works that we did in the '70s [PAUSE]
that we did was developed and funded by ARPA
and put in the public domain [PAUSE] what
bugs me personally to see how many patents
our Voice Over IP nowadays and how much money
spent on lawyers [PAUSE] owned it. Voice Over
IP and Packet Video are major component of
the Internet. All the information revolution
of the communication revolution, were developed
and demonstrated publicly by ARPA in the '70s.
Advances in computing, communication, and
storage made it practical and ubiquitous [PAUSE]
the carriers don't think that we are crazy.
The carriers are converging with us. End of
Part One. Tomorrow, the same place. He will
show you a movie to demonstrate a CVSD teleconference
that we did in [PAUSE] also discuss the evolution
of voice protocols for packet switching networks
like Voice over IP and like Skype, which bypass
the entire Standard Telephone Network long
distance toll system [PAUSE] Questions, comments?
Excellent question. If you note…
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Repeat the question.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COHEN: I'm sorry, the question was, when
we did it in the '70s, it was unbelievably
impractical. And we need supercomputers and
we need memories that didn't exist. The question
was, what made us do it? Is it that we foresee
the future or some other belief? That's the
question?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's the question.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COHEN: Okay. The thing is that the purpose
of the NSC was to prove proof of concept.
It was obvious to people at ARPA, it wasn't
obvious to people, it was obvious to people
at ARPA, especially to Bob Kahn, that computers
will be cheap enough to do this thing. So,
if you notice, there was a big gap between
when we finished working toward all that stuff
in mid-80s and until late '90s, when you'd
start being picked up by industry. And the
hibernation was caused--was waiting for the
price to be right. And I'm glad that ARPA
didn't try to work on it but let the industry
gets it by itself. [PAUSE] I don't think it
started around the '70s and I'm not sure if
the satellite was, it was all digital. They
used just the time, the signs, something,
I'm sorry did I say some--I don't remember.
Yeah, there's speech detection and the world
was doing all kind of interesting things for
satellites. And inside the network, I think
T-1 was starting being digital. It took a
long time for old T-1's to be digital and
old T-0's to be digital. [PAUSE] Yes? [INDISTINCT]
it was not a very--[INDISTINCT] as a standard
offering, to get it like getting the lines
between [INDISTINCT] was special. I apologize.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CASNER: I'm Steve Casner. I'm giving the
second half of this talk. Danny Cohen gave
the first half yesterday. His part concentrated
on the initiation of the ARPAnet, the building
of the ARPAnet and more on the concepts involved
in getting packet audio and video to work
initially in our experiments. My talk is going
to be more about the protocol development,
both the roots of it and the work we did in
the '70s, and then continuing on into the
real-time transport protocol that is in use
today. So, the timeline for this work began
in the '70s. The ARPAnet began at the end
of the '60s, 1969. But the work we did with
packet audio and video together at ISI and
with other contractors around the ARPAnet
was in the late '70s and early '80s, this
development of the coding algorithms, CVSD
and LPC, plus development of the protocols
to support transport of that data across the
network. We covered both the real-time transport
and voice messaging and we did not just point-to-point
calls, but also conferencing with multiple
sites. And the talk today will include a movie
of--that we shot in 1978, showing a demonstration
of the conferencing. Continuing from that--in
the '70s, in 1978 was when TCP, the original
TCP was split into IP and TCP. And from that
point, we began to use really what was voice
over IP even though it was not until a couple
of decades later that the term Voice over
IP was coined. We developed network voice
protocol, running over IP. We'd began then
a process to standardize the voice protocols
working towards RTP in 1992, and then those
specifications in the later years were taken
up for parts of a complete system to make
Voice over IP. One thing I wanted to point
on this timeline is a gap between 1981 and
1992 and I'll make a point of that on a later
slide. Talking about conferencing that began
on the ARPAnet, the ARPAnet had a fairly simple
protocol stack compared to what we see today
in the current protocols in current networking.
The IMP, Interface Message Processor, of the
ARPAnet was the packet switching node. It
was involved not with just--not only with
forwarding packets the way that we do between
IP routers today but also in some of the flow
control. It worked together with the network
control protocol in the host itself. So, this
box at the top represents a host and the box
at the bottom is the IMP, the network node.
That Network Control Protocol is the rough
equivalent of today's TCP. As they say, at
that time there was no IP. This was before
IP and TCP were developed, specified in or
initially described in 1974. The service provided
by NCP was one of reliable byte stream or
reliable data stream. It handled flow controls
so that the network nodes would not be overloaded.
It handled every transmission when necessary
for covering--recovering from packets that
were lost and basically, as I say, it provided
a reliable communication path. So, the service
that was provided was--and for those who were
here yesterday, I am intentionally repeating
a little bit of Danny's talk as a precursor
to the movie. But, the service that was provided,
as I say, was a reliable transmission service,
because as we all know nobody would want the
errors to occur in their data, nobody would
want their data to be lost. But of course,
that's not true for audio transmission, for
interactive audio. It's more important that
the delay be low, that all bits get here because
you can actually recover from some amount
of packet loss especially when the losses
are of short duration by bridging the gap.
There's a lot of redundancy in the audio sound
that you can afford to lose some. So, what
we had to do in the ARPAnet case, was to bypass
the NCP, bypass the reliable transmission
mechanisms and instead go directly to the
IMP with a different form of the packets.
As I said, the IMPs were providing part of
the flow control mechanism in conjunction
with NCP and the host, so we needed to use
the--a Type 3 packet which was sent without
flow control through the ARPAnet nodes. As
Danny mentioned yesterday, the BBN Network
Operations Center was reluctant to let anyone
use that mode of transmission because they
were concerned that we could just overload
the packet switches in the network, cause
buffers to fill-up and cause the thing to
collapse. So it did take a while arranging
for a specific experiment to be done on Tuesday
at three o'clock and we could send some packets
till eventually they became comfortable with
the--that notion. Today, we have a high volume
of audio and video traffic going along with
all their other kinds of traffic we have on
the Internet and it's--it has become more
or less routine. It's in individual streams
are no longer such a big part of the capacity
of a circuit typically. So, in that picture
I was showing, our network voice protocol
connecting directly to the IMP driver and
the packets which is in the network, the network
voice protocol is comprised of a couple of
pieces, a data protocol and a control protocol,
that separation of data and control is something
that we see in many areas. It was an important
aspect of this protocol design as well, because
there's really different requirements for
the data transmission and the controls that
go along with it. Also in this slide I'm talking
about different forms of voice coding going
over the data protocol, NVCP and CVSD and
I'll talk a little more about those in a moment,
but also we note here, PVP which was the video
extension following roughly the same data
protocol but extended to carry video packets
and over here on the control side, NVCP which
was our extension for conferencing. So, those
two are described here. The control protocol
for NVCP included a floor control mechanism
handing off the floor to allow different people
to speak, as opposed to just a shared floor
and I'll say a little more about why we needed
that in a moment. It provided some insulary
control functions like voting and you'll see
that demonstrated in the movie as well. And
I mentioned that we were doing, in addition
to real-time transmission of the voice, we
were storing some of it for voice messaging.
That was in conjunction with text messaging
at the time. On the video side, we did use
the PVP for multimedia teleconferencing support.
Actually we had some--a few rooms setup like
this one and use the packet network in the
early '80s for that kind of function. The
video has a few differences in characteristic
from the audio but basically the data protocol
accommodates both of those. At that time,
we didn't consider storing video on disc because
we didn't have anywhere near the space that
is now just everywhere for individuals to
store, as well as massive storage like Google
has, of course. So, to introduce the movie,
what we'll see in the movie is this scenario
with four sites. What's shown here is at each
site, a voice terminal, that's what VT stands
for, with a CVSD encoder, and you see those
boxes in the movie, the boxes with blue sides.
You'll see various user interfaces being employed
for controlling the conference and the voice
floor switching. This movie is on YouTube
but now I'll play it
for
you live here.
[VIDEO CLIP]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; CASNER: So, there's a few things that I'd
like to point out from the movie. One is you
may have noticed some occasional screeches,
particularly in Randy Cole's voice. So, I
actually believe that we--when we made the
movie, we recorded the audio and then transcribed
it into the encoded form for demonstration
before putting it, printing it on the film.
And we printed the film with a couple of different
encodings. I believe this one is actually
the LPC encoding because that screeching is
a nature of LPC. The way the LPC algorithm
works is it produces--it's based on a vocal
track model. So, it tries at the analyzer
to pick out what the timing is between pitch
pulses and if it gets confused by a factor
of two, the pitch can be off by a factor of
two. So, it analyzes what the pitch pulses
are and then at the synthesizer it produces
pulses at that rate and feeds them through
a filter that models the vocal track to try
to reproduce the sound. That's how we get
down to the 2.4 kilobit data rate. So, the
CVSD that we mentioned there is a much simpler
algorithm it's kind of interesting. CVSD stands
for Continuously Variable Slope Delta Modulation
and basically what it is, is it tries to track
the audio wave form, simply by saying at each
sample time, is the next one higher or lower?
So it tries to drive one bit at a time up
or down the track. That has a different kind
of artifact that sounds kind of gravelly.
You may have noticed--for those of you who
heard Danny talk yesterday, you may have noticed
that his voice sounded a bit different in
the film, in fact, it was said--felt that
Danny's voice would be too hard for people
to understand, so Eric Mader was speaking
for Danny instead. I wanted to point out that
the various user interface devices that we
developed, some from a character-based terminal,
some from a little box that we built, and
some from the telephone which we've felt was
an important aspect of making this system
usable for a larger number of people to have
the telephone interfacing. And you did notice
that the voting that we could do on the side
carrying control traffic which was sort of
independent of the voice traffic. That's what
this picture shows, the solid lines indicating
the voice data flow and the dash lines indicating
the control flow. In this particular implementation
of conferencing there was strict explicit
floor control. Only one person can talk at
a time so the chairman could talk at anytime
in the reverse channel to the--to whichever
participant had the floor and the person who
had the floor was talking to everyone else.
That's what the arrows; the solid arrows up
there are trying to show. The reasons for
this form of strict control were that the
ARPAnet, the lines of the ARPAnet are only
50 kilobits per second. So, we didn't have
enough bandwidth to send many streams of audio.
Furthermore, that the LPC encoding, because
it's a vocal tracked model can't track multiple
voices at the same time. It just doesn't work,
it doesn't fit the model. So, we can't have
the sound all go to one place, getting mixed
together, and then sent as LPC, as is done
currently with many centralized conferencing
systems. So there's a number of reasons, bandwidth
and encoding technology. Later on when we
were running, as I said, conferences in the
early '80s, we did have systems that could
handle the mixing and we sent these data streams
from all sites to all other sites at the same
time. Also, in this movie you saw an example
of telephone interfaced audio. And as I said
we felt that was an important aspect of the
project. We had a couple of generations of
it. What was shown in this movie in the 1978
timeframe was a single unit that we had built
at ISI. But the later one, the STNI that I'm
talking about here, was a single card. I'll
show in a moment how that was used. Both of
them though supported DTMF signaling so that
you could push touch-tone buttons on the phone
and have that be decoded as a single input.
And the--going in the other direction, was
used for placing a call across a network and
dialing out on the other side, to do toll
bypass, for example. So, as I say, this was
1978 and note the similarity to what we have
with Skype and other systems today. So, this
little box up here in the upper right hand
corner, is a Lincoln packet voice terminal,
PVT, which was comprised of several circuit
boards, wire-wrapped circuit boards, plugged
in there and a telephone that interfaced to
the unit. The telephone actually has a thicker
cord than normal and has a microprocessor
inside it so you can't see that from just
the picture. But this was--this was a system
capable of doing voice compression inside
the little box instead of with the whole rack
of equipment like you saw in the picture from
Danny yesterday. And it communicated over
a low end with low cost version of Ethernet,
CSMA CD bus network called the LEXnet. The
STNI was one of the cards that could plug
into this slot there, so we developed that
at ISI. In 1982, at the end of the network
speech compression NEC project, we had a big
demo meeting of--at Lincoln Laboratory and
there we had an actual five-site conference
with multiple networks involved. At SRI, there
was a packet radio network. At ISI, we had
the STNI going to a telephone network. At
Lincoln Laboratory, I think there was another
STNI, as well as a local terminal and DCEC
in Washington. So we actually had--did have
a--we had several conferences similar to this
stimulated one, but this one in particular
pulled all those pieces together. This is
a--you probably can't read all the details
of this but this a diagram of what the network
was like at that time. The oval at the top
is the wideband network, wideband satellite
network with an amazing 3 megabits per second
capacity compared to the 50 kilobits per second
we had on the ARPAnet. So that allowed us
to do multiple channels of audio, multiple
conferences and connections at the same time.
It also allowed us to begin doing packet video
because we had enough bandwidth. At the various
sites, we had voice terminals of different
kinds. Some on the packet radio network. The
STNI, as I mentioned at ISI, several at Lincoln.
And also at Lincoln Laboratory they had an
interface again, a telephony interface, but
this one based on a channel bank for--that
you would have like in a central switching
office. So a bunch of phones could come into
that and get connected through a higher speed
interconnect, T-1 speed interconnect, into
the packet system. So I mentioned the gap
in the timeline at the beginning of the talk.
Roughly a decade from 1982 to 1992, where
there was--I mean, you would wonder why didn't
we have this system that we had built commercialized
and, you know, why wasn't it deployed more
widely. And really the answer is, we had to
wait for technology to come along and be ready
to support this kind of application, both
reduction in cost and increasing capability
to get it down to a reasonable size. The thing
that happened by the 1992 timeframe was the
development of workstations like a Sun workstation,
that's what I had at the time, and the implementation
of IO devices in those workstations. So then
we had, sitting in front of people in the
equipment they would already have available
to them to use, we would have the voice terminal
capability ready to go. During that decade,
we weren't all sleeping. We were developing--continuing
to develop the protocols and as I mentioned
extending from just doing packet audio to
doing packet video as well. There was a--there
were a couple of networks built-up that supported
that research work. The DARTnet was a T-1
based cross-country network. So then instead
of having to deal with the satellite delay
of the wideband satellite network, we had
just local terrestrial delays. The packet
voice and video system was used for conferences
by, by people who weren't involved in the
project, so it was actually tested to see
that it really works. When you develop something
new today you have to actually get it out
into the field so that you can make sure that
it really works the way you intended. And
we did the same. We didn't really have enough
capacity to offer service to the general public
but there were a number of research groups
that did use the system. There was also a
transition, a buildup of the IP multicast
capability to allow multi-site conferencing
over the Internet. And I'll talk more about
that in a minute, too. And then, as I said
the--initially the notion of sending packet
audio or video over the network was a strain
on the network. But as the network grew and
as the research work covered the needs of
different kinds of transport and how to handle
that, how to manage that within the network,
then the network became ready for this kind
of service. Backing up slightly, I mentioned
on the timeline that the split of IP out of
TCP occurred in 1978. Similar to the--to what
I talked about with the NCP and the ARPAnet
protocols initially, TCP originally provided
just a reliable transport service with retransmission.
We had the same problem in wanting to apply
the Internet voice protocol over IP, we need--over
the Internet; we needed to have the reliability
mechanisms separated from the packet forwarding
mechanisms. And so in fact in 1978, IP was
extracted from TCP and became a separate protocol,
so that an interesting factoid that Danny
pointed out yesterday, is that, there is no
IP version One, for example. A lot of people
may not realize that, because it didn't exist
really until Version Four of TCP where IPV4
was split-out.
Also at the end of that hibernation decade,
in 1992 was when we began work in IETF on--in
the audio/video transport working group that
I chaired at that time for the development
of real time transport protocol. How many
of you folks worked with packet audio or video
and perhaps with RTP in particular? At least
one. The remainder of this talk is largely
about the development of that, the protocol.
But I mentioned here that the--this was the
First IETF Audiocast. What we had done was
take our DARTnet T-1 based network that was
providing research basis for not only voice
work but other aspects of networking. We used
that as a core for adding on tunnels to do
IP multicast to other sites. We had 20 sites
spanning 16 time zones from Australia to Sweden
and we actually did have real-time audio inbound
and outbound from the IETF meeting at that
meeting. Ben Jacobson, I recalled talking
in the plenary at the end of the meeting and
it was quite impressive to hear him coming
from a remote location over the Internet,
as
it was. That--after that initial meeting,
the ad hoc creation of tunnels that we had
done became a little more permanent in something
we called the MBone, the Multicast Backbone.
Again, this was just an overlay network on
top of the IP network which did not at that
time support any IP multicast natively. So
the IP multicast routers were workstations
which then encapsulated the traffic and sent
it across--encapsulated IP in an IP multicast
and IP and then sent it across through the
point-to-point routing. That it actually grew
through '94, '95, to something of this size
where we had 20 countries and 900, a thousand
nodes and--then in each of those places, a
number of users hooked up that could listen.
So we had at later IETF meetings something
like I think a maximum of 500 people who had
tuned in to one meeting. A couple of highlights
of our use of the MBone were the NASA Hubble
Space Mission, the NASA TV video got coupled
in and broadcast across this network. It was--I
remember sitting at my workstation and doing
my work and having over my second monitor
a video of the Hubble repair going on, being
able to listen to the times when their--the
part they don't show in the little clip on
the TV news was really neat. And another event
was the broadcasted Rolling Stones concert
and that led actually to an article about
the MBone in Newsweek in December 1994. The
distributed music performance was a demonstration
of some of the work we had done more on the
research side for synchronization of audio
and video. That was actually a live performance
with live players, one in keyboard and I forgot
what the other instrument was. At ACM Multimedia
'95 where we had three sound streams that
were sent from different locations and all
synchronized according to a synchronization
protocol that allowed us to lineup the timestamps
in the data, so that they were--music that
was all supposed to be played at the same
time, was played at the same time. The performers
were both performing according to a--to the
third party--third part that was recorded.
So that was originated from one place, distributed
to the two performers, they played their parts
and then all three of those came to a fourth
place where it was all put back together.
Unfortunately, that synchronization work didn't
ever become standardized, but I thought that
it was good work. Another aspect of the MBone
that I should point out is that it didn't
have any explicit session control, starting
and stopping. The sessions were all multicast
as well, the information about the sessions
was multicast. So you had a little session
directory program that listened to the session
announcement protocol and it collected a list
of sessions that you could tune into and the
sessions were basically organized by different
multicast addresses, so it's like different
channels that you could tune into. So that
was a very loose form of conference control.
And I'll talk more about the control aspects
in a moment after talking about the development
of RTP. The arrows in this diagram indicate
not dataflow or anything but actually the
evolutionary path of the protocols. It began
with the network voice protocol that I had
talked about earlier from our ARPAnet and
early Internet work. From there, we picked
up the notion of carrying a separate sequence
number and timestamp and I'll show that in
a minute. And from the Vat program, program
and protocol sends for visual audio terminal
is developed by Ben Jacobson and Steve McCann
at LBL. It had its own protocol and it contributed
a couple of notions like on-the-fly vocoding
switching, source identifiers when mixing
together multiple sources and the start-of-Talkspurt
bit for adjusting the time delay. So, the
headers are shown on each of this next sequence
of slides to show the fairly simple aspects
of the data protocols that we put together
into RTP. As I mentioned, sequence number
and timestamp are important together because
the sequence number allows detecting when
there are packets lost and the timestamp,
which tells what the position of each frame
or packet should be, allows you to distinguish
between gaps that are due to losses and gaps
that are intentional because of silence when
we don't transmit anything. In NVP, we actually
had a header checksum in place. We spent seven
bits on that header checksum because we wanted
to be able to accommodate data pass where
there might be some bit corruption in the
data which we could tolerate but a bit error
in the header would cost the packet to probably
be unusable. It turns out that there really
aren't transports available that don't have
some lower level mechanism that's going to
kick out the packets that they have in there
anyway so we didn't actually carry that idea
into RTP. In NVP we did also carry the control
tokens in the same packets along with the
data and I'll talk more about that separation
in a moment. And then at data length, this
protocol was dependent on the lower layer
protocol to say what the overall length of
the data was. In the Vat protocol, there was
not both a timestamp and the sequence number,
just a timestamp in audio samples. The way
that silences were indicated was by a flag
on the first packet after silence that indicated
that a gap had occurred and so that was a
suggestion of a time when the receiver could
adjust its delay that it's putting in to accommodate
the jitter to either increase it or decrease
it according to how much delay had been built
up. It also included a site identifier so
that you could have premixed audio, audio
that had gone to one place been mixed together
and delivered on further and still be able
to tell who the sources where inside that
audio. And it had a conference ID for validation
that the packets you are receiving are the
ones that you actually intended to receive.
We carried those--some of those notions over
from NVP and Vat protocol into the first version
of RTP because if you're working with RTP,
you may have wondered why there's RTP Version
2 and what happened to zero and one. The--that
protocol was actually allocated the zero.
In the first two bits is where the version
number one was and that had zero in that position.
RTP Version 1 had one in that position. In
this version of the protocol, we used timestamps
carried as seconds, 16 bits of seconds and
16 bits of fraction and had that timestamp
rate be the same for all protocols, all data
formats. The idea behind it was to allow simple
inter-media synchronization that you wouldn't
have to do timestamp calculations. That--we
have a sequence over and timestamp also present,
as they said, to detect loss. And in this
version of the protocol, we move to a flag
at the end of a Talkspurt or the end of a
video frame to indicate a point when you knew
you had something that was complete. That
was more important for video because then,
without having to wait for the beginning of
the next frame, you would know that that frame
was complete and you could display it. Those
are our motivations in making the change.
We did still have the audio format in each
packet so you could switch on-the-fly and
we had the notion of carrying control tokens
here in the data and the channel ID for multiplexing
packets from different sources. RTP Version
1, I think could have been workable but there
were influential people who felt it had serious
problems and we got push backed from the ITF
management to reconsider a couple of the design
aspects. And that led to RTP Version 2. Here,
a change was to be like Vat to have the timestamp
in samples and the motivation there was so
that you could do positioning of the data
with sample accuracy and positioning of the
data in time for playback continuously with
one sample accuracy, not worrying about arithmetic
errors that could be introduced by having
to convert from a fixed timestamp rate into
the native sample rate of the media. Of the--the
Talkspurt flag was changed to be not the same
for audio and video. Back to the beginning
of a Talkspurt for audio where it's more convenient
and remained at the end for video sets the
M-bit up there, the marker bit in RTP still
carried the format identifier for switching
on-the-fly and carried the source identifiers
for the audio that was pre-mixed so that you
could tell--could tell who is speaking when
you were getting audio that was pre-mixed.
The synchronization source identifier is of
an application level source identification
that served as a backup for validating packets
to make sure they were ones that belonged
in your stream. As you know; you could send
IP packets anywhere and the receiver needs
to be able to tell whether they're appropriate
or not. Some of the philosophy in RTP Version
2 was to try to keep the control and data
separate. The notion of control tokens was
removed from the data packets in RTP Version
2 and the separate RTCP control protocol was
devised to carry those in separate packets
and I'll show that in a moment. We kept a
fixed 12-byte header so that calculations
were simple and so that it was easy to do
header compression on it. You may have heard
of RTP Header Compression a couple of different
times. And it was highly scalable, multicast
was a big influence in the design of RTP so
that we could have--it worked well both for
two-party conferences as well as conferences
with thousands of users and not have the control
traffic overwhelm the data traffic because
of having so many participants sending control
traffic. One other point is in the descriptions
of jitter, for example, the time--the measurements--or
the--the packets, which conveyed packet loss
information, what the last sequence number
was received, et cetera. How many packets
were received those were all carried as absolute
values rather than incremental values. We
didn't say I received 60 packets since the
last update, we say that we received a total
of this many packets. And the reason for that
is that if you lose one of those control packets
carrying those numbers, it doesn't matter
because you can still take a delta between
any two packets that you did receive and find
out how many were received during that time.
Some of that philosophy has not been kept
over time. There was always push to try add
more complexity into it to allow more, more
features. And so in 2009, the idea of keeping
the control and data separate was--the idea
keeping control data separate was important
so that you could have, for example, some
monitoring stations that just listened to
the control traffic and didn't have to receive
the data traffic as well. They could filter
that out based on the separate addressing,
separate port numbers being used for those
two streams. However, with the introduction
of NAT and with the introduction of gateway
units that were trying to gateway a large
number of streams, they ran out of port space
per IP address. And so, a new variation on
RTP was introduced such that in some circumstances,
the RTP and RTCP packets could be multiplexed
back together. Also, we tried to keep options
out of the header in RTP but we left a little
hook in there for experimentation and that
Pandora's Box has now been opened and options
are happening. One other thing that surprised
me was, I thought that based on our early
work with CVSD and LPC and then subsequent
work in the early '90s on various coding algorithms
that that work would kind of slow down. People
would run out of ideas about what to do about
compressing audio and video, but that hasn't
happened at all. This is a list of the different
audio codex that for which there are payload
formats for RTP defined, and there are more
added since this. Switching from the data
side to the control side, there's--there are
a number of aspects of the control protocols,
NVP just scratched the surface of this with
the fairly rudimentary sessions setup mechanism.
We did have--we did have tokens like ringing
the telephone and getting an answer back,
that kind of control for setting up the point-to-point
conferences and then with NVCP, we extended
that to the extra controls for floor switching.
In RTP, the companion RTCP protocol supports
only loosely controlled sessions. It's really
just conveying session information information,
it's not about setting up sessions or billing
or any of that. So, for a complete solution,
you really need a bunch more and the SIP protocol
has been addressing that. I'll talk a little
about each of those. For NVP, as I mentioned,
we had a series of control tokens that you
could send for not only establishing this
session but also negotiating what kind of
VOCODING would used. At this time, we actually
described the VOCODING in the--as a whole
collection of parameters with the thought
that we would be sort of tweaking those parameters
as we setup sessions and we want to negotiate.
We learned that in fact that wasn't really
useful. It changed to where you just have
a single code point for a particular VOCODING
and you choose certain sets of codings, coding
parameters to use. In RTCP, and Danny wanted
me to point out, this is not our RTCP, it's
RT-CP, has nothing to do with TCP. Except
that it completes RTP to be a transport protocol.
An important part of any transport protocol
is managing congestion, managing the flow
control over the network. So, it provides
feedback about loss of packets. If you're
suffering a lot of packet loss, that probably
means that you have congestion in the network
and you should either back off your rate or
stop sending. So, it's really important for
RTCP to be implemented along with RTP, it
doesn't always happen in the implementations
and that's a concern. RTCP does carry a persistent
identifier for the source, the &quot;S&quot; source
value that I motioned that's carried in HRTP
packet that's used for validation is just
a random number. It's a random number so that
when people initiate from different places
independently there's probability of collision
is low. Here this binds in the RTCP we carry
that S-source value and persistent identifiers
so that you can get some meaning from it.
In addition to providing feedback about the--what
was lost--packets that were lost, it also
allowed each user to learn--so, it allowed
each user to learn what loses other users
had experienced but it also allowed each user
in a multicast session to know how many others
there were. And based on that, the timers
for repetition of the control packets facing
with the control packets automatically adjusted,
including some randomization to avoid synchronization
so that we could accommodate with RTCP sessions
of a wide variety of sizes. So, this dealt
with loosely controlled session in order to
have a more explicit session like a telephone
call. Then the session initiation protocol
was developed also in IETF. It drew on a number
of research projects that had gone before
Etherphone at PARC and Touring Machine at
BellCore, work we did it at ISI, CCP and the
MMConf system at BBN. I'm sure that most of
you heard of SIP by now because it is actually
become fairly widely used. A lot of work was
done there and still more work needs to be
done. The SIP concentrated on just point to
point conversing deferring the multipoint
explicit conferencing for later. So, you may
have wondered why we called this talk being
about prehistory in the title, really because
voice over IP was only coined in 1995. A lot
of people are unaware of the two decades that
came before that. Talking about the history
part between 95 and now, there has been a
lot of work done on the protocols both continuing
work on RTP and continuing work on the control
protocols to go with it. You know RTP was
adopted by ITU-T for the H.323 method of setting
up conferences and point-to-point calls and
SIP was developed, as I said, in ITF through
quite a bit more work and in conjunction without
or in addition to it, the RTSP real time streaming
protocol was developed for control of more
stream-oriented playback using RTP typically.
So, my conclusion which really is a conclusion
for the two days of talks not just my own,
that it's pretty clear, I think to most everyone
that packet audio and video are important
components of the Internet today. And the
roots of that were in what we did in the '70s,
not only in developing the concepts of how
to deal with real time data but also the protocol
work directly fit in to protocols that we're
using today. That work depended on advances
in technology to make it practical, but it
is now something that we are treating as a
normal everyday occurrence. So, that's it.
The--I have a couple of URLs here if you're
interested in the movie, it is on YoutTube
and also, you can get the full Mpeg 50 megabyte
original at the center location here. Questions?
Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What type of video encoding did you use?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; COHEN: Now, what we did--actually that
was kind of interesting at ISI. We--oh, yeah,
what sort of video encodings we used? At ISI,
we developed our own codec, which was based
on--at that point, the DSPs, the Texas Instruments
Ti 320, TMS 320 had just been released and
we actually took eight of those and built
a single instruction multiple data architecture
where we had eight of those DSP chips operating
in parallel to do discreet cosine transform
compression of the video. We didn't have a
lot of processing power there so what we did
was we had another [PAUSE] processor that
looked over all the blocks we used, I think
16X16 blocks of the image, to detect which
ones had changed and then we applied the DECT
only to those that changed and transmitted
those blocks and the rest stayed the same.
The algorithm for our--for determining which
blocks had changed also didn't really have
time to look at every pixel, they looked at
the boarder of the block. And so, if you were
careful, you could toss a lot of paper up
and get it to freeze there because it would--it'd
be in the middle of the block and not detected
when it left. You know, that was kind of fun.
But it was also very fast. It's--we sent 30
frames per second even at that time. So, if
he did like this, you could show your fingers
accurately, but if you did it like this, then
the frame rate would slow down in order to
accommodate those differences. Around that
time, we also took a couple of commercial
codecs, picture tell codec and compression
labs codec, which were not really designed
for use over packet network. Even though they
had block structures, they weren't designed
for loses. And we had adapted those block
structured data streams to be carried over
the packet network. And as long as our packet
loss was low enough, then they worked okay.
There was another aspect of reconstructing
clock at the other end because they were designed
to work over synchronized streams to one line.
So, we had to accommodate that drift in the
clock between the two ends. Other questions?
[PAUSE] The question was whether the various
forms of audio that we have, chat on computers
and DCT phone, I think you're talking about
a cordless phone, that's just the local communication
technology underlying that might be voice
over IP or whatever. And the cellular phone
with a couple--which might have--which might
be using in your iPhone or Android phone might
be using the carriers own transport mechanism
or could have a packet voice application on
it to carry. So, are all those going to converge?
I expect that it will be ultimately all some
form of packet-based communication, whether
there--whether we get to a point where there's
one encoding that's used typically in all
of then so that it could be end to end, no
matter what sort of devices came in the middle.
Given the proliferation of different encoding
I don't see that happening, but I do think
we're converging towards packet size, the
transport mechanism underneath. Yes?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ITU came up with the H3 [PAUSE] coming
with two [PAUSE]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, right. ITU did come with H.323 and
ITF came up independently with SIP. Why--really,
why did we have two? Why did--I guess one
way to phrase that question, why was SIP created
if ITU-T had dome H.323 already? And I'm on
the ITF side so I'm going to have a biased
view, H.323 was terribly complicated. And
I think in parts, it was a reaction to that.
The H.323 came out of a H.320, which was a
synchronist protocol so it evolved in ITU-T
from a synchronous protocol to packet protocol.
And because of that, it carried over some
of the constraints from the circuit based-system
and models of how things should operate from
that system which didn't fit completely with
the packet based-view. So, SIP came from the
other direction from loosely controlled conferencing
and saying, &quot;Okay, what to do we, you know,
what's the minimum we can to this to allow
sessions to be more explicitly controlled?&quot;
So, different people with different perspectives
and different goals and that's how it came
about. I think SIP has expanded beyond 323
as far as the deployment these days. So, apparently
the more Internet packet centric view is the
winner. Questions? Okay, thank you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
