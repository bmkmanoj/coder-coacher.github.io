you and we're pleased to finally have
yann Kloss and Bruce homer from the
games for Learning Institute here at
Google as part of our serious games at
google Tech Talk series the serious and
educational games face is at a pretty
pivotal stage right now where the
skeptics are are declining in numbers
and people are really interested but
they're starting to ask some questions
they want to know if this is effective
how it can be effective and they want
they want to see some data they want to
see some results and they want to see
some metrics and that's why one of the
reasons I'm so happy to have you guys
here today because I think you are at
the forefront of trying to do serious
research to demonstrate the efficacy of
some of these games and what can happen
in a classroom please join me in
welcoming Yann PLAs and Bruce Homer to
Google thank you Matt for the
introduction for inviting us to speak
here today and hello and good afternoon
to you here in the audience and on the
broadcast the games in the future of
learning is our our title supposed to be
a little bit provocative in some
audiences but I don't imagine that might
be the case here but just because that's
my favorite question asked who is a
gamer in the audience all right
so we come from the games to Learning
Institute and what I want to talk about
today is is really a you know a series
of presentations combined
want to bring up the national challenge
that we're facing right now just so that
that you get a context for what we're up
against and then talk about the games
for Learning Institute and how we try to
address that and booth is going to talk
about some previous research that we've
been doing that it's all the foundation
of what we're doing now and then I'll
talk about some current issues and
challenges that I think very much relate
to some of the work that some of you are
doing here so national challenge wise I
don't want to spend too much time on
that because there's a high tech
organization and cooperation as yourself
just looking around in the audiences I
don't see too many women here and in
many cases there are very few women
engineers and when you look at computer
science departments you see between 2
and 4 percent women actually choosing
computer science and we're asking among
other
question why so the national challenge
is really that your students are falling
behind their peers in other countries
and studies like Pisa and Timmons show
that Pisa is international comparison
studies administered to fifteen-year-old
students on all of a kind of topics
science literacy math etc but it's also
the 21st century skills requires or
workforce requires new skills that are
not taught in schools designed for the
19th century we have science and
engineering positions that are open in
many companies and they try to fill that
with qualified applicants especially get
some more female applicants and that is
a very difficult thing to do and so
we're asking one other things to
question why that is and how we can
address that and we believe in part it
is because the education system that we
have is not preparing or providing
materials in a way that really addresses
a broad range of learners India needs
it's really very specialized and how we
deliver instruction because we
essentially have a one-size-fits-all
approach to this so here's a piece of
study the red markings are the United
States and when you look at the
countries that are ahead of us you come
to one simple conclusion it has doesn't
have to be that way
the fact that Belgium Iceland Norway
South Korea Australia New Zealand are
ahead of us the Canada is number two in
literacy reading literacy which was the
focus in 2000 we're 24 on math and 21 in
science it doesn't have to be that way
and so we believe that technology can
actually have a an answer to that and
that's what we do in the games for
Learning Institute and create as the
Consortium for research and evaluation
of advanced technologies in education
that does the educational research
within against learning Institute so we
are we are interested in providing
guidance for designers who decide to
build educational interventions because
currently there's very little research
that does that and certainly very little
research that's translated and something
designers can work with we want to show
best practice examples and we especially
want to focus in a variety of digital
media not just a
multimedia learning or just web-based
learning but a broad variety of digital
media for learners of all ages coming
from various cultures from broad range
of subjects and we want to look at
conditions for the successful
integration of media into schools
because we're not working in isolation
there are formal and informal learning
environments we need to address so
that's what we're interested in
but bridge that with out of school
experiences on the go with your mobile
devices etcetera and what we are trying
to do is in order to to get this all
done is driving the research agenda
because currently there isn't really one
so we have a number of collaborators we
have a amazing board of advisers
with game designers and and Alan Kay is
on it and and many others who are
advising us in this process and and who
helped us do this right anybody who can
tell me who the guys in the swing and
the shot and in the middle and the right
can exactly so will writers on the
advisory brought so we have the people
who know what to do and how to do it and
the guy in the middle there's Ken Perlin
who is the that I could a director of
the Institute I'm the co-director of the
games for Learning Institute I'll talk
about that in a second so we're bringing
a lot of people together to do this work
as the games for Learning Institute and
there's faculty members from nine
different universities including
Teachers College Columbia University's
Dartmouth you see the list here all
looking at the question how can we
design games so that they're effective
for learning there's a question on the
design of games and then there's a
question that we are interested in
empirically based and theoretically
derived design patterns for games for
learning so we're not interested so much
in kind of just observations of game
play where we're interested in
collecting the data data mining or
analyzing the data with statistical
methods and then coming to conclusions
that inform the design of games and so
the mission then is to to look at design
patterns for effective games for
learning combining what we know from
educational psychology research to
translate that into design for games for
learning and those theory based
empirically validated design patterns
I've talked about and really in the end
to help create a nation with informed
citizens that have the necessary skills
digital literacy skills to be successful
in the 21st century so we use a variety
of research methods and experimental
research video observations play testing
and we use all different kind of
measures to get at the kind of data we
want and this is in many ways something
where you have to break them grant and
I'm going to talk about this in a little
while but why do we do games then we
think that they provide highly
contextualized places for learning which
is exactly the problem in schools which
is decontextualized and
compartmentalized and situated
everything that happens within the
context that makes sense to you is
something where you have a much higher
likelihood of actually applying that in
the future they're highly engaging
highly individualized which we currently
can't do in school settings are out of
many out of school settings and they
don't just teach 21st century skills but
also content that is important so we can
combine the two in real bridging
in-school and out-of-school learning
they have an emotional impact by design
which is something that's often
overlooked when it comes to design
learning and they allow for embedded
assessment and that's what we're really
excited about not just of learning but
also of a number of other variables and
I'm going to talk about that in a minute
also however we really don't understand
yet from a research perspective how to
do that alright and how to make games
sort of effective for learning and are
fun and so that's the core mission of
the Institute so we are building
adventure games for science learning
with strong narratives and science
problems we're building co-located AR
games with geo-located hot zones and
authentic scientific data feeds here
about Times Square in New York City and
renewable energy sources there we're
building games for simple math skills
for math skills like super
transformations on transformations and
so we're going to talk about some of the
research on that and it's all grounded
in a lot of psychology research and
Bruce is going to give a presentation on
some of the studies that we're done
outside of games that inform how we are
now looking at games and they're kind of
research questions we have there
so this is just a sort of high-level
overview of our research objective and
we develop you know we use those
cognitive social cultural and affective
theories to influence our design of
various digital media we're looking at
learner variables both as how they're
influencing our design of digital media
and also how they're influenced by the
digital media we're trying to build in
embedded assessments and biometrics into
the products that we're developing and
studying and for outcomes we're looking
at both cognitive outcomes metacognitive
outcomes
engagement learner engagement and
effective outcomes what I want to do is
just give a quick overview of some of
our main findings I'm happy to talk at
the Q&amp;amp;A if anyone has more questions but
about these I just wanted to kind of
highlight some of the main findings for
the work that we've done already so this
is one of the projects looking at
computational thinking it was
particularly targeting computational
thinking in in young women and it was a
dance game where you could change
outfits and and influence like at dance
moves by basically scripting the
activity this was funded by the National
Science Foundation and the key findings
well the participants were 56 middle
school students roughly half were female
and it was a pretest post-test design
lasted for four weeks with a 50-minute
session per week the key findings we
found although there wasn't necessarily
an increase in programming related
knowledge that wasn't really the main
focus what we did find was that there
was an increase in general self-efficacy
falou the young women that predict apart
in the project there was significant pre
to post gain in programming
self-efficacy for girls and marginally
significant increase for boys and
assuming pre post s office post s
increase in self-esteem and this
increase in self-efficacy and
self-esteem that's what's necessary if
you're going to have girls go into
computer science and programming
and stay at it so you know the
short-term gain is not as vital as
seeing these kinds of increase in self
efficacy yeah that so that's the second
finding from that work this is from a
project molecules and minds where we've
been developing chemistry simulations to
help high school students this is the
science exploration looking at the ideal
gas law and one of the things that we've
looked at in this design is
representational format how do we
represent the information in these
simulations so that a variety of
learners can understand the content of
what's being presented so we looked at
the adding of iconic representations so
if you look at the if you look at the
the the simulation to your right you see
that we've added weights which represent
pressure flames represent temperature
heat and then look to see soaring
empirical question was if adding these
iconic representations help improve
learning for these learners and this is
grounded in the semiotic theory of the
person some others literature the study
with 93 New York City high school
students in the 11th grade and you know
two by two studies so we looked at
adding the icons versus not having the
icons and whether it was something that
was more direct instruction where they
watched they it was very guided or
whether they were allowed to just kind
of explore it and on their own and
looked at how these two factors
influenced learning so for the
representational format what we found is
that the adding icons did improve
comprehension especially for learners
with low prior knowledge so if and those
were our target audience so if you came
into this not knowing a lot about
chemistry those icons really helped you
make sense of the simulation and your
and your learning really improved of
comprehension it's just kind of the
basic information that you're trying to
get from the simulation when we looked
at younger learners middle school
students though we found that even those
young students that younger students
that knew the information they benefited
from the icons so
there's also an age effect going on here
as well when we the second factor that
we looked at was how much guidance that
they required in using this simulation
and we compared more discovery learning
versus more direct instruction again
with the 93 high school students and
what we found is that for comprehension
there's a general trend significant
trend for the exploration would be
better than the more direct instruction
so there was benefits of exploration but
when we looked at some of the individual
factors that the story became slightly
more complex and to me more interesting
that in fact we looked at executive
functions and how that predicted
learning so executive functions are
related to frontal lobe functioning it's
it's the executive functions that allow
us to set goals monitor whether or not
we're meeting our goals and to adjust
our behavior so if we're not meet our
goals it's a very important but low
level neurophysiologic neurocognitive
feature and we looked at how kids did on
an executive function tasks and found
that controlling for their prior
knowledge if they had low executive
functions then they benefit much more by
the direct instruction yes this was we
used this group task which is there's
various versions of it but the version
we used would have color word like read
written in green ink and you have to not
pay attention in the semantic content of
the word but just name the color of the
ink and we look at how long it takes you
to do that so you inhibit the prepotent
response of saying oh that's red no no
it's green ink and compare that to if
it's just written in neutral ink so
that's that's the executive function of
measure
yeah
yeah yeah they did we we controlled for
time as well yeah so but if the kids
with the higher executive functions
controlling for prior knowledge did
better with the exploration so this is
one of the big debates in educational
psychology how much direct instruction
how much exploration it's like very
political in the field of educational
psychology and so this is a study that
says you know what you know there's it's
actually slightly more nuanced than a a
is better or B is better and then with
this whole project the we did a big
efficacy study to see well do these
simulations actually help when we put
them into a real classroom so we had a
big study with over 700 students
involved where we randomly assigned
classrooms to use the simulations or not
use the simulations and we have two
sites one urban site in New York City
and one rural site in Texas where the
students use this for the chemistry
again it was pretest post-test and some
individual measures and what we found is
that for the rural sample in Texas the
simulation group had increases greater
transfer of knowledge so what they
learned they were able to apply it to
new situations from the chemistry they
had greater self-efficacy for chemistry
and they also acquired some graphing
skills for our urban sample which had
lower prior knowledge they had increased
comprehension and increased transfer
when they used our simulations and they
also had higher engagement in class so
we actually set Clapp video cameras in
and coded how engaged students were in
the classroom and and the simulations
kept them engaged and asking I think
asking key questions another factor that
we've looked at is emotional design so
what happens if you try to design
material to create a positive effect
does that help learning and this was a
two by two factor design where we looked
at external external way of boosting
positive effect
also created design you can probably
guess which one of these have a happy
design the positive effect design is the
one on the right yes it's reading a
passage with either like a sad story or
happy you know narrative yeah well they
were editing himself but it's kind of a
standard in social psychology it's a
standard mood induction technique that's
used so he adopted that study and just
quickly the main findings that the the
internal mood induction actually did was
preferable to the external induction
external induced more positive emotions
but they decreased during learning
where's the internal induction which was
actually part of the learning kept the
positive effects up and most importantly
what we found is that this with the
positive effect you see a positive boost
in learning outcomes so having learning
materials that makes you feel happy
increases your learning this is just
just wrap up with two studies from from
the games for Learning Institute this is
factory actor named that Yan briefly
mentioned during his introduction where
we looked at play mode so we looked at
three modes of play either just kids
playing solo kids playing competitively
or kids playing cooperatively and this
was a study with 63 middle school
students what we found is that for the
collaborative and competitive plays so
when there's the social component to the
play there's greater situational
interest so they the students that had
either collaborative competitive they
actually were more interested in playing
the game in and of itself it was it was
more engaging for them greater interest
in it stronger mastery goal orientation
so they actually wanted to learn the
content more the solo but the solo game
play those students although they they
reported less enjoyable to be less
enjoyable in the collaborative
but the solo play group actually
demonstrated greater math fluency so we
did a post-test and in the post tests
they learned more from the from the solo
play but they liked it better and had
better goal orientation in the in the
group play so again if you're a teacher
who wants to use a math game if you're
going to be using repeatedly maybe it's
worth while doing the the social play
even if it there's some decrease in in
learning the motive increased motivation
might keep the students engaged and
learning over time like a crater
learning yes oh I'm just a quick
question when you say social
collaborative competitive how many
students are at a term and all are they
playing each other one at a terminal or
they're multiple people who's there they
were both at a term one terminal so
either for the collaborative they
there's like two rings so each person
controls one of the rings so they have
to create a get rid of the factor in the
middle by collaborating together for
competitive they both see each other's
rings and they have to you know try to
reduce their factors and more reduce
more factors than than their competitor
did you break this down by prior mastery
to see whether people had greater prior
mastery did better in the solo or
competitive environment we did I don't
think that had an influence we
controlled for prior master you know in
our analysis but I don't think that
there was an interaction between prior
mastery and and the modal play these
results are averages or you looked at
the best performance of the worst
student or the exist these are averages
so situations so we saw this sorry we
screen the data for any outliers I think
we had two outliers in this study who
came in either having no math knowledge
of way too much math knowledge I can't
remember which now and and then it's
averages looking at group averages okay
because because when you have group
activities you sort of expect different
people to carry the weight differently
right so you'd expect a different shape
of curve for rice but the but the
outcome measure is an
so the the post-test is they do on their
own
so the post-test is just a standard math
fluency test that is a paper and pencil
test that they did individually so I
don't know if that okay okay and this is
another game that we've developed
looking at we're trying to look at
different learning mechanics and seeing
what influence that has on learning
outcomes so this is an angles game where
you have to complete the angle and the
two mechanisms one is solve it by just
computing the number and the other is
just choosing a rule and and dragging
that in and so you're either using a
number approach where you didn't like we
have to compute it or just using the
rule which is more conceptual approach
and and what we found in this so we
compared the rule used versus conceptual
either number solving or just using a
conceptual number conceptual rule or
actually using the number to solve it we
had 89 middle school students from 6th
and 8th grade and you know this is the
study that we're still completing but
our preliminary results indicate that
they solve more problems in the rule
based game but the arithmetic game were
they were they where they dragged the
rules they actually find that the
learning outcome continues so there's
didn't say that right there's
diminishing turns so they've learned
from both games that's that's the key
thing so from the arithmetic and whether
they're doing the arithmetic or they're
just using the rules they learn in both
cases but what we find is after about 30
levels it flattens out the learning
flattens out for the rule for the
computational one where they calculate
the numbers but if they're using
dragging the rules then we keep seeing
learning games the more they played the
game so there's greater long term gains
from doing things the game more
conceptually rather than just computing
the answers
so this is a summary of the key findings
over again but if we put them in back
into our original layout of what our
goals are we've been looking at
exploration versus icons versus
visualizations as a sort of cognitive
design factor engagement collaborative
interactions cultural and localized
design so how does it does it matter
where you are where you're learning if
you're in a more rural or urban
environment we can get self-efficacy
self-esteem and emotional design and all
that is feeding into developing games
for learning we've looked at various
learning learner variables executive
functions prior knowledge and building
an embedded assessment to to further
explore what's going on with these
learning games and looking at cognitive
outcomes the metacognitive comes
engagement and effective outcomes all
right
so all of this is kind of just a very
brief overview of the the researcher
we're doing and we're happy to talk
afterwards about some of the details of
how we're approaching this and what kind
of measures we use and we're using game
based measures and out of game measures
because right now you have a lot of
skeptics that say if you only measure
performance through the game it's very
hard to to make it a case that this
actually means anything so we have
paper-based instruments after the game
played seven so we can talk about all of
that but I want to mention and get into
some some questions and challenges that
we're facing related to games related
research because they actually are the
ones that keep us in this and this work
it's it's so interesting to do this work
outside of traditional learning
environments and going into games now
many challenges that come with that and
and just just to summarize something
that we haven't really talked about
there there are four functions that
we've seen for games for learning
prepare ation of future learning where
you don't even attempt to teach
something you just set up future
learning goes back to work by Dan
Schwartz at Stanford games for specific
learning goals where we can teach new
content or skills but many games just
practice those that's number three
practice existing skills and lead to
automation of their skills very
important but not actually teaching and
then development of 21st century skills
what we find is that most yeah
okay thanks for bringing this up because
some of those things we should define
and didn't 21st century skills is
actually more a high port than anything
else that I really should take out and
replace with more concrete ideas
it means teamwork it means collaboration
it means more of instead of IQ more an
EQ and emotional quotient being able to
work in teams creatively solve problems
addressing all of the things that that
you face every day in your in your work
most likely but that are not taught in
schools or at least not in all schools
consistently and so when we talk about
21st century skills we differentiate
that from the 19th century skills which
would mean to know how to add and
subtract and to regurgitate some facts
about history and so on so that's that's
the main difference here thank you for
for bringing that up so there's a lot of
interest in using games to teach those
two in four century skills because games
have that collaborative component and
they have ways of engaging you in
teamwork of creative problem-solving etc
so when we found this the result
actually that solo play is in this math
game better than a collaborative and
competitive play it is very clear that
this is for a game that falls into
category number three which is practice
existing skills and automation if we
have a game for development of 21st
century skills which were actually
working on to use as a for the same
study design to see if the patterns hold
we would expect very different results
based on the game like that so it's
useful to think of games not as a one
kind of monolithic thing but not only
different genres for games but also
different functions of games for
learning but the most generalizable
research experimental research
quantitative research focuses on games
to predict to practice those STEM skills
and qualitative research which is a few
of participants thicker descriptions but
typically not involving numbers focus on
games to develop 21st century skills and
we feel we can go into that other area
and do a more comprehensive work using
data-driven approaches as well so this
challenge is the first one that we're
very interested in is embedded
assessment
and there are many as opportunities to
assess in games we keep logs obviously
of what the people do user logs event
logs but also biometrics and there is a
number of variables that were
interesting measuring that are in
addition to learn our variables and we
believe we can measure what we call
general trait variables something like
spatial ability verbal ability executive
functions state variables your knowledge
your your strategies your goal
orientation self-regulation and very
specific variables for particular
context of play engagement cognitive
load and so on we can we believe we can
measure all of that out of embedded
assessments in addition to the learning
outcomes which are important but which
is typically what people focus on when
they say embedded assessment is in game
so embedded assessments is extracting
that information out of an instrumented
game and out of the log files within
that game what is required though is the
design of thoughtful game mechanics and
that's what I want to spend some time
talking about and we separate learning
mechanics and assessment mechanics and I
want to go into those so talking about
learning mechanics starting with the
definition of mechanics in general in
games methods that are invoked by agents
the game play all the the agents in the
game for interacting with the game world
and are constrained by the game rules so
in other words the pattern that you show
when you play game the essential
gameplay that is either single action or
group of actions that you play when you
look at some of the games you see that
there are some employed or in osmosis or
Angry Birds they're very specific
mechanics that we typically used to
describe a game you know this is a first
person shooter refers to the mechanics
right so none of these are particularly
learning games but all of them have some
relevance for learning and I'm going to
talk about that in just a moment so game
mechanics for learning that need to not
just define the play but also need to
facilitate learning that's a completely
different challenge and what it may
provide details on learning process an
outcome but not necessarily and may have
reveal insights into learning variables
but only if it's designed to do that and
so we think that game mechanics will
only need to to meet some very different
functions and definitions we need to
engage to play on meaningful learning
activities rather just play activities
and it is the behaviors that we can
observe an X
we have meaningful lock data so in a way
then we need to we need to end be fun
and engaging in a way that when we think
about game mechanics really need to
think about learning mechanics that help
to learn or learn and assessment
mechanics that help the learner assess
or be assessed and they need to be
translated into game mechanics and
that's something that came out of our
research that helped us communicate
amongst our team when the learning
scientists like what I do talk to
psychologists or game designers when I
use game mechanics people think about
different things then when I say
learning mechanics or assessment
mechanics and so we started developing
that and that actually mushroomed into a
lot of other things learning mechanics
our building blocks of learning
interactivity not play interactivity and
have a essential learning activity that
they define by doing that and we for
instance if you take one game mechanic
one learning mechanic where you say I
want to apply rules to solve problems
you saw that a moment going the geometry
game that we used it's a game for
quadrilateral and other topics in in
sixth seventh and eighth grade we want
to for instance say well in this game
the learner selects different rules and
shows where and how they apply so we
have a problem here it's more abstract
problem and I can choose the rule that
is represented by an icon iconic
representation an icon of some sort of
another of complementary angles
supplementing your opposite angle rule
etc number of the angles inside a
triangle etc so rather than asking you
for the arithmetic answer for the
numeric answer I'm asking you for which
rule applies so that might be a learning
mechanic that I define based on my
understanding as a learning scientists
of how people should learn now so I
dragged that rule and it might even show
you the answer and I dragged the other
rule and that's my response I could
translate that into a game mechanic and
that game mechanic might be an angry
birds' mechanic where I take that and I
fling it over to the response right but
is that the right way to do that and so
what we would we asked in our research
then is you know I'm fling my am I
making my answers over here is that
angry birds' mechanics a good mechanic
to use that and the answer is it's not
and it's a it's a really fun mechanic
for games but it's actually
this particular case not a good mechanic
for learning and for assessment and why
is that it's because and I'm going to
talk about that in a moment I introduced
additional skills in using the mechanic
that might prevent me from actually
doing something that I know I want to do
but I just can't get that darn bird to
that particular part of the structure
where I want to shoot it so implode
might be another mechanic I don't know
if anybody plays that it's one of my
favorite games on an unnamed touch
device that I carry with me and occasion
where you have a structure and you have
bombs and you place the bombs in
instruction and hit you bit then you hit
the big button on the right that says
implode and then it shows you what would
have happened if you had actually placed
those bombs in that structure and you
need to go below and below the dotted
line with that so here I just drag an
icon from the bottom to each location
write it I don't have to fling it and
get it right or not get it right I just
drag it and it's just as much fun but I
don't have to add a particular other
skill of getting the angle right and
getting you know the power right to to
fling it to the right location so but
both follow the same mechanic of
learning translated into a different
game mechanics so here's another
learning mechanic arrange concepts to
solve problems this is the game gravity
on the same unnamed touch device that
where you can use different items that
can be arranged in time or space to
solve a problem here the problem is to
get that ball to somehow or get
something to hit that red button that
then ends the game so the one that you
see there on the lower part of the
screen so arrange concepts to solve
problems could be translated this way
that I just have a free way of dragging
those those bars around but I can also
do that in fact control
I'm also arranging things in time and
space which are in this case the
airplanes don't need to be landed in
particular landing strips so again one
gaming can one learning mechanic
arranging things in time and space
translating into different game
mechanics tubes or plumber is the same
thing I placed the tubes in a way that
they construct a system that doesn't
leak again I can drag them to a
particular place but then they're locked
in place so I constrained you
flexibility to change things around
I'll give you another example for
learning mechanics select sets of
certain properties to solve problems you
in this case that need to belong to each
other in time or space so bejeweled is
an example for that where I need to
select a certain set of items in this
case I need to actually bring them
together and then then eliminate them
that way here's another one of samosas
where I actually carry out the the
joining of objects that I think belong
to together in time or space in very
different ways so my whole point is that
the same learning mechanic can be
translated into different game mechanics
and we need to have criteria for those
learning mechanics and for the
translation into game mechanics that
actually will help us build games that
then collect the data that we want to
collect or in this particular case
actually facilitate the learning that we
want to facilitate so they'll game the
learning mechanics themselves need to be
grounded in learning sciences and what
we know about learning in general and
there's a lot of research done on that
it's just that those people typically
don't know how to design games they need
to describe meaningful interaction with
specific subjects and need to be based
on a theoretical model of interactivity
which is people that I wrote a while ago
with two colleagues and looking at
interactivity and something that is both
happening on a behavioral level on a
cognitive level on an emotion level and
we need to understand all three in order
to really usefully design those
mechanics and they need to provide
different but equally useful or
appropriate solutions to problems so we
actually have a choice so what we then
started doing is we build a library of
learning mechanics where you see those
those different items that that I
already mentioned with the examples and
so you have this learning mechanics
library that we're constructing where we
say here's one mechanic that learning
designers say is a useful learning
mechanic and here are several ideas for
how game mechanics could look like and
so we're starting to build that as a
library and we're going to post that
online on our website G for Allied org
to have that available for other
designers so something where we want to
have that is kind of a community project
where people say oh I have an idea how
to do that in the meaningful way and
then then add new game mechanics to
learning mechanics or come up with new
learning mechanics to begin with the
point though is that the approach that
many people are taking which is to say
well there are so many game mechanics
why invent new
starts from the wrong perspective we
need to start from understanding how we
learn and then pick game mechanics
rather than saying here's a game
mechanic now can I learn with that right
and that's that's the idea and there are
some requirements for selecting game
mechanics based on learning mechanics
and I don't know if you have played this
game to this dimension M the only
first-person shooter algebra game that
has made it into the mainstream it's a
tablet digital game and to be applauded
for actually trying that but this is a
good example for ideas where game
mechanics introduce excessive amounts of
extraneous cognitive load on occasion
where you have to do things extraneous
comma closes when you have to process an
unnecessary information where that might
be related to the narrative order to
resource management if it's excessive
and yes it might make it fun but I have
to manage so many resources or I have to
think about so many other things in this
case collect certain packets of data and
in places where I constantly run out of
or run up against some obstacles that
prevent me from doing that then then
that might not be useful or in this case
this is solving equations or or
transforming equations if the game
mechanic reduces the amount of germane
load which is actually the investment of
mental effort too much that I don't even
have to think about it anymore what I do
if the game does it all for me in this
case if I move the B to the from the
right side to the left side the Y kind
of moves to the side and I can drop it
right in then I don't even have to think
if that's the right way to make that
transaction or if I if I don't I don't
have to invest any any thought into that
so that would be another requirement
that you actually still need to think
about that nagae mechanics shouldn't do
that for you we you know have other
mechanics in this case Angry Birds you
you ad fine motor skills to that or
content knowledge feel skills to to what
otherwise would be a learning task so
this is all to say that that the idea of
starting to talk about learning
mechanics rather than just game
mechanics really helped us design those
games and I think is a very interesting
way going forward but interestingly this
also implies to assessment mechanics and
that's actually something that relates
to to what many of you are doing now
we're talking about patterns of building
blocks of diagnostic
how can I actually build something that
can diagnose any particular variable of
interest during gameplay and and so
coming back to my example here the idea
that I respond to my problem with the
number versus I respond to my problem
with a conceptual rule is diagnostically
fundamentally different if I get that
number wrong if I if I say that at first
angle there's 25 or 35 degrees I don't
know why I got it wrong it could be that
I didn't know the rule or I could not be
mean that I didn't know them the the
arithmetic of coming up with that answer
and so diagnostically it's completely
not helpful unless I had other ways of
getting at that answer and that why is
that necessary so when we use the rules
to answer the question we we have much
more insights into what you actually
cognitively were processing before you
before you give that response so we
build all of this work on the framework
by Miss Lavvy called evidence centered
design and that's an approach to say we
need to think in terms of modeling all
of that we need to think of a competency
model and in other words what
competencies am i interested in and how
are they broken down over the
sub-elements of those competencies math
related science related than others then
an evidence model what kind of evidence
would I actually accept as support for
those competencies what behaviors reveal
those constructs so if I if I say I want
somebody to be able to apply rules to
solve for angles and triangles or
quadrilaterals what would I actually
accept as an expression of that
and then a task model what kind of
actions should elicit those behaviors
and having those three steps really
clarifies the way we need to think about
that modeling the domain itself and then
and then going from evidence to tasks
and so criteria then for assessment
mechanics are that they need to be based
on this evidence model so we need to
understand what we want to see as
evidence and describe aspects of the
task model what tasks are actually
required to be able to use those
mechanics for assessment purposes and
then test theoretical concerns so when I
when I have test theory prescribe that
know to test
items should depend on one another
that's not what games do games typically
heavily rely on what you did previously
and so if I make something like this an
assessment of learning and you mess
something up in the beginning because
maybe we're just playing around that
shouldn't affect future performance in
the next task but it many in many games
it does and that would not necessarily
be with learning mechanic unless
assessment mechanic unless I find a way
around that so those are those are tests
theoretical concerns which is also why
we separate learning mechanics from
assessment mechanics because for
learning mechanics it would be fine to
base it on what you do before for
assessing mechanics that's not always
the case so it's very helpful to think
about that in in separate terms we need
to create repeated exposures to the same
problem so we can have multiple
observations of the behavior of interest
and then we need to somehow help I don't
want to make explicit the steps of
learning rather than just give me the
answer because I want to be able to
diagnose how you get to the answer and
it may or may not be obvious to the
learner that they're being assessed if
they're if it's not obvious a colleague
of mine Val shoot talks to staff
assessment and if it's more obvious
which which we are typically your
friends off we just call the method
assessment but that's just different
flavors of the same idea so again then
you can build a library of saying here
are different ways of Taiwan to assess
that translate into different game
mechanics so again starting now from a
test theoretical approach I can develop
assessment mechanics that translate into
game mechanics and then I have this this
way of working with game designers who
know how to make this fun an engagement
and say well what are some requirements
then to do that we need to reduce any
unnecessary processing which we call
extraneous cognitive load we need to
make sure that there's a certain level
of mental effort involved in the
processing that's not reduced too much
that they're no fine motoric skills
involve that that have no relevance for
the task in other words I shouldn't have
a certain proficiency with my mouse to
very quickly move around the screen to
do things the content knowledge or
skills shouldn't be be added to by
irrelevant things too if I have a math
game and all of a sudden I put you in a
situation where you have to apply that
to something where you also need to know
physics to do it right then that's
helpful because it might be that other
content knowledge that are introduced
that that wasn't there and which is why
I got a low performance so I need to
have a control for that or or eliminate
that and the emotional response that
those kind of practices can give and
bird anger is a reference to a talk I
gave earlier where some people said what
we have this game that's a little bit
like Prince of Persia every every time
he dies there's a bird that actually
comes and and picks you up and puts you
back and people hate at the bird that
we're so angry at the bird which is
interesting because Angry Birds too but
they were so angry at that bird and and
so there was an emotional response that
completely ruined the entire diagnostic
ability of the game so we need to
understand how emotions are affected by
the by this kind of environment as well
so in summary there there's a lot of
interesting things to be said about
separating learning mechanics and
assessment mechanics and then turning
those into game mechanics and that's
part of the work that we're doing where
we're heading forward with that and
where we have workshops every month if
you're ever in New York City and you
want to be part of that just drop me a
line we have invited outside game
designers and other people come to those
workshops to think about those mechanics
and we have different themes every week
every every month we had teams related
to some of the more movement based and
speech recognition based systems that
are coming out now we have touch based
themes etc so there are other challenges
though and other things that we're doing
biometrics I want to just briefly touch
on them because I know we're running
short of time on it leave some time for
for questions we're looking into
supplementing or complementing those
those mechanics and the assessment we
get through user behavior on system
events in the log files with some
biometrics that triangulate the
variables were interested in so if I
have a posture sense or a movement
sensor that I see how much I move on the
screen
I might actually with my first or second
derivative get at changes in my in my
movements rather than our behaviors and
so we're looking at the the idea of how
posture can predict that and wind Olson
who comes out of because lapidary might
he has done some work in that
so so we're working with them and
looking at some of those method but the
idea is to have biometrics that help us
explain what we're seeing in the log
files so synchronized biometrics that
that we use to look for patterns in log
files we use eye tracking where we find
very interesting results that we
typically can see in lock cuts because
we don't know where people are looking
we just know where they're clicking or
what the results are the action so the
in-between space that the log file can't
capture eye tracking can capture so if
it's used for the right purpose which is
always a tricky thing but if it's used
for the right purpose it see it's useful
thing here we have this simulation that
you saw earlier and you see there's the
actual simulation on the left and the
chart on the right and we actually find
that frequent transitions back and forth
between the two helped to learn a
process the information and and have a
comprehension and transfer of that so if
we know that for my tracking if we know
that frequent transitions back and forth
predict learning then we can use some
measures to actually support that in the
design and see if that actually helps
learners or if it was just a byproduct
of that other research methods that were
using other other measures are EMG to
look at emotions quranic skin response
and and EKGs to look at engagement and
emotions and some EGS measures as well
so there's a lot of kind of branching
out and getting those biometrics to be
synchronized with the log files and that
of course raises questions of log file
analysis so what we're working on is a
what we call it what I call currently a
data crypt because crypto nomicon fan of
having a combination of an open lock
filed standard for four games research
so defining how we want to write our
logs use tasks attacks that refer to for
instance common core standards which is
now something that for the first time we
are looking at a National Curriculum of
what our standards in the various
disciplines that we should all teach in
the schools and so we can route AG
specific actions and games or specific
events and games to those standards and
skills and then user actions and game
events and biometric data put that on
lock file and then then look at specific
I'll seize on that put that in a place
where I don't have to worry where store
it and and how I have accessed that
because I'm really more interested in
learning Sciences so that that needs to
be taken care of and then find analysis
tools for visualization and data mining
on that so that's what we're doing and
that's work we're actually looking for
partners to do that with there's a
number of issues on the granularity of
that that I want don't want to talk
about because there's one more slide
that I thought was was useful for under
this is App Inventor we just talked
about the idea that if instrumented that
could get a lot of interesting insights
in the in the process of putting those
apps together what kind of decisions
people are making if that were
instrumented in the data was collected
then we could look at app inventor
essentially as an entry level
programming language and then ask
questions in a super App Inventor of
what would that might look like if we
added a number a number of things to it
that aren't currently not in there
variable scoping data typing object
classes instancing etc and made it the
code actually something DeLorean could
edit so you open a window you get the
code and do what scratch doesn't do what
code who doesn't do and what other
systems doesn't don't do which is to say
let me first build it understand how it
works on a principle conceptual level
and now peel away the layer that
actually lets me look at the code and
then start making the seamless
transition into into actually coding we
could use game line features through to
apply our research this is something
that especially Ken Perlin the ad
director of the Institute who is a
computer scientist is very interested in
from how to design that to actually be
possibly teaching to fall for
programming and I oversee the education
and assessment side of things so we're
very interested in the data mining and
data analysis issues and what that could
could show us so that's what we've got
prepared we're happy to answer questions
I just wanted to point out that even
though it's Bruce and I or here there
are a lot of collaborators who have
contributed to all of this over the
years
and here are the names and if you have
questions
we use of Education did it worker can
you elaborate on why this so it's not
our preferred approach to say here's a
game let's see if we can we can add
educational content to it because games
many games are designed for very
different purposes for entertainment
purposes for you know things other than
learning of subject matter and almost
any game probably any game teaches you
something at least to learn the game but
often it's kind of this reverse
engineering that causes more problems
than it solves
however having said that it's very
likely that there are games to which you
can do that well that is an interesting
approach and if you had a lot of money
that probably would be one approach to
take we found that being inspired by
those games learning from the games how
they've done it and then building our
own games that are much more based on
what we know first of all how learning
has to take place and second of all what
content we want to add and then
designing game mechanics that actually
are directly corresponding to the
educational goals seem to be the the
well it certainly was the approach that
we chose and with with which you were
pretty happy I could see doing the other
approach but we're kind of a very theory
based bunch we like the idea of starting
with the theoretical approach and then
deriving our next steps from that and
then looking in perfectly whether that
holds you're doing more the casting a
wide net I have a lot of ideas and
examples you can do that if you're able
to to put this online and get the large
data sets that you might get from
completely see why somebody here would
ask that question yeah so if you if you
use some of that type of data collection
you could do that we're
currently asking questions that require
us to know a lot about learners that
they would never give us online and so
you know you have to kind of strike that
balance but there are people who are
actually using approaches like that with
large datasets and and it's it's a
obviously very valid approach and and
ideally you would use both and then
figure out different questions based on
the two different approaches so this
sort of follows on from that I was a
little confused when he kept saying
reduce the cognitive load use cognitive
load it seems like there lots games like
say World of Warcraft where student kids
in particular very good at realizing
when they're being taught and then
certain kids will stop to stop learning
right I don't want to be taught I'm
playing it seems that games like World
of Warcraft you know this or research
like that constants fine cool and stuff
which shows like their literacy goes up
you know mathematical skills get their
ability to pass information on the
internet goes up but you kept saying
reduce cognitive I would use college now
is that for you so that you can research
and assess better or is that for the
students because I'm not sure whether I
agree when the students are better off
by reducing other cognitive leg all
right a very good point to and I
apologize for just throwing this in
there are three types of load and I
always had cognitive load preceded by a
type so there's intrinsic load
difficulty of the material extraneous
load is the excessive processing or the
unnecessary processing and germane load
is the amount of mental effort you
invest what I typically was talking
about is reducing the extraneous load
which is the unnecessary processing and
so that is layers that you add that
don't really help you solve the problem
that you're solving but in many cases
have other functions and so that is the
type of load where I would say looking
at whether to reduce that is possible is
useful to entertain especially and my
point was when you do that for for
assessment mechanics right if you want
to assess something but you add a
narrative on top of something and so on
that that then it doesn't become a good
assessment mechanic but I completely
agree with you that there should not be
an overall goal to reduce cognitive load
because cognitive load is investment
of thinking and of mental effort and
that's the only thing that brings about
learning so yeah I don't think our
positions are that far apart from images
so are you inherently against extraneous
locusts always trying to sort of pick at
is the idea that extraneous load is what
hides the learning from those students
that otherwise would choose not to learn
right that they think I'm playing World
of Warcraft they don't think I am
learning spreadsheets and I'm learning
how to use multiplication to make my
damage higher right like right it's this
is this is a question where you really
would have to go into some more detail
to to come to a sufficient answer but
but the the short answer perhaps might
be that when we are in the luxurious
position to design our own games and not
take an existing game like World of
Warcraft which works for for many
reasons that you know constants and
curtains are now looking into when you
are in luxurious position to design your
own game where you can say well then
let's try and reduce that unnecessary
processing and focus on the essential
processing then that's a good approach
to take when you have something that
works and when you want to study that
then I wouldn't even come up with that
argument I wouldn't I wouldn't make that
that argument so we take very different
positions from from constants and and
people like her who look at existing
games and what you can how you can
benefit from those and we say yes that's
one type of research the other type of
research is to help the designers who
want to build new games to help them
think about the decisions that they're
making and so if you if you aren't
position of designing a new game then
you can think about that and you should
and if your answer is no this is still
very important to me
then at least you've thought about it
right and and and you have an answer to
why did you do that versus World of
Warcraft was never designed to teach you
something so they made a lot of
decisions that a learning game is on I
probably wouldn't have made now that's
probably also the reason why we don't
have any really good learning game that
people played at the same numbers at
World of Warcraft but thank you
um I'm Isis embarrassing question and
I'm not claiming to be representative
either but how can you compete with a
book Boyle's law is less than 60 seconds
with a reading it's not hard to
understand once you have the intuition
that it's about momentum I can't believe
that I could learn to play the game
that's supposed to teach me the concept
in less time than I can read it in a
book and understand it and in try not to
be hostile but I've been subjected to
many learning innovations in my life and
none of them were an improvement over
reading in a book do you want to talk
there are many ways of responding that
I'll bring out the big guns and I'm a
first responder well do you think one
you're not our target audience okay I
mean this as a compliment you're an
outlier
so students like you will learn no
matter what gets thrown at them the
students that we were typically
targeting they had the books and they
were failing so for example the gains
that we talked about with the the
understanding graphs these students were
taught graphs and you know the
traditional with a book had no clue but
after using the simulations they
actually gained some knowledge that they
weren't there so books are great great
tools I don't think this is submit and
it's a mess so two things one this is
targeting students that may be books
were not working so well for secondly
the games for learning is never meant to
be a replacement for teachers or for
classrooms they're meant to be a
supplementary tool that can be used in
the classroom so the same with our
simulations we didn't say ok we get rid
of the teachers and put the simulations
in we said we worked with teachers to
develop the curriculum that the
simulations were embedded into so books
are great they're not but they're not
reaching all of the learners and just
look at this another tool that may reach
learners that the books may have been
failing yeah because what i fear when
you start talking about using them for
evaluation and so on is that rather than
taking the role of the lego bricks that
you can sort of go and play with and see
if it improves your understanding of
some
thing they sort of become the mandatory
thing that everybody has to do and it
becomes a break on the entire experience
for the people who are quick so you know
we're just as you were talking about the
frustration from firing the firing the
angry birds having to learn the game in
addition to learning the material when
the material is not hard to learn is
going to be a great source of
frustration for some people yeah and in
the same way that you said having
learned the game sorry there's some milk
being steamed so I only got half the
question but you said having to play the
game when you've already got the concept
may be frustrating the same way you know
as a student I was good at math having
to sit through the lecture on how to do
better
derivatives got Mitchell how do
derivatives after I got it after the
first lecture staying to the next three
lectures on it for the heck of it so
yeah there's always that but the
trade-off and so that's but the
advantage of with games if it's well
designed is that it picks up on that and
you're suddenly you know leveled up so
there's it's always at that sort of
sweet spot of where the learning is
taking place which is not always the
case in some traditional or traditional
educational formats that's our goal
