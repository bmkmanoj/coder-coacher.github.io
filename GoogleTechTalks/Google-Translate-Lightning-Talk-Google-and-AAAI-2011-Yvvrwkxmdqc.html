translate and not sure I guess most
people here probably who use google
translate before who or who did not use
ok so I get I didn't don't don't need to
explain too much about it so basically
if you provide this right free
translation service where you can
translate typing some source version say
do different language or sentence or
paragraph or you can translate web pages
who is integrated into gmail and you can
do all the cross-lingual search so you
type in a query in English and you can
search just other language as we also
tell you which language that might be a
good language for that specific very so
if you look like how machine translation
right machine donate was one of the very
early things that people looked at in
artificial intelligence and has been
pursued for many many years and what
being physically the way we are
addressing machine translation is using
very large amounts of data very large
concentration of resources in learning
basically how together so it's a
different approach and SB person for a
long time and in the field but nowadays
most people in the research community
also pursuing this kind of data driven
approach and so here it shows kind of a
timeline of what happened in the last
few years so in the very beginning we
didn't have our own system which is
licensed third party system which was
based machine translation and then in
2006 we had our first four or a small
number of languages of our very first
language XE was Chinese and then edit
arabic in Russian and over time
basically then when it turned out that
this approach is really working well we
can't build a better machine translation
cane system
which are much greater than before then
we just apply this to all those
languages of 2007 kind of did all the
languages our own in-house system and
then we just scaled the system up too
many more languages and better quality
and so now we have actually so the list
is actually incomplete I think you show
some 50 languages or so but now we have
16 different language the last set of
languages that we launch was bengali
kannada tamil so language is very few
people probably know where they even
come from and so the very important
thing for us for building the machine
translation system is data and there's
just this universal rule more data is
better data is just a learning curve
where we have our system for a bunch of
different languages what do you think is
the Chinese English trained in a million
words so if you go to 10 million words
quoted you gets better and on this curve
it's kind of like a point to on this
metric axis and reduced core then it's
kind of reasonable transition it's not a
good translation but it kind of is ok to
expose you those to that so with 1
million words it's very hard to build a
decent system you need a very simple
language but if you have 10 million
words bunch of languages are there and
then you just go to 100 million words or
two billion words and you see a nice
improvement which is a little bit
flattening on that but but basically
right you have a million words then you
can get pretty good quality for for all
of language and this is just data that
we use known to train the translation
model can kind of do the same thing if
you just add more data the language
model which shows half-wits the target
language and then again get similar
quality improvements so I what I I don't
want to explain kind of power system
works and all that stuff what I want to
do is kind of discuss some hot areas
interesting challenges where we are
currently working on or
or which which which are hard for us to
deal with and so I go through those long
distance tomorrow morphologically which
languages evaluation feedback notes and
species beach translation and those
kinds of things so though a big
challenge for a machine translation each
other like it's a lot of the models
natural language processing nowadays is
we are pretty good in local dependencies
ngrams are quick right we have tons of
them then anything that is locally you
can do amazing things very square it's
very hard for a human to kind of
complete because we can estimate those
probabilities on just huge amount of
data but things which are more longer
distance those are the tricky ones and
so we meant a lot of the research that
we put in in order to figure out better
ways to do for example your ring from
English to Japanese that we can move to
the right place and figure out all the
dependencies that tell us how to do that
so morphology is another one just going
into target languages but but where
something like Russian so another big
change is just evaluation so the thing
way we built the machine translation
system which is very important visitors
that we're kind of agnostic about what
works right so we have an idea we try to
implement that idea and and if it works
if we get a better result than before
then we use that and that goes in the
system and if not you don't do it and
then we just go through that loop over
that and by that we learn kind of what
matters and what doesn't and and one big
change is at this point just this metric
how do we know that our system is
better'n and human evaluations are very
expensive and the main problem all
today's high latency that you got those
back and and you want to have kind of
really meaningful metrics to tell you
what what gets veteran and the metrics
has been used in machine translation for
a long time kind of because there was so
much progress she is not really
well anymore so Soviet we are having a
lot of work on in that space so another
one is this feedback loop so what Peter
mentioned with it with a control aspect
of that so for a lot of things that
Google II had this amazing kind of
feedback loops where we're search can
get better because people search or
speech recognition came better because
people use speech recognition and thanks
to get the results and then you have
more training data for machine
translation is much harder way because
typically people look at a machine
translation and wouldn't tell us now
this was a bad translation or you should
do it differently and but but so we are
experimenting with a bunch of different
things with a framework for human
translators for example or here is
something where where if you go with
your mouse to a translation and then you
hover over all that then you get a list
of alternative and then if you don't
understand this word very much I said
what is this and then you see a list of
alternatives and then you say oh if the
third form then makes total sense and
then you can correct the sentence by
clicking on that and this helps the user
and but then is also a feedback for the
system we order produce next time
probably at rotating that's more similar
to to that one but this is an active
kind of area where in machine
translation it's not as TS and some of
the other areas to get this kind of back
and certainly a very exciting is the
future speech translation so if you have
an Android phone then I basically had
this conversation mode in google
translate where you can just speak in
English and have a conversation with
someone in Spanish back and forth and
and this users and the speech
recognition technology will read it more
in a second and and this is just an area
where all those different technology
which go into that machine to invasion
speech recognition speech synthesis and
big aspect also is the whole HCI
interaction in order to make this very
efficient for the user given the fact
that once in a while system is will use
a wrong recognition
translation okay so that was it for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
