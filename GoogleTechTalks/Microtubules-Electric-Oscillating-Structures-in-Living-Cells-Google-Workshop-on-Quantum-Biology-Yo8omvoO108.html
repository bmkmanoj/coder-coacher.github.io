funny because it talked about micro
heroes electric oscillating structures
in living cells he's from
first of all
hypothesis of coherent oscillations
observes observed oscillations in living
cells microtubule Association mechanism
of oscillations and something how
ambient them pink may influence
coherence that coherence time I would
like to mention a few the first model is
based on Spector energy channeling
predict spectra energy channeling the
second model is based on a nonlinear
interaction between elastic and electric
polarization waves
the first model is based on interaction
between frelich system between
oscillation system and heat bars and the
nonlinear the nonlinear interaction is
false between two possible
austerity austerity mode and prairie
system in valve or selling people in the
river and this mode is responsible for
energy channeling across frequency
spectrum energies channel along the
downward the frequency spectrum and some
modes may be coherently excited it
repels is the same as dams along the
river
ferrer it assumed only the lowest
frequency mode but even higher may be
excited and very likely there is in
biological system about Banton's
or more modes in the whole frequency
spectrum that are excited
the second model is model of nonlinear
interaction between elastic and polar
polarization mode is based on classical
evaluation formulation of kinetic energy
potential energy nonlinear nonlinear
coupling is nonlinear coupling
evaluation of Lagrangian equation of
motion and then Frederic derived just
the situation abscissa it contains four
figures and there is polarization
electric polarization and ordinate is
ordinate is
modified density of potential energy the
new parameter depends on elastic
oscillations energy of elastic
oscillation the greater parameter the
greater energy is the energy of elastic
oscillation sound effects for higher is
there if certain selection is its parts
then there is ferroelectric state on the
basis of oscillation with this
potentionally that special point of the
second second mode for Erick model there
are two branches of oscillations of Van
Van is in the center without
polarization the second is with with in
ferroelectric States the relation
between two modes if we want to join
these two modes it's necessary for
instance in the first model use
coefficients dependent on excitation but
we do not know what what dependence is
correct
it must be measured and all this
frequency channeling must be included in
the second model and now it is shown
here three regions polarization elastic
heat bath first motor
the digital specter energy
transformation energy condensation the
second border ferroelectric state and
potential valley therefore all
assessment of for Eric system based only
on the first model and linear linear
coefficients for instant coherence and
so on is nonsense it leads to incorrect
results and it is published in two very
nice journal always now observed
electric oscillation in living cells 10
to the 15 Hertz it it seems reasonable
because microtubule is is cavity
resonator at a soft x-ray frequencies
and it is not measured yet it is only
theoretical prediction but really it it
corresponds and simultaneously some
frequency modes correspond to transition
x-ray transition in carbon oxygen and
and nitrogen
and this spectrum in exist in in vacuum
now therefore there may be excitation in
the whole range pairing at Los
University of California measured
measured oscillation on atomic force
microscope me real problem is this
measurement and also confirms that this
measurement are practical nature the
measured also the first men who measure
oscillations was Paul and published here
in the United States he'll use director
of erotic method attraction of small
directed particles he assumed that the
frequency is from about 5 kilohertz
up to 10 megahertz here so on
didn't measure directly he only assessed
effect of external electromagnetic field
because he is able by external
electromagnetic field destroy sir
because he destroys polymerization of
microtubules
therefore he assumes that microtubules
have this frequency between 100 to 300
kilohertz it is not a direct measurement
our measurement of Earth's health an
amperage that fryer University in Berlin
measured in the region from about 1
megahertz to 50 megahertz is in several
in several and publish this
Bellucci matter it is something special
because he disclose the head Gnostic
method of cancer based on detection of
them oscillations he the method is very
strong Pro transmitting transmitting
electric field at 465 megatons which is
strongly damped in cancer and to note
them in a normal tissue
this is indirect method for any
prediction but that fact that no effect
for healthy tissue shows that there is
something there is a strongly damping
near zone field of the oscillator ruler
measure effect of external field on his
growth ratio freeze of gross light of
cells and assumed that this that it is a
resonant frequency of the cells he also
measured at higher frequencies at 70
megahertz which is used for instance now
by Professor CTO in fear for certain
experiments and in this in this region
also predicted period of our goal and a
year in Moscow
Albrecht Durer here in the United States
a measured interaction between cells and
proved that this interaction is on the
basis of electromagnetic field in the
region near red red visible or a
near-infrared measured emission of a
photon from tissues in visible and UV
region we also measure oscillations
eight eight megahertz but I must say
something to be balanced this
was Smith and Post published in this
their to each other for paper and we are
at a loss whether it was really signal
of the cells or or oscillating system
because we measured similar situation
but we are rather assume that it is
feedback positive feedback as in an
austerity he very major at the beginning
Smith the beginning of division of cells
they measured signal that emerge from
noise with spectrum about two megahertz
which narrowed to 250 Hertz and after
several minute this spectrum disappeared
we measured the same but we assigned it
to two positive either that measure
using Raman spectroscopy oscillations in
3-4 terahertz in the same region
measured also French researcher was and
Martin using femtosecond spectroscopy
concerning that there is special because
it it was at the time it was assumed
that it is luminous sense what he
measure but it is questioned whether it
was reminiscence or not because at the
time they use short by Frank lasers
there must be used razors in near
infrared region races and
second you must measure nanoscale
domains not the wholesale and they did
not analyze distribution of oscillators
in the self and the distribution is very
likely connected with microtubules and
as the microtubules are organized in
interphase as from the center from the
centrosome radially to the to the
periphery and because there is several
hundred microtubule in a Cell therefore
we have no more mic nano zones the
length is significant the ranks may be
for instance five micrometers
but microtubule is twenty nine twenty
five nanometers in diameter
therefore we must measure by points that
correspond to the dimensions of this
nano zone
three very severe
Oh
we use
we use for instance have both evaporated
strips these strips are 14 micrometers
wide and there is yet 8 micro meters and
all micro electronic sensor something is
wrong
Michael electronics in Center were
strips we're about 10 10 micrometers and
forget from 3 to 10 micrometers that is
the view at the sensor the Riu system
with sensor amplifier in a double
screening box one box were washed from
nu-metal spectrum analyzer and PC all
was controlled by PC we use
we use two types of cells genetically
modified a van a van of the cells has
has no microtubules in the interface and
the microtubules because the temperature
was had Bureau fourteen degrees at
relative temperature and after heating
too permissive temperature the cells
started and pace by building microtubule
and the second cells had also their
modified in genetically there has the
microtubules but not functional and then
the temperature was was increased from
Paramus for other safety too permissive
this microtubules was the polymerize new
microtubule for it lasted about one hour
therefore we have comparison here is
measurement
abscissa frequency it's a part of and
or do not report great power all the
left hand side is power and the people
of spectrum analyzer and on the right
hand side is power at the input of
preamplifier and the scien
denotes mean value of the noise and the
red line about 6 DB above design both
use that the line that are greater than
the line was was taken into computation
and the Opera
that means yeah therefore out higher
than this figure this design shows the
time in cell cycle first part
prophase to center of food centrosomes
the second power
Michael Cooper Michael Michael to stay
that is fall and if I stay and face beam
and you can see here that there are
needs for formation of Michael Cooper's
for formation for metaphase anaphase
anaphase anaphase B and these more
statistically significant from all
measurements which we performed
now very shortly mechanisms of
oscillations in cells
this is from proton space charge layer
around mitochondria on the left hand
side this metric space in mitochondria
on the left on the right hand side space
charge chaplains array of protons around
mitochondria mitochondria are aligned
around microtubules and this is space
charge layer around mitochondrion
abscissa
distance from the parameter as a
membrane therefore because mitochondria
occupy about 20% of cell volume this
strong field and space charge proton
space charge layer occupy the rest of
the cell comparators of the third and
because water is organized in the in the
electric field of this value of this
intensity the whole water in the cell is
organized strictly organized and is very
important for for understanding of
biological systems here is the way of
measurement because these black spots
are certain certainty
30 micrometers feels that were used for
measurement of the field
dinah dinah cop I'm a proper man
filtered the the main supply of energy
to to microtubules are from mitochondria
so-called wasted energy energy that is
not used for production of ATP and gtp
this energy is is liberated in the form
of photons and in the form of heat and
because efficiency of of production is
about 40% 60% of energy is the basic
energy that excites the remain on
yourself
here only for show there are two
organization system in the self water
organization of water
the first is so-called interpretation of
the colony it is caused by charge as the
surface of structures in voluntee for
instance arid microtubule this this
layer organized there is absolutely no
meters Armus Armus and cook published 30
years ago all religions and in the case
of of Michael Michael Michael and area
from all the water is in the service
organized but it is not so geometrical
regular you understand it is irregular
with concerning on the direction of the
field here is everything integers is
nonlinear for all series based on on
linear processes lead to wrong results
principle of superposition that's not
very known as nonlinear effects are very
strong in this field based energy supply
supply energy and microtubule generate
electric or electromagnetic field and
this field we assume we assume that has
no indirect principal cytoskeletal
organization interaction between cells
inside cells and information transfer
and last last picture effect of anything
of ceramic media on self-oscillation
here it's blue factor of the abscissa is
at ten megahertz the coherent time maybe
four it is effect of ambient damping but
what concerns microtubule will be said
by Anita
mechanism of oscillations depends on
mitochondrial function mitochondria
intensive cells produce less energy
about 1/2 of energy that is produced in
healthy cells it is it was disclosed by
verbal 80 years ago and makalah is from
Albert University of Alberta for method
how to return mitochondria to normal
function and mitochondria start normal
function even even the cell is normal or
start apoptosis proton space charge is
around microphone a little acknowledges
the non utilize energy and produce GPP
and ATP microtubule have nonlinear
properties are electrical polar and is
then by surrounding medium strongly them
if ordering of water is disturbed and
that is the reason there is no cause by
roberto Verducci found this method of
geometry ordering of level of of cycles
of water is very important for normal
function thank you for your attention
a comment in this connection we should
mention jerry pollack from University of
Washington in Seattle who is working on
things which are very consistent with
these pictures namely ordering of water
in living systems and and the fact that
this ordering state is actually non
equivalent state pumped by photons and
one of the messages actually - I mean
this is mm half-serious but but actually
has a scientific scientific basis one of
the messages to to get exposed to
sunshine a lot because this is healthy
very healthy at the level of cell main
maintenance of healthy cells requires
exposure to Sun which which works like a
battery for the ordering of water if
you're interested you know Google of
