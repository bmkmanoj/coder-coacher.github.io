delighted to be with you today and talk
to you about how leading from strength
using your unique signature strengths is
the best route to sustain to creativity
top performance central government
recent findings in business research
neuroscience and psychology support the
idea that leaving from strength allows
us to work with our weaknesses and is a
much better strategy than focusing on
weaknesses I find that when you can
leave from strength you bring your best
to the situation and you enjoy the
process one and since I also believe the
joy and excellence my natural business
partners it's it's the way to go it's
what I use is a coach with individual
organizations and I'm excited about
sharing some of those items with you
today to him I want to focus on how do
we first get these ideas it isn't
natural to interest if you imagine
historically what's wrong rather than
what's right and in fact there are
plenty of research don't ask if you just
think about it if you in the long ago
passed over report card with 3 a's two
bees MSC which of those would your
parents have focused on we think it's a
no-brainer right well that's natural but
it turns out that's not what's best and
this big ideas behind strengths based
leadership begin coming to the fore
around 2000 and in the years since then
have coalesced through two main streams
of research and development the first
one comes from the Gallup Organization
yes the same people who are bombarding
you with political polls at the moment
but their research and education center
has spent the last 30 years interviewing
top performers on all aspects of the job
ladder from the janitorial staff stew
CEOs and out of those two million
interviews they discerned that it would
be important to find out what made them
special what made them able to use their
strengths to the max in that way so they
went out and did a whole host of other
interviews they talked to 1.7 million
people in a hundred and one companies in
63 countries and they asked a single
question and that question was at work
do you have the chance to do what you
alone do best every day and anybody got
a guess as to what
centage could answer yes to that
question anybody 30 15-5 not quite that
bad it's actually between thirty and
fifteen twenty percent of the people in
all those companies in all those
countries said they actually get to use
their strengths on a daily basis that's
eighty percent of the people in all that
area not able to do what they do best so
out of that then the Gallup people went
back to the two million high performers
and looked at the characteristic
strengths they found among these people
what did they have in common and they
evolved an inventory of 34 strengths
that they began using to test people
with to give people the chance to find
out their top strengths and you too
could do that I wanted to share with you
that it's possible to take what they are
now calling the strengths finder
inventory it's in a book called
strengths finder to point o the original
research came out in a book by Donald
Clifton and Marcus Buckingham called now
discover your strengths that was some
time ago 2001 now they have a new
iteration of course they called it
strengths finder to point o the catch
with this one is you have to buy the
book in order to take the online
inventory there's a code embedded in the
book jacket that you have to use and the
other thing about this one is that they
only give you your top five strengths
you don't get to find out about the
other 29 but it's a very useful
inventory for work situations because
they use business language in describing
the strengths the other inventory that
I'll get to in a minute use this more
general language for instance my top
strength on this one is called strategic
and obviously that's something good to
leverage and business
my top strength and the other inventory
is called curiosity and interest in the
world similar but slightly different so
the Gallup people define strengths this
way they say that a strength is a
combination of talent plus knowledge
plus skills strengths they say is
consistent near perfect performance well
when I hear that I have to just kind of
take the burden off my shoulders because
who's near perfect all the time but
consistent strong performance is
composed of talent which they find is
genetically linked they say it happens
in that synaptic pruning that occurs in
our brains the first three years of our
lives plus knowledge the facts and
lessons you can learn plus the skills
the steps to learn something although
some of the skills they've found they
can't break down into steps what would
be the steps for instance to learn
empathy there are ways to go about it
but it's not necessarily a step-by-step
process so those 34 strengths are
reflected in this inventory and they
also say that you can kind of fight
figure out your strengths for yourself
if you don't want to buy the book look
at what you do spontaneously look at
what you learn easily look at what puts
you in that state of relaxation and
comfort where things are just clicking
for you like Michael Jordan on the
basketball court and also look at what
you long to do more of those would point
you towards your talents which you can
develop into strengths so that's
something about the Gallup people and
there has been a whole flow of books
associated with strengths finder the
most recent and I understand for
Googlers there's going to be on the
website a list of the resource books i'm
going to be talking about today the most
recent gallup book by marcus buckingham
is called go put your strength to work
and in it he suggests ways to identify
your own strengths separate from taking
the inventory and how to use those to
manage around your weaknesses they don't
say to ignore your weaknesses they say
put your strengths to work to overcome
those weaknesses so the other stream of
research comes through the field of
positive psychology that has been
gathering steam over the last seven or
so years when i first started
researching and teaching about strengths
based leadership using positive
psychology there were maybe a hundred or
more references to positive psychology
on google the last time I looked there
were 15 million so it is a growing
stream within the field of psychology
and dr. Martin Seligman the primary
exponent of it decided back in the early
2000s when he was president of the
American Psychological Association to
make well being the center of his
mission his tenure as president we know
if you go to the diagnostic and
statistical manual of mental disorders
we know in great detail what is wrong
with people but we don't necessarily
know what's right with them he wanted to
create what he called a classification
of the sanity's those things that help
us enjoy well-being and be top
performers and so he commissioned a
bunch of researchers to look at what was
already out there and see what we know
about what makes people strong and how
those strengths play out he found a
particular formula seemed to hold its H
equals s plus C plus V H stands for
happiness and that then s is set range
we all have a set range of happiness we
tend to come back to no matter what
happens to us you win the lottery you
think your life is
now perfect in six months you'll be
about as happy as you were before you
won the lottery you get hit by a bus
leaving google and you lose the use of
your legs terrible tragedy but in about
six months you'll be back to the same
range of happiness that you were before
this happened to you your set range is
pretty genetically conditioned about
half of your score on your set range
would be accounted for by what your
biological parents would have gotten I
sometimes say that in people go oh no
but in truth that's not all on top of
set range there's a see circumstances
and here you would think that some
circumstances such as education good
health living in a fortunate country
would be good for us there are only two
that seemed to have above a subsistence
level much much help do you think one of
them would be money getting a little bit
back and forth it's not above
subsistence level money is not that much
of a factor in happiness and using your
strengths the two that do prove out to
be helpful are having a strong network
of social relationships and having a
system of meaning a sense of meaning in
your life whether that translates in
traditional faith perspectives or simply
a philosophy that helps you get out of
bed in the morning those are the two
circumstantial things that help but then
there's the variables H equals ask set
range circumstances see V variables and
the variables are what the positive
psychologist went after they looked at
what strengths of character are allow us
to make the most of what turns out to be
forty percent of our happiness is
conditioned by those variables we've got
a lot of a piece of the piece of the pie
pretty big piece to work with and so
what they did to try and discover
are there Universal or near universal
variables that can help with this
strengths stuff so they commissioned a
bunch of people to read in all the
wisdom and philosophical traditions
everything from Confucius to the Koran
to the Bible and the samurai code even
though Klingon warrior code they looked
at what virtues and character strengths
were thought to be universal in
different systems of belief and out of
those they found six sort of overarching
virtues they are wisdom and knowledge
courage social intelligence justice
temperance and transcendence I'll say
those again wisdom and knowledge courage
social intelligence justice temperance
and transcendence from those six they
elaborated 24 strengths and they put
those into an inventory you can also
take online but in this case you don't
have to buy a book even better you can
simply go to the website that is named
for dr. Martin Seligman's latest book
authentic happiness dot org authentic
happiness dot org and what you're
looking for is called the values in
action VI a signature strengths survey
VI a signature strengths survey what I
like about this one is that you can get
not only your top five but all 24 in
rank order which allows you to look at
where your preferences fall and you can
use some of your mid-range strengths
more consistently when you know them for
some reason the Gallup people will only
give you your top five despite all the
complaining about that so I've actually
used both of these inventories
with individual clients and in
organizations and I find that it doesn't
come easily at first sometimes people
resist their strengths they say oh I
don't think I'm anything special in that
area how can that possibly be one of my
strengths well historically were not
conditioned to think of the positive
where we're ready to look at the
weakness and prepare for it were anxious
to save ourselves and so we don't look
at the positive and the strengths but
when we turn that around we can see that
amplifying those strengths allows us to
build on and manage where we're having a
tough time in particular ways let me
just give you some examples I mentioned
that my top strength is strategic
another of my strengths on the gallop
one is called input that means i love to
collect data i have files of quotes and
poems and things that I think might be
useful someday and when I'm preparing
for something like this talk or a
weekend workshop at Stanford I find that
I am overwhelmed with data I can overuse
those two strengths and it won't serve
me well unless I remember that one of my
other strengths is communication and a
fourth one is inclusiveness I want to
make sure people feel included and I
consistently get the feedback that I
give people more than they need pare it
down make it simpler you lost me you
know when I get that feedback I know I'm
overusing the input strength and in
order to be strategic and more
successful I need to make sure I test
out my ideas with others and here's
where strengths within teams become so
important on the gallop inventory there
are two strengths that you'll often find
in conflicts within teams
one of them is called activator that
person is ready to go out of the gate
the idea comes up they've already
thought about implementation they've
already chosen the people they want to
work with they're impatient with you for
even asking why we should get levels of
approval that's the activator strength
then there's the deliberative strength
it's also a strength but it suggests
that the best thing to do is to take
your time think it through clearly get
all of the data under your hands and
then come to a decision you know these
two people on a team are going to have
judgments about one another they're
going to have stereotypes they're going
to say oh that person's always going off
half-cocked and well you know this
person's always just dragging us down
they delay everything we need to do but
when you understand how strengths play
into a team you see that just as in an
individual we can develop all the
strengths that are there within a team
you can use that as well and know that
if you feel like you might be leaning
too hard on one of your strengths you
can check it out with someone else who
clearly has strengths in other areas so
in addition to this basic information I
wanted to share with you today an
additional research finding as a bunch
of tools for you to take away and that
has to do with five key strengths that
research shows are never fail ones for
any of us this comes from this second
inventory the values in action
significant strengths survey the
Seligmann positive psychology work after
the initial round of research a Korean
psychologist dr. Nansen Park got
interested in whether there were certain
key strengths that made people more
satisfied and better performers and
unlike the Gallup research that never
went into that they did
this with a number of people who taken
the online survey well into the
thousands and now they're replicating
the study and they found five key
strengths I like to think that they
represent all the domains of human
learning so I'll just go through them
with you and then towards the end I'll
give you a chance to ask questions or
interact a bit the first of these key
strengths is zest I think of it as the
physical domain strength sometimes it's
called vitality or enthusiasm it's that
reservoir of body based energy that we
all have when we're doing something we
love when we've had a good night's sleep
when we're excited about a project this
is one of the key strengths that anyone
can use as an ally and if you are
finding that you're losing touch with
that aspect of your being nothing is
more important then you that you refill
the well because burnout lies the way of
losing your zest zest is not correlated
to health it's correlated to how
strongly you feel that you can have an
impact on your world so it's a physical
presence and magnetism that we see in
leaders who are physically very dominant
and comfortable in their skins but all
of us can learn to work with that
strength and to access it more there are
is an important aspect to this that I
think comes out in a book by two other
coaches to Jim laura and tony schwartz
in their work they found that managing
energy is more important than managing
time that if you learn to do things that
will preserve your physical zest at the
right time of day and if you keep
yourself energized throughout a day with
what they call positive energy rituals
simple things like never sitting for
more than an hour at a time getting up
and walking around having a social
interaction to break up times of pure
concentration and focus that your level
of zest or physical well-being will stay
high so zest is the first of the five
key strengths the second is curiosity it
is that ongoing intrinsic interest both
in everything in the internal world our
thoughts our feelings our attitudes our
perceptions and sensations as well as
everything in the external world near
and far curiosity enlivens our life and
inoculates us against boredom when we
are using the strength of curiosity our
minds are alive and alert and I don't
think I have to tell Googlers about that
because that's part of what brought you
here your curiosity your drive to know
more and to leverage knowledge in
particularly innovative and important
ways the foremost researcher in this
area has the bone crunching name of
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi a hungarian
psychologist who for the last almost 40
years has been researching a phenomenon
he calls flow or optimal experience when
we are in flow it's as if time stands
still our skills are equal to the task
and we just feel like we could do this
forever he says that the flow channel
operates on either side of on one side
anxiety if you're too anxious you can't
get in flow and on the other side
boredom if you're not stimulated enough
you can't and get and flow either so he
suggests that keeping our curiosity
enlivened is a very important discipline
for top performers and that's why it's a
key strength we can enliven our
curiosity by paying attention to
anything how many blue things can you
see in this room right now I said blue
because i'm looking at a sea of mostly
blue chairs but maybe i should have said
green
Csikszentmihalyi says nothing is
interesting until we focus our attention
on it you can bring your attention to
your commute to a dilemma that has
bedeviled you if you simply shift your
perspective and focus your attention in
new ways and in that way you'll be using
that mental key strength the third key
strength zest curiosity is optimism I
think of it as the emotional domain of
strengths leadership and if that were
drums through the wrong way I don't mean
Pollyanna optimistic people interpret
their troubles as transient as limited
to just one situation and as
controllable pessimistic people think
that their troubles are going to last
forever they're going to bleed into
everything and there's nothing you can
do about it and those two orientations
are to an extent conditioned by our
genetics and our family background but
they are also amenable to change and
nobody knows that better than dr. Martin
Seligman who got this whole movement
started he says he's a dyed-in-the-wool
pessimist and he takes his medicine of
what he calls learned optimism very
seriously and there is much written
about how you might do that the most
recent book that I confess to not even
having Rinna finished completely because
it only came out a couple weeks ago but
I would recommend it highly is called
the howl of happiness it's by Sonia
lubomirski another name not easy to
spell but if you just look up the howl
of happiness she's a researcher from UC
Riverside who has looked at all the
positive psychology research and
codified twelve strategies to help boost
your level of functioning your strengths
based functioning one alone that I'll
mentioned because I think it ties in
with optimism
is avoid overthinking and social
comparisons when you're in a highly
driven competitive environment it's so
possible to get into that loop where
you're just overthinking everything and
you're not able to break out of your own
mental rut you are comparing yourself to
your intellectual peers you're wondering
if people are thinking you're losing
your strength and you are going into a
pessimistic downward spiral if you stay
there but the people I coach I suggest
ways to avoid that what lubomirski says
in her book a few strategies are to
distract yourself as soon as you notice
the ER overthinking in whatever way
works she also suggests visualization
could be helpful for people who are
visual to imagine a big red stop sign
appearing right in front of you every
time you start to overthink and finally
a one that's worked for a lot of people
is to schedule your overthinking periods
you will all over think only from this
15-minute period in a day if you do that
it's likely to help boost that key
strength of optimism on then to the last
to the fourth after zest curiosity and
optimism is gratitude and this is
actually the most potent of the five key
strengths there is more research showing
that gratitude is powerful than it with
any of the other strengths and here the
research is based on interventions where
they have asked people to do different
things first they researched what they
called a gratitude visit to go to
someone that you have never properly
thanked and tell them of your gratitude
could be something small could be
life-changing but the gratitude visit
was one intervention another was a
gratitude letter which would allow you
to write to someone perhaps who was no
longer on the
planet but to whom you also had never
expressed your gratitude fully and the
third intervention was to write in some
kind of form whether journal or just uh
nuh posted every day three things that
you were grateful for what came up
immediately was that this last one the
writing three gratitudes was the most
powerful intervention in fact when
people who identified as moderately to
severely depressed on the inventory on
their website did that intervention they
weren't on medication they weren't in
therapy but they were moderately to
severely depressed they wrote three
gratitudes a day for two weeks they had
all moved out of that range and into
mildly depressed that may not sound like
much if you don't want to be depressed
but there's nothing that we can equal
with psychotherapy and medication that
that over takes that so now they're
refining it and there are whole books on
gratitude and how to work with it the
latest finding from lubomirski book is
that while it works well to write three
a day it can be even better to do that
once or twice a week to do it regularly
but not random but randomly rather than
religiously every day that seems to have
a more positive effect and they found
with the initial study with three
gratitudes doing it daily that compared
with the control group after six months
after doing it only for two weeks those
people were still 25% happier than the
control group they had begun adopting it
naturally so gratitude is a very potent
key strength and finally the last of the
five zest curiosity optimism gratitude
and the ability to give and receive
appreciation caring or if you want to
use the word love this strength is
important I think in the domain that is
both social and in terms of the meaning
and purpose framework for our lives most
of us find that we may be able to give
appreciation but it's harder to receive
it why it's in the language language
would we say can't you take a compliment
as if it were cod liver oil we find it
difficult often to appreciate at what's
coming towards us and to accept it and
be affirmed by it but we need it
desperately in another book that's come
out of the gallop people they looked at
how much appreciation and caring is
expressed in the American workplace they
found that the number one reason people
leave their jobs is because they feel
under unappreciated at work the number
one reason and then when they went
further and surveyed tens of thousands
of people they found that sixty-five
percent of the people they surveyed had
received no recognition in the previous
year at their work none zero sixty-five
percent no wonder that's the number one
reason so the ability to give an
appreciation and receive affirmation
appreciation caring is so important as a
key strengths as well it leads right
into the package that you put together
when you use these five strengths as
your allies plus those that you might
naturally discover either on your own or
through one of these inventories well if
all this sounds overwhelming I think
it's important to close by saying that
the small step approach is best you
don't have to suddenly try and leverage
all your strengths and bring them in
what we know from neuroscience is that
change is overwhelming so what I do in
working with clients is have them begin
to
amplify their strengths and apply their
strengths to their work and personal
dilemmas in small increments there's a
wonderful book called one small step can
change your life by a psychologist who
works with the doctors at UCLA Medical
Center and Robert Moore who wrote one
small step can change your life takes
the view that our neurological makeup is
such that if we try to put too much
change into the system at once we will
shut down we will become terrified
there's this little aspect in the
midbrain this little organ called the
amygdala that pumps out all our
fight-or-flight hormones it's very
needed if you're a zebra grazing and
there's a lion nearby immediately
everything stops but running away
however we're no longer zebras and yet
our amygdalas fire just walking into a
difficult meeting or anticipating a
tense exchange with a colleague
defending your idea in front of your
team all of that is the equivalent of
the lion and yet what happens when the
amygdala takes over is that only ten
percent of the information about the
situation is what we act on the other
ninety percent goes to our neocortex for
long-term analysis and storage great if
you have time not so good if you're on
the spot so to reduce our anxiety and
make the changes as small as possible is
what more are suggests and it's what I
would suggest to you in an approach to
leveraging your strengths find something
that is a little tiny tweak whether it's
writing three gratitudes or adopting
some positive energy ritual maybe taking
one of the inventories and posting your
five strengths so that you see it once a
day review your day when did you use 10
what was that like how might you have
done it differently that kind of
curiosity will take you for
our and it's important also to do all of
this in balance and moderation I find
that one of the temptations as a coach
is to encourage overmuch and to over
promise we don't want to do that we want
to be realistic about how tough it is to
sustain creativity and high performance
but I also don't want to underplay how
possible the hope is and how small
increments make a difference in what you
do in a minute I'll open it up for
questions or comments if any of you have
any but I'd like to close with a little
wisdom passage from Stephen Mitchell's
translation of the ancient Chinese text
the doubt urging by Lao Tzu Lao Tzu
wrote fill your bowl to the brim and it
will spill keep sharpening your knife
and it will blunt chase after money and
security and your heart will never
unclench care about people's approval
and you will be their prisoner do your
work then step back the only path to
serenity so I wish you serenity and
strengths based leadership and I thank
you for being with us today and and
taking this time together does anyone
have any questions or comments you can
either just ask it where you are come to
the mic
I sense considering but I'm not hearing
anything so yes 60 divides between it's
about equal the question was if forty
percent is the variables we can use to
use our strengths and be happier what
accounts for the other sixty percent
it's about equal thirty percent set rage
thirty percent circumstances so the
actual biggest piece of the pie is
what's under your own control if you
look at each separately good question
thank you yes of course worked at a
large company that was also trying to
push this same kind of things back they
have Marcus but IM talk at cetera but it
didn't seem to get beyond the HR people
really haha and as an engineer I was at
the feeling that when I'm judged I hope
you'll do all the things that the
management was able to put also all the
technical things whereas they only have
to be able to the material things but
it's okay if they're not technical you
know and you know it's nice to talk
about how I mean I'm thinking of Google
here
more general other places places but
it's nice to talk about working to your
strengths but the reality is it's not
just the attitude of people you know
saying oh you've got improve your things
that's the way the other people get
themselves ahead so the question is
going to get by enforcing that view on
things yes so the question or challenge
I think I'm hearing is so what do you do
if the overall environment is still
pointing to weakness and offering
competitive challenges that require you
to do everything as best as possible I
think that's daunting and I don't
undervalue the challenge that that is
it's why I think this sort of thing
works best when it's a comprehensive
kind of approach and part of what I
think we're trying to do here at Google
is work from the engineering
organization to disseminate these ideas
through coaching through all the levels
and try and have this be something that
is more embraced widely I understand
what you're saying I've seen it I also
think that it doesn't always have to
play out that way and I would encourage
you to get curious about where your
point of power is as an individual in
the situation and play around with that
one thank you other questions or
comments well then I'm just going to say
