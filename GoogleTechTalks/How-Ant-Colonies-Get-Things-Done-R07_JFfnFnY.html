I'm interested in how complex systems
work so at always live in colonies and
colonies always consist of one or more
reproductive females who just lay the
eggs and then the ants all the ants that
you see walking around are sterile
female workers and the queen doesn't
tell anybody what to do doesn't give any
orders nobody directs the behavior of
other ants and so the question that
fascinates me is then how is it possible
for an ant colony to accomplish
everything that it does and how is it
possible that ants are such a successful
group there are 12,000 species there are
ants everywhere on earth clearly they're
doing something right so I want to tell
you today about work that I do in the
desert in southeastern Arizona very near
to the Mexican border near the New
Mexico State Line this is my study site
and that's a rabbit not an ant and I've
been working there now following the
same population of colonies since 1985
and the ants that I study there are
called red harvester ants the species
name is Pocono mirmix Barbados and this
is a nest of a mature colony so you see
in the middle the nest entrance and
these ants are called harvester ants
because they forage for seeds on a trail
that they sometimes clear sometimes not
through the vegetation that might go
about 20 meters away from the nest and
they bring the seeds back and store them
inside the nest this mound is about a
meter wide and a mature colony so every
year since 1985 I have mapped all the
colonies on the site this is a map from
this happens to be 93 so the site is not
that big it's about 250 meters by about
400 meters there's a road the boundaries
are arbitrary and every one of these
little filled squares is an ant colony
every colony has its name which is a
number and every year I go back and find
all the colonies that were
or the year before figure out which ones
died and put the new ones on the map and
by doing that I've been able to track
colonies through their life cycles as
the colony gets older and larger and
because that development of an ant
colony is important for the story I want
to tell you I want to now start and take
you through the life cycle of an ant
colony so ants don't make more ants an
ant colony is not a population it's
actually a collection of sisters but
colonies make more colonies and the way
they do that in this species as in many
ant species is it is in an annual mating
flight where all of the colonies in a
population of colonies send out their
winged 'add reproductives this is a male
with wings this is a female virgin
female with wings and in these ants as
in most ants you can tell the difference
between males and females because the
male the males have tiny heads and the
females have much smaller much larger
heads and that's because the male's live
only for a couple of weeks they don't
live long enough to eat and so they
don't have much jaw musculature so they
don't need a head for what they do which
is just to mate so there's a male on his
way to the mating flight and there is a
queen still has her wings and she's
mating that's her abdomen and she's
mating with this male that's his abdomen
his thorax his head and there's another
male on top waiting his turn and we've
recently understood that because of the
strange genetic system in this
particular species a queen has to mate
at least twice and they often make many
times so after they mate the male's all
die and they're mostly dead by the next
morning the kind of clustered underneath
the bush is trying to get out of the Sun
and the Queen's the newly made eight
Queens
fly off apparently at random drop their
wings dig a hole go into that hole and
start laying eggs and in this species
the Queen will lay eggs using sperm from
that original mating for 20 or 25 years
and she'll never come out
so here's a picture from my book ants at
work showing the Queen digging her hole
on that first day after she made it and
here's a real hole they go down about 18
inches the first day they get down there
lay the first batch of eggs takes about
six weeks for them to develop and once
they develop the workers do everything
for the Queen she feeds that first batch
of larvae by regurgitating from her fat
reserves and then she never goes out
again so here's what a one-year-old nest
looks like this hole here is the nest
entrance and there's a pencil for scale
and here's the rock that names this
colony so these workers these ants
walking around our ants that are
produced by the queen who mated the
previous summer it's a one-year-old
colony and here is a three year old
colony so here's the nest entrance there
there's the hole for the nest entrance
there's a pencil for scale even by the
time the colony is 3 years old they've
started to cover the nest mound with
little bits of rock and here is a five
year old colony and there is the nest
entrance and here's a pencil for scale
it gets to be about a meter across and
that's about as big as they get by the
time the colony is five years old so
this is what colony size in thousands of
workers looks like as a function of
colony age in years so it begins with
zero ants just the founding Queen and
she goes on laying eggs year after year
growing very quickly through years three
and four until about year five when the
colony gets to a stable size of ten to
twelve thousand ants and it stays at
that size for the rest of the colony's
life eventually when the Queen dies
there's nobody to produce more ants and
although the ants live for maybe another
year once the Queen has died eventually
the colony will die and it's at this
point where the colony reaches its
stable mature size that it first begins
to reproduce that is to send out winged
adds to the populations annual mating
flight so I know how colony size changes
is a function of colony age by digging
up colonies of known age and counting
all the ants and it's hard to dig a hole
in the desert so we get a backhoe to dig
a trench next to the nest here is a nest
and there I am standing in the trench
I'm wearing gloves because these ants
have a really powerful sting that Stefan
Kober who's at the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Harvard and has a wonderful
x-ray sense for finding the Queen which
is really important because unless you
find the Queen you don't know that
you've found all the ants that was a
more recent version we dug up a colony
that had just moved so here's what it
looks like underneath this is the ground
here's a trowel for scale and we find a
whole mass of chambers surrounding the
nest entrance and that goes down it's
kind of cone-shaped and it goes down
about as deep as the mound is wide and
then there's another tunnel which might
go down another meter or so which leads
to a small chamber and that's where we
find the Queen and all the blued have
gone to escape the backhoe and us so
this is a the flag shows this is a nest
that we kind of slice down the middle
and the flag shows where the nest
entrance was and you can see that most
of the chambers are around the nest
entrance and inside the nest we find the
seeds that the ants store they prefer
grass seeds here's another picture of a
tidier chamber and often we find the
seeds are piled up very methodically
here are the small ones underneath and
then these larger ones here's an ant for
scale and also inside we find the brood
so ants like all insects begin as eggs
and then they turn into larvae look like
maybe little caterpillars and it's the
larvae who do most of the eating so most
of the food that in a colony takes in is
actually consumed by the larvae and
after the answer larvae they become
pupae which corresponds to the cocoon of
a butterfly and one that when the pupa
is mature then workers come along and
slice it open and the ant comes out as
an adult those are the ants that we see
walking around and once the ant emerges
as an adult it doesn't grow anymore so
the process that I think about is what I
call task allocation and that's the
question of how without any central
control any management any direction how
the colony gets the right numbers of
ants to perform each task as conditions
are changing so things happen to an ant
colony this is what the site looks like
after the summer rains and I think this
is probably the function of the escape
tunnel not really to get away from me
and my backhoe but instead to have a
place to go when the ground floods and
after the ground floods there's a lot of
damage to the nest so the colony has to
put extra effort into fixing the nest
and to nest repair and this is true for
all the different activities that a
colony performs that it has to adjust
the numbers performing them and I divide
the activities that I see outside the
nest into these four categories foraging
collecting collecting food patrolling
that's supposed to be a magnifying glass
because the patrollers search early in
the morning nest maintenance taking
building and taking care of the chambers
inside the nest and midden work dealing
with the refuse pile or midden and the
first thing you need to know about these
different tasks is that the ants
performing these different tasks are all
the same size so you may have seen some
species of ants actually the minority of
ant species in which the ants the
workers come in different sizes but in
this species as in most ants the workers
are all the same size so you can't tell
what an ant is doing by just looking at
it so I want to show you this film that
illustrates these four different tasks
and starting with the foragers so the
foragers leave the nest and they go out
in streams which we call trails although
they're not very distinct trails and
I'll show you some pictures soon they're
more like sometimes they
look more like big blobs they go out and
they get to a certain point they search
around and then they come back carrying
whatever they found as soon as they find
a seed or if they're really lucky a
termite they bring it directly back to
the nest so what you'll see here is an
ant some ants carrying seeds going
directly back and the film is streaming
really fast I don't know quite why but
you might catch a glimpse of an ant
carrying a seed well the film is is a
moving faster than it is in real time
but the film is moving fast for some
reason ok the next activity is one that
I'll tell you a lot more about the one I
call patrolling so the patrollers go out
early in the morning and they walk
around not that fast and they touch the
ground with their antennae so ants smell
with their antennae these ants like most
ants don't see so their universe is
mostly olfactory it's mostly about smell
and they sometimes stop and touch
antennae with other patrollers that they
meet and they walk in this
characteristic zigzag trajectory and
then after a while they just go back
into the nest they don't collect
anything they don't do anything else
they go out they smell around they go
back in and the foragers will not go out
until the patrollers come back the next
activity is nest maintenance so the nest
maintenance workers work mostly inside
the nest and they line the walls of the
chambers with moist soil and it dries to
a beautiful Adobe finish so that the the
ceiling and the floor of the chamber is
lined with Adobe and then they bring out
like these ants they bring out the dry
soil and put it down they also bring out
the garbage and put it down on the
midden or refuse pile so you see nest
maintenance workers outside the nest
only occasionally coming out carrying
something in their mandibles putting it
down a few inches outside the nest
entrance and going back in so they're
all mixed up in the stream of other ants
and all they do is carry stuff out then
they go back in
then the midden workers work on the
refuse pile which contains the husks of
the Seas that ants eat and also these
little pebbles that they collect and
what you see a midden worker doing is
like this one just picking up some
little piece of garbage and turning it
over and over in its mandibles and we've
recently understood that the ants are
putting in a colony specific odor into
this stuff they collect especially
porous stones because it's a good
receptacle for their chemicals and they
move it back and forth across the mound
they pile it one day here another day
there then they move it back so these
ants the foragers the patrollers the
nest maintenance workers in the midden
workers are only the 25% of the colony
that works outside the nest and once an
ant starts working outside the nest it
comes in and out and into these chambers
just inside the nest entrance but it
never goes back down deeper so ants
start out we think that probably the
youngest ants work inside the nest
within brood care feeding the larvae and
taking care of the larvae then there are
when ants that are working outside bring
food in and put it down
then they just put it down just inside
the nest entrance and other ants come up
from underneath collect the food and
carry it back down again and then they
store and process the seeds then the
nest maintenance workers are working to
line the walls of the chambers and to
carry the the dry soil back out and then
the Queen does nothing really but lay
eggs so even if she had the intelligence
to somehow direct the behavior of the
ants outside the nest keeping in mind
that the ants don't see there is no way
that the chemical information could get
through this whole mass of chambers to
the ants outside the nest in time to
tell them what to do then there's this
escape tunnel but we don't think that
the Queen spends much time there except
when somebody's digging up the nest then
one of the really surprising things
about this is that there seems to be a
large group of ants who are basically
doing nothing
who you could think of as reserves in
the sense that if something important
would happen they would go back out and
help but in my now almost 25 years of
watching these ants I've never seen
anything that brings out most of the
ants so whatever it is if they're
reserves
I've just never seen it happen or maybe
they really are asked that just do
nothing and one of the interesting
questions about the network of
interactions that I'm going to be
telling you about is whether this group
of basically inert ants has some
function that helps regulate the whole
network did you have a question yes I'll
show you some pictures the question is
how do I know which ant is doing what
and I'll show you that in a minute
so when I started out working on this
question of task allocation the question
I started out with was are these
different activities interdependent does
it matter to one group of ants what
another group is doing and so I did a
series of experiments in which I change
the numbers performing one task and look
to see how that would affect the numbers
performing another task so for example
we put out piles of toothpicks right
near the nest entrance early in the
morning when the nest maintenance
workers were active and the nest
maintenance workers carry the toothpicks
away and it took extra next nest
maintenance workers to do that and I
wanted to see if extra nest maintenance
work would have an effect on the other
tasks and then we repeated these
experiments using marked ants
we used to mark them with model airplane
paint it has to be hot fuel proof model
airplane paint with these ants and you
could mark them according to task and
now we use a little bit more high-tech
Japanese marker but same idea and we did
this with ants that were marked
according to tasks so these are all blue
nest maintenance workers and here's a
yellow patroller and somewhere in here
there's a green forager which maybe you
can see I can't see right now so the
results of these experiments were that
yes the numbers performing one task do
affect the numbers performing another
task so the different groups are not
working autonomously for example if I
make a mess that the nest maintenance
workers have to clean up the foragers
stay inside the nest they become less
likely to forage and that was true for
all the pairwise combinations of
activities and the next result was that
ants actually switched tasks so for
example if I put out extra food then the
patrollers will stop patrolling and go
to collect the food the nest maintenance
workers will stop doing nest maintenance
work and they'll go to collect the food
the midden workers will stop doing
midden work and they'll go to collect
the food but not all transitions are
possible and this is how it works that
when more ants are needed to forage like
I just showed you the patrollers will
switch to forage the middle the
patrollers will switch to forage the
midden workers will switch to forage the
nest maintenance workers will switch to
forage and when more patrollers are
needed and I created a need for more
patrollers by creating disturbances that
recruited out more patrollers if more
patrollers are needed then the nest
maintenance workers will switch to
Patrol but if more nest maintenance
workers are needed so for example I make
a mess that requires more nest
maintenance workers to clean up nobody
will switch back to do nest maintenance
and they have to get more nest
maintenance workers from the younger
ants inside the nest so foraging is a
kind of a sink and all the other
activities flow into foraging and once a
now becomes a forager it never goes back
and once I understood that that meant
that each ant must be making moment to
moment decisions not only about which
task group it belongs to not just a Maya
forage or a Maya nest maintenance worker
but whether to be active right now that
is if I'm given that I'm a forager
should I go out and forage right now
when I first saw the results I had
thought it was possible that the reason
that when I recruited extra nest
maintenance workers
I got fewer foragers is that the nest
maintenance work that the extra nest
maintenance workers were foragers that
had switched over but once I understood
that once an ant becomes a forager it
never goes back to nest maintenance that
rely that made me realize that what must
be happening is that when extra ants are
doing nest maintenance that affects the
decisions of foragers whether to be
active so it's not the same man
switching
over butthey chances making moment to
moment decisions about what to do and
the most puzzling result of these
experiments was the task allocation
seems to be related to colony age so
it's related in this way that older
colonies are more consistent and more
homeostatic in their response to
perturbations while younger colonies are
more variable whereby more consistent I
mean that if you take a group of older
colonies and you perturb them or create
a need for more work in some particular
task group do the same experiment over
and over you get the same result from
different groups of older colonies
whereas with younger colonies a group of
younger colonies will all respond one
way this week and another way next week
that is the variance within colonies
among colonies in a given week is not
any different from older colonies and
younger colonies but as a group all the
younger colonies will do one thing this
week and they'll all do something else
next week which suggests that the
younger colonies the smaller ones are
much more sensitive to whatever is
different between this week and next
week and the other difference is that
the older colonies are more homeostatic
so as I ramped up the magnitude of the
perturbations the worse it gets
the more an older colony will just leave
everything else aside and concentrate on
foraging so that the greater the
magnitude of the perturbation the more
an older colony resembles an undisturbed
colony whereas in a younger colony the
greater the magnitude of the
perturbation the greater the magnitude
of the response and what's surprising
about this is that an ant there's only a
year I've lost my pointer so you see the
lifespan of an ant is only a year so
that means that the response of the
older colonies while it's clearly
different is not the response of wiser
more experienced ants because the ants
in the older colony are not any older
than the ants in the younger colony so
something else about the organization is
changing yes
do they go back to the baseline number
of foragers a number of other goals I
give you ants take on the role over the
Dalian well the flow is from the ants in
so the question is do new ants take on
the role of the dying foragers no
there's a sequence and the new ants
start at the beginning inside the nest
and are recruited up into the pool of
ants working outside gradually so a new
ant is in a different position in that
stream than the dying forager yes so the
question is over over time if new answer
recruited into foraging will the numbers
go back down and the answer is yes they
will yes can you manipulate the speed at
which they move through the sequence yes
if you create a need for more ants doing
one task you pull them out of the
previous step into the next step so well
to go back here so clearly something
about the organization is changing as
the colony gets older and larger and
since it's not the experience of
individual ants an obvious place to look
is in the size of the system because the
obvious thing that's changing is that
the older colony is larger than the
younger colony and so that's what got me
started thinking about what kind of ant
decision rules could explain these
outcomes and we know that the ants
decisions must be based in part on just
what they encounter in their environment
is there walking around otherwise there
would be no ants of picnics if they
couldn't notice the picnic but it must
also be based on their interactions with
each other or it wouldn't make any
difference to the foragers what the nest
maintenance workers are doing and so on
so I'm looking for decision rules that
are in part based on interaction and I
started to explore the idea that ants
use simply the rate at which they
interact to decide what to do so the
idea is okay
I'm a forager I expect to meet a forager
every so often and if I do my
probability of going out to forage stays
the same but if the rate at which I meet
other foragers goes down I become less
likely to forage and that in that way
each ant doesn't need to understand
what's happening nobody needs to make
any global assessments each ant just
uses its own experience of its
interactions with others to decide what
to do but in the aggregate you would see
the task allocation that we see and you
might expect such a system to operate
very differently when the colony is
large from when the colony is small
because if the ants have the same
algorithm the same thresholds in a small
colony and a large colony their
experience the rate at which they meet
others would change because in a large
colony there's more other ants to meet
so if ants are going to use the rate at
which they interact to decide what to do
they have to know who they're meeting so
you might wonder well how does an ant
know the difference between meeting a
forager nest maintenance worker this is
work I did with Diane Wagner who was a
postdoc in my lab and we found that ants
within a colony differ in smell so it's
well known in social insects that all
social insects like many other insects
are covered basically with a layer of
grease
these are long-chain fatty acids or
hydrocarbons and that's how an ant or a
bee or a wasp knows if another one is it
is an estimate because they have a
colony specific odor and what we found
is that they also within a colony differ
in odor according to tasks and in
particular the ants that spend more time
outside the foragers shown with the
white bars and the the hatched bars the
forgers and the patrollers have more n
alkanes in their particular hydrocarbons
whereas the ants that our inside smell
different and then we did an experiment
in which we took ants nest maintenance
workers that had mostly been inside the
nest and we expose them to the same
conditions that foragers and patrollers
experienced outside the nest namely high
temperatures and low humidity and we got
those increases in NL canes so it's what
they do that makes them smell different
in the same way that a carpenter might
get a callus on our hands an ant as
she's walking around outside comes to
smell different so the smell doesn't
make them do something different it's
because they're doing something
different that they have a different
hydrocarbon profile so I want to tell
you about how the system works in
particular with respect to foraging so
here's a picnic as everybody knows where
there's ants there will be a picnic with
its sorry whether it's a picnic there
will be ants it doesn't work the other
way as far as we know so that's a great
example of the regulation of foraging
activity that is how is it that the
colony decides first of all whether to
forage at all second where to go like
where to go where the picnic is and
finally how many foragers descend there
so I want to talk to you now about the
details of the regulation of foraging in
harvester ants and to do that I want to
tell you about the particular challenge
for harvester ants in the network that
that controls foraging so first of all
harvester ants compete with their
neighbors of the same species and it
works like this this is a picture of the
foraging trails of one colony so here's
the nest entrance this is about ten
meters across here and you can see that
sometimes they go out in a kind of a
line that looks like a trail sometimes
they go out in a line that it turns into
a big blob sometimes they just spread
out and from day to day a colony will go
in different directions and sometimes
the trails of neighboring colonies meet
so now this is the entrance of one
colony this is its neighbor and
sometimes they happen to overlap and so
when they overlap either one colonies
foragers gets the seeds or the other
colonies foragers gets the seeds and
sometimes they fight so here's a picture
from my book of an ant of one colony
grabs the petiole that's the segment
between the thorax and the abdomen with
its mandibles and they kind of tumble
around for a while and sometimes they
just won't give
and so the aunt that has grabbed on
eventually dies from desiccation because
these ants can't be outside in the heat
in the desert very long and the muscles
of the jaws are so strong that they
remain clenched even after the ant dies
the rest of the ant breaks off and the
ant that was attacked walks around for
the rest of its life with the head of
another ant clamped on so the cost in
overlap is mainly in competition for
food but also in the cost of fighting
and overtime just as trees in a forest
compete for light and it's hard for a
young small tree to get started near a
large old one so in this population by
looking at the census data over time we
can see that new colonies are unlikely
to survive near old large one so the
main premise of their foraging
regulation of foraging has to do with
competition for neighbors with neighbors
so the next thing is that these ants
have to spend water to get water that is
they store seeds and the foraging going
out in the hot Sun costs water because
the ant dries out while its foraging and
they get their water from metabolizing
the fats out of seeds so they're
foraging system seems to be based on the
premise that it's not worth foraging
it's not worth going out to look when
the search time is long when there's not
food isn't available and you have to
spend a lot of time outside looking for
food so it's not worth it to use up a
lot of water to get in water and the way
that the food is distributed is patchy
and also ephemeral the distribution
changes all the time so they forage for
seeds and they collect seeds that are
mostly distributed by wind and by
flooding not by not from nearby
vegetation so it's not the case that
certain places out there are good
reliable sources of seeds in other
places aren't anywhere is just as good
as anywhere else basically there might
be local patches but they're
unpredictable and so anytime
fine that one colony searches an area it
has pretty much as good a chance of
getting seeds as its neighbor and the
final thing is that search time is a
good measure of availability of food and
that's because of the way that a
foraging trip is set up so an ant leaves
the nest a forager leaves the nest it
goes out for a while on the trail and
then it leaves the trail and spends a
lot of time searching around and
eventually as soon as it finds something
it picks it up and goes right back to
the nest so it goes maybe 20 meters from
the nest with an average time of about
20 meters and Valera Beverly who was an
undergraduate who did great work with me
but instead of going to grad school he
came to work at Google he did a
wonderful honours thesis in which he
showed that trip duration is clearly
correlated with search time how long the
ants spends outside is correlated very
highly with how long it has to spend
searching and it's not very it's not
correlated at all with how long it's
spent traveling so they walk so fast to
the place that they then leave to search
from that the time they have to spend
searching is a really good measure of
how long they're going to spend outside
so the idea is that the more food there
is out there the more available food is
today the less you have to search and
the quicker you come back and it seems
as though that's pretty much the same
everywhere on a given day because what
determines food availability is more
whether it's rained recently and washed
up the dirt off the seeds than anything
special about a particular patch so
here's how they regulate foraging given
those constraints the patrollers come
out first this is the hardest part for
undergrads about working with me in the
desert is that if you want to deal with
the patrollers you have to get up at
4:30 in the morning because they come
out right at as the Sun comes up and
they're the gatekeepers they tell the
foragers whether to go and which way to
go
so the foragers don't go out as I said
until the patrollers come back so it's
the return of the patrollers that
signals the foragers that it's okay to
go out and I want to tell you about a
field experiment that we did that showed
how this works taking advantage of this
fact we knew that the foragers would not
go out if the patrollers don't return so
we could collect up the patrollers as
they're coming back put them in a little
box and know that the foragers would not
go out so here's a picture of a couple
of students collecting up the patrollers
as they come back and this is work I did
with Mike Greene who's at the University
of Colorado at Denver and we didn't a
field experiment that in which we
removed the patrollers so we put the
patrollers in a box so they wouldn't go
back and then we dropped into the nest
little glass beads that were coated with
the extract of the cooler hydrocarbons
of the patrollers so little glass beads
that smelled like patrollers and here's
a picture of the glass beads and that
was enough to bring the foragers out so
this shows the number of foragers in
response to live patrollers that's the
control and then two different extracts
of patroller hydrocarbons the full lipid
extract and then the hydrocarbons which
are part of the lipid extract and you
can see that little glass beads that
smell like patrollers coming in to the
nest
we're enough to bring them out foraging
whereas little glass beads that just had
the solvent pentane as a control or
glass beads that smelled like another
kind of ant the nest maintenance workers
didn't bring out the foragers so this is
how we know that ants are using just the
just interactions with each other and in
particular the smell of the other ants
to decide whether to go out or not and
it turns out that the onset of foraging
depends not just on having patrollers
come back but having patrollers come
back at the right rate so we try
dropping in the Gospels at different
intervals one bead every 180 seconds
every 45 seconds
and it's only when they come back at a
rate of one bead per ten seconds that
the foragers will go out so this shows
the foraging response there's also a
foraging response if the beads are
dropped in pretty quickly but if they're
dropped in too quickly
it's not as good as dropping in at the
right weight rate and of course we got
the ten seconds by measuring the rate at
which patrollers are usually going back
at the time that they come out to forage
so it means that the foragers inside the
nest are using the rate at which they
encounter something that smells like a
patroller not anything the patroller
does not anything the patroller tells
them simply the rate at which patrollers
come back to decide to go out so it
seems that for the foragers the fact
that the patrollers can go out and come
back is enough to guarantee that it's
safe to go out and try to forage
so actually we were able to make the
foragers come out sooner by putting in
the patroller beads sooner at the right
rate so it suggests that what's
happening to the ant is simply something
like this some kind of threshold where
the ant what it experienced is an
encounter with a certain kind of ant it
has a response that has a decay and if
it gets enough encounters often enough
its response is pushed over some
threshold and it's probability say of
going out to forage increases enough
that they're likely to go out to forage
but if the encounter happens much much
later than by that time since this decay
seems to be on the order of about 10
seconds the ant has forgotten that
anything ever happened to it and the
process has to start over to make it go
out so we don't know that that's how it
works but this is how we think it it
works the patrollers are also telling
the foragers which way to go and we
figured this out in some experiments in
which we blocked off different trails so
this is a nest with here's the nest
entrance and therefore foraging trails
and the entrance to the the opening in
the grass to the foraging trails which
extend out for another 20 meters or so
is marked with a pair of white flags so
goes to here through here
and so on and we took this foraging
trail and we blocked off the entrance so
that the patrollers couldn't get on
there and if we kept the patrollers from
going on that little segment of the
trail which is maybe 20 or 30
centimeters just on the nest mound then
the foragers didn't go there the
foragers didn't choose that trail that
day and so then we kept the patrollers
from the mound and we put down extract
of different glands inside the ant the
Dufour is going on the poison gland and
the solvent and the DeForest gland was
enough to get them out there so we found
that the ants are telling the other
telling the foragers which way to go but
they're only directing them which
towards a certain compass direction but
they're not directing them towards any
particular food source so the patrollers
are saying okay
it's safe to go out because we came back
and it's okay to go this way and it
seems as though the decision of the
patrollers isn't based really on
anything to do with food quality but
only that if the foragers the patrollers
go out in the direction that the
foragers went the day before and if they
meet the patrollers from the neighbor
then they don't choose that direction so
the patrollers are likely to avoid the
directions in which they met the
patrollers of the neighbor and they're
also so if you can go out you can come
back fast enough and you don't meet
anybody from the neighbor then that
direction is okay and that's the
direction that the foragers take so yes
by putting down this chemical on the
mound so they don't come back if they
meet the the patrollers of the neighbor
they we think this is what happens if
they meet the the patrollers of the
neighbor they're less likely to take
that way back what we know is that if
they the more patrollers come back in a
certain direction the more likely the
foragers are to use it and that's
because the patrollers whenever they
come back they just put down some
chemical so if there's any process that
makes the patrollers less likely to come
back in a certain direction it'll make
the foragers less likely to use that
direction but they're not really giving
the foragers any information about
what's good or bad about that direction
so they're only saying okay we went out
this is the way we came back it's okay
to go out so they tell the foragers
whether to go at all and which way to go
now what determines how many foragers go
so it turns out that this is a second
process that depends on the rate at
which they interact and here it's not
interactions between the patrollers and
the foragers it's interaction between
the foragers that have just come back
from a trip and other foragers that are
coming in with food and the way we
figured this out was to take away
foragers returning first foragers
returning with food and then foragers
unsuccessful foragers and if you take
away foragers that are coming back with
nothing it has no effect but if you take
away foragers coming back with food it
slows down the rate at which more
foragers go out so the foragers go out
on the first trip because of the
patrollers they come back and then the
probability that they go out again
simply depends on the rate at which more
foragers come back oops so this makes
sense from the perspective of the colony
because the rate at which foragers
return is a measure of the availability
of food so the more food there is out
there the more quickly the foragers are
going to come back because they won't
have to search so long so for a forager
inside the nest
the rate at which foragers are coming
back is a measure of whether it's a good
day to forage so they don't have to know
anything about that rate they only have
to respond to successful foragers coming
back and we found that they respond
really surprisingly quickly so here is
the cumulative forager outflow in one
colony on a particular day and this is
the same thing per 10 seconds so these
are the same data and at this interval
we started to collect for two minutes
the ants returning with food and you can
see that within just a couple of minutes
the rate at which the foragers go out
again starts to slow down so they
respond within minutes to a very small
change in the rate at which foragers are
going in they're really surprisingly
sensitive to fluctuations in the weight
at which foragers are coming back so
returning foragers remove for three
minutes immediately led to a change a
decrease in the rate of forager return
so this was surprising to me because
after all what they're collecting is
seeds the seeds are not going to go
anywhere in two minutes so these are not
like the opportunistic ants that you see
in your kitchen around here like the
second that you drop a crumb on the
kitchen counter the answer there
these ants are foraging for resources
that just stay on the ground until
somebody finds them and so it's really
surprising to me that they have such a
fine-tuned system that responds so
quickly to changes in the rate of
forager return and I think that it may
simply be a function of the decay rate
in their memory that is if foragers can
only remember something for about ten
seconds then they can only respond to
something that happened very recently so
that this very quick adjustment a
forager return rate is actually a
byproduct of the of the memory the
decaying in memory so the fact though
that it is so fine-tuned means that they
can actually adjust forager outflow very
well to food availability that is when
it takes a long time for ants to find
food
then that decreases the rate of which
ants go out and they can adjust quite
carefully to forage to food availability
now what determines where the foragers
go remember that the patrollers are just
directing the mountain a certain
direction
another thing that so a forager comes
out of the nest and takes one of the
trails that the colony is using that day
and then goes off somewhere to search
for seeds and the other thing that Blair
Beverly found out is that each forager
is returning over and over to the same
location on successive trips so the
forager leaves the nest and goes out
somewhere and what he did was to mark
ants individually so we had a
three-color system you know a different
color on head thorax and abdomen
actually six color system but three
places to mark and so he could follow
individual ants and found that the
destinations the different destinations
on different trips for the same ant was
within about half a meter so the ant
then for the perspective of the forager
the ant goes out first thing in the
morning when the patrollers come back at
a certain rate it goes out it finds a
certain place and then it goes back to
the nest once it's found something and
then it waits to go out until it
encounters ants returning at a certain
rate then it goes out again it goes back
to the same place over and over
throughout the day and what this means
is that from the perspective of the
colony the return of foragers from one
direction is stimulating more foragers
in another that is there might be at
number one who's going back and forth to
here all day and at number two is going
back and forth to there all day but the
return of this ant from foraging here is
going to stimulate an ant to go out over
there and so the system only works in a
situation like this one where the food
is distributed pretty heterogeneous Lee
but unpredictably around the environment
and a good day to forage in one
direction is pretty much a good day to
forage in another so it's a very finely
tuned recruitment system that doesn't
recruit them to any place in particular
but simply adjusts the outflow of
foragers for the whole colony according
to the success of any
particular forager anywhere so it's the
regulation of foraging by interaction
rate but it's not by recruitment to any
specific location so unlike some species
of ants that are probably more familiar
to us that make pheromone trails to
particular locations here they have an
elaborate recruitment system in which
there is no information about any
particular location so I want to end by
just outlining the big questions that
this this raises for for me as a
biologist what is the question about
stochasticity then the questions which
are the big questions for any biologist
about development and evolution the
question about stochasticity is when you
consider so this is the average response
of 40 colonies to removals for two
minutes and you can see that overall
there is this variability in the rate of
foraging and then after removals it
declines but look at the error bars and
think about how for an ant it can't be
that the rate at which ants are coming
in is very it's it's extremely variable
for the ants that is using this rate the
input that it's getting is extremely
variable and then ants are ants you know
no ant is make any complicated
calculations they can't do a lot of very
precise averaging or anything and so and
their response is not fully
deterministic so if you watch any ant
you will quickly learn that no ad ever
does exactly the right thing every time
so what's really interesting to me is
that with such stochastic input and such
imprecise response on the part of the
ants that the system manages to work so
well the developmental question in
biology is the question of how this
whole process changes is the colony gets
older and larger and that developmental
question is really a scaling question
how is it the network size affects
function what's the relationship between
the size of the colony and these
dynamics and the evolutionary
question is the one that arises when you
realize the colony is actually very in
foraging behavior some of them are much
more sensitive to changes in the rate at
which foragers come in than others and
so one of the things that we're doing
now is using genetics to identify which
colonies have more offspring to ask
whether natural selection is acting on
task allocation and whether the colonies
that are better forgers actually
collecting more food having more
offspring colonies assuming that the
variation among colonies is due to
differences among colonies in the
particular algorithm that an ant is
using that is an app that says okay I
need to meet 10 foragers coming in per
minute before I'm ready to go out to
forage in that colony they're going to
do a lot less foraging than in another
colony where their threshold is lower
and they say I only need 2 ants to come
in per minute before I'm ready to go out
so the differences among colonies in
these thresholds would lead to overall
differences that we see consistently
year after year and how much of colony
forages and that that might have
implications for their reproductive
success and that would be how natural
selection was shaping task allocation so
I want to end by trying to make a
connection with what all this has to do
with Google by showing an email I got
from somebody yesterday who was visiting
my lab from Taiwan and he writes that I
visited Google with my friends twice
when I lived at Palo Alto this
interesting company have some particular
ways to work their boss asked managers
of every department not to limit
engineers how to solve problems and what
have to do just give them a direction or
a plan and your engineers will make a
temporary group and decide the ways to
do the process maybe longer but opposing
li may be more efficient than the way
that managers decide if they can each
group seems to have no link between each
other but the whole company works pretty
well so I don't know if that's really
true but he goes on to say in praise of
Google that it worked something like the
ant colony he observed in my lab and
it's like this the situation is like the
colony of harvester ants I observed in
the small room he means the lab where I
keep my ass I found the dead bodies and
trash are gathered at some nook far away
from the nest
some evil individuals were
them out and throw away when they just
walk for a short distance but some
individuals will pick up the trash when
they suddenly meet it and bring it more
far away some trash are brought back and
forth between the new between two nooks
basically the ants walk around carrying
pieces of crud they put it down they
carry it back and forth
it seems inefficient because the repeat
steps and the longer process from nest
to the trash nook however when I saw the
nest totally it also seems to work well
each ants just know something they have
to do but not an accurate process I
think that maybe all the net tasks in a
nest are finished in this way and it
makes the task more flexible not a
straight line so I don't know if you
guys walk around kind of carrying bits
of garbage back and forth and I don't
know if Google really works like this
but it's clear that there are lots of
interesting processes in nature that do
work something like this and I'd be
really interested to talk with people
about analogies between the ways that
ants do things and maybe not so much how
you do your work but how you perform the
tasks that you're working on so thanks
very much yes yeah probably one reason
is they're getting small ants to be
bigger but everything else take the same
do you think they would keep this model
on with their differences I think that
this model so the question is if ants
were big enough to have bigger brains
would they keep this model or what
they'd do it differently well I don't
know but I think that what's amazing
about ants is that they have evolved
ways of doing things really well that
don't require a big brain so I think if
you have a big brain you think about
what you're doing very differently I
mean the key to the way that ants work
is that no ant is thinking about what
it's doing no ant needs to understand
what it's doing or why and so what we
see in the operation of an ant colony is
is the ways to develop a system in which
each component doesn't have
any global information yes question is
if the ants are blind so they don't need
the light and it's hard work to forage
during the day why don't they forage at
night well other ants are foraging at
night they got their first I don't know
yes do I think it's ok to study ants by
destroying their homes and painting them
with toxic chemicals well I don't like
destroying their homes so I don't do it
very much is it ok I don't know but the
toxic chemicals don't bother them very
much because they do fine with the with
the paint so the ants that are working
outside only have six weeks or so to
live anyway and as far as we can tell
having painted thousands of ants we've
never caused an ant to die sooner by
being painted he sir the question is
whether painted Queens will get thrown
out well I've never actually painted a
queen the Queen's that I have say in the
lab are so precious that I wouldn't let
anybody near them with anything but the
reason they're getting thrown out is
because they smell differently and so
with all the ants that we paint we have
to let them dry out and then the ants
groom each other and they put the
hydrocarbons back over the paint and so
then they smell ok and then they don't
get thrown out yes
okay
yes how they return they don't come out
great
so the question is why when we added
beads at one-second intervals why how
does that fit in with a threshold model
and that's a great question and it
doesn't make sense in terms of the
threshold model so the only situation in
nature where the ants would all come
back that fast is if something really
bad happens so you could imagine some
extra rule on top of the threshold model
that says if they all come back too fast
this is a dangerous situation
but that's really me just kind of
invoking an extra thing to explain the
result that as you say doesn't really
make sense in terms of that decay model
so I don't know short answer yes
the question is how do the patrollers
communicate that it's dangerous outside
well that's the thing they don't
communicate anything but the rate at
which they come back communicate
something if they all got eaten or so
one of their predators the main predator
is a horn lizard if the patrollers all
got eaten or if it was such a windy day
as happens that they all got blown away
then they wouldn't come back so the rate
at which they come back is the
information they don't bring any other
information besides that yeah the
question is what do they do if they
sense a danger but I don't think that
they I don't think that they're out
there to sense danger it's the fact of
their going out and coming back that
reflects this current situation but they
don't go out and say wow it looks like
you know pretty good day but I'm a
little worried about that lizardy thing
over there they don't do that so so it's
only the rate at which they come back
which which gives the information yes
and to go and
the question is how do they find their
way back it's the same question for the
patrollers and the foragers we don't
know in some related species they use
the plane of polarized light from the
Sun so something about the direction of
the Sun there are some ants that can see
landmarks but they're in the minority
and these ants we don't think can see
anything so we really don't know one of
the things that we're thinking about now
is whether the ants might use the
gradient of the hydrocarbons in the
midden objects as a way to guide them
into the nest entrance from the edge of
the mound but that doesn't explain how
they get to the mound in the first place
it's clear that they partly use
interactions with others and you can see
this in any ants that you look at that
like the Argentine ants around here that
they as they pass each other they touch
antennae and if you if we mess with the
foragers so that the foragers coming
back don't have many foragers going out
they definitely take a much more winding
trajectory back and so it seems that
part of what guides them back way far
from the nest mound is the flow is the
interactions with others that they have
on the way back because as they get
closer to the nest there's more ants but
we don't know all about how they do it
yes
when they're coming back to return how
do you know it has to do an encounter
that is the concentration of the
chemical
exclaiming requiring a sort of logic
the question is how do I know the
difference between each ants experience
of encounters and the idea that that
little pile of glass beads might create
a pool of pheromone of a certain
concentration
I don't know that except that I see them
touching antennae and I don't see the
patrollers kind of clustering in a pile
but I don't I don't know that for sure I
had a film that I was going to show but
I feel like I was taking too long but
you can see the so maybe I'll put this
on while the while the questions are
going I think this will work
oh I have to approach it from the other
end I mean it may be that an ant oh come
on don't be silly it may be that an ant
somehow absorbs its its chemical
environment over a certain time but it
would also have to be quite
time-dependent or the rate wouldn't
matter right because if they mean I
guess that's another answer is that if
they were accumulating just the net
amount of thought of particular
hydrocarbon smell than the beads that we
put in every three minutes should have
had the same effect eventually as the
beads we put in one every ten seconds
and they didn't so I guess that it could
be some kind of accumulation thing but
it has to be very time dependent
I think that they're just a sink that
some ads fall into there and never get
out that those ants were once younger
ants that we're down with the brood and
then they end up in that pool and then
they don't they never do anything after
that but it's almost in the mature
colony could be almost a third of the
colony so one of the interesting
questions is whether that might be a
kind of a buffer zone so that these
dynamics that depend on the weight of
interaction it might help to have a
group of inert ants that dampen
oscillations or runaway effects in the
rate of interaction and keep the system
more stable yes
yes right well what they look like
they're doing is just beyond during
around and so maybe they feel a little
more meandering when they've met a
patroller of another colony and being a
little more meandering tends you know
all these are are stochastic trends
rather than you know strict
deterministic rules so this is film
taken from inside the nest entrance with
a fiber optics microscope and so you can
see lets investment its worker coming up
and I'm wondering what the fiber optics
microscope is but eventually you see
that they come past and the idea is that
the answer then just inside the nest
entrance here are using the rate at
which they meet ants coming back in from
outside to decide whether to go out and
then soon you'll see some ants standing
around outside and you can see that
they're very responsive to two antennae
contact where they smell the
hydrocarbons of another ant so the idea
would be that that a patroller is out
there wandering around and if nothing
happens it eventually wanders back but
if it meets a patroller of another
colony its trajectory changes a little
bit making it less likely to come back
the same way and making it less likely
to put down the chemical cue that when
enough of it accumulates will get the
foragers out there so a group of maybe
50 patrollers can set the direction for
thousands of foragers later on by some
simple rule that links that simply makes
them a little more likely to avoid a
place where they meet the patrollers of
the other colony and we see the outcome
of this in that if ants of mature
colonies meet their neighbors on a given
day they're likely to avoid it the next
so we know that they're doing it somehow
and that seems to be the way that
they're doing it
yes with other patrollers no we don't
see patrollers fight with other
patrollers and fighting is a strange
thing that happens on some days our
fighting days so there are days when
they tend to especially after a rain and
we think maybe the rain washes away
hydrocarbon colony specific signals on
the ground but there are some days after
the rains when the ants go pouring out
all over the place and the foragers of
neighboring colonies meet and fight and
there are other days when we see just as
much interaction but much less fighting
so the probability of fighting per
interaction changes very much from day
to day and it's very much through the
whole population and the only thing I
can think of is that there's some
climatic conditions or something that
affect the spread or the volatility of
some chemical that induces fighting so
some days are fighting days some days or
not and I don't know why okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
