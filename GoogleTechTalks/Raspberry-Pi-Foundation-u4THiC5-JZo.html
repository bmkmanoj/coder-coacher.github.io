here at Google I'm very excited about
the Raspberry Pi and happy to introduce
it here so thirty years ago I learned
Apple logo and we had the Apple turtle
which is a little bowl like thing when
you tell it forward ten and it moves 10
units forward and you tell it right 90
and it goes right 90 and other things
and that was an amazing experience for
me as a kid because it was a robot you
could see the motors in there and the
little servos from the serial ports and
all the fun things that got me really
excited about computers and that was
kind of what started me I'm well the
path I'm on now so I'm really excited
about the Raspberry Pi and potential
that has for education and my own kids
and other kids and getting people to
understand what is involved in the
computer you know you look at a tablet
or a phone it's pretty much literally a
black box so I'm very excited to welcome
Rob Bishop he's one of the early
engineers in the Raspberry Pi foundation
and it's going to tell us all about the
pie and the foundation hey guys
so yeah I'm Rob Bishop here over from
the UK Turing a number of computer
science departments and hack spaces
talking about the Raspberry Pi talking
to the community seeing what projects
are being made making links see what we
can do for education so as introduced I
I'm one of the earlier engineers from
Foundation and one of the very few
developers we have supporting this
project talking about the foundation we
registered charity back in the UK we're
not-for-profit organization and at the
moment we have no paid employees you
know so when you think we we can't have
half a million of these devices in the
wild and there's maybe five or six
engineers supporting this and in their
own time and that's probably why are a
bit slow on responding to some issues on
kit outbreak so what is the Raspberry Pi
for people who just turn up and there
nothing about it essentially it's it's a
credit card computer it's a UNIX box
with GPIO and an HDMI out which is 35
dots
yeah I mean that alone kind of sells it
to a lot of a hacker crowd sells it's a
lot of people in here you know that the
point is is that that cool robot thing
you've always wanted to make
but you couldn't quite justify spending
hundreds of dollars on the brain to go
and do it you know now you can go do
your UNIX development now you can make
physical computing for $35 and before
Christmas we're going to release the
model a so the model be named after the
tradition of the BBC micro which is
going to be the same board but without
the the networking chip and and
connector and that's going to be $25 so
why do we produce this how come a bunch
of Engineers are giving up their their
evenings and weekends to come and make
this thing and why am I here talking
about it today so it all started when
the founder eben Upton was working as
the director of undergraduate studies
for computer science at st. John's
College in Cambridge and while he was
there he realized that the quality of
the candidates he had applied computer
science was dropping on a year-by-year
basis and he was getting fewer
candidates with lower skills and he was
really concerned as to why this was and
he realized that you know it's bad for
our industry it's bad for our economy
it's bad for geeks like me to have toys
to play with if we don't have people who
are talented enough to go and make them
and it's something that resonated with
him now he's working at Broadcom you
know he finds it very hard to hire good
engineers you know and the problem is
because you know we're sort of suffering
from from people not growing up with the
low-level skills that he sort of grew up
with so why doesn't my generation have
those skills well if you think about it
my generation grew up with two kinds of
computing device we grew up with a games
console and we grew up with a shared
Windows home PC now styling for the
games console but I said phenomenally
advanced but a kick right the silicon in
there in terms of flops performance is
better than a 1990s Cray supercomputer
you know you think like Darfur and NSA
build supercomputers out of ps3's right
the problem is is that they're
completely closed and as an educational
device that they're a complete dead end
you know where is Evan if you wanted to
go play a game would go to the news
agents buy a computing magazine flick
through the pages they found a game you
liked go home and actually type in the
source code that was on the page before
you could play it you know we just get
downloadable content for call of duty
and go play with phenomenally advanced
graphics engines but we can't even see
the source code for that
if we wanted to you know you don't sell
a games console based on what silicones
in it you don't sell it based on you
know what flop performance is you sell
it based on the games titles and the
kind of clothes packaging right and and
and the problem is is that as I say
that's it that's a dead end platform for
learning how to use so what's the other
kind of device who grew up with I mean
when we grew up sort of back in the UK
we do these things for ICT lessons
information communication technologies
it's kind of rare to find a school that
teaches computing certainly I went to a
good private school back at back in the
UK and but you know there weren't any
computing lessons available even if you
wanted them and these lessons were
essentially sales pitches for Microsoft
Office products right I mean does does
my generation really need to be taught
16 how to go and use Microsoft Word it
kind of doesn't make any sense
and the thing is while it's great that
we have this proliferation of computing
devices while you know nearly every home
now has these Windows PCs there's a
barrier either an effort or a cost
barrier to going and developing on them
you know if you want to go develop on
your own your Windows PC you have to go
and find the development tools you've
got to go in
you know source Visual Studio and either
you know download it for free as a
student or you know go and pay for it
you've got to go make the effort to go
and be able to develop on and you've got
to invest the time and the money to go
and do that whereas alternatively you
know you can open up Chrome and go watch
YouTube right and this is the problem
you know in this instant gratification
society that we grew up in when there's
no barrier to content consumption and
there is a barrier to content creation
no wonder we're having a sort of lost
generation of people who didn't bother
becoming hackers because you know those
HD video content that they could easily
get on and what we realized is that you
know sort of taking a step back you know
when I when I grow up talking about
hacking on on PCs I remember taking
apart my my parents computer their
windows box and getting shout out by my
dad because you need to check his email
and you know the motherboards on the
floor right you know it's it's no good
having these machines and saying let's
tinker let's hack let's make if you need
to then use them to do your word
processing for your homework right and
it's no good having these game
souls that are incredibly advanced if
when you do go and hack it when Linux on
it you get sued by Sony Corporation you
know so so what we realized is what we
needed was another device we need an
additional device that removed the
abstraction that removed the barriers
and that was just there as a toy for
tinkering right we wanted something you
could switch out your Xbox 360 with put
in sort of a low cost barrier a low
effort barrier and and it was just there
straight in with the development tools
it was straight in to go and make things
happen to go and build robots right and
we realized those there was kind of two
keys to this the first was price need to
be cheap enough that even parents who
didn't understand computing you know
they were happy to buy it just because
it was sort of cheap enough and and that
we need to make sure the kids had
ownership we need to make sure that this
was a device just for tinkering you know
it was their device they didn't have to
worry about whether or not they broke it
they didn't have to worry about whether
or not you know it was still a usable
state to go do their homework on it this
was a machine for play it was a machine
for hacking and so Evan always had this
dream but it was only when he was
working at Broadcom developing processes
for mobile phones that he realized
actually we had the technology at the
price point we needed to go and fulfill
this and so essentially what happened is
we we took the development board that
was being used for the Broadcom
applications process on this board and
turned it into this turned into the
Raspberry Pi and that's essentially
where this came from you know in many
ways this is a cell phone without the
baseband without the radio and the idea
is that you know this has HDMI
connections has components you can hook
this up to your CRT TV you can put it in
place of your Xbox 360 you know and and
all you need is an SD card out of your
camera my flying around keyboard and
mouse from a old PC you might have
junked and a USB microUSB charger you
might already have your blackberry you
know these are things that were just
lying around so you just need this sort
of $35 investment to go and have a toy
to play with and what's great about this
device is it's accessible but not
necessarily easy to use right the point
is is that rather than you know covering
all the kernel booting on some kind of
nice graphic you know we print out all
the steps on the kernel booting right
you know because what we kind of hope is
that kids the last questions you know we
think you
by seeing you learn by asking questions
you know you learn by being inspired
wanting to make things and having to
overcome obstacles in that goal when you
boot this up it goes into command prompt
if you want a GUI you have to launch a
GUI and we don't have a nice
sugar-coated button saying you know
launch Gary you have to type in star tax
right and then we get these kind of 10
your kids going before the start X mean
it's like well you're starting an X
server and they're like what's an X
server you're like well actually you
know this is how operating systems
really work you know at the start button
isn't an integral part of your operating
system right come got a contrary to
popular belief and so the point is is
that it's all accessible it's all
immediate and it's a great platform for
developing so where are we going is the
foundation so I talked about the fact
that we were very interested in
education outreach but what we realize
is that ultimately you know we're a
bunch of Engineers a bunch of low level
software kernel hackers you know ASIC
engineers you know we produced this chip
and what we wanted to do was make sure
that we made the tools for the educators
we made the tools for the outreach
projects already there to go in right
resources for to go and teach with but
they had a cheap platform to go and do
it right and and so kind of you know why
am I here why am I talking to you guys
what I'm saying to you guys is we went
and made a UNIX box that's $35 you know
we went and made a computer that you can
buy for $35 you can give to your kids
you know it comes quick preloaded with
scratch comes pre-loaded with Python you
know it's a great learning platform we
have GPI out for the physical computing
and what we're saying is you know please
go and do awesome stuff and please help
us get these in the hands of kids and
please help us teach we're not yet ready
to go into schools and say you know this
is a finished product that you can that
you can put in your skills and teacher
in and you know what we need is your
help to to polish the OS to refine the
various bugs and to make those resources
so that we do get to a point where you
know we can we can go to schools and say
hey we have a whole computing package
for you you know that's $35 here's some
free resources here's some case studies
by dedicated teachers that have already
been
using it you know this is a tool you
need to go and do that so how do we see
education working with the pie you know
if if you're you're out here and you
have you know you have kids you have
cousins siblings and you're like yeah
I'm you know I'm Spyder I want to go
teach this stuff and how can I do that
so firstly we really like scratch we
think scratch is a great way to get kids
introduced to programming
one of things we like about scratch is
that it's teaching data flow it's
teaching algorithmic development without
ever needing to say those words it's a
graphical programming language you're
dragging and dropping control blocks or
we'll probably have a demo next door or
possibly pull it up and and you're
creating short programs you're making
things happen just by dragging and
dropping these boxes and we've seen like
seven eight nine year olds make games
for the first time using scratch and the
point is they don't really understand
the computer science behind it but when
they've grown up around computing
devices where all I've ever done is
consume apps made by other people the
joy they have in showing their brothers
and sisters you know a game that they
made that's really awesome you know
ultimately programming and computing is
a creative tool you know it's I know
it's tempting sort of academics among us
to say you know we want optimize things
to sake optimization we want to research
things for the sake of science but
ultimately it's a tool and it's a tool
for creativity you know the best
engineers are lazy people right you know
it's a way that we can go and do things
that we might not ordinarily be able to
do very quickly very easily and we want
to make sure that it's not just it's not
just the people who know they want to be
engineers it's not just the stem
students is anyone who had a crazy idea
to go and make a robot you know anyone
who wants to go and fire nerf guns
remotely right I mean we see some great
projects when I was over in New York I
met a videographer from Milan who was
there covering New York Fashion Week and
she came to the raspberry pie talk
because she wanted to use the raspberry
pie to show videos she recorded of kind
of catwalks runway stuff and you know
that's awesome
we met some my resister we met some
people who'd made this huge tent that
had a five 12 point FFT and around the
tent on Iran LEDs that they took to
Burning Man and made as a dance ten
right I'm willing to bet most of the
people dancing in that tent didn't
really know what an FFT was but the
point is you know it's cool you know
it's a toy it's a way to go and do
awesome stuff and we think if we're
going to inspire kids the way to do it
is to go and make these cool projects
show them the cool projects and then get
them to want to learn so that they can
replicate them you know if we go and
teach programming for the sake of
programming we go say yeah it's
important you should learn this you know
yeah this is good for science you know
that's not gonna be as effective as
saying dude this is a robot
we made it using programming you know
that's the way that we make stuff happen
I mean someone Nova early on and saw
MakerBot I believe made a wearable
computing set up for like under a couple
of hundred dollars just by using a
Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi adapter like a small
display and a coat hanger you know sort
of like a very cheap Google glass right
and you know and that's really cool it's
cool that we can go and do that stuff
but you know when we're all growing up
like we wanted to do but you know maybe
couldn't justify out our beer budgets to
go and buy the toys we need to make the
things from it so so let's say so back
to the learning so let's say we've
inspired them at scratch they've made
their games you know they've shown their
cousins and they're like that's awesome
and what they want to do now is they
want to go make some motors move they
want to light some LEDs they want to go
and make a robot we really like it as a
first programming language we like
Python we like Python because it's a
great language to get stuff done and
it's human readable you know if you want
to go do hello world it's one line as
opposed to like 600 in Java right you
know and it's it's a great language
you're just getting stuff done is why
the scientific community uses it and
what we like about python is is the fact
that you can you can introduce kids to
it just using it through the interpreter
you know they can use it as their
desktop calculator right they can you
know just do them at home of it they can
write simple lines it's one line for
hello world with our libraries for the
GPIO it's one line to go and turn on the
motor it's one line to turn on an LED
you know and you know you want to go use
Jason to make something happen as a
result of someone tweeting the word
Raspberry Pi you know that's still only
a few lines right that's the joy of
Python and what we see is once you've
introduced the syntax you know they've
had that immediate success of typing
something and seeing something happen
you can then put those lines together
and
compiler you know that's your first kind
of procedural program and that you've
written the program you know you wrote
some code you made something happen
that's awesome
and then obviously as people know like
pythons an object-oriented language the
best way to write Python is object
orientated but rather than learning Java
where you kind of need to go and read
those text books before you even go and
write your hello world you've already
picked up the syntax you've already
picked up dataflow and algorithmic
development from scratch you've already
gone and compiled your first program
you're in a good place to go and learn
about object-oriented methodology you
know lower class hierarchies and then
that's a good point to go and write your
gypped orientated code once you've done
that stepping over to Java or something
is pretty easy right because you know
you know you know how to do that kind of
design it's just another set of syntax
we also really like teaching the
low-level so one of the things we've
done is Cambridge University Computer
Science Laboratory have given one of
these to every fresher coming into this
year's set of computer science undergrad
and and this is really great for two
reasons the first is that we can
hopefully see a whole load of projects
by by kind of undergraduates wanting to
prove themselves make a name for
themselves and going and making awesome
stuff just because you know they have
time and they they want to go do it but
also because it means that the academics
are going to start writing teaching
material that's tailored to the pie so
there's already a course out there
called baking pie and that's your great
name that's made by the academics for a
computer science laboratory and that's a
course on how to write your own
operating system in assembler like
complete with frame buffer and when you
think you know one of the problems is
that we're we're lacking those low-level
skills you know we didn't my generation
didn't grow up on basic you know we
didn't grow up on spectrums you know we
didn't do command line stuff we didn't
learn machine code yeah and so the point
is that you can go and write an
operating system in assembler you know
when you then go move on to C and help
us with kernel development you'll see is
gonna be a lot better having written an
operating system in assembler first than
going the other way around
right and you know and and we think this
is great for not just the sort of
computer science learning we also think
this is great for physical computing as
I sayin I'm an I'm an e grad and I think
that the best way to get people inspired
on programming is to show them stuff hat
you know it's one thing to try and teach
them why some optimization or somebody
codes cool
the thing to sort of show them something
happening and going that worked because
we had a computer and we had some code
to make it do something so really you
know I'm here asking you guys to please
keep making cool projects please let us
know the cool projects you're making
helps inspire more kids help us get
these in the hands of kids and you know
show your you know the kids you know
your cousin's you know your kids and
things how to get a program in scratch
introduce them to Python introduce them
to the joys of physical computing and
also you know be great if there's any
education outreach and I Google there's
lots of education outreach out there who
could help us write material for the
Raspberry Pi you know help us get the
sort of lesson plans and the structure
we need in place so that we are ready to
go to schools and say here's a complete
package at a low cost you know this is
the way we think you should be teaching
computing and introducing computing in
schools I'll probably hand over to Q&amp;amp;A
now and I can answer more technical
questions I know these kind of talks we
get a wide variety from kind of teachers
turning up saying I've heard about this
Raspberry Pi thing you know what's in it
for me
through two guys one saying you know why
doesn't my particular bit of split
transaction on USB work so we can
hopefully try and cover that range and
I'll try and answer what I can awesome
do you know where people are yeah so so
initially we have problem whereby the
end points and the micro frames were the
allocation was fixed so you're limited
to kind of seven endpoints you could
service in one frame and that meant that
your first kind of the first few devices
which used up those endpoints bearing in
mind that one goes to bulk transfer
anyway ones used up for the networking
and then most devices have two or three
endpoints anyway which meant if you're
using multiple USB devices that that
didn't work we've now got pushed out a
mic refrain scheduler fix the dynamic
allocates endpoints so we can now
service lots of devices we've also
pushed out a fix with the interrupt
masking so that we service the USB first
and we reduce the CPU overhead that was
incurred in doing that we're still
actively working the USB and you want
any engineers and here I've worked on
USB you know that's probably the hardest
thing we've had to develop for this you
know you need these sort of hundred K
analyzers to go and work on it and you
know it's it's a systems problem because
you've got to understand both everything
from the state machine in the RTL
through to sort of using your logic
analyzer to see what's going on on the
frames and due to the other problem the
USB is the ubiquity so the problem is is
that the general perception is with the
USB devices that they should just work
you know the USB right but there's a
very loose understanding in the industry
and what the USB spec actually says you
know we've we've seen lots of devices
that you know don't adhere to the spec
and don't work with us or do it here to
the spec but don't act in it in a nice
way
so we had some issues with USB serial
converters and and they they just kind
of flooded us with packets right they
didn't they didn't perform in the way we
expected so part of what we're trying to
do now when I say we expected to ship
10,000 of these in our first year we're
probably going to ship a million in our
first year we've shipped half a million
already and there's maybe five or six
engineers working parts you know not all
not in part time and they're evenings
and weekends right on supporting this so
you know we're we're working on it but
but the USB is is slow because it's
difficult and
I know some people say that one of the
problems of the foundation is we're not
transparent enough and what we're
working on
it's probably just because you know
these are all engineers who are working
at Broadcom their day job going home and
trying to fix USB in the evening you
know they don't really have much time to
go and write a blog post as well you
just kind of have to trust us that we
want to see this as finessed as possible
we want to get the best performance at a
USB best performance out of the
processor you know we're going to work
on those things we're going to do our
best and we'll kind of push out updates
as we do it but we'd rather do the
development then necessarily spend lots
of time kind of blogging about it and
see that might get you a lot more help
yeah I agree
I'm it's something we're working on we
do we do recognize that and it's just
something I mean obviously we're all
kind of Engineers that you know work in
a sort of corporate environment we're
now working in a sort of open source
project it's quite a big sort of
headspace switch to go move across to
doing everything sort of in a kind of
structured way to suddenly doing things
in the way that you're asking the
community for feedback and you're you're
getting involved I think part of the
reasons we don't look transparent is
just because we're so overwhelmed you
know we're we're desperately trying to
do as much as we can and we spread so
thinly that you know we don't have time
necessarily to do all the things we'd
like to do but definitely as things are
stabilizing you know as as the
foundation actually starts to have
engineers working on it full-time
we're certainly going to move towards
more more transparency and one of the
things we've done we've opened a Twitter
account called RPF underscore dev
underscore updates its link target hubs
and what we do is every time as a commit
it gets tweeted onto there also every
time we push anything new into the
repository every time we push an update
to the firmware we tweet about it and
that's just a really quick ways that the
developers among us can kind of keep
track easily and what's going on without
necessarily having to go to github and
just see what the development is and
beatitude is something we're working on
it's thinking about any hardware widgets
around er this eve mostly focused on the
software side yes so we can talk about
that so I should have mentioned I'm
notoriously so um so the way the
foundation works ultimately Pete Lomas
who design this board did a great
article in Wired recently I don't know
if any people read it which is very
saying about you know we have we have to
sell out a little to sell a lot
you know we realize there's going to be
a lot more demand than we could ever
raise capital to go and produce
ourselves so what we decided to do was
to go and approach a number of sort of
multinational companies so we went with
our su traders allied in the US and the
final group you have a number of
business units element14 Newark MCM here
in the US and we we license them the
design of the PCB so that they could
manufacture it for us and handle
distribution as a result that meant that
we couldn't release all the Gerber's and
things on the outset which we wanted to
do the problem is is that you know to
get people to invest money in in in the
infrastructure in producing these we
have to make sure they can protect that
investment and so you know one of the
things we talk about is we are very much
believers and the open ideology it's
something we want to do you know we can
honestly say this board is as open as
possible you know if we could make this
more open we would be doing it there are
things we are doing right now I can't
necessary talk about to try and make it
more open right the problem is is that
what we thought was more important was
to ship than to sit around worrying
about the ideology you know ultimately
yes the GPU on this is closed yes we
haven't released the Gerber's but we can
get UNIX boxes in the hands of kids for
$35 you know and that's are gone and and
sort of the important thing was in it
wasn't doing that wasn't delivering that
and then you know kind of secondary
making sure we can fulfill all of our
own personal beliefs on openness
ideology and things and the other point
is we're gonna be in a much better
position when we've shipped a million or
so units to go and talk about the open
debate then we would be if we're sitting
around saying hey we're just going to
wait till we can do an entirely open
border less than $35 you know so you
know i engineer I sort of understand I
understand the frustration there but
ultimately the point of this is to get
cheap computing devices in the hands of
kids and you know we're going to make
sure we do that first and we're going to
make sure that if we can do that we do
that and we make it as open as possible
but you know that stuff will come around
so so so we we are responsible for
designers board we're responsible for
the kernel like that's that's what we do
as a foundation there's then a lot of
add-ons which are made by the community
senior notices we don't produce a case
so there's a couple of reasons for that
I mean firstly we're not graphic
designers right you know we're if we're
hardware engineers and we're software
engineers we we thought it was cool to
leave it open to the community to go do
that for us certainly with the rise of
3d printing
you know those designs you can go and
download go to local hackerspace and
just print that and there's there's a
variety of cases like this one we really
like this one it's called a pi bow it's
like a multi-layer case comes with
really nice like faux IKEA instructions
and you know and these are made by the
community and an open the available and
it's great that we can kind of encourage
the maker community and give them ways
to sort of raise some of their own
finances by by making projects that can
sell alongside the other reason we'd
have a case is because when I put this
in the hands of kids they go hey what's
that you know what what's this bidding
right and that's awesome
you know we've grown up in a generation
where we think electronic devices of all
kind of black slates around the corners
right and and it's important to say no
no this is what a computer looks like
right this is a computer you know and
and it's great to be able to answer
those questions it's great to be able to
show them a PC bit you know in I quite
like going up to CS grads and saying hey
can you name the capacitors on this
board because you know it's amazing how
much we've sort of lost that knology of
computing that you know when we sort of
had spectrums in Apple twos that that
was a bit more bit more well known
there's also Hardware made by my bread
welcome engineers so there's a guy
called go at Van Loon who's a really
smart engineer did a lot of the ASIC
design and for the sock that's almost on
this board and he was he wanted to go
and make really big things move from
this whereas we thought you know this is
3v3 digital logic the the current draw
is obviously all powered by the power
supply so it's shared between the
processor the USB devices on the GPIO
she kind of limited that but he wanted
to go make big motors move see when okay
I'll go designer board to make that
happen so have a thing called the Girt
board so available from new york it's
$40 comes as a kit you can solder
together yourself it's not on sale yet
just because we're going through the
last few bits of kind of FCC testing and
things will be on sale as soon as we can
sell it and this allows you to drive
things up to four amps for it with
5-volt logic so you can just
this in the same place as you would do
your Arduino sensors you know it's the
same 5 volt GPIO you can go make some
great huge motors move you know there's
physical fuses on that that's kind of
cool and it actually has an Atmel chip
on it so if you want to go sort of use
your existing Arduino microcontroller
code you can run it on this board and
this isn't made by the foundation but
this is a part of fact that our mission
is to focus on what we do well focus on
what we can do for the community that it
might otherwise struggle to raise the
capital or you know get the engineer
towns go and do you know we made the
UNIX boxes where we're kind of letting
the rest the community come and help us
out with without on get particularly we
really liked our friends over Adafruit
and they have a learning website called
learned at Adafruit comm where they have
a whole bunch of tutorials and products
they've been well tested for the PI in
everything from GPS receivers to GSM
receivers you know wireless keyboards
small displays and all of these things
with tutorials and they're for sale and
you know what's great is that they were
you know they were waiting for something
like this to come a lot you know they
were waiting for someone to make
hardware hacking accessible and cheap
enough and and that's what we we feel
we've been able to go and do the one
thing the the foundation is gonna
produce in terms of us around on the
hardware or certainly is going to in the
immediate future is that as I mentioned
this is basically a cell phone without
the baseband on the radio the other
thing those cell phones now have is a
camera and so we're going to release a
camera board which works over SPI for
data I squared C for the control it's
going to be $25 it's going to hopefully
be done before Christmas people often
ask me when's its going to be done I've
got to go back and write the software
for it so as soon as I finish that it's
all that it'll probably go on sale it's
a 5 megapixel smartphone sensor and
you're going to be able to record 1080p
video with h.264 encoding and the
hardware gonna be able to hopefully use
the JPEG hardware encoder to get quite
good frames a second encode of JPEGs off
the 5 megapixel sensor I'm also going to
hopefully give a raw bit stream that you
can put across the network put into
OpenCV go and do cool robotics projects
and that's all going to run on the open
max
sort of media streaming layer and that's
all gonna be in user land and yeah I
mean talk about the open we are wanting
to open source everything
runs on the arm or the userland you know
we are trying to be as open as possible
problem is you know you guys well
appreciate that involves talking to a
lot of lawyers which is a not very fun
and be very time-consuming but we're
taking on that pain on your behalf right
so you should be very grateful and so
yes so hi so with the help of things
like scratch you know as I say we've
seen seven year-olds produce games so on
our blog there's actually some videos of
some games that some seven year olds
have made that we saw and we just
thought that's awesome you know the
seven year olds made a game is really
excited about it I quote from the
engineers have been teaching their kids
and you know you've got you've got these
kids on the ten you were so excited that
they made something themselves you know
it's a game that they made you know when
you think you know it's kind of seven
you have all these cool games you want
to make the fact you can actually go and
produce something someone else can play
you know that's awesome you know and
it's the right way of encouraging
programming because we're showing that
it's a tool for creativity it's showing
that this is a way you can go and make
those awesome things you want to do and
I'm pretty sure that's the reason why
most of us are here you know we grew up
making awesome stuff in Lego we grew up
wanting to build robots you know the
point is we've made something cheap
enough and accessible enough that the
kids can go and do that and that's
awesome sort of a moving up from there
you know we've got undergraduates using
the assembler course going right
operating systems you know we have the
kind of you know lifelong hackers making
all sorts of awesome stuff and you know
Python kind of fits nicely in between
physical computing you know all the way
through to sort of web development stuff
you know you can use all the kind of web
libraries for Jason and stuff to go and
make web apps and it's great what the
community's done with the Raspberry Pi
and one of the things that I was really
excited about back at home this Earth
sort of computing magazine and they had
a review of media centers and the
Raspberry Pi was reviewed as a media
center option right and you think yeah
we produced some hardware for education
the community has gone hey we can make a
Media Center out of this and they went
and got XBMC polished enough that it was
good enough to be reviewed in a
commercial magazine as a commercial
product anything that's awesome right it
just shows what the community can do I
think one of the great things about this
platform
is that if we do sell a million in our
first year there's going to be that
wealth of people making projects for it
that wealth of people on the forms
answering questions having user groups
and that's going to be a really great
platform to learn on because if there's
something you want to do someone's
probably already blogged about it right
and that's really cool
you know I'm where I've been touring
hack spaces because we really like
supporting hack spaces you know we think
tank space is a great place where you
know artists can turn up and say hey
I've always wanted to make this
ridiculously awesome thing for Burning
Man but I have no idea how and then
there's guys like us saying yeah let's
do it you know and you kind of can share
those skills and and inspire by doing
rather than inspire by by teaching and
inspire by academia so you can order one
right now so yeah so you can do that
right now if you want to so there's two
manufacturers distributors there's this
allied and final-final currently have a
lot of stock in north america you can go
in order from MCM electronics and I it's
just shipping it's three to five days
shipping have stock right now and
there's no order limits so you know you
can go do that now if you want to okay
two days so there you go so you can have
a hundred and two days probably the only
my only worries I'm going to give this
talk at some point I mean everyone's
gonna have got their iPhones out ordered
them and then there's gonna be no stock
but I'm I finish the talk but you know
that hasn't happened yet right so
hopefully they're still stopped right
now so the problem is is that they're
the chip on this board is a custom ASIC
application-specific integrated circuit
um you can't buy off-the-shelf
you have to order them from Branko and
that's kind of got like a 23 week lead
time right so the problem is is that um
once once they sold out it takes quite a
long time to recover that you know to
get your orders through for the chips to
can produce more boards so that's going
to stabilize once we have a better
understanding of demand but as I say we
expected to sell 10,000 units right so
we got you know when we crashed the fire
on our website on the day of launch
right and you know both of both of our
distributors you know they you can kind
of see when we launched on their share
and so and so we've been kind of
overwhelmed and they've been a bit
overwhelmed we we think before Christmas
the stock situation should be stabilized
we should be in a good place as I say
this was plenty of stock in North
America through Farnell right now so you
can get them in two days how do you so
people call for NASCAR competition right
so we're you know we're not to start up
where we went into this to get rich I
mean no one gets paid yet I'm probably
gonna be the first employer of the
foundation like paid employee there's
Evans wife Liz it's full-time doing the
PR at the moment and doing the blog you
read most the postings if you go on the
web site and Visenya is the first
engineer when I go back and you know we
didn't do this to get rich I don't have
any equity right now I'm not being paid
to do this we didn't say hey let's go do
this thing hey let's make a startup
we were a bunch of engineers who had the
drive to go and make something for
education and and had the facility you
know have the technology to do it and I
think a lot of people say you know why
did you go for a Broadcom chip and it
wasn't that we sat down and said hey
let's produce a platform we we had a
platform we said hey this would be great
for that thing we've always wanted to do
for cheap computing for education you
know it's that way around this is a
startup that was that was born out of
necessity rather than out of desire to
go and have a startup and I think with
the competition you know we didn't or
certainly as far as I'm aware you know
we didn't sit around and go you know
let's where's our competition you know
what's out there
we just kind of went we think this is a
good thing to do we think we need this
let's go and do it you know we we don't
want to go and you know and compete with
these other companies who looks great
other people are working in the hardware
space I mean we often say if someone was
to come in and produce a higher
performance board or a board that was
somehow better for the community that
was cheaper that's great you know we'll
go back to our day jobs right mission
accomplished
we're doing this because we think it
should exist and we're hoping that we're
spawned it well if you go read the tech
blogs you'll see the tech blogs are full
of that you know raspberry-pi
competitor you know razz beep I like
devices and we're kind of proud of that
because the point is that we've shown
that there's volume in doing cheap you
know computing devices we've shown that
this is a device that people want and
hopefully you know we can we can kind of
get those being created and you know
that's our goal it's not our goals not
to sort of have a have a massively
successful business our goal is to get
these in the hands of kids and to make
something like this and so we think
there's still room for the Arduino when
the Arduino as a microcontroller is a
lot kind of better platform for really
cheap sensing projects for you know
really kind of basic so anything where
you want a basic microcontroller but as
soon as you want anything with
networking as soon as you want anything
where you know the developments going to
be quicker in a UNIX environment than it
would be you know writing for
microprocessor for misses where this
really wins you know I believe then
Arduino is a similar price but then by
the time you buy the networking shield
and get all the stack working that
starts being over a hundred dollars I
believe that's people told me you know
whereas this is thirty-five dollars with
USB with networking you know so that's
that's where we see this being useful
but we don't you know we see it as being
a you know living alongside and the
ecosystem not necessarily being a
replacement
a couple of motors number of our sight
yeah what's involved to go over there
so um so thing you do is if you if you
go and buy one of these names here
you'll get a nice box
I don't know federal has a box with them
but a little cardboard box with on these
devices it doesn't come in the past ply
it doesn't come with an SD card it
literally comes as the bear bear board
so the first thing you want to do is
source some kind of power supply we
recommend one that's rated up to an amp
five volts
one of the things we found is power
supply manufacturers do vary greatly and
we found at least one manufacturer that
sold a range of power supplies that just
were all seven volts we got us what it
said on the label right and and it is
mate worth making sure that you can
supply enough current because one of the
problems we have is that people plug I
pass wise in that maybe only give 500
milliamps or less and so it's enough for
the board to boot as soon as the CPU low
get significant soon as you plug in your
Wi-Fi dongle it restarts because a lot
of power so Adafruit sell 1 amp 5 volt
supply if not you know just scout around
we found the iPhone ones are pretty good
so you know you can get them but to get
hold one of those got hold of an SD card
go all over the HDMI cable plug it into
your TV right yeah yes
as we couldn't do today apparently this
TV only takes VGA which is why I don't
have a demo behind me so that was a
pretty poor example and doesn't have
component either so because the only
argument is that for the developing
world we have component so if you want
to keep one of these out for free you
know you go to your local electronics
recycling company you say hey the next
time someone's Chucky's we're CRT you
know or free cycle or Craigslist or
whatever the us's equivalences now you
can source CRT monitors for nothing
these days people are trying to give you
them the same with keyboards and mice
you know you go to your local bank
whatever and say hey next time you're
repositioning your IT you know and
you're throwing away those perfectly
good keyboards yeah we believe you can
stock these out for nothing and with a
little bit of effort but yes see you get
your SD card you go on a website we
recommend an operating system called
raspbian so raspbian x' a fork of debian
obviously we only forked because we
absolutely had to you know wants
unnecessary forks of operating systems
and but debian have a version which
supports the v7
instruction set with hardware
floating-point and they have one which
is kind of catch-all distribution which
supports of v4 with software floating
point and so the problem was is that
because we're v6 we were losing all of
that performance by having the the build
for v4 with software floating-point so
the community went away we're very
grateful for them for doing that and we
built Debian rebuilt the packages with
hardware floating-point with with v6 so
you get a significant performance
increase so that's why we have this
raspbian but it's essentially Debian and
so you can you can get a Debian disk
image dd it onto your sd card plug it in
boot it up and hopefully uh solve demo
next door so I don't go up on here you
know it boots up to the command command
prompt it says if you want the gooey
type start X type start X LXDE starts up
you know it's what most people would
recognize as a computer right um
scratch is pre-installed on image so if
you wanna go to scratch you go straight
into scratch pythons pre-installed so
you can open a Python terminal and
obviously putting Python development
we'd say don't waste the CPU overhead of
going into the GUI you know just just go
straight into it in the terminal and and
that has a library which is already got
all the GPIO controls so you go on our
wiki the in Linux wiki you look up the
necessary Python lines it's all well
documented and it's like a line to go
and turn on GPIO so you know it's 3 V 3
so you go get a header pin get some
breadboard connect it to something in
LED connect it to ground on the
connector type your line of Python LED
turns on so that's those are basically
the steps but it is it's well set up I
mean the great thing is anything you
want to do if you go and google it
someone's probably done it or done
something similar you know there's all
sorts of rappers as a rapper called
wiring Pi which makes the GPIO like the
Arduino I believe and makes it very
simple but also all of the GPIO and the
LED you can control they're all mapped
in the correct place in UNIX file system
so you can do with the bash script if
you want to so I actually did a great
workshop where we got a bunch of
complete beginners and we went and
turned on an LED on a breadboard
using bash scripting right and we did it
not because that was the easiest way but
because they actually understood what
was going on you know we we had a
multimeter out and we were also bash
scripting how often do you get to do
those two things in the same
right you know we were we were reading a
resistor value and we're also explaining
what a pipe did that's awesome you know
and that's that sort of teaching
computing on the low level it's teaching
computing by doing and it's you know
it's getting those low level skills
which we're losing to people you know
who aren't are bothering to learn
assemble are bothering to really
understand how our computer works
obviously so you're applying to schools
we're kind of throwing Attalla so so
right now we're targeting the stem
groups the outreach groups who maybe
we're already doing stuff with arduino
maybe you're already running sort of
electronics classes you know they don't
need any lesson plans of resources from
us right they just here they can get
hold of one of these for $35 and that's
all they need all right and so for those
people we're ready for you to go and be
the Trailblazers do the case studies get
them in the hands of kids and see what
they can make we also have like another
set of educators which are the teachers
saying you know I'm not an IT specialist
I'm not a computing science specialist
you know I want to teach computing I
hear what you're saying but I don't know
how to do it to those people we say hold
off yet you know we are working with
with big government groups we are
working with educational groups to get
those resources made but that takes time
you know we're we're not arrogant enough
to believe that because we understand it
we can teach it we wanna talk to
specialists get their skills involved
and that's on its way I mean look the
travesty would be if we push this hard
into schools generally now and sort of
had them sitting getting dusty on the
Shelf just because they were cheap and
they seemed like the only thing to be
right you know we're we're very much
focused on making sure that we have a
package we have you know a board and an
operating system and a set of resources
that are polished enough ready to do
that we're not there yet
but you know that's our goal that's what
we're working on right now we're saying
let's go make those cool projects which
inspire people to do it let's go and get
them in the hands of kids like we
probably were when we were growing up
who didn't need a lesson plan right we
just needed to be able to have something
to go and play with and you know let's
let's make sure that we get them out
there get them tested get the feedback
so when they do go into classes you know
it's polished we've got the inspiration
you know and they've hopefully already
seen cool things other people have made
our management and low-power Lord yeah
I've tried to shut down this and it's to
absorb about more what yeah
so I believe on a model a as I said the
networking consumes about fifty percent
of power consumption where twenty to 700
megahertz on the arm
with the model a I believe with
underclocking you can get that down to
250 milliamps the the update we've
pushed out has this this governor so you
kind of have this so hysteresis effect
where we monitor the CPU load and we
step the core voltage and frequency
based on the cpu load and then we have
an upper threshold determined by an on
die temperature sensor when we kind of
ramp it back down again which hopefully
means that you know you get the extra
force when you need it without needing
to run overclocked all the time you know
unnecessarily and you don't need cooling
for that often people kind of go since
you say overclock people go but there's
no active or passive cooling it's like
there isn't on your smart phone you
don't need yes so on the model be sadly
you can't I don't believe you can turn
off in software and that's frustrating I
mean I don't see any reason why you
couldn't do solder it but but the model
a is gonna be out before Christmas right
and you can under clock this board so
you can go into the settings and reduce
the clock speed if you wanted to and
hopefully drop the power consumption
that way but yes you always can have the
overhead of the networking on the model
B but the model B is model a is coming
there the problem is we can't produce
enough model be to satisfy demands so we
haven't done the model a yet but it's
it's on its way
anybody's criticize or yes so all right
we're kind of committed to sort of
continuous improvement much like you
know with software you know the kernel
development you kind of improving as
often in a committer lee commit often
we're trying to do that similarly with
with the hardware you know we are going
to sort of seamlessly keep updating the
PCB is necessary when we find bugs keep
fixing things no we've just released
this Reb too which fixes some of the
earlier bugs and hopefully sort of
improved that way I mean right now what
we want to do is as I say get this
polished enough to be ready to give to
kids to have a sort of an education
ready product and announce our focus you
know we're not we don't have a roadmap
for any wild new stuff right now
so yes it's going to be it's going to be
minor improvements it's going to be bug
fixes we're not going to probably not
gonna change the form factor just
because you know there are so many
people producing cases and things for it
that you know we kind of we kind of
stuck by our own success and the fact
that we probably don't want to change
this form factor or the the pinout and
things just because that'll be
frustrating to the community we've
hadded mounting holes as well when we
have to which is something that people
wanted yeah yes pretty much it's gonna
be continual improvement so the problem
is is it's on die right so um you know
the stock in this is a is a graphics
processor with an arm core so if we were
to we wouldn't as Broadcom engineers
have access to another socket to replace
it you know book windows and also you
know to get this to get the sock you
know redesigned in need new master set
you're talking millions of dollars right
you're not going to be able to do that
for $35 you know this is cheap because
it's an existing part and the GPU it's
very powerful it's very good for doing
things I mean so we have OpenGL ES 2.0
API so for example you can run quake 3
60 frames a second fairly consistently
using the new overclocking that's pretty
cool you can do 1080p video encode
decode got a whole host of media codecs
you can use in hardware
yes it's frustrating it's closed
but it's the fact that that bits closed
that allows us to sell us this cheaply
you know and ultimately you know we do
get people saying we just want to make
you award for most hackable gadget and
someone was saying on Twitter how can
you be the most hackable gadget if your
GPU is closed and it's like well I'm not
sure I'd teach kids GPU programming as
their introduction to computer science
right
you know like for what we want to do you
know there's arm JTAG the v6 instruction
set is well known yes you need a binary
blob to boot it but as a learning tool
you know for price and for availability
you know we don't think there's anything
better and as I say this is as open as
we can make it we're actively making it
as open as we can but we're you know
we're limited the chip that we have cool
okay well if there's no more questions
and I believe we're setting up some
monitors and cirrhotic PI's next door so
we can kind of play have with the
workshop come and have an instruction to
scratch have a look at Python have a
look at the Girt board and and yet
hopefully if you guys been working on
projects you can show us those projects
- okay okay let's guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
