get myself invited
go go come and also thanks for using
your laptop so people here don't have to
look at my flickr sticker it was a joke
okay alright yeah i'll talk to you about
some of the recent research I've been
doing that I think is actually pretty
exciting and going is going to affect
everybody's lives as much as the web has
affected our lives already so this is
kind of the standard view you have of
the web which is a collection of
documents that are interlinked and as
all of you know it was google's
breakthrough that revolutionized search
in the web is that realizing that
connections between this document this
piece of information can actually get
add value to evaluation of document
quality content but at the same time
there is in addition to the web
documents they're also all these web
breed users of documents and until a few
years ago their their opinions their
knowledge wasn't taken to into account
until a slew of new sites web two point
O sites social media sites they have
different names came about looks like
you know flickr and wikipedia dig and
twitter and excuse me if i bring in your
competition here and what decides a lot
people to do is actually not just
communicate form a community but also
share their knowledge and opinions and
expertise about but about data what's
the data what all these sites have in
common are the following things users
contribute content whether it's images
or articles or news stories or or
bookmarks well any kind of kind of
multimedia content or plain text
documents use it but more importantly
users add metadata to content through
the everyday activities users are
annotating the document with lots of
extra information they use tags so this
attack the freely chosen keywords by
users to describe the document
categorize documents they have this okay
users actually have the discuss content
through the blogs or through comment
sections and flickr sites and also users
evaluate content evaluate documents
either actively or passively like either
what about or just viewing so in
addition to all of this but wait there's
more
in addition to all of this users create
social networks they had the other users
as friends and most of these sites allow
very quick and easy interface to keep
track of the friends activities and also
they're all very transparent you can
actually navigate site through multiple
ways through links and see what
everybody else is doing thinking talking
about things like this so my apologies
again to the picasa team for using
flickr is my kind of pretty typical web
social media site but here's an example
of a photo page and flickr you have this
is a photo that some user submitted it
each link actually each each word here
more or less each word is a link to more
information so if you click on a name of
the user who submitted that you'll see
their users photostream all the images
they have submitted you can see this
image category this user categorized
this image with descriptive tags if
probably can say that says reflection
sky water pink blue things that describe
this image and if you click on any of
these tags you'll see all the other
images that the particular user has
tagged with with this keyword or all the
other images all the other users on
flickr have to have tagged with this
keyboard you can also see the discussion
about this image you can also see how
many people have viewed this room this
image was viewed 283 x + 22 people mark
this image as a favorite if you click on
the user's profile you will see actually
the friends the social network this
person belongs to all all the
photographer's dispersed but this
particular user is watching and you can
see what groups they belong to use a
joint so you can see sky and clouds
beautiful clouds the reflections of
users interests and again if you click
on any of this this is a link to the
group you can see all the group images
on this particular in here you can also
examine what are the tags that the user
has used to annotate his own images with
and and this is a cloud view so the
bigger the tag the more frequent this
keyboard is in the users for the stream
so you can see nature sky and clouds
that this is what the user had used the
term is chosen by this particular user
as hear this explanation about tears in
case um I'm just going to assume you
guys are not familiar with text and /
explain everything so tags are the key
word based meta data added to content it
helps thanks were originally introduced
to help users organize and manage to
on content in order to search for it
more quickly and browse for it more
quickly and these are freely chose
there's no dictionary or anything that
the dictates what what words user should
use and you can also examined for
example what other images that this
particular user has like the other
photographers and those it tells you a
lot about person's interests you can see
this particular person is interested in
flowers and birds and nature in nature
photography but like I said these are
images that this particular user has
chosen is the favorite is the favorite
so bike so you know I get all excited
and I start talking about this and
people just say well what's the big deal
but I believe I should this a big deal
because by exposing human activity
social web allows users to exploit the
collective intelligence and opinions of
others in order to sell not just their
own problems but salv also like many
bigger problems the social web
facilitates new ways of interacting
information with the call social
information processing and it allows you
to exploit collective effects like word
of mouth and amplification of good
information among many other collective
effects though and what I like also
valid that it is a mean able to
mathematical quantitative analysis so
you can actually design optimal systems
of that uses in a collaborative work of
many many individual users and as
somebody who works in the field of
artificial intelligence I I think it
offers also a new challenge and you as
well as a new data set where I and the
challenge is to harness the power of
collective intelligence to solve
information trusting problems and i'm
going to in the rest of this talk i'm
going to show what kind of problems you
can solve you know i'm going to show you
how you can use user contributed meta
data to solve a range of problems for
example information discovery document
discovery personals they had to
personalize results of search to
individual users how do you recommend
find new new new content to recommend to
users so recommendation problem as well
as collaborative rating if i have time
i'll talk about mathematical modeling
abusive collective behavior in the
systems alright so here's this is my
accomplishments at them in my children
in my photography madill i'm going to
sneak in few photographs of my own in
here
so first topic I'm going to discuss is
document information discovery and the
goal of information discovery is to
automatically find resources there's a
web services web pages any kind of
online the resource that provide the
desired functionality for example you're
interested in finding sources that
provide information about current
weather conditions or did allow you to
track a flight or provide bless you or
allow you to geocode the particular
address and this is a good problem but
it's a little bit difficult so I'm going
to look at the simpler goal which is to
find resources that provide the same
functionality as some example source I'm
going to coat the seed source and I work
actually with an information integration
group and in within this information
integration or like the for example that
builds map creates mashups there the
problem is important because of ansys or
some source can fail but they want to be
able to support application as a whole
so you need to find alternate sources
that provide the same functionality and
our approach will be to leverage
user-contributed tags the cat 30 just
keywords that users have categorized
things to discover new resources and i'm
going to use delicious web social
bookmarking site for this reason and
delicious what has anybody actually used
delicious here family of delicious only
of you okay only like fracture one-fifth
of population so delicious is a social
bookmarking site if you find some web
page online that you like to bookmark
for future reference you don't just put
it in your book you're nearing browsers
fault that you actually save it to the
side and when you save it to the side
you can add descriptive keywords so for
example there's a resource or given by a
URL flight cam that tracks flights
realize you fly tracking source and you
can see individual user fours mlcs
lawson came and and add the tags travel
sites and airlines this is a user save
they cannot describe the resource so
they can find it later when they go like
oh yeah I remember that flight tracking
some what was the URL to it and they can
quickly type in by the tags that they
have put in and find it and so different
users added the users adenoids maybe
something the stripped it to describe it
and then delicious displays this kind of
the popular tags so you can see that
after the 451 people that have tagged
this particular site origin
webpage this particular URL 234
annotated with travel 169 with flight
140 with tracking your flight track
airline you see I should the good kind
of descriptive keywords that we can use
and you click on each individual one
you'll see all the other documents at
all the other users have tagged with
this particular keyword so you can
actually see them we can actually start
now accumulating this large collection
of documents about that might be related
to travel a second okay and so we
introduced the probabilistic we're going
to use a I tool known as probabilistic
modeling and winter just the described
tag in processes that is a stochastic
process the user comes in this is
representing the graphical form so this
variable represents a user and this is a
resource Oh URL they want to tag and
there's some hidden variables that we
can't observe that like users interest
and resource topics these are
represented here as white circles users
interests and users topics and based on
these hidden variables a user choose a
set of tags that describe two to
annotate the pay you the resource with
and by via this is what we observed the
tags we observed user names and we
observe the URLs and from this we try to
learn using probabilistic modeling
techniques you learn what the hidden
unobserved variables are so it's a small
set of tablets that describe this set of
resources and so this is the model we
expressly asked him train or train it
using expectation maximization which is
a popular technique right now in in AI
to learn the what are the topics and my
student actually was a very ambitious he
didn't look at just a single model he
investigated using other models this is
different ways of representing so we
have here hidden topic here hidden
variable which is the topic generating
durations of users tags and resources
and you can train this okay and in order
to train which we need to collect the
data set and that is a big collected is
starting from this each of the has three
seed resources like flight calm which
provides flight information we had
Weather Underground that is a kind of
seed source for weather conditions and
the geocode that us which jerkwads
sites and from this we when they
supplied this URL to that site to
delicious retrieved the popular tags for
each popular attack we deceived all the
other documents they've been tagged with
the same tag and so we accumulate large
collections of documents so for flight
come for example seed we had 3,500
resources which had 14,000 tags and that
were annotated by 34 or more than 34,000
users and so for different for the each
data set and gosh I almost feel
embarrassed to be talking to the
soybeans and comparing our results to
Google but this is what you do you can
also think you can do the same
functionality by tapping URL into
Google's so you and then find similar
pages right which will return to this so
this is so here's a video and this is
actually for fairness let's look at
black bars which say how many then we
had the student manual evaluate whether
they discovered resource was actually
discovered based on topics not based on
text was actually relevant to the cedar
net and the student with all the student
to use either you know either if the
resource provided same functionality it
marked in black and if it contain the
link to the resource that provides the
functionality it's a it's a great in the
gray bar so this is total number of
resources that our system can access the
same functionality as the seed resource
and you can see for flight come this is
our model this is the other model so our
model could get like 27 28 resources
that had the same functionality you know
more than google's but I'm find similar
pages that could return you know 15 you
know it's written like 25 at of them
eight are relevant so forth and there's
actually that not that much variability
in performance probabilistic models but
they all perform better in our analysis
then you know find similar pages
algorithm the best performance was in
whether whether pages we were able to
find like 60 even among the top 100 p.m.
we looked at menu labeled the top 100
results a model predicted and all of
them like 60 were relevant to whether
information rather than a five or so
that we got provided any questions about
this part of the talk because so bike by
exploiting tagging activities of many
different users we were able to identify
courses that provided this functionality
we were interested in and I should
there's all kinds of interesting ways to
extend the stag in work for example we
want to learn like something like a
directory of services a hierarchy of
sources or maybe the concepts of sorts
to provide services about different
things for example we noticed that lots
of people tag flight tracker as travel
so they have a general category in mind
so it would be great if because I shall
learn it under travel there's things
like flights that have booking your
flight status information and also on
the child we have hotels with different
types of information and I believe it
there's that much content that we can
actually extract it this confirmation
from all right so next I'm going to talk
unless no question okay going to talk
about how to personalize search results
and here we actually going to use Flickr
again as my as a model so as i said
flickr allows users to tag their own
images so they can later find them
quickly and easily and and if you if you
type for example keyword you can
actually let tag name you can actually
search by text you can see all the
images that people have tagged with a
specific thing so so if you type beetle
for example you find all the other
images that users attack the beetle and
actually I'm ordering them by how their
interestingness so these are actually
good images that are labeled by be told
you can see actually if you can see if
this was bigger you can see that half of
these images are about bugs and half of
these images are of cars and that's
example of an ambiguous query term so
the term beetle has a big it has
different semantics different meanings
in sets of car model likewise if you
type tiger you'll get 50,000 images some
of them will be of the pantera Tigres
you know the scientific name for tiger
but many of them will be of house cats
or sharks like tiger shark so tiger
lilies or even mac OS 10 operating
system you'll see screen shots with that
and likewise you know I'm a child
photographer so I typed I went I start
thinking about this problem because I
tapped newborn to seal the interest in
newborn images and I got newborn baby is
fine but also got kittens and puppies
and ducklings and falls and many other
types of newborns
interested in in fact we can actually go
through and we can evaluate how many of
the top 500 images are actually relevant
to the query that she be user has in
mind the first sense of the word and for
newborn there's only a and I can do
precision precision is basically how
many of the Richard documents are
irrelevant the so how many of the
fraction of the 500 that irrelevant so
for newborn only eighty-two percent of
the documents of relevant to the baby
sense of the word for a tiger only
sixty-seven percent of the data of the
five hundred top 500 for relevant to
their one and four beetle query only
four less fewer than half were relevant
to that sense of the word you're
searching for Tiger went tiger isn't
wearing consider precision
persons of the work the other since we
were still in some sense correct the
correct then in what sounds like a
shepherdess all right but the user who's
executing the query absolutely but how
do you optimize your procedure that's
what I'm giving to talk about that's
what I'm but so well as if it was any
other questions so but naturally flickr
contains a lot of knowledge about my
tastes and preferences that i cannot
optimize my searches for me and what
kind of information do they happen i
have expressed you know because i'm a
kind of power user flickr i've been
involved in just posting in the
community a long time and I've actually
built up social networks of other
photographers so I've expressed my
patient preference to the other people
have added is my contacts I've I've
actually said something about my taste
and interest in photography through the
pads I've used to Anna pick my own
images with and also through images that
marked with my favorite if I had the
network connection I could show you all
the images that that veil I've added and
you could look at the say oh yeah this
person is interesting pictures of babies
okay I'm and through group set I joined
so they're going to look actually not of
we haven't had a chance to look at all
of this we're just going to look at
personalizing by text and personalizing
by contacts like how you can actually
very simply improve search results by
just filtering the results to this even
sometimes punish me that you have and
actually personalizing Becca can cut
personalizing by context actually kind
of trivial idea basically means you
return search results and only show
results search results from
photographers who are part of your
social network and if you do that so
this shows like I've selected for each
of this query terms i selected for users
who are like interested the horn you
were interested in or suspected strongly
they were interested in that sense of
the word I went and looked at their tags
their strings and said oh yeah this
person is interested in wildlife in the
zoo tigers and this person is interested
in baby so I had these for users which
set and you can see this is the size of
how many contexts they have ranges from
800 to 60 or so and now if you filter
the search results just by
that and look at what is now precision
and recall of the top 5 500 results you
can see actually you get very high
precision you know this is that's a good
job picking out only the images that
will be relevant to the user so then
fight for this user you know 232 two of
the five hundred were relevant at zero
were irrelevant and so down even to
problematic cases like beetle you still
had maybe seven well one panel relevant
but still very high precision meaning
there are very few poor false positive
results results of the systems thought
were about beetle bug but we're actually
bad beetle car or something else but if
you not look carefully is actually so
precision is great but we call is lower
low few meters actually are come come
back to the search so that well no
problem rather than filtering by your
first level your friends how about
filtering by your friends and their
friends friends so we actually enlarge
the social network that you're filtering
with and actually the social network
blows up a lot so you go from if one
level you have only 700 users after you
expand the social network two levels you
have tens of thousands of users so it
actually you know and you do get
improved prequel which means how many of
the 500 images were actually returned to
you but you do it by precision does drop
relative to filtering by first level
contacts still you get much higher
precision than and recalled in an
unfiltered search you get between nine
to sixteen percent average improvement
in precision and improve the precision I
think is what you're interested in you
will be there's so much information out
there your best to filter through out
information as long as you display only
the relevant information to the user all
right so but that's again so that's
that's like I said it's kind of a little
trivial idea because it's very easy to
filter yeah
if you have a contact that means that
you have very similar because if I take
in Tiger and my contact has pictures of
lots of pictures and tigers then you
gotta use I information about his or her
apartment and apply it well that's what
I'm saying I'm kind of assuming this
will motivate that people's context have
similar tastes to the user itself yeah
and and that's and it's actually born
out by the extremely high precision you
actually get in there but this room
people generally add contacts you know
photographers whose work they like they
have I mean there's many different
reasons people add contacts you know
they want to keep track of friends and
co-workers but if they're going to add a
stranger to their contact list that
somebody whose work they like you know
them but there's a lot of information in
this links that we actually going to do
more work in this context links you know
favorites links and so forth but the
second part so in addition to contacts
or maybe instead of context because that
was a very simplistic idea but those the
users added told you that users add tags
to images and they had titles their
descriptions they are the other images
to groups they're all this other textual
information about the images with which
we can exploit and we can do similar to
how describe this delicious work we can
build a probabilistic model that trains
on large set of images to find the
hidden topics contained in the
collection of images so integral to find
well these images about wild animals is
there a set of images about house cats
and so forth and then we can do the same
thing given a user user has a photo
stream that has tags in it so we can
also find the topics that are just the
user and then we can filter the search
results and only present those that have
similar on the topic that is of interest
to the user ok so again we're going to
have a model tagging as a stochastic
process so this plate corresponds to an
image has a user who created this image
and there's some hidden topics that
users interested in and based on these
hidden tapas user generates a set of
tags that the user signs to the
particular image and given a collection
of many images with this text we can
find what are they hidden what are the
small set of topics in that city
and and here I'm actually showing you
what so we train on this 5,000 image
images from the tiger very set will run
this algorithm only with 10 topics we
have to set manually it have to say well
there's only 10 topics in here and i'm
showing you the highest probability tags
within each of these topics i'm only
showing some of the 10 topics so for
example topic one has text like this is
the highest probability text within this
topic sorry tiger zoo animal nature
animals wild so start to see that this
actually these are tags associated with
the wild animal you know the first sense
of the word tiger topic 2 for example
has this is some group names actually
but also has flower butterfly macro
yellow swallowtail early so this is the
tiger lily sense of the of the of the
war tiger this one is also very good i
should cat kitty cute kitten cans orange
eyes tabby this is all about house cats
so all the descriptive words that
associated with house gets this one is
also very good on Apple Mac os10
Macintosh screenshot when a Mac os10
tiger operating system and the here's a
kind of catch-all not quite sure what
the topic of this is but that's what
everything else that was not in those
topics gets end up in this last topic
now we just disabled will we have this
model in the satyrs k is 10 let's the
only thing the fix and then we run this
and it finds you know it finds what the
probabilities should be to divide this
between 10 topics you know that's it all
right
it waits with topics here yeah this is
strong showing of the top 25 highest
variability so there was actually her
ability with each of these and
decreasing motifs so this is the most I
mean this is the first past the tiger
cruise across all of them which is not
it's not a very good tag because it
occurs in every single image so we
should we shouldn't even included but
you know it's it's promising and nasha
flickr offers something like this kind
of static they has clusters they use
them to cluster if you're doing
something a little bit more
sophisticated than pure clustering okay
and so if you do the same thing now if
you take for this individual user and
just show the results the images that
are in the same topics that the user was
interested in in tech space here's the
precision recall and so then we rank the
images the 500 images according to how
relevant they are to the user and then
looking at top 50 of those images how
many of those are relevant and how many
are irrelevant so if you look at top 50
you get very high precision 1.0 for
example for the new print wary but in a
low recoil permits are equal but the
precision that remains very high across
that if you now look at first step 200
images that are ranked by our method and
see how many of those are relevant how
many other ear elemental bit sense of
the word you can section precision stays
relatively high it equal actually gets
up to one-half so it's pretty good and
now if you look at just our Precision's
defined you know told you out of the 500
there were 337 to pull relevant to
declare is so we look at the top 337
back images and see how many of them are
relevant and irrelevant you get and
precision recall for this one are equal
so you get 90 get actually eight to
forty two percent in improvement
precision which is pretty good so
filtering by tags actually so yes so
look it does contain enough as long as I
tag my images it does contain enough
information about my taste do it like
that but there are actually other ways
also people who don't tag their images
and there are still lots and lots of
people who do that the other ways to
extractors information through the
groups that they add images to or other
photographers who they favor it with an
it's I'd like to think of it as a very
complex network of users connected to
images connected to tags they're all
interconnected there's many ways to get
the same information out all right so
I've showed you that actually you can
improve results of image search for
individual user but again as long as the
user has expressed interest in this
particular topics through in the tat in
the topic of search somehow but what if
for example I'm interesting child
photography but I want to look at now
landscape images you know I'm not going
to be able to find use this approach
because I haven't expressed anything but
let's game images but flickr contains
information about the structure of the
network and connections among people too
so that i could be able to find the
community of let's go photographers and
who are the pics and a horde good
photographers within that community
there is a lot of that information there
that that's next topic of research we
are going to do should be probably
telling you about next attic so research
but yeah
like I easy tag then I'll mean something
different like it's like I used to
retire and probably a taco mac where is
it
it's ugly
so in delicious malwa here we don't
really have because in Flickr even
though many different users can add tag
the same image in generally just the
image owner tags the image but in the
delicious model there was a possibility
to have this user interest kind of so
which could yeah we include both the
interest user allow for different sense
for different users have this is
different senses of the same words so we
can lecture might change the model
proposed model for that too laughter so
this is top it based like social
networks and you can actually add some
sort of really describe the links on
social networks that actually said I
don't think many people have looked into
that at all how to introduce semantics
to deal in social networks and that's
something else are you interested in
alright so next I'm actually going to
this is this is kind of start out with a
question about social networks and I'm
going to show you how social networks
can be used for recommendation here i'm
going to introducing yet news site
called dig and and it's it was a kind of
media darling but i think it can maybe a
little bit on the decline right now but
pic is a social news aggregator and has
a very simple premise users submit
stories so the submit links to stories
define online and other users is what
name they call them by digging them so
users word on them and then they kind of
selects out of the stories that had the
most wats selects few stories to feature
on its front page and what the world
when you go to digg com you see the
front page so you get a lot of exposure
for this and their claim to fame is that
they have rather than how many few
editors decide in what should be the
front page content it emerges from the
independent of opinions of many users so
it's kind of an emergent frontage
concept and also big allows users to
create social networks just like all the
other sites and they add friends and
they have a users can add friends that's
made others as friends and then they
have a friends interface that allows
people to try to track the activity of
friends so this is a
at the typical dick page you get has
stories and here's a number of what's a
story received but the family registered
user and login to dig I'm going to also
see the friends activity i can see by
clicking here you can see that you know
65 of my friends liked or doug water
done this 64 65 stories my friends have
watered down or in the past two days or
my friend submitted 11 stories in the
past days and they can click on those
Lincoln's and only see those stories and
no other stories
life at some point before on the site
inside in front page was no longer
interesting and I had to go in like
seriously mess with the procedures for
inside one compares
they didn't like the users were selected
well I'm going to touch on briefly there
was a controversy that came out in
September's like oh there's a cabal of
top users they're like dig in each
other's stories automatically and
they're the ones who are controlling in
fact you know I just I should just
submit the paper yesterday so this is
fresh in my mind I've looked at digg
behavior over a period of a year it was
interesting there was a first of all I'm
going as i'm going to show it's not that
there was no about I mean I know if
there is cabal not but the same kind of
findings can be explained by just social
filtering that I'm going to talk about
and in any system you have the spirit of
principle you know that twenty percent
of the people do eighty percent of the
work so it's true that's three percent
of the top 1000 users very responsible
for seventy percent of the top stories
but it's true in any site Wikipedia is
the same way in a flicker is probably
the same any social any site is that way
but so but the people like so the
statistics and I said oh no you know
it's like top users there it's not
democratic if they have such
disproportionate share there was so much
acrimony trail you can see spike in
activity in September when the story
came out and then just drops you know
just this acrimony elling that users so
much that their activity like now the
tap users have like just a small
fraction one-tenth as active as the
right back down even those who stuck
around and did not leave as a result of
this controversy so it's important like
if you're going to run a social media
site you should actually keep tap users
happy because they're one doing most of
the work and if you eliminate them
you're hardly going to recover so I
think I could the number of digs big
users is growing but I think people
mostly come in contributing amount of
the stories and then never go into the
site again so the core of users who like
can sustain the site is gone and and you
know I know I can't evaluate the impact
it had in the quality of the front page
I just know impacted head and user
activity and definitely has the gland
down but quite a bit all right so let's
set our shared ink dig dig ranks users
based on how many stories their users
have promoted to the front page and it
used to be like if they stopped making
this list avail what it used to be you
could go and you can see who is the
number one user who's number two user
and you can go through and you can
actually scrape the site and find out
what stories they dug they like you know
what
is the submit that who are the friends
who are the other people who call them
friends no do you can extract the coral
social network get all kinds of
Statistics how many stories as user
submitted how many stories were promoted
how many stories the user commented on
this a lot of like I said I liked it
because it was very transparent until
actually recently and also I should
point out that social networks actually
there's this symmetry no people in the
summer a dismiss be as a friend is
watching these activities but not the
reverse so actually call user who's
watching activities a is the reverse
friend of B &amp;amp; B is a friend of a and so
i knows but also because it's so
transparent i was able to study
literally weekly or even daily or hourly
can see how what's on the story change
had the social network change and weekly
basis so I've checked 2,800 stories
submitted over a period of a day last
May and of these stories and I was so
that 98 became popular and then also I
could see out of this like then I looked
another set of 200 front page stories
and I could see the names of everybody
who voted on the story like I said it's
lovely there how much harder it's very
transparent is because you get a lot of
data like that and so this graph shows
how how what's on stories change on
select stories in this data set change
in time you can see basically have very
similar behavior a story is submitted
then it spent some time in in the
upcoming stories section of the site
which very few people go and look at and
after gets accumulate enough what it
gets promoted the front page and then
it's number of what it gets shoots up
dramatically then saturated some value
and you can see some saturate lower
valleys I'm saturated higher value and
so forth and this this saturated value
that the number what Biggs or what
saturated I called story story
interesting as obviously it's higher you
know it's more interesting to general
user general population the deck and
because I've been looking at this data
set for such a long time and you the
users by their first name basis
centrally notice that the tap user we're
submitting stories that were kind of in
the bottom here and these users are
forgetting the most interesting stories
were unknown or and unranked users and
as you can do it even more kind of
scientifically and do a scatter plot of
the kind of the final
number of what's received by a story
versus the rank of the user and the
lower the rank the more high rank the
user is the more influential the user is
and you can see from this that the set
is divided roughly in half where 50
stories come from 14 users with average
entry interestingness of 600 which is
about on this side you have half of the
stories interesting is about twice as
much so the lower rank users were
contributing more interesting stories
here so top users are not submitting the
most interesting stories so why are they
so cap what makes them so tap and I
think it's because social filtering
explains why this is successful because
users express the preferences through
those social networks and then they use
this social networks to the friends
interface to filter the vast stream of
new content that comes in big daily and
they only read stories are generally
just read stories difference and submit
so I'm going to analyze two claims that
users tend to like the stories their
friend submit and users tend to like the
stories difference like because they can
see was see my stories my friends
submitted and see the stories my friends
that and this is just a show the turtle
networks networks to exist on deck it
consists number of friends for top 1000
users in one weekly data set this is the
number of friends they have versus
number of reverse friends they have our
users for watching them and that direct
lines are the top 30 users so you can
see they generally have large social
networks and this particular user was
Kevin Rose was the founder of dick so he
had you know if you go like when he
explains how social network friends work
and big sigh go ahead add me as a friend
so people do 20,000 people have added
him as a friend and watching him so
that's why he's all the way up there
alright and this is how social filtering
works suppose user here this user
submits a story the story becomes
visible to all of his friends so the see
the stories my friend submitted
interface as these friends read the
stories it becomes too visible to
through to still more piff users through
the see the stories my friends that part
of the interface and so on it propagates
through a network so as more users with
the story it becomes visible to many
more users to the social social networks
thing
alright so here's here's the plot that
shows for the 34th I took two hundred
front page stories and then took a look
at the names of all the users who who
dug the story and I compared it to the
social network of the submitter and this
the blue line shows the size of the
social network of the submitter whose
scales given on the side you can see
that these two hundred stories about
half wooden half was were submitted by
users who had substantial social
networks and hyper submitted by unknown
users and the red line shows how many of
the friends that the story how many of
the submitters friends tag the story so
you can see and to get this number is
purely randomly by chance if you just
assume users would purely by chance on
the story you can compute with the
probability as an average probability to
get this observe this kind of numbers
purely by chance is half of a percent so
this is not happening salen likely to
have happened by chance and it's not
happening by chance that's happening
because users actually use the friends
interface to to navigate dick and you
can look the same so this is the first
part of the claims the users tend to
like the stories friend submit second
part the claim that the users tend to
like the stories the friends like and
here i looked at who ok you have first
person to the guna stories the submitted
to the store is a submitter second look
at the following people who vote in a
story and look at the their social
networks and combine it so this shows
how the combined social network of the
first first user combined session
network at the first six users comment
section Oh two votes two on the story
and so for how it grows you can see as
more people as story gets words it
becomes visible to many more people on
this line this lines are actually
shifted upwards just two so you could
see them better on this side I'm showing
how many of the users within a combined
this command social network actually
voted on a story and you can see also
this number grows and you can do Simic
same kind of Nelson see well after story
submitted by unknown users who had fewer
than 20 friends these all these have
been if you'd put your friends to get
that number of friends like Boutin story
pebbles is a half percent after five
more people what in the story the
probability that the story had received
that many of the
from france is 2% about 3% after 15
people that the story probability is
about six percent so it's getting to be
less statistically significant but it's
still you know highly unlikely to get
this it's not happening by chance people
actually using friends interface to look
through this so taps uses are
responsible for line share front page
stories for a reason you know there's no
wonder that three percent on top to top
1000 user-submitted thirty-five percent
of front page stories this can be
explained purely by social filtering
without involving any kind of conspiracy
theories you know it can be explained
simply by because that users tend to
have bigger social networks and they
tend to have more active social networks
let's spend a lot of time reading
digging stories but like I was telling
you before it is kind of similar finding
you know without resultant controversy
verte app users were accused of being in
our colluding to automatically promote
each other stories and they actually
changed the promotion algorithm to come
down to way down the words coming from
France complete opposite of the whole
idea of how social networks they wanted
to have people actually using the
extruder short social networks and you
know so the algorithm actually did lead
to decrease the tap use of prominence in
the front page it worked for that reason
but man I've had unintended consequence
I said you know maybe discouraged users
from joining social networks actually
here I show actually similar analysis of
interestingness of stories after the
change in Audrey's was made and you can
see stories tend to be more interesting
first of all you know Sony third he also
looked at the first 7270 page stories
and like there's fewer duplicates coming
from stories come from the same user
like single users are less tap users is
less likely to have multiple front-page
stories only 36 from 24 rather than 50
stories from 14 users and also tend to
be more interesting so you know 960
words versus average what's with 1200 so
it worked that but might have had
unintended consequences like alienating
tap users and actually seen that
happening or discouraging users from
joining social networks I've seen that
happened to a little bit but user stuff
that had dropped others users from their
friends list after that and so the
question is actually can be studied this
more systematically then just making
algorithm and run it in Austin see what
happens and designing collaborative
rating system or any collaborative
rating system which exploits the
emergent behavior of many independent
users is very difficult because small
changes can lead to big consequences
even the type of the promotion algorithm
can affect what kind of front page you
get emerging them and right now there's
very few tools that actually help people
work this out and rather than people can
execute that's what did they executed
see how system rounds over a period of
two weeks and then make tweaks and
changes of that and there's no way to
explore the effects of these changes
design changes beforehand and this is
what I'm going to show you the first
part of the last part of my talk which
is collaborative mathematical analysis
of collaborative rates and systems you
know can be basically can be explore the
effects of promotional algorithm before
they implement it and I can't actually
can use mathematical analysis though I
should understand and predict the
emergent behavior of this collective
large-scale collective systems and it
can be useful investigating the choice
of promotion algorithm you have and in
fact of the promotion your design
choices have on story timeliness
interestingness using incentives to join
social networks and so forth and then i
create a very simple mathematical model
they describe how what some stories
change in time and this model is
parameterize by just two corpora has
parameters story interestingness
basically what is the probability a
story will receive a what if it's
visible to some user and its visibility
actually only cuz the comm signal it
will receive what if it's visible but by
what makes it visible well it gets
submitted so it's visible upcoming
stories pages and as new stories are
submitted its visibility decreases
because it gets pushed down further
further to done list it also invisible
in the front pages but as new stories
are promoted gets pushed down and so the
visibility decreases that gets pushed
down to page to page three poof so forth
and it's also visible through the
friends interface peace through this see
the stories my friend submitted and see
the stories my friends dog and you can
express all these mathematically in this
one this is just interesting us and the
visibility and actually all of these
quantities I can determine from my from
my previous data set and there's only
two parameters that characterize the
here are the solutions of the systems of
equations which is the size of the
submitters social network s and the
story interesting this R and every other
parameter can get from the data so this
shows actually this is the same almost
the same it's like similar data to our
show you before this is actual wats
received by actual stories on deck and
each story I applied by the social
network size of the submitter of the
story so these stories were were
submitted by people who had only five
friends and these stories were you know
this story was submitted by P people had
100 160 friends and this plot shows
basically solutions of the model for the
same social network sites but different
values of r and you can see that you
know the stories submitted by this more
highly connected people are have only
interestingness of 1 point 1 and point 2
whereas so it's submitted by less
connected people have story interesting
this point 8 and so high interesting
value and you can explore it much more
systematically basically say what is the
minimum social network size required to
promote a story of a given interest in s
to the front page and has this form so
you know if you have social network size
of two thousand you can only your story
has to be only point zero five percent
internist and interesting as to be
certainly in just a bit promoted whereas
if you have you know very small social
network your story has to be very
interesting odor get promoted
well how do I can but you can look at
the number of digs just digs made by
users so yes top users they responsible
like thirty percent of the Biggs as well
so they I should do do a lot more
digging and more unconnect like
low-ranked users not connected just like
sure but they also help in there also
helping other users discover less
interested now is because they're like
they're doing a lot of the work they're
spending some users were they were
rumored to spend out 14 hours a day like
glue collecting of Eden story so they
actually provided yes they're providing
model benefit they provide a lot of work
they're like lifeblood of the site and
sure they're responsible for decisions
just because they're advanced were doing
the opposite opinions yeah and also like
the time that they make the story to
promote the story actually the more
interest in the story is the last time
it takes to be promoted me I saw it in
this that as well actually the more
interesting the story the facet was
promoted less interesting the more time
it took promoted and you can also study
for time it takes you know for a given
our interestingness and ask for
different types of our promotional
basically can study the effect of the
promotion algorithms to on story
interestingness on the timeliness just
before it is implemented and which you
know they could have done it to see how
to design a system better and interest
in this of time well I can just blazed
through this is very short but also like
I said big used to rank users by how
successful they weren't getting stories
to the package so the user ranked number
one had the most front page stories and
this shows how the rank evolved in time
from july last July to basically may
have no actually gets februari of this
year and you can see some users actually
the user number one user actually
managed to stay number one now the user
came in like five hundred and quickly
like submitting a lot of stuff and
getting promote making friends and
everything he made his rank down to two
and then he actually disappeared from
this he stopped posting the spirit on
the system other users just ranking of
30 and can graduate drifts up and this
the brain dynamics going on and actually
could construct it a model that
basically has a very simple model that
uses rank but I should use the number of
front page stories as a as a substitute
for user hang up something's telling me
I should be done by the name is I can
construct a mathematical model that
actually very accurately qualitatively
actually qualitatively predicted the
with the evolution of user user rank
unlike sorry so these kind of systems so
nice thing about is because these are so
large large scale systems each user is
basically acting kind of independently
based on kind of simple inputs from the
friends you can actually treat the
systems mathematically and then you know
study their behavior and more
importantly optimize the collective
behavior of the system with mathematical
analysis and if you ever come back I'll
just conclude my talk with some insights
because just saying that this is
exciting to Musa so actually okay thanks
so this is actually just good this is
actual user with the number of front
page stories Kyle change in time and
number of such houses social network
group this is the actual user mrs.
predictions of the model actual user
predictions of the malic acid see this
users step was seen after the sometime
submitting news stories and and there's
actually no free parameters this model
very simple model but explains a lot of
the qualitative behavior ov of users and
use a rank on deck and okay so just you
know this is even though there is pins
I'm a little bit of prior work and kind
of using collaborative effects of people
like for example collaborative filtering
like and Netflix and Amazon they're
finding products to recommend because
other people have like this kind of
products you know but that's all very
good but this actually offers you a lot
more this is a lot richer data set we
can actually add people not just you
know you can give opinion on people and
not just products or bits of information
you can annotate a lot of data so in
their everyday use of the websites users
are creating large quantity of data
which which we can exploit to get all
kinds of new information out so I
believe this actually does facilitate
new ways of interacting with information
we can actually use other people to
filter stuff out
rather than yourself and it leads to new
solutions to all problems or maybe in
the new problems and as i like to say
well like you know this is the google
approach versus the aqua pro chewy now
instead of constructing ever clever
algorithms to solve problems we can
exploit the hub we can harness the power
of collective intelligence to house all
the similar problems and one thing i
just want to point out is basically well
in the AI Semantic Web was very popular
although now it's basically declared
dead but there was a lot of excitement
went was first introduced because the
idea was like you can take web page or
any kind of document you can annotate it
with some concepts and then computer
programs will be able to automatically
access that and use it to solve
different types of problems for you and
this is what was really like people got
it you thought it was next killer app
for web but then as of right now I think
actually make Tim berners-lee kind of
declared that it is indeed dead and
there is no diapers because it was just
to complicate you couldn't get people to
agree in the same formal semantics
concepts from annotating things supposed
to costly it was in specialized training
but the web like the social web offers
another project will go towards solving
state province called the Fox on me so
this text I described before you can
look at those texts also kind of
informal classifications that many users
are constructing so if you look at that
not just a single user but you look at
large quantity of users and this class
is little informal classification
systems they have created maybe you can
actually extract some sort of focus on
your classification system and then use
it to annotate documents to enable
computers to interact and understand
together and like it before instead of
connecting data the web now connects
people and I do think it will lead to
new applications new solutions and here
I'm organized actually here will find
out I'm organizing a symposium in social
information processing and it's going to
take place in Stanford in March a part
of a triple a series so especially
encourage people from the mountain view
to attend I want to get some people from
the industry to that end it's all
because I think a lot of interesting
stuff in this area is happening outside
of academia and like in companies like
Google and gakuen many others right
thank you
you
