Google University and Google University
School of personal growth and I'm happy
to introduce dr. Emmett Miller today he
will be speaking on balanced stress and
optimal health the title of his talk is
self healing through mind-body medicine
this is the first talk in our new
personal growth speaker series the
school of personal growth develops
Googlers as whole human beings and we
offer four curricula mental development
emotional development holistic health
and they are being and what we call
beyond the self we have lots of exciting
new programs coming up including our new
search inside yourself program which is
a very successful mindfulness based
emotional intelligence course that was
started by Meng dr. Mira's innovative
thinking has revolutionized the field of
health care he is one of the originators
of holistic health in the field of body
mind medicine he's a physician scientist
musician poet and master storyteller
whose multicultural heritage has given
him a unique perspective he is a
graduate of the iBot Einstein College of
Medicine and his practice spends nearly
40 years during which he has served as
lettre in preceptor and learnt that
worth today at Stanford University the
University of California and other
prestigious universities and medical
schools if you ever heard a guided
imagery or meditation tape on CD you
have probably benefited from his work he
invented and marketed the first of such
programs in 1970 combining music nature
sounds and his unique voice to produce
relaxation and appealing his processes
and products are used by top health care
organizations and health professionals
business people perform US and elite
elite athletes including or the Olympic
team he is the author of many books
including deep healing which came out I
think in 1997
and thousands of these audio and video
tapes and you have a folder on your chip
he has always followed the room Roman
rule those who do not believe a thing
can be no I'm sorry
he has always followed the Roman rule
those who do not believe a thing can be
done should get out of the way of those
who are doing it okay sorry
so I'm I'm sure you will enjoy his humor
and intelligence and discover some
powerful new tools to bed and stress and
create health and success so please give
a warm welcome to dr. Emmett Miller
Thank You Monica thank you
works well I'm I'd like to thank Monica
and dr. Trevor and to thank Google for
inviting me to be here speaking on
stress is something I've done for a long
time but I I realized that this was
going to be a special occasion when my
secretary told me last week that nearly
half of the people who be witnessing my
talk are actually going to be laid off
within the month but then it turned out
that wasn't really Google that was a
different country different company
they told me that I had to get people's
eyes out of their computers and Men put
me up to it okay so I'll take it to a
little scene it's a dark night it's out
on the ocean
it's very stormy very foggy and the
captain's out on the bridge of the ship
and it looks off into that making out
through there through the mist he sees a
little light and he's getting closer and
closer so he turns to a signalman and he
says a signal to change your course ten
degrees north signal changer course ten
degrees north a weights and a little
light blinks back change your course ten
degrees south I says I said I'm a
captain change your course ten degrees
north captain United States Navy change
our course ten degrees north light
flashes back seaman first class change
your course ten degrees south
he says signal I'm a battleship change
your course ten degrees north like I
said back I'm a lighthouse change your
course ten degrees south a stressful
experience for the captain but what's
the source of that stress what was the
source of that stress can anybody tell
me expectation exactly there's a
different way he could have approached
it where it wouldn't have been that same
level of stress so we talked about
stress when I talk about stress what
comes up for you what is stress in your
mind so volunteers
louder please having a physical reaction
okay go ahead someone else the
unexpected what else what is stress
something that's unwanted good more
disharmony mmm-hmm good one more yeah
I'll say a little bit more about exactly
what that what that stress might be but
there is one message that I want to get
across to you about stress if you
remember nothing else remember this
stress is not what happens to you stress
is something that you do with what
happens to you and it's because people
don't understand that that they often
take exactly the wrong approach to
dealing with the stress that we all have
in our lives
let me say a little bit about myself I
came into the field of medicine and the
field of health care and a rather
unusual route I was a mathematician my
real interest was in point-set topology
I really enjoyed how to transform one
space into another mathematically the
other thing is I'm one of the early
early computer programmers having begun
with Fortran four back in 1962 but one
of the things that brought me into
medicine was an interesting experience
that happened to me when I was in
studying biology I looked underneath the
microscope and I saw for the first time
the one celled animals that were living
there I had never really seen that
before
this is a Paramecium actually this is
two paramecium's doing something called
conjugating in which they exchange
information between each other and so
enrich each other's lives and when I
look at these one celled animals
underneath underneath the microscope I
felt a strange kinship to them they were
alive and I was alive and therefore I
had some kind of relationship to him and
everyday whatever we were studying
biology I kept following up on all these
little microorganisms that I had a
little Bowl on my desk and later on I
studied comparative anatomy in
embryology and that's where I saw the
similarity of all of life starting from
the very first life-forms up through the
vertebrates up through the mammals and
through the the human being I could see
this gradual development this gradual
expression of this incredible life force
making itself more and more available
until of course against the crowning
achievement which is the human being
with our brain with our ability to
visualize things that are not actually
physically present which thereby gives
us the ability to create things do not
yet exist and one of the interesting
things about all forms of life is they
must maintain balance from that very
first life-form
if balance falls off then the life force
gets weaker and pretty soon symptoms and
pretty soon illness begins to occur in
the animal everything from the first
living cell all the way up through the
human being homeostasis is crucial that
we must maintain balance so that if the
the if the membrane of a Paramecium is
injured then that Paramecium has to
close that membrane so that it can
continue to maintain an environment
inside that is balanced with respect to
the outside world and it can pump ions
in and out so that it can empty its
waste products take in oxygen and so
forth and about so therefore maintain
maintenance of life requires healing and
healing is by my definition essentially
restoring wholeness or moving on
to a higher level of wholeness and
completeness in order to do that then
the Paramecium and every other animal
has to continue to sense what's going on
within it has to continue to sense
what's going on outside and it has to
have a way to respond to what's
happening around it and what's happening
inside without that it won't be alive
very long then I became a physician back
in the 60s and the fascinating thing and
the reason reason then I went into into
medicine was after seeing really having
this this sort of breakthrough this can
show of awareness of life then I looked
at the field of medicine because and
when you get to a certain point in
mathematics everyone becomes very dry
very interesting people and I'm a person
like to sing I like to dance I like to
play music have fun most mathematicians
didn't really like that but here was
this field of medicine and whereas every
other field of science that I had
studied had gone through a
transformation in which we realized that
the world no does not really resemble
the Newtonian Cartesian model very well
that since Bell and the Einstein at
Heisenberg
we realized we needed a different model
for the world and yet the field of
medicine still was looking at things in
the old way the field of Medicine
thought that people were simply
collections of parts if a part breaks
down then you just fix that part and
everything is going to be fine and so we
got more and more specialists and we
have specialists they deal with every
part so it's not even a heart specialist
there's a specialist who deals in the
left or Rick Euler appendage and and
that's all so you have more and more
specialists and every specialist knows
more and more about less and less so
ultimately you know absolutely
everything about absolutely nothing well
what I began to realize was that there
was something that people could bring to
the party that medicine seemed to be
unaware of I began to notice that when I
worked with my patients if I was talking
to a person about their knee and what
they needed to do in order to take care
of an injury if I placed my hand on
their knee and if I just visualized in
my own mind that person's knee being
well and instead of just talking to them
about the different things that they
could do to help this knee heal faster I
would begin to speak to them talking to
them about what they would be able to do
in their lives how well they would be
able to run how comfortable they were
going to feel and my patients got better
much faster than they did before I did
that so I then decided I was gonna take
another look at medicine and some
colleagues of mine this is around 1970
69 70 we developed the concept of
holistic medicine where we saw the human
being as a system kind of like Russian
dolls nested within each other so I'm a
whole system and in order to but in
order to operate I need all of these
subsystems within me I have organ
systems that need to be operating well I
have my circulatory system I have my
respiratory system I have my skeletal
system I have my muscular system I have
my immune system I have my digestive
system and I need all of those in order
to really function well to be whole to
be healthy to be happy and to achieve
what I want to achieve in life and each
of those systems is composed of groups
of organs and each organ is a sub sub
system and each organs contains cells
and so forth down the line systems
within systems and in the same way I'm a
whole individual but here's my daughter
over here and if my daughter is sick or
unhappy she's back there if my daughter
is sick or unhappy I don't feel quite so
whole anymore because I am an element of
another somewhat larger system called my
family I'm an element of another system
called the team that I work with at work
and my team is part of a larger
system which is the company as a whole
which is part of a larger system and
ultimately we are up to the level of the
planet as a whole that's how a holistic
viewpoint focuses on the process of
developing wholeness and healing so what
I want is deep healing which is for each
level of system to be operating
effectively and efficiently and
operating communicating well with
systems that it's a part of as well as
the systems below it information flows
from the lower levels of system up and
must come up and be clear and then
control flows from the upper systems
down of course as you move up the
hierarchy there are emergent qualities
the most exciting one of which is
awareness consciousness that leads to
the potential for still greater
wholeness which we then call creativity
I realized that most of the illnesses
that we have in the world now that we
have to deal with are not traumatic
diseases I don't know when I've seen
tuberculosis I haven't seen malaria yet
rheumatic fever you don't see unless
you're in a specialized trauma unit most
of our problems are not caused by bullet
wounds or stabs most of our problems are
caused by the way that we react to the
things that are going on within our
lives our bodies react in such a way as
they produce illness and disease within
our emotions react in such a way as we
become unstable this instability causes
us to not be able to think as
effectively and efficiently as we want
our creativity and our productivity
begin to go down those challenges in our
lives our way of reacting to them causes
us to not take care of our relationships
so now we begin to create problems in
that system of which we are a part which
of course then comes back and creates a
problem for us
what we see is the result of people not
eating well which is not a problem here
at Google from my from my tour it's like
eating - well the problem people don't
do the exercise the way they should
why not that doesn't make any sense to
not exercise people drink more than they
should drink they smoke when they
shouldn't be smoking and on and on and
on these are the illnesses that we are
approaching but the way we're
approaching them is using an outmoded
paradigm because the medical system I
found was treating things the way the
rest of our culture did according to
this old paradigm this bipolar paradigm
of duality to say if there's something
wrong there's something bad and that bad
thing is at fault and we should attack
that thing that's at Paul at fault and
so off the field of medicine as I found
it you treated with drugs or you treated
with surgery you are against something
antibiotics antimalarials
antihypertensive
whatever it might be anti muscle spasm
so you're constantly looking at it in
that way but you cannot see the totality
of the human being in that way
there's an old Sufi story about the ants
and the pen some ants are crawling along
a page and they discover some writing
and they say well this is strange look
like a whole bunch of ants run together
and pretty soon they find a point of a
pen and they go ah
now we know the cause for that writing
and then they move on and they find the
pen they find a hand moving the pen says
now we know the cause for that and then
in time they discover the wrist and the
arm and the shoulder and so forth and as
the saying goes it by proceeding in this
way one at some point the ants may
discover everything there is to know
about the mechanics of writing but by
proceeding in this way they will never
be able to understand the meaning of the
words that are being written and this is
the situation I found medicine in in the
1960s in the 1970
I said ok this is for me we just need to
bring in some new information and we'll
have the same transformation in the
field of medicine as we had in all the
other sciences that gave rise for
instance to atomic power because you
can't dis explain atomic power using a
Newtonian model of the universe and so
forth and there was some things now that
needed to be addressed in medicine that
can only be discovered if we shifted to
this to this new paradigm so most of the
illnesses that we suffer from whether
it's physical emotional mental
behavioral or relational are really dude
how we're dealing with the world not the
little story story of a samurai who came
to see this wise man in Japan said I've
come to see you because they say you are
the wisest in all of Japan and I want to
know the answer to a question he says
very well what's your question he says I
want to know the difference between
heaven and hell the wise man looks atom
starts to smile starts to chuckles it's
you a samurai somebody who goes around
killing for a living you get really
ticked off he draws a sword and says
prepare to die monk the old man says ah
that is hell miss my gos they says and
that is heaven it's right there it's not
last week it's not next month it's right
now that's the truth of it and it's how
you look at it that makes the difference
your perspective well in order to be
healthy our Paramecium has to continue
to sense its internal state it needs to
know whether it needs oxygen it needs to
know whether it needs more glucose it
needs to know whether it is what where
its acid-base balance is and so it is
cleverly designed with sensors within in
order to reveal that information
to read the information and then be able
to respond to it it's well-equipped and
every animal is at least all the way up
to us but what's happened really in the
last few years or the last few centuries
if you work maybe even last couple of
thousand years is this enormous growth
of what we laughingly call human
civilization and what we've created is a
world where we are surrounded by
pressures and stresses that Nature has
not yet had time to deal with if human
beings are still around maybe a million
or two or three years from now we might
have a sensor within that says okay your
stress level is getting a little bit
higher and then we would have some
response mechanism that would tell us
what to do but we don't have that now
therefore those the only people who are
really going to be able to survive and
thrive and do well are those who are
able to use this conscious mind the
conscious intentional part of the mind
to address those issues that as yet
don't come bundled with the system that
would that we get we do have sensors
within hold your breath for a while and
your sensor will say hey your your acid
you're getting more acid in your blood
that's the first Drive that makes you go
to have to take a breath but if you hold
off for long enough then pretty soon
they're so sensitive says now you don't
have enough oxygen after a while there's
a sensor that will tell you you need you
need more a higher level of blood sugar
so you have these sensors within but we
don't have that stress sensor and just
as you need to build a sensor if you
want to discover whether or not there's
too much mercury in your salmon or too
much radiation coming from the ground
under your house you have to use
something that's created by this level
the conscious intentional level of your
mind so then what is stress
a scene at the vet thing that's has
something to do with stress dog is
feeling it the end we so we talked about
we talked about that
that process of evolution
hans selye is the one who came up with a
concept of stress stress is the
nonspecific response or reaction to a
perceived demand and he and stress
itself is an intangible thing maybe the
best definition I heard of for stresses
someone said stress is the internal
tension that you feel when you tighten
up your muscles to keep from punching
some jerk in the nose when he really
deserves it no way that's not a bad bad
definition maybe not general enough but
stress itself is something that's
intangible we cannot see it directly
because we don't have a sense or we can
only tell the stresses there by its
symptoms in the same way as you can't
you can't watch an atom or electron do
something you can only see its trail on
a film you can see its footprints but
you can't see it directly but we can see
we know that stress is there as a result
of the symptoms that we see within most
people if you ask them what stress is
they seems to have some idea and can
answer that question for you but if you
look at their lifestyles you often find
that the way they're living their lives
it doesn't look like they really
understand what stress is or somehow
they don't care what stress is or maybe
somehow they're not fully informed about
how dangerous it is to allow this to
continue to accumulate within and and
the funny thing about stress is it's not
something that comes on in you get bang
and it's really painful because you
don't have a sense or but it builds up
and it accumulates within you and we
think we can get away without treating
ourselves well but that's it's like the
summer I heard of who took a course in
psychology and decided he wanted to
train his horse to live on on less food
so every day when he put the feed bag on
he'd give him a little less food a
little less food and everything was
going well as he tells a story but then
he says you know right at the point he
got him to the point where he was
trained to live on
o'clock the thing up and died on him
right at that point and that's what
happens to us we continue to deny
ourselves too long and then we don't
achieve we don't get what we need so
what had happened was Hans Lu was told
that for every symptom for every damage
within the body there's a specific cause
for every symptom for every illness
there's a specific disease but he found
in working with lab animals that no
matter what stress stress or he placed
on the animal he would starve the animal
or he'd give him poison or he would run
the animal too fast in a on a treadmill
or he would give the animal and
infection or frighten the animal or
expose him to cold no matter what he did
he always found that there were lesions
that were the same they were bleeding
into the adrenal glands and so forth
within the body so he went to his
professors and he says well wait a
minute this seems to be a response to
too many different things and the
professor said well we're not interested
in that we're only interested in damage
to the body that comes from specific
things and that's where hans selye began
his work to talk about and discover what
the stress might be and he came up with
what's called the general adaptation
syndrome which means that a person's
going along at a certain level of stress
nobody's ever completely stress-free
except kind of like when you're sleeping
almost you're stress-free because you
need a little bit of stimulation some
demand or your whole system just falls
asleep and you probably know if you're
if you're reading a book is a really
dull part of the book you could barely
keep your eyes open you get to an
interesting part and you're right on it
so you have this level then alarm comes
along and that is a signal to your
system there's something threatening
there's a demand that's being made on
you then you go into this alarm phase
everything gets called out the muscles
tense up different organs of your body
react different way
she begins to secrete adrenaline muscles
tighten that sort of thing your immune
system goes into action because your
system doesn't know what's going on it
just knows there's a demand and it
figures out what the problem is and then
it says oh I see what it is we've got a
streptococcus that's beginning to infect
us so it's it's okay the rest of you
guys go home the immune system I just
need you natural killer cells I need you
and some b-cells won't you come out and
then at that point this fades away
because you don't need it anymore
because now the person with the answer
to it is working on the problem just
like you well at least I've got somebody
in to fix whatever's going on and then
you come down you recover and you're
you're back to back to normal again so
so to see how things happen in this way
I say it's a good idea to look back
again as you see I always take an
evolutionary approach to things because
if you want to understand how we work
inside you're looking at other animals
and looking at our evolution can give
you the most most important information
so so what we want to do is let's go
back to a time that's that's really
early on let's back to the days of the
caveman so here's a caveman he's fast
asleep in his cave
pretty soon the sun's coming up outside
and the birds start chirping tree tree
creeped he's a very relaxed kind of guy
he doesn't you know not many predators
are after him it's a pretty easy life
and oh it's morning in a stomach so whoa
whoa whoa he begins to he doesn't know
he's hungry but suddenly he begins to
think about these blackberries there
were almost fully ripe yesterday down by
the water
oh yeah and the flowers are so pretty
this time of year so he's getting
stimulated now oh yeah then he remembers
there's this little cave girl that
usually comes down to bathe in the
morning now he's really interested so he
goes out and he's walking along but his
systems calm and he's happy and his
Smiley's thinking positive things so
it's not paying too much attention to
himself to his environment and suddenly
he hears a noise and he looks and he's
just walked between a hippopotamus and
her baby not a good thing to do not a
good thing to do and the hippo starts to
charge him so at that moment all of
those thoughts about the cave girl goes
away the stomach no longer growls for
food because the body shunts the blood
away from the stomach the blood pressure
goes up the pulse goes up respiration
goes up as he begins to pump out as much
carbon dioxide as possible
because this is the fight-or-flight
reaction he's either got to fight this
hippopotamus or run away which one does
he choose that's a easy question that's
easy that's why we're called Homo
sapiens because you choose to run and so
he's running and he feels anxiety inside
and his mind is racing it's racing it's
thinking about every hippopotamus he
ever saw and he sees a tree and he
thinks of every tree he ever saw his
unconscious mind does that anyway and he
realizes he's never seen a hippopotamus
climb a tree so he climbs up the tree
and hippo mado hippopotamus comes and
kind of roots around at the trunk a
little bit and kind of walks around and
he realizes a thing can't climb trees
so his creativity saved him the stress
was necessary to bring out this
creativity but now he's sitting in the
crook of the tree and now he calms down
again
his breathing slows down his muscles
relax the hippopotamus wanders away
forgets all about him he begins to think
about the cave girl again and the
berries he climbs down the tree and goes
about his business and that's the way
things used to happen back in the old
days but we're no longer there we leave
live in a different environment and
today today's caveman is not awakened by
the chirping of birds and light coming
through the window is lucky if there's
any birds left in this neighborhood now
already I can't believe it oh don't
forget to pick up the sour tone-tone so
today oh no she wants me to go there I
don't want to have to go there and a
stress level begins to rise and then he
gets up he realizes oh my god I have
that presentation this afternoon and
I've still got a glitch in the program
so he begins to tense up and he's
running downstairs he runs his tune to
his teenage daughter who says that I'm
getting my nipples pierced
today and this stress level runs up
people and higher and he runs down he
has a cigarette and drinks a cup of
coffee each of which raise up that
stress level within him even more he
went down they jumped in his car drives
out onto the freeway there's no
hippopotamuses but there's Cougars and
jaguars and pintos and Hummers and
18-wheelers and he hits working there's
three new things on his desk and bosses
step into my office a very different
kind of environment from the kind of
environment that our bodies were so
efficiently and effectively evolved to
deal with
the result of that obviously is the
imbalance the first kind of stress don't
make me put the bone back in my nose
acute stress is finite short-lived the
demand comes from an easily identified
source it's in the present it's not like
oh there may be a hippopotamus next week
or you know have you seen the Dow Jones
what happened to hit the pot of no it's
not like that it can be resolved by
analyzing being creative reacting
immediately usually through some
physical activity which is why retained
stress shows up in our body as physical
disease so often so here is the stress
recovery cycle just a little bit change
but almost the same as Hans Lu comes up
here's where there's a demand what we
perceive to be a demand that doesn't
mean there's really doesn't mean there's
anything wrong yeah you're sitting at
night you're alone in the house you're
reading a great mystery book
everything's great and suddenly you hear
the door behind you and immediately in
your mind you remember oh there were
three robberies oh yeah and you know and
you know somebody got really beat up in
one of those robberies last week maybe
that's somebody coming in the door
behind me your pulse goes up you start
to breathe like that your muscles tense
if your body gets ready for fight or
flight and you spin around to find out
it's just your cat that's pushed the
door open coming into the room so you
just suffered this increase in stress
even though there was nothing wrong it
was all in a sense all in your mind it
has to do with perceived demand now so
do you perceive a demand then there is a
reaction and then an interesting thing
happens down here
have you ever almost been like an
automobile accident or your car spins
out
something like that what's the first
thing to do when you realize I'm alive
and everything's okay that's what you do
and for a minute or two you don't do
anything else the same where the caveman
just took a break that's what happens
here this is called a relative
refractory period every organ in your
body works the same way your adrenals
work that way and that's why you get jet
lag because you're trying to go out and
do some work when you're in a refractory
period your heart beats and then it
relaxes and if you're trying to
cardiovert someone if you give someone
shock in the emergency room if you shock
during the refractory period you can
throw them into a fatal arrhythmia
you're not supposed to be doing things
when when you're down here try
swallowing fast six times in a row and
all of a sudden you can't because the
stress of swallowing is followed by a
relative refractory period how many of
you have had sex no I'm just kidding if
sexual you see it's the same thing there
is this rise in stimulation in erotic
tension there is orgasmic release and
then unfortunately there is this
relative refractory period that some of
you may have noticed it happens if you
can go through all the organs of the
body this is the way it happens and it
happens for us overall as individuals as
teams as companies as nations and
planets we have to restore that that's
the piece that's the crucial piece so
here's the caveman here is his encounter
with the hippopotamus okay a couple of
days go by oh there's an avalanche huh
but we got away no problem
Oh an invasion by the tribe next door
but we fended them off and so forth so
it keeps changing but there's always a
chance to recover and therefore you
maintain right along that balance line
that's why cavemen are always so happy
now we get to the 25
century I just copied this one from
Reuters a couple of days ago that people
who felt stressed by 9/11 had twice the
number of cardiac incidents three years
later that as heart attacks raised blood
pressure and so forth the stress of our
day that you're glad you don't work
there now here said this is a meteor now
this is this is a stressful situation
but it's short live well miss me well I
guess that's it because the meteors
never fall twice in the same place so
this can actually now be the most
relaxed guy in the whole neighborhood
this is type 1 stress no problem going
out boating this is a stress is this a
type 1 or type 2 stress well if this
little blonde lady manages to get out of
the car it could be just a type 1 stress
but if she makes this mistakes an awful
lot then she'll have a lot of stress
that she carries around with her and
then there's the the news that we have
to encounter every day so this is the
world that we have we just insecurities
lots of things are pressing on us lots
of stresses
this is employee of the month not here
of course but this is what the world is
dealing with so 21st century stress
accumulated stress its future-oriented
its intangible it's primarily social
stress sores and the thing that happens
is the stress or the stress is what you
do with what happens to it there's no
clear response you know there's no clear
response you know should you get out of
the stock market or should you buy while
everything's low it's not clear and this
stress accumulates within us we do well
for time and then we crash very
different from from the type 1 so here
is our 21st century caveman you know
here he wakes up and this is the
daughter with a nipple piercing and
there this is where it goes on and at a
certain point you begin to get symptoms
now if you measure with the sensitive
instruments that we have now even here
you can detect that things are off
balance that's called medically we call
that a sign you have a sign of something
going wrong then we get up to here
and we call these symptoms because you
can actually experience them go
high-tech here and so for this
particular person they first notice some
tension the next thing they begin to
notice are headaches next thing they
notice they're snapping at people next
thing they're having trouble sleeping
next when they become allergic to the
next thing they get an infection that
doesn't go away and so forth and this is
what usually brings us in to see a
doctor to see somebody to say I'm
suffering from a disease of stress of
some kind how many diseases are related
to stress I tried to just list a couple
here yeah just a couple just a couple
there's a lot of them there's a lot of
them in fact it's really kind of
difficult to find a human illness that
isn't either caused by stress or made
much worse by poorly managed stress
the stress reaction then is being
mediated by a part of our brain that is
not immediately available to us to make
a really really schlocky metaphor it's
like that stress is that something that
happens with information it is there on
the harddrive and you can't hold all of
it in your RAM you can just get a little
tiny window of what's going on there but
really it's that unconscious part of the
mind the one that has evolved for all
these millions of years that's carrying
this out whether or not you feel
stressed is not only due to the fact
that something's out there but also how
you're interpreting it how you're
interpreting has partly to do with what
you've brought to the situation
genetically partly to do with your
beliefs what you've learned in your life
and that that is all stored in your mind
that is what interprets what's happened
and will interpret things as being Adam
and the things that ordinarily save us
now these reactions of the unconscious
mind actually make things worse
here's why if if a muscle sustains a
little bit of injury let's say you stick
it with a pin or something like that
muscle contracts right and that's normal
and usually that saves us but let's say
what's going on is this person is under
a lot of stress so to speak a lot of
pressure and they're working and working
trying to finish this thing trying to
finish it trying to finish it and they
tense the shoulders muscles like that
and they stay tense and they stay tense
well eventually this prevents oxygen
from reaching the fibers that are in the
center of the muscle those fibers of the
muscle begin to show damage they begin
to release prostaglandins which are
irritants which create pain stimulus to
the muscle so what does a muscle do what
muscles are trained to do that contracts
that produces more damage more
stimulation more contraction and until
you get a real spasm and then you're in
trouble
okay that's and physically it's
same way whether it's whether it's your
irritable bowel syndrome whether it's
your gastro esophageal reflux whether
it's whether it's indigestion
whether it's asthma whether it's low
back pain and on and on and on they're
all diseases of muscle tension and the
stress response makes them worse so
let's let's take something like
overweight I met a woman who was very
sensitive about her weight she felt that
because she was heavy that that meant
she was no good she felt rotten about
herself and she got depressed and when
she gets depressed she eats and then she
stands in front of the mirror and she
looks and sees that things are getting
worse and she feels even worse about
herself and she eats even more and she
looks worse and so you get the vicious
circle in that in that realm as well and
so forth and so you can go through each
of these and I really don't have time to
do all that you can read more about it
in the book but it's those automatic
stress responses that happen and and I
say they're automatic when you think
about it it's like I'm going to speak to
you and let's say before I get to speak
to you I say you're here because you're
interested in what I have to say you're
good people you're not here to do
anything bad to me you're not gonna
throw tomatoes or anything more harmful
than that at me so I'm really safe right
here my body is in no danger but
beforehand will they like me oh no what
if I what if I forget my lines what if I
what if I fall off the stool what if the
computer doesn't work what if I don't
have my power and so I have stage fright
or I have social anxiety so at the
conscious level I know that it's okay at
the conscious level I know okay we
finished that problem we'll see we don't
know if it's going to work but in three
weeks we'll find out whether it worked
so I don't need to think about it
instead I'm up all night oh I hope we
don't fail oh no what if I do I'll get
fired and and so even though we know
what we want to do there's a part of us
that responds in this other way create
creating the tension so this is where it
was very useful that I understood
computers because I realized that the
human mind is very much like a computer
like a bio computer it's very complex of
course but like any computer the best
way to deal with a glitch or malfunction
is to figure out how to teach the
computer to analyze itself and to repair
itself or to tell you what to do and so
I developed what I called software for
the mind this was in the nineteen
seventies nobody knew what software was
they thought it was like buying a rake
with a handle that went one morning
morning like that instead of being a
rigid rake so the goal was to find a way
to consciously and intentionally number
one be able to pay attention to what's
going on inside to develop a way to
sense what the level of stress was and
number two to be able to respond to that
stress that's inside in other words we
need to learn how to speak the language
of the unconscious part of the of the of
the of the mind and it's different if I
if I say to you if I have a child and I
give the child you know an ice cream
cone chocolate ice cream cone I say okay
now don't spill that ice cream cone on
that beautiful white carpet and make a
great big brown spot that'll spread and
never come out
that kid is very likely to drop that ice
cream cone not because they want to but
you've created that image in their mind
and their mind will just go and do it
it's true some of you ski out your
skiers you know like you're skiing say
you say you're skiing through the woods
right
you've between the trees and your
there's two trees and now a space
between them what do you look at you do
not look at the tree you look at the
space between the tree because if you
look at the tree you're gonna hit the
tree that's the way the brain works it's
simple so you know it also reminds me of
there sorry about this fellow who goes
to get a job as a as a lumberjack he
arrives in the foreman says okay here's
your chainsaw we're cutting this forty
acres here starting today what you do is
you cut your trees down cut them into
sixteen inch lengths stack the wood up
I'll be back at the end of the day see
how many cords of wood you cut and you
get paid on the basis of that the guys
is fine the foreman comes back at the
end of the day the guys cut down one
tree he stacked it very very neatly it
was cut down well but only one tree and
he says have you been goofing off all
day and he looks the Kies drenched with
sweat exhausted the form asila maybe
there's something wrong with your
chainsaw he takes the chainsaw it's
girls what's that noise that's the way
it is for us we don't remember to pull
the chain and for us the pulling the
chain is restoring that recovery period
this is so magical this is so magical
just to be able to do it to understand
first that it's important to do it
number two understand what damage is
going to happen to you if you don't
learn to do something like that number
three to develop a technique that you
can in fact do that for yourself
so here's a little bit of practice with
the brain what what I realized is let me
just ask you to join me in an expert
experiment I want you to think about a
helicopter and I'll think about a
ballpoint pen
now think about think about the little
toe on your left foot think about the
Statue of Liberty become aware of your
breathing listen to the sound of my
voice it's very easy for you to shift
from one thing to another think about
them all at the same time not possible
not possible so therefore even though
the mind has enormous selectivity it has
a very small capacity over any given
period of time the quality of the
thoughts that you have during that five
minute period of five day or five year
period those thoughts create images in
your mind and the images that you create
in your mind will then affect the
unconscious parts of your mind
that's brain language brain language is
imagery so I think we just have a few
moments left so what I'd like you to do
one more experiment with me and that has
to do is let's see if we can restore
that little recovery period okay so let
your body be seated comfortably and if
you haven't felt a lot of stress in the
last few days you can imagine that you
have and that now you're giving yourself
a moment to sit and do something about
it and with your eyes look at some point
in the distance focus your eyes on that
as though it's really important to do so
and as you do you'll notice that
everything else in the room fades off
into a blur and that's good because the
only thing that you want your mind
focused on is what you are intending for
it to be focused on and then become
aware of the fact that at this moment in
time there's no other place that you
need to go
there's nothing else that you need to do
and there's no problem that you have to
solve and therefore you can give
yourself permission to relax and as you
do that you may notice your eyes begin
to give you signals that they would like
to close and if it feels more relaxed to
let your eyelids close close them now
and behind your closed eyelids let your
eyes gently roll upward till you're
looking at the back of your forehead and
imagine that they're on the back of your
forehead you can see the word relaxed or
if you like you can imagine an image
that represents relaxation for you
imagine that you can relax your eyelid
muscles all the way down to the point
they just don't want to open at all and
when you feel that relaxation in your
eyelids gently test them and as you test
them let the relaxation from your
eyelids flow throughout the rest of your
body imagine little ripples of
relaxation flowing outward from your
eyelids into your forehead and your
scalp feel the muscles of your face
relaxed as your jaw muscles relaxed you
may notice your upper and lower teeth
gently drifting apart
let the relaxation flow down into your
neck and your shoulders and as that
happens you may feel your shoulders
gently falling away from your ears a
little bit every little relaxation of
your body is echoed by relaxation of a
neural complex within your brain let the
relaxation flow down through your arms
and your elbows and your forearms and
your wrists and your hands down to your
fingers and as that relaxation reaches
the tips of your fingers you may feel a
kind of a a warmth or a tingling or a
pulsation notice how it feels
and then when you feel that relaxation
in your fingertips take a deep breath in
draw the relaxation from your fingertips
up into the center of your chest
now as you let that breath out let it be
a feeling of letting go completely like
a balloon letting go all the air
and then let the air do the breathing
for you
with each breath imagine your breathing
and relaxation
with each breath out imagine your
breathing tension out of your body feel
your chest back
and your lung was relaxing let that
relaxation flow down into your abdomen
and your lower back feel the rising and
falling of your abdomen like a gentle
massage of relaxation to all your
internal organs but that relaxation flow
through your pelvis relaxing all your
pelvic organs down through your thighs
and your knees your legs and your ankles
and your feet
all the way down to the tips of your
toes
good and become aware of the fact that
at this moment in time there's no other
place that you need to go there's
nothing else that you need to do and
there's no problem you have to solve and
therefore you can give yourself
permission to relax even more deeply
and double your relaxation no matter how
relaxed you become you can always become
more relaxed to do that in a moment I'm
going to ask you to open your eyes and
close them again and as you do feel your
relaxation doubling over what you have
now open your eyes and close them good
and feel your relaxation doubling see
that little symbol of relaxation on the
back of your forehead and when you can
feel that double relaxation in your
eyelids gently test them and as you do
that the doubled relaxation flows
throughout the rest of your body warm
soothing peaceful feeling all the way
down right out through the palms of your
hands right out through those soles of
your feet
as your body grows more relaxed you
become aware of the unnecessary thoughts
being generated by the unconscious
levels of your mind unnecessary thoughts
because there's nothing that you have to
think about
unnecessary thoughts are like doubts
concerns worries comparisons judgments
thoughts about the past about the future
you don't need to do any of that right
now in fact right now you can become
aware that the past does not exist
not even one second of the past can ever
exist again and therefore you're
completely free
to let go of any unnecessary thoughts
about it the future doesn't exist either
and never has everything that exists is
right here in this moment in time and
right now at this moment in time you are
in the only place that you can possibly
be and you are the only person that you
can possibly be at this moment in time
and so you can allow yourself to be a
piece
justice at peace as if you were at a
very very comfortable place maybe a
beautiful place in nature maybe a place
you've been before unless you'd like to
go to
and you can imagine yourself on a magic
floating through time and space and
imagine yourself perhaps at a beautiful
beach
maybe you can feel the sand beneath your
feet see the color of the sky and smell
the fragrance of the ocean feel the cool
breezes the warmth of the Sun or if you
like you can go to a mountaintop or to a
beautiful garden filled with colorful
flowers you can be surfing or skiing
wherever you might like to be any place
far far away from anything that could
ever disturb you and any time any
unnecessary thoughts come along imagine
those unnecessary thoughts are like
words written on the blackboard in your
mind's eye then as you test your eyelids
imagine you're drawing a wedding racer
across your mental blackboard erasing
the unnecessary thought and sending
another wave of relaxation flowing
throughout your body another thought
comes along
you may race it in the same way
more and more relaxed and more and more
comfortable and notice your breathing
breathing in and then there's a letting
go and then there's a little pause after
you breathe out and before you breathe
in again let yourself sink deeply into
that pause it's the quietest time of all
for all your mind and body
and as you erase unnecessary thoughts
from your mind you begin to notice fewer
thoughts and more spaces between your
thoughts let yourself sink deeply into
those spaces between your thoughts and
imagine yourself in a very peaceful
place place far far away from anything
that could ever disturb you and think to
yourself the words I accept myself
exactly as I am with each breath out I
accept myself exactly as I am good and
become aware of what you really care
about what has meaning in your life what
do you value deeply
and do you feel a sense of mission in
life does your life have a purpose or is
it meaningless and if so become aware of
your purpose
and become aware of those that you work
with in your work team and think about
the common purpose that you have with
them think about what you have in common
with a company that you work for think
about what you have in common with all
the people in all sentient beings on
this planet and perhaps beyond
the more deeply you can be in touch with
those the more of a commitment you will
feel within yourself there are three
things that protect against stress the
first is being committed a second is
having control which you do now because
anytime you notice stress building in
your life you have a way to come back
into relaxation and the third is you do
not see obstacles in life you see
challenges and for you challenges are
opportunities to bring forth your skills
your gifts your talents imagine yourself
going forth in life imagine yourself
seeing your obstacles merely as
challenges that you enjoy overcoming
imagine yourself bringing forth the best
that is within you and imagine you can
see an image of yourself in the future a
year from now or six months or one month
as far as you'd like to go see yourself
looking completely happy and healthy
dressed the way you'd like to be dressed
doing something you'd really like to be
doing in a very pleasant place step into
that image and become that person feel
how it feels and as you do you're
letting the deeper levels of your mind
know what your goals are letting the
deeper levels of your mind know who you
are and what you want to work for and to
move towards
good now keep that feeling with you and
bring yourself back to an awareness of
the space around you here in this room
I'll just count from one to three do it
gradually one reorienting to the day the
time of day two
be aware of your surroundings 3 when you
ready let your eyelids open take a deep
breath in let it out and take a moment
and notice how comfortable you feel
good
okay so that was a little high-speed
touch on what we're talking about in
terms of that place of relaxation for
some this was easy for some it was
difficult if it's difficult nothing that
can't be overcome with a little bit of
practice practice makes perfect
do we have time for questions well I got
a little mixed up on my time which is a
stress that I go home and torture myself
about tonight but thank you all for
being here
hope to see you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
