for some time Casey was my student two
years ago so I'm going to start with a
quiz because just to give you into the
right state of mind and I'm going to
show you seven pictures and I'm going to
ask you what's common to all seven and
these are pretty diverse picture so here
we go here's the first one so just look
carefully at what it is you don't need
to give me an answer right now this is a
second one there's a third one this is
the fourth one is five six and seven all
right so I'll do it again slowly bit
just because you guys look all totally
bewildered you're supposed to Google
people smart guys so figure it out
here's number one here is number two two
three here's number four here's five
here six and here is seven so any
anybody want to try take a guess I'd
what it is you sorry you missed the quiz
you'd like to ask your friends later
it's possible if it's my quiz it's
possible yeah so any anybody want to try
so I'll tell you and I'll put names to
it so that's an that's an avalanche
that's the Berlin Wall you know that
that's the Xerox Alto the first PC this
is a Len Kleinrock with the InP which is
the first node in the ARPANET in 1969
this is a map of the Balkans just before
World War one this is well that's
capital baikal marks and that's a boy
plugging a dike in Holland it's a
sculpture of a boy plugging a dike in
high in the Netherlands voice yeah it's
a sculpture it's a famous story about
Hans Brinker this guy put a thumb in the
dike to prevent it from collapsing so
okay so
there you go now you know why is the bus
so these are all things that happen just
before a tipping point to go back to the
beginning this is just before the dike
broke you know this guy was kind of you
put your finger in because if he let
goes the whole dike is gonna collapse
this set off the Communist revolution
enough said
this is the quadric egg of Europe the
Balkans before the World War one one
assassination in Sarajevo 1914 cause you
know seven years of misery to millions
of people in Europe this is the
beginning of the internet the first nor
the Internet message processor and
somehow you know in 40 years you cannot
build the entire Internet infrastructure
this started the PC revolution this was
a Xerox Alto which had WYSIWYG the WIMP
interface in the windows icons Mouse
pointers and this is the Berlin Wall
rearrange the map of Europe and this may
rearrange your face if you get caught in
it so what's important about all of
these what's impressing is that this is
what it looks like basically this is
accumulation of energy or potential
inside the system okay and it reaches
this crux and at some point a small push
the straw that broke the camel's back is
going to cause an energy minimization
with a large release of energy you can
call this equivalent of nuclear fission
if you want or all of these other things
they all have this notion of ingrained
concentrated large energy which is then
being pushed over and my analysis is
that actually three things going on this
notion of internal contradictions you
know Marx talked about the internal
contradictions of capitalist society and
similarly in a dike you know the dike is
keeping the water mass away you know the
Berlin war was was separating a nation
which was artificially split okay so in
all these cases internal contradiction
plus external pressures there's some
external pressure which comes from
wherever and adding to these two is a
technological push there is something
that extra technology that causes the
whole thing basically
party so what I'm going to argue is the
electrical grid has reached us okay and
I'm going to now ask you to hold this
thought in your mind for just a few
minutes well I tell you what the grid is
and they'll come back to this explain to
you why I think there's going to be a
major change so let's start what is a
grid like so this is like a you know
idiots guide to direct Racal grid and
what we have is basically on the left on
the on my left on the left hand side we
have sources of production so we have
coal so dominant source of production we
have nuclear and we have hydroelectric
these are dominant sources of production
pretty much in any country you can also
add in other things like natural gas and
so on which I haven't really shown the
second component is called transmission
that's all the wires that you see over
here all over the place transmission and
these are long long distance and then
finally we have distribution where the
distribution corresponds it basically is
a substation that blocks over there and
then the wires going out to each house
its distribution and those are the three
components of any electrical generation
system generation and transmission and
distribution now the problems and the
inherent contradictions and external
pressures are apparent from this
beautiful figure which comes from the
Lawrence Livermore National Lab in the
US and it shows in 2008 how much energy
was used in quadrillion btus called
quads and you can see that it's a sort
of a spaghetti and I don't know if it's
all visible but I'm just going to walk
you through it on the left hand side is
generation and the right-hand side is
consumption basically and left-hand side
you can see the yellow box on top is
solar point 0.09 BTUs nuclear is eight
point four five hydros 2.45 so the boxes
are not to scale but the lines are okay
those thin lines are to scale you'll see
right away right away it's jumps out
that the big black generation boxes are
coal and petroleum okay coal is 22 quad
quads and petroleum is 37 quads and
these are basically carbon okay now most
of the petroleum is actually going to
transportation that's your diesel and
your transportation we're ignoring that
most of the coal in fact
90 plus percent of the coal is good
electricity generation that walks on the
on the top over that is using thirty
nine point nine seven quads in 2008 so
electricity generation is dirty it's
based on coal at least in the US the
second biggest component is natural gas
or which is closely followed by sorry
they can second is nuclear closely
followed by natural gas but if you take
coal and natural gas basically a pumping
carbon into the atmosphere like crazy
okay so electricity is not clean it's
very dirty that's the first big takeaway
the second big takeaway is actually
absolutely bizarre it blew my mind a way
to see this off the electricity
generated which was forty quads give or
take two-thirds or more is wasted only
twelve point six eight or a forty quads
that orange star the grace that was just
waste its wasted in generation it's
wasted in transmission and it's wasted
in distribution
no transmission buses in the US are not
very high about seven percent the
transmission less than other countries
are very high in India transmission
velocity 25 percent ranging up to 43
percent in some areas generation losses
are because mechanical conversion of
mechanical energy to or nuclear energy
to electricity is inefficient okay you
can approach 40 50 70 percent but it's
still 100 percent even nuclear energy
which is kind of this energy of the
future all you're really doing is
boiling water okay I mean at the end of
the day do all this crazy stuff in this
boiling water it's like a tea kettle on
steroids okay you're wasting a lot of
energy you're wasting huge amounts of
energy is a gray bar so those are two
takeaways one from this picture I would
encourage you to actually look at this
picture and study it because you will
get a tremendous understanding of the
energy system in the US which is similar
to other countries now it's not the same
example in Japan in France 70% comes
from nuclear okay but then nuclear
anagram is unclear what do you do with
the wicks okay here is the third fact
according to testimony at the hearing
and November 38 last year by the
Commissioner of the Massachusetts the
part of energy 15% of generating
capacity in Massachusetts
that's a lot of billions of dollars is
needed fewer than 88 hours a year okay
it's only buildin at the absolute peak
summer okay lesson one percent of the
time so you're building this enormous
capacity and you're just not using it
it's crazy this is what I mean by
internal contradiction this is what Marx
was all upset about okay and so am I so
let's look at the structure of the
system in terms of internal
contradictions and external pressures so
to begin with the technology is ossified
okay the last clever stuff done in the
grid was about 100 years ago okay after
Tesla and Westinghouse and Edison pretty
much anybody with brains moved on to
somewhere else like cars interesting
fact Henry Ford used to work for Edison
in Edison's electricity plant in Detroit
and then he quit inside of the car
manufacturing firm it was still around
so smart guys left including Tesla who
died penniless in 1943 terrible okay so
rising energy prices we are seeing a
diminishing of coal and natural gas and
not cold with oil and gas diminishing
resource Peak Oil means rising energy
prices that's an external pressure
energy security if all the Sequoia Liz
coming from Middle Eastern countries
where you know you're propping up
dictatorships in order to get access to
their oil invading them as the case may
be it's not particularly secure so
that's an external pressure inefficiency
enough said global warming okay carbon
footprint is going to be a problem is a
problem and once carbon taxes go in
which is absolutely unavoidable it's a
problem okay so we are seeing tremendous
pressures on the grid from the outside
and in internal exec uestion over there
yes it is inefficiency is coming down
but not as much as you'd like so the
question was it's an efficiency coming
down it and I think it's because many of
these inefficiencies are built into the
way they produce electricity and built
in the way to distribute things how many
splices you have working to transform us
you how long your lines are things like
that systemic inefficiencies that are
very hard to actually get rid of but yes
they are coming down I'm just saying the
inefficiency you could live with
inefficiency when the cost of the inputs
is low when the cost of inputs goes up
you can't tolerate that anymore just cut
it out so what's going to bring it down
okay the structure of the energy it goes
up and then something happens it falls
down so what's going to bring it down I
believe seven things are going to change
so these are the technological push
factors the first one is renewable
energy okay more than a trillion dollars
of investment is going into renewable
energy around the world just you name it
solar wind geothermal Google is
investing in basically putting in high
explosives done a big pipe you know
shooting down water and pulling up steam
okay five kilometres down anywhere in
the world you can shoot energy if you
throw a bomb eight kilometres down
anywhere in the world you'll get hot
water okay it's as simple as that all
you need to do is dig a hole a climate
is deep and you're done same thing with
tide rule people are building these
snakes which kind of float and then they
go up and down and as they oscillate you
know you just have this energy from
there it's being done of this coast of
Scotland for example wind of course is
is happening communication so this is
sort of at the heart of what the rest of
the talk is going to be about but if you
can overlay the infrastructure with
communication able to actually know
where the inefficiencies are if you can
tell the homeowner look if you don't
turn off if you turn off the AC right
now even though it's hard you're going
to give you $200 you can save two
billion to all this perhaps okay it's
not necessary that everybody so right
now I'll just give an example of this
ASHRAE is the American Society of
heating refrigeration and air
conditioning
and they have policy 55 which says the
set point in a building should be
between 20 degrees in 26 degrees
centigrade and this middle point is 23
degrees and every building in North
America if it's a triple a class office
space it's set point at 23 degrees
throughout the year okay
right now it's 23 degrees in pretty
measure that I know okay
and in winter it's 20 degrees in summer
is 23 degrees do you really care whether
it's freezing outside you're willing to
wear a sweater because you want a
sweater to come to work anyway but
ASHRAE will not permit you to put on a
sweater in winter because you want to
keep it at 23 degrees if you can
communicate in a big sign saying look if
you guys are willing to wear a sweater
to come to work in the middle of
February we'll give you $100 bonus you
could save a lot of money that's
communication
okay now this lot more - I'm just giving
some pragmatic examples over here other
thing they said yeah yes yes rejected
energy basically means energy that's not
used and once you heat a car cars engine
by driving it where's that heat going
it's rejected
that's waste that's waste also you could
be putting a hamburger on it and you
know having a having a burger when you
drive home I will recommend to you the
radiator grill cookbook it's actually a
real book you just put your burger in
aluminum foil stick it in your car drive
home it's done I'm not making this up
and there's even stuff to do the
roadkill which I won't go into
ok so energy flows right now are
unidirectional basically everything is
coming down into your house but if you
had a solar cell you could push it back
out again so that's another technology
it's changing basically so looking at
diodes you looking at by directional
energy flow storage is a big deal you
know Bill Gates you know talked recently
said something absolutely amazing his
heat gun and gone and quantified it he
found that the total amount of energy
storage available in the world today is
equal to 10 minutes of worldwide
production
okay that's it so imagine that yeah the
amount of storage available for YouTube
was 10 minutes of production
okay you can see that something is out
of whack so lot of investment is going
into storage in many different ways
ultra capacitors nano nano buy batteries
with nano molecules in them these rooms
this size absolutely black you through
the air with this enormous big
gyroscopes which are spinning like crazy
and you know when you buy day with the
Uni when you have a cheap energy by
night energy panda you spin it up and
the day you draw it down okay people are
doing that yeah yes so storage here
basically means for the most part
storing electricity during off-peak time
okay natural gas of course is storage
but it's hard to create it right so so
but whereas all of these other things
are our reversible reactions well under
the cheapest ways is to pump water up
and down so it goes back up when it
comes down again right so people do that
as well
compare compressing air is another thing
you can do so all these technologies for
storage are coming in technological push
factor I just think storage is coming
metering is coming in smart metering
almost all of you by now have a smart
meter on your house I do what you may
not know is it forms a secure WiMAX mesh
to communicate with the local utility to
tell you exactly to tell them exactly
how much electricity you're using every
few minutes or every few seconds I don't
know this muting interval is now we
don't have access to the data as
homeowners but this is being collected
so that's happening plug-in hybrid
electric vehicles this is a big deal and
the reason is very simple the amount of
energy you consume in a day is
approximately 20 kilowatt hours okay for
a typical North American home 20
kilowatt hours the Chevy Volt has a
battery in the capacity of the battery
is 20 kilowatt hours if you buy a prize
one of these plug-in hybrid once they
vote for kilowatt hours with the full
all-electric cars basically a one day's
worth of storage
which means if some disaster struck in
you cut off your electricity for one day
you'd be fine as long as you could use
your car
plug it in but other interesting things
open up over here which is what happens
if you have two neighbors and one has a
lot of carbs a backup and I've seen the
car other one doesn't or it's a hot
they and your home for whatever reason
you can use your car you can actually
use this storage okay so P HEV is just
another form of storage that you are
buying on behalf of the electricity
company basically okay so you're you're
you know debt to the car loan companies
paying off the electricity bill okay so
that's very interesting product another
part that is interesting is that you can
actually carry energy in your car and I
can give you energy I can see oh you're
running short here I'll give you one
tenth of my battery and you drop it off
in the driveway and you can actually
create energy this way so that's
changing and that's really a big deal
just to give you a sense of this the
amount of energy density in a
lithium-ion battery in this laptop is
greater than that of dynamite okay look
it up energy density energy per cubic
centimeter in a lithium ion battery is
greater than dynamite okay why they
allow you to take it on a plane is
beyond me
and finally high-voltage DC and super
conduction they actually building
transmission lines between Philadelphia
and New York which are super conductors
they have no resistance whatsoever they
are cooled down to whatever it is 240
Kelvin or whatever to make it work so
these are things that are changing
changing the electrical grid okay and I
won't have time to go through all of
them and and neither do you but this is
the bottom line this is what it's going
to look like in the end at least my
visualization instead of coal we're
going to have wind farms and solar farms
and hydro will stay there and it at
these substations those orange boxes
you'll find next to them I have shown a
large battery this could be fuel cells
Ballard which is a Canadian company
based in Vancouver has got these large
fuel cells they're pretty big and you
can use them to produce electricity
recently this is company out of Silicon
Valley if I get the name right now who
said they've been powering eBay using a
fuel cell as well so that's happening
the nice thing is you can store start at
night and release it so you can smooth
out modulate the energy so that 15
percent of capacity that you were
wasting you don't need to build out
anymore because your peak to average
ratio has gone down essentially and also
in each
house we expect to have solar and wind
why is it antenna has the most
aggressive and most forward-looking
energy policy in the world including
Denmark in Germany it's actually quite
amazing okay you if you put a solar cell
on your roof you'll get 82 cents per
kilowatt hour
okay let's the feed-in tariffs no matter
how much you consume every kilowatt hour
you produce get 82 cents if you work out
the math you get a loan from the bank
for $30,000 and you put in a solar cell
in your roof you will actually make 16
to 22 percent rate of return on your
money which is way more than Scotia that
is going to give you okay and I'm not
making this up okay you can go to Sun
garden comma Sun garden let's see I
don't remember and they will work with
you to put a stuff when you put the
solar cell in your roof or you can go to
st. jacob's farmers market on Saturday
and next in peddlers village is a guy
who's sitting there who will put up
solar cell for you ten dollars a
kilowatt hour so it $10 like a watt
kilowatt $10 so what
so kilowatt is ten thousand dollars and
you know you can get money back so you I
worked out the math you basically if you
understand your house more than six
years you're going to make money
hand-over-fist six years from now you
pay off in six years so this is going to
change what's happening here you'll you
will see full-page ads in the paper very
soon and predicting like next few weeks
you'll see ads from banks saying come
into our solar program you'll take the
you'll put this on your roof and you're
gonna get make money it's like having a
renter except it's cheaper and the
quieter so this is going to change the
way Ontario rooftops are going to look
like dramatically in the same way that
if you write drive through rural Germany
everywhere you find windmills why the
same thing you know it's cheap you make
money on it yes
yes right yes right right so there are
obviously issues with respect to this
now there are people who will put in a
complete off-grid system with local
storage lead acid local store is not
lithium mine
the theme is too expensive right now but
the regulations are changing in fact the
biggest probability herd will be having
Ontario right now is not the hydro
company it's insurance because they're
saying a parking a BMW on your roof
30,000 bucks
what if somebody steals it when you're
gone on vacation I mean it's non-trivial
problems so yeah some of these things
have to be they will be crossed because
there's tremendous energy stored up you
know at the pun okay this is my
prediction the next decade will
determine the structure of the grid into
any 120 okay so what the grid is going
to look like in a hundred years from ten
years from now 100 10 years from now
look we will decide what's going to
happen is okay what's going to happen so
what are the problems okay I painted
this vision but there's lots of problems
okay I'm going to just mention a few
things one big problem is suddenly
instead of having 150 sources of energy
okay or 200 source of energy which are
the coal plants and nuclear plants you
got tens of millions of sources
everybody and their brother has got a
solar cell on the roof and that's
exactly what the Palo Alto problem
constant because they want to control it
but they don't know how to control 10
million sources okay this is a big
problem okay because you want to
maintain reliability you want to
maintain what's called dispatch ability
that's second thing is these sources are
not constant bit rate or constant energy
rate the variable bit rate is it go up
and down you know the Sun Goes Away
every day every night there's no Sun
whoops you know it just turned off your
power plant so what do you do if the
cloud goes over the face of the Sun you
can lose up to 95% of your energy in
about five seconds if the wind stops
blowing you lose 100 percent of your
energy in about a minute so when you
have these kinds of variable stochastic
sources the
engineers are just kind of wondering
what to do because they've never been
taught this stuff okay they know how to
do a Transformers in winding patterns
and stuff like that but you show them is
stochastic source and say we never
learnt the math for this one so this is
over-provision like crazy so the rule is
for every watt of solar you need to put
in five watts okay so this bill five
watts that's why it's so expensive one
of the reasons is expensive two-way flow
is easy but you know these are hard to
get right okay and I won't go into that
too much non-utility players basically
means you and I utilities now just like
we're putting a Wi-Fi access point in
your house you become an ISP we're
putting a solar sailer become a utility
provider but you are not playing by the
same rules as utility providers play
which is whatever API is they use for
controllability you're not really doing
that how do you get reliability we have
issues a multiple time scale this means
your control protection switching
happens at 20 millisecond time scale at
the same time we need to plan out
transmission lines which happen in the
time scale of 15 to 20 years okay if you
want to put a line between here in ovens
on for example to get wind energy from
Oban silently here just think about the
regulatory hurdles to get land allocated
to you along the way long routes works
it's a pain in the neck plus so that
happens in 15 20 years it's very
expensive at the same time to deal with
very short-term things you know the
cloud came over the face of the you know
cloud cover moved into Ontario all of us
Solar went away what do we do we've got
to come somehow get stuff in from Quebec
for example so there's a problem
incentivization how do you get people to
do the right thing okay to wear sweaters
in winter for example it's expecting it
to 23 degrees throughout the year
security well it's the internet storage
when you put storage into any system it
causes delays okay when you have delays
in control it's a mess because you have
basically first order oscillatory
behavior then you put dampener she gets
low soldier
I mean it's control with delays is a
pain in the neck and storage basically
adds delays so this is a well known
problem and control it's a difficult
problem in addition instead of the
supply changing over time the demand is
also changing over time right because
now what you're doing is you're putting
in like peak load prices oops your
prices went up
eight o'clock instead of 759 right
that's what peak low pricing is coming
into us this November I believe we're
gonna have the equal pricing or whenever
it is so suddenly your demand is
variable as well because people will all
turn off their dishwashers when the
price goes up and so suddenly the demand
sinks
so the demand is very predictable
suddenly changing as well and the other
thing is resources or remote what I mean
by that in order to replace one megawatt
of electricity from solar you need a
hundred and ten acres of land okay
you're not going to be able to do that
in your backyard anytime soon okay so
these renewable energy sources are
primarily going to be in the rural
countryside but that's not where the
supply energy demand is the supplies in
the countryside and the demand is in
Waterloo and in Toronto so how do you
get it from here to there okay it's not
obvious maybe use cars to drive it in
and finally we have the legacy we have
110 years of crud okay wherever it is
here to basically deal with that so
these are all problems and if you go
read the reports written by the
commissioners in charge of electricity
or we talked to hydro one people and so
on this is what they look like so what
can we do so now that I have a few
minutes to talk about my so I think so
this end of part one part one says
things are going to change in a big way
and there's nothing that you and I can
do other than to watch it okay I mean at
least it's going to happen I can predict
it's going to happen and pretty
confident of that
what do is we know something about the
internet and guess what what we know
what the internet matches the grid so
I'm going to go through some
similarities and differences and then
the end and sort of paint research
hypothesis what can we do okay so what
are the similarities
interestingly enough the Internet and
the grid historically started out the
same way this bottom-up at first you
know people put up their own little
lands okay or there was this van but
most people have their own Ethernet LANs
and they said let's hook it up you know
you kind of grew up from the bottom in
the same way people started building
their own electricity grids because
there was there was a windmill so it was
a water source nearby in 1881 the first
generation generation was put up in
Niagara Falls Saudi
see generator actually in 1881 just
before the grid right it was just some
guy wanted to run some machines and
caught some DC machines from Edison so I
put up a DC machine a DC generator in
Niagara Falls
so it was bottom up and then slowly they
said if you diversify sources we can
actually get the power of diversity so
let's use a grid so it will spot him up
and then top down
it carries a B must have a grid we must
have a national grid we must have this
so in the same way the internet grew up
from the bottom and then became a top
down initiative once the politicians got
into the picture they both vast I mean
they're everywhere right pretty much
especially HeLa cell phones today
Internet is everywhere because you can
carry it in your pocket you get 3G your
satellite phone the heterogeneous right
electricity grid already showed you
different kind of sources different
kinds of users it they're both critical
to society and they're both ossified in
the internet the core of the Internet is
stuck in 1973 ok this is never going to
get out of 1973 ok and the core of the
electricity grid is 2nd 1892 ok and it's
if you see a picture of a transmission
line or a generator or whatever from
1895 and you look at 1995 it's the same
thing you could guy something he was
dead 100 years
bring him back to life and say work on
this electricity substation he'd know
exactly what to do nothing has changed
incidentally if you get somebody who
died in 1950 and you brought them to
your kitchen they would know exactly
what to do other than the microwave
nothing is changed kitchen technology is
also ossified by the way so it's
fascinating how many things that were
certified I could go into a whole roof
on that but I won't
they're hierarchical ok the the
transmission core is actually a mesh
okay for all these reasons but the
distribution is basically tree-like
because we don't really care about
redundancy where is the coracoid
redundancy and the mesh like core uses
its own technology these high voltage
transmission all right in the
distribution is low voltage it's
probably you know it's in the thousands
of volts rather than the hundreds and
thousands volts so in the same way in
the internet Covey's MPLS right nobody's
is IP ok if you want to strip out all
the headers into something fast and
smooth and
leek but in the access network we used
IP so we have tree-like access network
we have hubs and very little redundancy
so this example of this this is the u.s.
transmission grid I couldn't find it one
for Canada so this is the transmission
grid as of 2007 I believe you can see
what it looks like and this is the
internet density of IP IP addresses it
was roughly similar it's pretty much
what you expect where there people
there's electricity and there's
information ok one flows energy one
flows information they are very similar
in that respect their gradient degrees
of control now you think of the grid as
being very much under control but
actually what you plug in to your grid
at home is not control you can plug in
anything you want as long as you obey
the API which is two pins or three pins
that's it as long as you have a the API
and you don't over draw a current limit
you're fine you can plug whatever you
want that's what allows innovation to
proceed in the same ways IP is a narrow
ways the three-pin plug is a narrow ways
of the electrical grid okay
and and and the control beyond that is
very very loose in fact the Internet has
more control on the edges in the
electrical grid in some ways there's
storage in both networks the storage in
the grid is far less and what you'd want
and this simple API - both of them right
- right a a pond a and the electrical
grid you build a toaster okay and that's
an app you can do whatever you want okay
and well you know how to build apps in
the Internet and they both use do
basically solving the same problems a
bunch of distributed demand sources
demands from people and the distributed
sources no generators and so on you want
to match the two so and so the resource
matching problem it's a standard
resource allocation problem and you do
whatever is necessary below Steiner tree
and you do whatever you need to do to
get things going
and finally or not trying to this is
balance of centralization and
decentralization you want to centralize
some things and then decentralize it for
example and its focus on just was one
thing in the Internet AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
and these big guys provide long-haul
transmission and then they attach to
tier twos which provide basically access
and aggregation they don't really want
to give service to every endpoint
in the same way Hydra one connects
hundreds of local distribution companies
reward will be north Hydra what will not
is not generating electricity this is
providing you access they are your ISP
or ESP if you want electricity service
provider and they are decoupled from the
backbone which is the transmission so
the same kind of two-stage things are
going on there are differences okay one
big difference is electricity doesn't
have headers okay I mean it's kind of
silly to state it but it's really very
very profound because headers carry two
things that are important one is type
and one is destination so on an Internet
I can say this packet is of type X
whatever that type is and you know it
could be TCP packet UDP packet whatever
I can put that in the header so I know
what to do with it in electricity
electronics a electron okay similarly in
the Internet I can say I'm going to send
thank you
I'm going to send electric it down this
wire and I'm going to put the MAC
address or that abscess of that host
over there and it's going to go that one
host I cannot address a single light
bulb right so if somebody is studying in
that corner I have to send electrons to
all the lights over here right because
they're not addressable only they can
control them is to have one circuit per
bulb which is too expensive right so
this address ability fundamentally
allows efficiency if only communication
in the internet was broadcast you'd be
in trouble
which is why Wi-Fi sucks okay because
that's it's broadcast and so everybody
gets everything and so it's not very
efficient besides interference
that's wonderful second differences as I
mentioned earlier electricity generation
is primarily one way whereas Internet is
more and more or less two so we have a
difference over there the time scale of
controlling internet is seconds okay you
are within milliseconds to seconds
depending on what kind of control you're
talking about what scheduling it's in
the nanoseconds if it's round-trip flow
control its milliseconds and so on and
so forth whereas in the things happen
much more slowly in the grid if you want
to bring up a nuclear reactor takes two
days to two weeks depending
okay and you know what's going on you
never have to wait to to go three
weeks to bring up a source on the
Internet you can typically do it within
seconds and then here's a very
interesting difference if you have a
fiber optic link between here and oven
sound and you want to go from you know
100 Meg link to one gig link you just
change out the lasers at both then and
you start sending more lambdas you're
done okay you can't do that at the grid
okay you long-haul transmission is a
constrained resource and you can't
actually add more capacity you know the
superconductors physically you can do
that but with all the superconductors
you're basically stuck with whatever you
have so you need to put in more wires
more copper whatever it is the Internet
is less predictable because your flash
crowds whereas the grid is very
predictable you can pretty much guess
what's going to happen so these are some
kind of differences so the bottom line
is I think of the electrical grid as
being a content distribution network for
a single video stream it's a video
stream because there's continuous
generation going on and they want to
actually distribute this so so let's
take the case of somebody trying to grab
electricity onto the car and driving it
to somewhere else it's like downloading
a file on your memory stick and going
and go into your friend okay that's the
same exact thing as downloading
electricity okay and it's a single video
stream because there are no types it's
all the same so which means if you can
start applying the same tricks we use
for CD ends for the existing route can
you come to that in just a minute so
this sort of concludes the part two of
my talk and I'll just pause and take any
questions at this point
okay so let me move on so what I'm going
to do is to make this hypothesis and the
hypothesis is that the research and
technologies developed by Internet by
the internet research in the last 40
years can be used to green the growth so
it's hungry so it's a hypothesis because
I haven't proved it I'd like to spend
the next several years proving it but
I'm going to give you some taste of why
I think it's true and then you know I'll
conclude so I must state that this is
not the same as these two other things
I'm not saying reduce electricity usage
for Internet data centers now it's great
to reduce the letters to usage anywhere
including Internet data centers but
let's face it it's only using one and a
half percent of all electricity produced
okay it's not a big deal heating and
cooling uses 40 percent of all energy to
any person for commercial to any percent
for domestic ok so if you have think
that you're far better off then
affecting the data center now for Google
internet data center is a big deal but
for the rest of the world you know
basically I don't care ok you could burn
all the electricity you want you're
really not doing much harm but every
single building every single restaurant
that keeps its door wide open and summer
with the AC blasting not they are a big
deal ok because the millions of them and
they're all completely messed up so we
need to figure out incentives to make
them do the right thing a second thing
that people have talked about in green
networking is to use internet as a
communication overlay I mentioned this
already smart metering and yes that's a
great idea but it seems to me it doesn't
go as deep as one would like you can go
far deeper by actually reformulating the
grid in terms of internet research as
I'll show you in the next few slides so
one idea is local matching so I said if
the grid is a CDN content distribution
network what is it that corresponds to
Delano what we want to do in a CDN is to
reduce the delay right we want to get
the content down as fast as possible
well the longer the electricity travels
on a wire the more transmission losses
there are because you know the the you
have I squared R is the heating of the
wire so each kilometer the electric
travels in the wire
wasting and basically wasting
electricity so minimizing delays has
some more effective minimizing
transmission laws
as I showed you earlier these losses are
filed in fairly large so what we want to
do is to perhaps use peer-to-peer
cooperative caching to reduce losses how
does this work
okay so you'll take your Android phone
and stick it in your car and it forms a
wireless mesh network with all the other
Android phones and everybody else's car
and they talk to each other and say hey
you know how much it Exedy do you have
there's so much I have you under swell
okay and you have this chit chat going
on and at the end of the day they
control the appropriate diodes and so on
and the electricity flows all from the
car through the plug into the substation
and down to somebody else and at the end
of the month you get a bill that says
you just made 200 bucks because your
neighbors all wanted your electricity
okay not bad good just because you
happen to work near a hydroelectric
power plant and they have lower rates
over there you can bring electricity to
your neighbors in your car and you could
do this I mean this is technologically
feasible today okay so we have to just
use the same ideas in cooperative
caching that we all know about which we
know about and the grid people are
clueless about okay demography is the
determination of the traffic matrix from
a number of observations you have
cat-scans
goddesses computerated tomography so you
take a bunch of x-ray images and you
figure out backwards you do a sparse
matrix inversion we figure out where
everything is in the same way the
internet tomography you look at a bunch
of aggregate points and you figure out
for the aggregate flows or the traffic
matrix was from some source s to some
destination D how many bits were sent or
some period of time so right now maybe
we can do the same thing with grid usage
we can just measure substations use
inserting smart metering perform is
there a way for us to figure out
invert the sparse matrix and not have to
meter everybody maybe you can do it
through tomography so I'm just throwing
this out I have no idea I've mentioned
this to somebody from Hydra one and they
were not immediately aghast they said oh
maybe they could do this and they
actually are going to give me access to
the data so I'll know what you guys are
doing
so as I mentioned earlier solar event a
stochastic sources a variable bitrate
sources now one thing that the internet
people have done is to model sarcastic
sources like crazy I mean I can point to
probably 200 papers on on or maybe more
2,000 papers on variable bitrate sources
or the model that I'm using any number
of techniques you know Markov modulated
Poisson processes you know order a RN
model auto regressive n models you name
it right and the big question is the
internet models always the same if I
have a hundred VBR sources going to the
link what is the probability they're
going to offer the link okay should I
accept them or not the exact analogy of
this is this you you you build a hotel
it has 100 rooms in it ok 100 rooms in
it and the technician comes from the
phone company is how many dialog phones
do you want now imagine this is the four
cell phones right so you have to choose
how many lines you have if you put one
line in for each guest room or bound
they can always call out from the hotel
right that's great but then it's
expensive if you put in just one it's
probably too low what number do you use
its workload dependent right its
workload dependent and that's the same
problem over here oops what did I do now
why did it go away but will I prove this
or the wire came out baby it was a
mechanical problem so under what
combination under what conditions is the
some of these VBR sources greater than
some value okay so probability this sum
exceeds a critical point nine and it's
five nines reliability so Hydra one
operates on five nines so they want to
say that the base load in the province
is whatever you know two hundred two
hundred megawatts two hundred megawatts
so how many sources do we need to put an
ominous order how much wind so that with
very high probability the sum of these
sources exceeds the base book okay
that's the answer they want to get and
it's workload dependent and it's
stochastic and they don't know how to do
it and you know we I think we can we
know how to do it now remember this is
very very different from the kind of
thinking you do to say let's turn off
the routers we're not being used it's
very different to saying
let's use the Internet as a
communication all well it's got nothing
to do with communication whatsoever it's
using internet thinking rather than
internet itself the later hundred
networking basically says look I have
this USB stick in my pocket I used to
have I know what happened to it
Casey has it I guess let's just pretend
here because this internet stick it has
you know thready get whatever eight
gigabytes I'll just make it up maybe
it's not and it has eight hours of movie
I put it in my pocket I walk home I have
eight hours of movie okay well maybe you
can carry energy like this you take your
laptop you know take the battery stick
it in your pocket go home and you can
run your dishwasher okay so how do you
do that so this is a very interesting
question every time I click on the link
and then using Google zooming in Google
you guys know what I did you know what I
clicked on and where I went to see you
kind of computing the the the PageRank
of the you know so another page I'm with
the you know basically computing a
profile on me what happens when eternal
life switch on and off okay that's it
click as well right now imagine the
following thing let's say I can harvest
the electricity clicks and somebody is
going to turn their AC on and in a hot
summer day when the peak load is very
high and everybody is it this newspaper
and TV is broadcasting please don't user
AC this idiot does it anyway okay what
do we know about this person they are
rich suck the socket to them you know
charging a lot of money because they
don't care okay or maybe the teenage kid
doesn't care but whatever it is you know
they're indifferent to price so the
demand elasticity they have in economic
terms is very low they're not elastic
you have inelastic demand if it's hot
they're gonna turn the AC off no matter
what these people also drive Hummers
okay probably the wrong side of the road
as well but this kind of information is
very valuable okay to companies who want
to harvest information so imagine
streams of electricity clicks coming in
from hundred million endpoints into some
data source you can imagine the data
mining possible the reason out there
so people like Ashraf or database people
should probably view this as what can
you do with this data what can you do
you know hopefully it was a social good
I don't know about Google now how do you
get somebody to turn the light off it's
a game theoretic problem you have to
make it incentive compatible you say
look if you turn the light off you save
money okay so assuming you can do this
maybe this mechanism design problem now
we know how to try and get people to not
download too many movies okay you have a
bandwidth limiter or some kind of things
from sand wine that says if you use too
much you're going to delay things okay
so this kind of thinking about the game
theoretic modeling of the negative
impacts okay a tragedy of the Commons is
very important it's a game theoretic
model okay again the kind of ideas we've
developed in the Internet can be applied
over here any kind of blackout which
means you know you lost you demand was
greater than supply for extended period
of time means more than five minutes
means you have a blackout or a brownout
where your face goes down from fifty
curricular herds you can go to 50 Hertz
or whatever that's the same as network
congestion on the Internet so
essentially all the kinds of distributed
control algorithms that we developed on
the internet for network congestion can
be used over here to give us examples of
this
what's the electricity grids analog of
TCP okay TCP says if I see a packet loss
it must be me okay it's the very I don't
know the cycle ionic term for this but
self blaming view of the world oops not
be me sorry you know it's a very sorry
behavior analog for this electricity
grid is if you overstep a limit your
circuit breaker trips off and you're not
allowed to use anymore but that's very
coarse it's very coarse it says if you
draw more than 20 amps whoops the fuse
went off then you go and do something
manually and you kind of do it because
the equivalent of FTP is a short circuit
okay that's the equivalent of FTP give
me everything right away
that's your short circuit you know we're
going to prevent that so just take your
rate limiters we have circuit breakers
we want to make it a little bit more
graceful you want to probe and say maybe
the substation has more energy I can use
more right now to charge my car maybe it
doesn't and when it back off so we want
it has this modulated additive increase
multiplicative decrease approach to
energy consumption rather than just
saying well and when you get five amps
and again if I can't get more than five
hours I'm going to shut down okay so
this is some interesting analysis that
needs to be done over here
and finally simulations so we really I
talked a bunch of people I said how do
you decide how much grid power you need
how much solar how much wind depending
on the you know the stochastic variable
variations and so on so for the answer
is well it's seat-of-the-pants there
really doesn't seem to exist any
simulation I have talked a bunch of
people about this including the green
and and these energies are at Google a
Bill while and there was a while ago but
maybe you guys have it now but as far as
I know there is no simulator so one of
the things I'm trying to do is to build
a continental level simulation of let's
say brent north america you know
simulate cloud cover simulate wind
movement simulate you know 200 cities
and the variable demands simulate the
movement of cars and transmission lines
we know exactly the transmission line
sorry I already showed you a figure
that's a downloadable data set then you
can download and run it so I have a
student who is going to be working with
me exactly on this and we're going to
try and simulate North America and see
what happens we can help us as a
planning tool again this is using
internet style thinking so I'm just
about running out of time so I'm going
to give you three thoughts first one the
decade 2010 to 2020 will decide the grid
of 2120
okay that my great-grandkids says will
be will be using and probably yours to
the internet approximately equal to the
grid it's not the same okay we don't
have headers we don't have a bunch of
different things and I believe that 40
years of internet research could should
may help at least I'm going to try doing
it for the next some years so with that
I'll end and I'll have any questions any
more questions
so I was thinking about these incentives
in Ontario you know you get some rate
for solar and some rate for wind and I
noticed that the rate for wind was much
lower than solar and it seems like
that's that's just an incentive that you
know makes it economical to build axe
right whereas in Ontario maybe why is is
the choice because you know you get more
wind electricity per per dollar invested
than solar it seems kind of I don't know
a bit wasteful to use the money on
building solar panels when you could be
when building wind turbines common to
that so I'm the wrong person to answer
that I mean I'm not setting policy
initiatives I'm just telling you the
policy initiatives have an effect and
that clearly is borne out by the fact
that you looked into it so what should
be the modelling Mike my answer would be
this I think it's an interesting
research problem from an academic
perspective at least to understand the
incentive structure of a particular
policy and what actions can be expected
as a consequence of their policy and you
know I think we should kind of play it
out and see what happens and you know
say predict that this is what's going to
happen and see if our predictions are
correct so that's what we should be
doing then yeah your your simulation
here it seems like it's something that
that is likely in the future grid to be
very financially lucrative yes in a
sense if you can sort of identify these
points where you know energy prices are
expected to fluctuate a lot in the grid
then you know you build your your agario
scopes there and that's right you sort
of arbitrage the yes yes there should be
financially lucrative that's why I said
I don't know what Google is doing right
now because if anything is financially
lucrative and has to do with information
you guys have your fingers all over it
I would not be at least bit surprised to
know there's a simulation going on and
you know 1 million computers in the
middle of Nebraska or whatever any
questions for someone on the VC before
they get cut off Oh like the whole
system it seems to like geared towards
like more like peer-to-peer incentives
so it becomes like much more sources
everywhere right and we're thinking
about how to give incentives for this
sort of usage yes but once you put like
much more power into the nodes of the
system like there is a question about
abuse and control security of this sort
of thing so if I have incentive to give
something back I can try to game the
system's yeah that you see what I mean
right so absolutely and you're
absolutely right and that's let me
restate my thesis I'm saying that the
grid is going to change not because of
these kinds of issues it because of
carbon footprint because of transmission
losses you know global warming things
like that when it's changing and
becoming more distributed these issues
will come up and my claim is that the
things that you've learned from internet
research ought to help us model and
analyze these things I'm not saying that
these problems don't exist they do exist
they have to be solved and I think that
internet engineers have something to
contribute over here ok so basically
just another thing to keep in mind yeah
remember I showed you this yeah so where
did I go let me see yes thank you so do
you have any recommendations about
places where we can learn more
information about the grid how it exists
today or the structure of again like
books websites or
yeah it's a great question there are so
they I have a website called is s4e and
I really should have put it up on my if
it is searched for is as the number for
e that stands for information systems
and science for energy and that's the
research group that I'm leading with
professor Katherine Rosenberg at unisza
Waterloo and we have a section there
called resources and in that it's a wiki
and in the resources section you will
find links to all sorts of things that
have come up including some speeches by
Bill Gates and some projects at Berkeley
for example this has been focusing on
this there are some books available
probably the best one in the internet
grid is called I think electrical grid
concepts by the X and Robin Meier but if
you send me e-mail I'll be happy to send
you a pointer to that book but there are
there are books available and this free
book you can download called sustainable
energy without the hot air that's from a
professor at Cambridge whose name
escapes me right now that's also really
worth reading as well the link to
Professor cash has a project site is in
the abstract if anyone needs to follow
up later oh good but so these very much
seemed to be first world solutions to
this but like say carbon footprint in
that you know North America isn't the
only problem so how does how do we like
this is abstract into third world
situations at all oh absolutely I mean
my focus with last seven years has been
a little development in in developing
countries and what God needs sudden
energy was to realize that the biggest
problem in villages is not lack of
communication but the lack of energy all
right and the lack of clean energy you
know cooking done is done with garden
cakes in most of India which is an
absolute horrible source of particulate
matter causes all sorts of diseases plus
those particles settled on the glaciers
and Emilie's and caused the glaciers to
melt causing floods right so what you
need to do is to basically get them
clean grid cheap grid solar wind okay so
these issues of local distribution local
generation are not just over here this
is a worldwide and if you can set up a
in fact in India is taking a big lead in
solar for LED lighting systems so you
charge it by day and then you have the
light go on at night using LEDs it's
it's a kind of a tamper proof foolproof
system that is being used in India it's
ping is in Bolivia Peru places like that
so these issues come up not the bigger
issues I'm outlining over here are
relevant to the North American context
because that's what I'm talking about
not right now and delivering a similar
speech in India in three weeks and it
will be slightly different but obviously
the focus is going to be on more local
issues but there is a big relationship
between the spread of electrical energy
and rural health actually so I think
there are those kind of issues become
relevant now you can say what is the
role of Internet in this same thing
stochastic sources right
how many villagers need to have Sun and
wind in order for us to get the baseline
electrical load for that village even if
their off-grid we need to know that how
much storage should be put what is the
sizing of the lead-acid cells and if you
over capacity if you over provision that
it costs you too much right cost you too
much so maybe you can have a siren
system that says everybody turn off your
whatever it is right now because the
grid is going to explore in your face so
I mean these kinds of things you know
may sound stupid but the early warning
system for the tsunami in South India
was actually loudspeakers connected to
cell phone' which got a text message
saying you know run for your life and
people it weren't not speakers work
really well when you live in a dense
environment it works really well so
these issues are not far from my mind
but they're not in this particular
presentation yes
so like I'm thinking like so we have the
problem basically with a current system
right yeah and like this seems like a
pretty radical change but I'm thinking
about how cost-effective would be like
changing the whole system compared to
maybe like finding couple things that
are like really really bad in the
current system
yeah let's say like maybe doing one
thing both like like relatively simple
thing like I don't know maybe like
adding the storage like massive storage
point somewhere right yeah so maybe
it'll fix the current system so it'll
work like another hundred years yeah it
could be like more cost-effective than
changing the whole system so all the
research that have done into this and
I'm by no means an expert leads me to
believe that the system is really at
this creaking obsolescence stage okay
we're the people running it really know
it's going to collapse and they really
scare and they really need help I mean
why else would monopolies come to
university and say please help us you
know they're they're worried that the
whole thing is that is as far as I can
make out they really want to seem to
want to make the change I'll give you an
example of this which is absolutely
amazing in Ontario there are two million
wooden power poles okay
the two million of them each of them
cost one thousand two hundred dollars to
replace so it's two point two billion
dollars in just these wooden power poles
most of them are more than thirty-five
years old and their lifespan is 35 years
okay so which ones do you change now it
turns out the people at Waterloo doing
research on determining which poles to
change by taking a helicopter flying
over them and looking at the amount of
surface rot from image analysis and
determining their with high probability
these poles are bad okay other people
are using ultrasound machines they have
a ring of eight ultrasonic transducers
we put on the pole and then they compute
the acidity cat-scan excellent sound and
they figure out the internal structure
of the wood and tell you whether it's
going to be falling in the next five
years or not okay so these are the kinds
of technologies which are coming in so
the to answer your point systemic change
seems to be inevitable okay it's being
recognized by
every Energy Authority in the on the
planet okay so I may be wrong but
hopefully not all of them are wrong at
the same time maybe they're better than
economist okay who tend to be
universally wrong I should say the
diversity in opinion among economists
doesn't seem to exist whereas the power
engineers that lack of diversity maybe
less I have too many negatives in my
sentence but it helped you get the point
and second thing is even small things
cost a lot right
even the polls cost what you know like
two billion dollars even a small small
nuclear reactors five billion dollars
this tremendous amounts of money in this
tremendous source of money in us to
change the infrastructure it's a hundred
years of infrastructure hundred years of
hundreds of millions of people paying
hundreds of dollars a month every month
for the system you know it all went
somewhere so basically you think that
change in the system like pretty much
doing like complete overhaul of the
system in the long term it would be more
cost effective than you'll be fixing
couple like really big paints of point
right now if you look at smart grid
that's what people are saying okay and
I'm inclined to believe them okay I
can't say for myself but from what I've
heard that's what I'm hearing
yeah how you thought about using
existing hydro power plants they seem
like they are becoming more valuable as
you face in more renewable intermittent
sources right that's because you you can
you can fairly fast scale up the output
from you know scale the output of a
hydroelectric plant
yeah but once you mean a certain number
of turbines it's yes yes I do I've more
capacity yes you can ramp up out of five
to ten minutes you can spin up a new
turbine and that's why this what's
called pumped hydro electric storage is
a big deal you can take water and pump
it back up again but it seems that you
don't even have to pump the water up you
just don't run those
when you have you know when the wind is
blowing basically I guess there is some
percentage of your energy mix that is
sort of if you are above this level in
terms of hydroelectricity
then you can sort of add more
intermittent sources without having to
worry that's right so the the what the
power region is called the base load and
then the peak load so the base load is
what you want to meet all the time and
typically it's met today by coal and
nuclear and hydro because these are
long-running sources and that's okay and
then you can take the kind of the extra
Delta's from from wind and solar for
example yes so I agree with you that you
know we want we want to develop hydro I
don't know what the number of the top of
my head but North American large-scale
hydros at the 80% stage or something
like that in that ballpark in terms of
usage all basically all rivers have been
dammed yeah yeah so one thing here is
adding more turbines to existing dams
yeah and they're doing this a nigra is
building additional turbines you know
this coming on stream I think next 2-3
years and the other interest is in micro
hydro which is you know the stream
running through just put a small
generator which is a four factor for a
few hundred Watts even right can you and
and that is combined with storage that
makes a difference right you can take
your and people are putting solar cells
and backpacks it's really tiny the same
kind of tiny micro hydro can also be
built is being built and deployed and so
if you live by stream you could
potentially power your house from there
so yeah the problem that micro hydro
tends to be it's a mechanical systems
the turbines run out wear out you know
they get clogged with algae and dust and
who knows what you know it's pretty
gross maybe try cleaning out your
bathroom sink anytime it's similar to
that but worse
yeah yeah you could put a micro turf now
if you're bald it's much better let me
assure you that yeah I mean you could
generate I think people have talked
about and I'll putting a tiny wind
turbine and you're holding out of your
car and charging a cell phone from that
right there was a proposal about three
years ago up a conceptual artist so
please take it at conceptual artist
level of putting turbines on the middle
of the New Jersey Turnpike in New Jersey
and they kind of estimated that just a
win the sheer wind from the two cars
moving in opposite directions will cause
a turbine to spin pretty fast and that
can generate enough electricity for I
don't know what something interesting so
you know so yeah you could you could all
these kinds of harvesting can be done I
think that it will be done you know once
electricity cause goes to let's it goes
from 10 cents a kilowatt hour to 50
cents a kilowatt or in two years from
now you will be facing you know half the
lights will be turned off and better
visited Bell Labs in well as various to
work and I visited them and I counted
about early 2000 something I don't know
and these guys this is before they got
bought by alcatel-lucent was saving
money by turning off every other like
every other light thing was turned off
to save electricity okay
and that was Bell Labs okay if if
electricity goes up by a factor of five
you'll see that happening everywhere so
and these kinds of harvesting will
become popular it's a question of you
know money talks and right now
everything is cheap and it's going to
change so I guess one more liability of
the current centralized grid is its
vulnerability to deliberate attacks yes
and if you build your your great
simulator I'm sure you could find like
one spot that you could go and cut the
wire and yes yes yeah yeah but eight
years ago I did some research where I
didn't
the 500 data centers where 80% of the
Internet traffic comes from I could
identify the IP address and with a
little bit of work the geographical
location as well and one of the
questions I got asked was aren't I
giving people a map of exactly where to
bomb so I never published it with so
will this
what will this change with the smart
grid distribution generally means
resilience that's a standard rule in
computer science any last questions from
VC participants all right I guess thank
you very much for coming back refresh
