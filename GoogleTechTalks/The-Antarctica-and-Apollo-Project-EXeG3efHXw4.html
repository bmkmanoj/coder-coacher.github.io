tech talk for Google at Santa Monica and
we have a special guest here Brian Lynn
taught who is the former director of the
fairy need Historic Park the historic
park in new zealand and it's what we're
in new zealand is in christchurch a
mountain in christchurch and he has done
quite a bit of research on antarctica
and historic preservation there and
he'll be discussing that as well as
spinning out from there and talking
about historic preservation in areas
beyond so i get the forks right crank
you thank you very much all right good
afternoon thank you for coming along I'd
like to begin with asking you to imagine
something long decades have passed no
humans have visited the heroic sites
where previously the world's attention
was focused there's an extraordinary
range of artifacts have been left
transport scientific equipment and just
the general remains of human activity
then one day a transport vehicle arrives
on its side very proudly displayed is
the emblem of the United States the
craft lands but during one of the
landings they have a problem the visual
conditions are so strange that people
are unable to measure distance easily
they're able to recover part of the
equipment from the earlier expedition
and use it to get back to their main
base the year is 1947 and the crew from
the USS Burton part of operation
Highjump have visited Captain Scott's
discovery hut another 30 years since any
human being had been there in many ways
the heroic era expirations of Antarctica
are similar to the Apollo mission in the
1960s both of them happened in times of
great international tension with nations
wanting to show their prowess and their
moral superiority through scientific
endeavor and brave exploration they also
drew deep
on cultural themes so we have astronauts
and Apollo we have Odyssey Nimrod and
Terra Nova and also they played with
current themes of discovery and durance
and Aquarius and snoopy Scott and
Shackleton now are as much cultural
icons and management school theory as
they are historical characters both
endeavors sent people to the very edge
of where humans could go in this case a
Munson the first human to arrive at the
South Pole where they would pay homage
to their nations flag fortitude though
is another quality that the people had
to have who undertook these great
endeavors here we have Shackleton ship
trapped in the ice slowly being crushed
destroying any hope of his plan to get
across the Antarctic continent through
the South Pole from the Atlantic sea to
the Pacific Ocean and here we have the
service module from apollo 13 when one
of the oxygen tanks had exploded both
parties were able to utilize very small
things that had no real purpose for
saving them in the situation that they
were suddenly found themselves in here
we have the James Caird a little ship
boat that's now been preserved which
sailed across the southern ocean so
Shackleton could inform the world where
his party were marooned and arranged the
rescue ensuring that not one person and
that party lost their life and here we
have the lunar lander from Apollo 13
which was able to supply power and some
oxygen so that the astronauts were able
to return safely to the earth sadly both
endeavors had great tragic loss three
American astronauts lost their life and
a ground test when the oxygen filled
capsule of Apollo 1 caught fire and in a
similar way although the absolute
opposite the end of the world and
temperature captain Scott lost his life
with his party within the
english-speaking world and specifically
the British Empire in the Commonwealth
Captain Scott's legacy got very much
embedded within the history of the time
and is a very fascinating cultural
marker which has moved its way through
the last century what you're looking at
here
is a memorial window from Christchurch
New Zealand and at the top of it are the
various ideas of truth and beauty and
the middle of it are a range of
historical characters predominantly from
British history and down the bottom a
fine line of New Zealand troops is
fighting brutality and ignorance the Red
Dragons but when you look closer front
and center next to Captain Cook the
European discoverer of New Zealand who
find Captain Scott and so in this period
before the First World War you had the
disaster with the Titanic then the news
came the captain Scott and his party had
perished and in the first world war came
along and culturally two things happened
the first was that Scott himself was
writing himself into the cultural
construction of the time so he had a
friend Barry and Barry wrote a book
called Peter Pan based on the play that
had written and in Peter Pan Wendy says
to the Lost Boys your mother's hope that
you died the death of an English
gentleman and when Captain Oates decided
to walk out of the tent realizing that
he was injured and holding up the party
and literally walked to his death Scott
wrote he died the death of an English
gentleman and at the time within what
was very much a British imperial they
had at uncle muscular Christianity
environment the sacrifice was very much
understood as being a Christian one what
happened with the film that was made of
Captain Scott was that it was showed to
the British troops on the Western Front
during the First World War and so the
death of English gentleman then became
something of an industrial scale and so
the trauma of the First World War
especially in the European British
Commonwealth context meant that Scott
got very solidly embedded within the
public understanding by the 60s and 70s
though with a very sort of I you know
iconoclast view coming through it was
time for parody in terms of popular
culture so Monty Python today I'm Scott
of the Sahara filmed on a beach down and
Devon then in the 80s there was a book
came thundering out that Scott was a
total fool and then other Antarctic
Explorer is responded and so now we're
in this period of history where you go
from the great hero the debunking
and now the nuanced debate Antarctica
itself if you get the opportunity to
visit I would highly recommend as a
sublimely beautiful place you'll learn
two things the first is that within
yourself you have more fortitude more
character more strength and resilience
and you ever thought you had before if
you're an American you have a one and
125,000 chance going down on the
national science foundation program or
you can go down as a tourist you find
this inner strength and then you look
out at the huge vastness of Antarctica
and you feel like an ant on a football
field and so you learn these two quite
contradictory things at the same time as
a territory it's quite unusual and one
of the great achievements of the
Eisenhower administration was to put in
place a treaty south of South America
Argentina Chile and Britain each claim
competing areas of Antarctica the United
States position towards claiming
Antarctica is that an expedition was
sent down there during President
Jackson's presidency and ironically some
people from that turned up in New
Zealand as the main founding treaty of
New Zealand was being signed the
Russians also sent down an expedition so
they claim this kind of idea of being
there as well the American position is
simple though effective occupancy which
they have without a doubt the highest
percentage of activity in Antarctica is
the claim for territoriality but in a
sense territoriality is an absurdity at
and this comes up with the moon as well
how do you claim the moon what does it
mean that's not like going west and
deciding that you know you're going to
add some more to the United States so
everything was put on hold under the
antarctic treaty and the fundamental
idea is that Antarctica is a zone of
peace but the military can provide
transport and logistical support and
scientific research is the main activity
in Antarctica and when you read the
autobiographies for example of Admiral
dufek of the United States Navy what
comes through very clearly as that
they'd been through two wars the Second
World War and the Korean War and there
was this real sense of pride that they
were doing something that was positive
that had enough of
of bloodshed and sacrifice and suffering
and death an Antarctica they felt that
they were making new discoveries they're
going to improve the value of human life
around the world and the quality of it
and you give this very strong idealistic
view coming through the territorial
claims are set aside during the treaty
as we do in our interpersonal
relationships quite often we agreed to
disagree and to put something on hold
and sort it out later decisions are
based on consensus between the countries
so decisions can take a long time to
arrive at but when you finally get there
everybody's on board and there's
Antarctic law for each nation so for
example if i was to damage and pilfer
from a historic hut i would be
prosecuted under new zealand law
presumably the majority of you would be
prosecuted and american law the American
law is quite fascinating basically a
federal agent who is authorized can
arrest you search you have you
essentially imprisoned and deported from
the continent without a warrant there's
no mucking about whatsoever very similar
with New Zealand they don't seem to be
very many cases though of problems of
lawlessness down there first of all the
people that are chosen to go down have a
high level of motivation to be there so
they're not going to be silly little own
criminal in addition if you do anything
really stupid you simply get locked out
of your nation's Antarctic Program and
your Antarctic access is very difficult
from there on them one of the things
with the heroic gear our Hut's is that
they have a very strong sense of
presence about them for example so Neil
cousins the chair of English Heritage
says that they are the most tangible
heritage sites on the planet and time
and time again you get these reports
coming back that things aren't quite the
same there in terms of time and space as
they are in the rest of the world and I
think one of the reasons is that your
several of them you have to be highly
motivated to go there and you'll
probably have a good knowledge of it in
addition the normal signifiers of time
don't count
when I was down there last January the
Sun just goes round and round the
horizon you know you wake up and it's
the morning so the sun's over there and
it's midday and then it's time for a
meal and then you might wake up in the
night and the sun's down there it's just
going round and round so that day night
thing isn't working in addition there's
no spiders so there's no cobwebs and the
environment outside you is so strange
you know it's just like nothing else
someone referred to it as a reductionist
environment and it is your the lack of
stimulation you're getting put you into
quite a strange headspace but what we
have here is a photo from Scott second
expedition and they're going into the
hut from Shackleton's first expedition
and one of the things that identifies
the fact that the food is still edible
and decades later the food is deletable
down there as part of my research I had
the privilege of interviewing Sir Edmund
Hillary a year and a half ago he's
recently passed away and he told me the
story which is in the public domain
already of seeing Shackleton's ghost and
he said I don't believe in ghosts and
spirits but I walked him to Shackleton's
Hut and there he was his arms are
outstretched and he was smiling and
welcoming me and I got such a shock I
fell backwards out the door and it was
wonderful that he had told me the story
personally but then I talked to his wife
afterwards and a really interesting
aspect where she said that as it gets
older he's thinking about what
immortality means is there a spiritual
aspect to life or world people like it
Hilary who was a real fan of Shackleton
imagine and the future when they're on
top of Mount Everest seeing it Hillary
up there and who's been a great
supporter of preserving these huts in
Antarctica and his last great trip of
his life was when the American Air Force
um flew him down to Antarctica and I was
there a few weeks beforehand and
everyone was saying it will find a way
to stay here a bit longer and sure
enough he did and he did that late great
last great journey and then came home
whenever more bird of the United States
Navy wrote for the Nash
geographic in the 1940s he commented on
the fact that the timber seemed an
exceptionally good condition and this
was one of the things that surprised
people was that they were able to pick
up rope that have been used for ponies
and use that to hold down the
helicopters from the American ships but
one of the problems you find when you're
dealing with a historic site is that
sometimes you'll have layers and in this
case they're literally as a layer of
blubbery sooty smoke over all the
building so the first expeditions that
came were very well-planned very well
equipped they had heating and so on but
then there was a later expedition and
most people know about Shackleton and to
ship getting crushed in the ice in the
Atlantic side on the Pacific side there
was always called the Ross Sea party and
the Ross Sea party went ashore and a
storm blew up and their ship got washed
out to sea swept out and the ship
managed to make it back but they were
marooned and to stay alive they had to
kill seals and burn the fat so what you
have are these two very distinct and
very different phases of history and how
you deal with those layers of history
can be a very very strong debating topic
a lot of artifacts have been left there
over the years and interestingly some of
these artifacts have been used for
scientific research so for example they
got the fuel from Captain Scott and his
expedition and the some of the last
surviving examples of petroleum from
1910 are down in Antarctica other
Petroleum's just been used or thrown
away and the environment being so cold
and so dry means a lot of things have
been preserved here we have one of the
conservators working down there there's
an organization called the New Zealand
Antarctic Heritage Trust and they have
up to six conservators at any time Getty
foundation here have provided some
funding towards this project there are
some health and safety risks besides the
danger of Antarctica scotts ponies had
anthrax and the spores are still viable
although they're now deep underground
lead a whole range of different things
when they were doing a cleanup they
dropped a bottle of ether and decided it
was time to all go
outside and little bit of one go through
there's morphine cocaine laudanum and
opium and the medical kits and so
whether you leave those historic items
in place or whether you take them off
the continent has been an ongoing debate
global warming has caused issues as well
what's happened here is that the snow
and ice have melted so even though the
very core of Antarctica is getting
colder and the reason for that is as
more moisture goes in the atmosphere and
it goes south and it hits the freezing
line it turns to snow and ice so the
mass of snow and ice is building pulling
the core temperature down the
extremities at the coast especially the
Antarctic Peninsula are starting to warm
up and this has happened where these
Hut's are and so as soon as you get
water chemical and biological issues
become very serious with conservation so
the very distinctive phases with these
are Roy agera huts and the 50s a lot of
base personnel and I must say New
Zealanders and Americans were pilfering
artifacts but the interesting thing is
when you talk to a lot of people they
didn't see it as something really bad
they saw it as a special token of the
fact that they'd been to Antarctica but
things had got a little bit out of hand
and so in the late 50s it was a very
strong decision made by the New
Zealanders that if they restored the
huts to look something like a lived-in
museum then people would understand them
more and have been big piles of rubbish
and of course they'd been cleaned up
because you know the rubbish didn't fit
in with the ideas and so forth my
research indicates that a lot of ideas
were taken from Colonial Williamsburg a
lot of the same language is used about
making a lived and historical site an 87
the Antarctic Heritage Trust was
established with professional
conservation the pressure from tourism
is controlled with only two thousand
visits a year eight in the huts at a
minimum but there's a real tension in
Antarctica and that is between the
scientists because there are a limited
number of seats on the plane and are the
Heritage community and very much I got
told in no uncertain terms antartica is
there for science paradoxically though
when you go to the scientific
laboratories you'll find all signed
equipment from the 1950s which has been
used for continuous monitoring of the
environment and essentially this is a
mini-museum it's old equipment it has an
interpretation panel on it it has a map
it has something to give it some context
so in the 1950s the undertaking was
called the international geophysical
year and it was a great idea there was a
dinner party here in America with Van
Allen as the host and the idea came up
before look we've got all this
technology from the Second World War why
don't we have another polar year and
look at these extreme environments where
previously it was very difficult to do
research so the territorial claims were
put on hold this was just before the
treaty and by every measure it was a
great success at the same time there was
this kind of end of empire expedition
though being done by the British and
this was to achieve what Shackleton had
failed to do set up a basin the Atlantic
side of the continent and then go across
via the South Pole to the Pacific side
Vivian fuchs was the British commander
of it and Sir Edmund Hillary would
recently conquered Everest would lay
depots between Ross Island on the
Pacific side and a point 500 miles from
the South Pole so essentially folks
would be up at the top left and would go
across to the center and Hillary would
be in the bottom center and he would go
up and then stopped short of the South
Pole folks had these wonderful snowcat
vehicles designed for traveling on snow
Hillary had some messy ferguson tractors
which had been adapted with these tracks
very difficult to drive but affordable
and here we have Admiral dufek first
commander of operation deep freeze and
ed Hillary just before they set off and
one of the things that we're working on
in New Zealand at the moment is setting
up a Hillary dufek fellowship because
the personal friendship between these
two actually started the whole
relationship between the United States
and New Zealand and Antarctica
originally the New Zealand base was
going to be 30 miles away do
fix it look we're all getting on so well
why don't you build your base next to us
and in terms of logistics that's been
great but also just in terms of that
cooperation that's been a great success
for New Zealand science and it's worked
out very well for the Americans also
Hillary went forward with his our
tractors and fuel was being dropped in
an interesting bit of the geopolitics
was that the British were also doing
this and this has turned up in the
British archives to show their
territorial claim to Antarctica and
rather cheekily the Americans arm agreed
to help the New Zealanders with their
plan which was to drive to the South
Pole first so Admiral dufek had some
fuel brought down from New Zealand by
ship it was swept off the ship so he had
some flowing down and then the Royal New
Zealand Air Force were making these
depots Hillary got to within 500 miles
of the pole and as we were talking about
it he said what do they expect I'm an
adventurer and an explorer Hillary
thought that fuchs was not even going to
make it to the South Pole before the
summer season ended so basically there
were some telegrams with backwards and
forwards one of these telegrams was
accidentally released to the media and a
pile of other media releases and
suddenly there was another race to the
South Pole before it had been Norway in
great britain now it was great britain
in New Zealand and the sense there
wasn't really a race fuchs had been
doing a very steady pace Hillary had
done everything you had to do so off he
went and as you can tell from the
photograph when the two leaders met at
the South Pole several weeks later when
Fuchs finally made it there was a little
bit of tension between the two of them
on the other hand the New Zealanders
were very pleased because they had shown
that with a near territorial claim they
could drive from the coast to the South
Pole the Americans were thrilled that
that cemented this relationship with the
New Zealand is in the area and thanks to
the route that Hillary had actually
plotted through the crevasses folks was
able to finish his plan on time as well
sadly though not all things in
Antarctica have come to a happy end and
in the late 1970s there was growing
concern and that was that with tourism
flights which flew over Antarctica with
people looking that not actually landing
that there could be very very serious
issues if there was to be a crash so the
entire two countries get together each
year or every second year originally
they meet they discuss the issues and
this was the recommendation that was
going out that clearly communications
were not good the air traffic control
system was designed for the military it
didn't have the capacity for large
civilian operations as well and that if
there was going to be an emergency
landing they weren't even sure that the
basis would have enough food to feed 200
300 people if blizzards came in and so
on well sadly the tragedy in 1979 was at
a dc-10 flew into Mount Erebus and with
the loss of 257 lives and so at the next
meeting we're calling with respect the
years of exploration and research many
have traveled and worked in Antarctica
are not returned and they very very
appropriately and correctly acknowledged
the great work that the New Zealanders
and Americans did trying to recover you
know the remains they express their
sympathy and recommended that the site
become a tomb because they restore the
remains of humans there and so their
area of Antarctica is totally sealed off
there's a memorial area next to it which
has a memorial for ceremonies of
remembrance but no one flies over it and
it's just totally like a graveyard and
in a strange way it's not a bad
graveyard because when you look at Mount
Erebus and I was talking to someone who
lost a friend endless tragedy it's
sublimely beautiful it's like when you
look at you know the images of mount
fuji by hokusai and in terms of
someone's final resting place the end
was swift and thank God and in addition
to that it has a real beauty and
serenity to it
it's also interesting when you talk to
people who have been to Antarctica
because Mount Erebus especially from the
American perspective New Zealand's
perspective our bases are down at the
bottom of it and it's like a reference
point and this huge white vastness Mount
Erebus is this place that you refer to
in your mind and you get quite an
affinity with it the Antarctic Treaty
consultative meetings recently
criticized the amount of ship-borne
tourism going down to Antarctica and
last year with no loss of life or injury
a ship dedicated to sailing and polar
waters sunk when it was South America it
had gone south from there and hit what
was called a growler and ripped a hole
in the hull and sank very very quickly
and so these huge cruise ships are going
down there from South America they take
them down from Alaska and there's a
range of issues in terms of search and
rescue the waters are uncharted that's
absolutely treacherous with the weather
and simply the capacity to rescue large
numbers of people is not there so if you
want to go to Antarctica I don't know if
Google or set up something down there
would be great fun if they did you start
off probably in Christchurch New Zealand
which the guys on the International
Space Station are kindly pointing out
and that's down the bottom left
Christchurch is very lucky Scott
Shackleton Admiral Byrd and operation
deep freeze have all gone through there
over the years chances are you'll fly
down on an American c-17 and one of the
things that really you know poignant Lee
I was aware of was that you are allowed
up on the flight deck and since nine
eleven when the flight deck is now this
kind of armoured Enclave where no one
gets to see except the pilots and the
flight crew we've really lost something
and I think the two things that we've
lost as the incredible view you get out
the front of a plane you know you can
see why people are pilots just for the
look of it and then the other thing is
that that sense of camaraderie the
collegial feel of your all going on a
big trip together and pilots love to
talk about the aeroplanes
so in this situation you can get up on
the flight deck they'll happily chat to
you for hours about it all it's a c-17
crew that been up in Iraq and
Afghanistan so this was you know a
welcome change of pace for them and then
finally you'll arrive over Antarctica
and look out you actually leave in the
middle of summer so you're looking at
about 80 degrees when you leave
Christchurch and you've got to go out
with all your emergency clothing on in
case the plane goes down so everyone's
kind of sweating away and carrying these
huge coats I think I get down to about
minus 30 or 40 in these clothes that
you're wearing when you do arrive down
there you walk out onto the ice runway
down the bottom left you'll see Santa
Claus part of the flight crew people are
color-coded Kiwis are blue the Americans
read National Science Foundation the
Italians set up a program and I'm just
really classy clothes just no two ways
about it you jump on Ivan the Terrible
it's about 16 miles and that'll take you
across the ice shelf and then you'll go
up onto the island the New Zealand base
New Zealanders are very much into their
green we did have the orange and red of
the British but in the 1960s we sort of
moved further and further away from that
historical connection and the base is
designed in little modules so if there's
a fire they can section off one module
and Fire is a huge danger in Antarctica
it's a desert all the water is frozen
you can't chip away at ice and throw it
at a fire and so I was there when there
was a fire alarm and just unbelievable
you know the level of activity to make
sure that nothing got out of control on
the other side is sort of like it's
really strange you spend 12 hours flying
between Auckland New Zealand and Los
Angeles and you've gone from one world
to another here is a 12 minute little
shuttle ride and so we drive on the left
and in the corridors we walk on the left
you go across to McMurdo and walk on the
corridors in the right hand side there's
ATM machines there's American bathrooms
which are slightly different from our
ones the accents are obviously different
the only frustrating thing was I went to
the bar and I feel great I can get
some American beer and that's it we have
at argos baits and we have our
Canterbury DB and these are all new
zealand beers they don't bring american
beers down so they've got a great coffee
shop over there you meet lots of good
folk there and they've got a bar with
appalling karaoke which I would suggest
you avoid at all costs the internet link
not a lot of broadband but reasonably
continuous the New Zealanders and
Americans do have two big satellite
dishes I think only about three or four
degrees above the horizon to actually
get round the curvature of the earth and
one of the satellites to go down so
there are a few issues and contrast at
south pole station they have to go
between I think six or seven that pop up
above the horizon so nothing like
broadband but you can send some basic
files backwards and forwards Irial
exploration this is Captain Scott using
a balloon basically they had an
instruction manual they got them up to
1,500 feet and nearly let him go and
then mum he decided it was time to come
down and his first expedition then
Shackleton went up and used aerial
photography nowadays NASA to do a proof
of concept as well as some real
astronomy as well sends up these helium
balloons you could fit about for jumbo
jets on that and there's a little weed
pot underneath it might be for example
an x-ray telescope and what they will do
is send it up to a hundred thousand feet
and then there's a big current of ear
goes round Antarctica you send it up for
two or three weeks when you get back
over where the bases you push a button
the pod drops down the parachute deploys
and you get all the data down so while
it's actually up at altitude they can
download about 1% of the data to other
satellites when it comes into line of
sight they can download another twenty
percent of the data and so they use that
to check that the operational parameters
are being adhered to and then when the
whole pod comes down you get everything
but they did have a problem when I was
there and that is one of these pods came
down but in the parachute didn't detach
and a woman came up and they found it a
hundred miles away down a crevasse
and was a ten-million-dollar experiment
so they send out a rescue crew a search
and rescue crew to go down and get the
hard drives it's a place to do art and
artistic programs are becoming more
popular down there National Science
Foundation has won this is a California
artist leader Albuquerque she's based
here and these balls actually
represented the stars above in the
summer solstice which ironically you
couldn't see because the Sun was just
going round and round the horizon there
was an astronomer he was in the red
jacket there and he with his GPS could
actually go and so all you're a Virgo
come on I'll show you where Virgo was
and he'd go over the neat thing about
this was that it started off as these
blue balls they're anchored into the
snow and they were all on the surface
but Antarctica sort of consumes things
and by the time we'd got there you could
see some of the balls were starting to
sort of you know go under the
environmental regulations very strong so
at the end of the artwork photographed
from ground level and air level
everything was taken away and when you
go out into the field now there's very
strict environmental protocols so
everything goes back and you know you
sort of start to get an affinity with
astronauts this was my little bit of
interior decorating the clear minimalist
influence of luck abou za with the white
surfaces the Gothic Revival reading
knock alluded to at the end and the
plastic Pacifica flowers to put a bit of
color just all snow cave and I was
reading Admiral Byrd's but called alone
and in the 1930s a little America base
was established at the edge of the ice
shelf he win 100 miles inland set up a
meteorological station and wintered over
and it's a fascinating book to read
because he's just a person alone coming
to terms with himself taking a break
from the hurly-burly but then what
happens is that I'm carbon monoxide from
the oven starts to poison him and he
realizes this but if he doesn't have the
oven he doesn't have heat and he freezes
and he's trying to convince everybody
back at the coast
he's ok but the messages are getting
crazier and crazier the radio messages
and you're under strict orders not to do
a rescue and you know this was the Navy
the 1930s you know the order was the
Admiral will not be rescued if he's made
this decision having said that it got so
crazy that they decided that they were
going to do a tour of inland areas to
look at meteorites and well they were in
the area they were going to pop in and
see them and this book alone is
fascinating to read and when you
actually like I did sit inside the Ross
Ice Shelf hearing your heartbeat reading
this book you know that contextual
learning is superb and over on our right
this is a little meteorological station
we set up and did some data research
with a lot of there's a stranger called
the Dry Valleys very similar to other
planets in terms of not a lot of life
while we assume there's life on other
ones dusty gritty and when I was down
there I met a guy from Kansas University
had been working on remote-controlled
aircraft in extreme environments a lot
of stuff that Nessa will use on Mars
they'll take down to Antarctica and
they've got their separation the extreme
environment and now things have actually
come around 180 degrees because people
are saying well why don't we just use
the same technology and Antarctica you
know it's a dangerous place it's
expensive to take people down there so
why don't we just have a rover trembling
up and down one of these Dry Valleys
taking little biological samples
throughout the year back at McMurdo
Station there's a really cool guy George
is a Madison Wisconsin and he's probably
the most highly qualified guy with a
soldering iron on the planet he runs
meteorological stations all around
Antarctica this is his way of getting
down there and this whole idea of remote
sensing is very very big and is growing
more and more as time goes by if you go
out into the field you'll go on one of
these small little planes or if you're
heading off to the South Pole thanks to
the United States here
force and there's a National Guard unit
up in New York State and they fly to
Greenland in the Arctic and then they
swap around the other half of the year
and come down south everything at the
moment is flowing into the South Pole
will though they have experimented with
a ruh roh door a rat way the very first
plane to land at the south pole was que
sera sera versus narrow in Pensacola and
a museum naval aviation and they were
the first people the essence got it left
nowadays if you get down to South Pole
Station the original base set up in the
1950s is underground it's just kind of
melted its way down Snow's built up
extraordinary place this is the absolute
edge you're about 13,000 feet of
elevation your brain isn't working as
well as it normally should because your
body is desperately trying to survive
and you see over on the right there's a
geodesic dome which was put up in the
1970s and then the new base to the left
is actually on pylons so it can be
elevated up so a huge amount of science
going on down there at the moment to get
supplies here though can be tricky the
Hercules are very expensive to fly down
there's an unfortunate incident where
someone at the south pole broke the door
of someone else at the South Pole and
they had to put a special flight in and
it was you know tens if not hundreds of
thousands of dollars for this one
particular flight here we have a c-17
doing an airdrop so Antarctic science
you're looking at the birth the nature
of the universe climate change and life
and extreme environments South Pole
telescope will be coming online I think
they've just got first light on it
things are so cold there that the
secondary mirror actually docks with the
building and people can internally get
access to it and I think was it Berkeley
some of the sensor arrays they were
still developing the technology for it
as they built the telescope one plane
load with 5000 bolts I was involved as
well as plain road after planeloads take
all this down
good one to look up on the internet is
called our ice cube believe it or not
this is actually a telescope is 2400
meters under the surface of the South
Pole and it's really interested in
neutrinos that are coming through the
North Pole so that the planet is
filtering out the local neutrinos and
it's this great question and science
where the neutrinos come from you know
is it from around a black hole where
there might be you know kind of energy
being built up as masses whirling round
is that from stars exploding is that
from somewhere else altogether this is
actually a line in the federal budget of
thing about 250 million dollars so the
idea is that you drop these ropes down
and they had pods on them and then you
have an array of all of these pods and
when a neutrino comes through there's a
secondary effect of a blue flash and you
can find out the direction of where that
neutrino came from and if there's a
whole swarm of them then you can inform
astronomers and ask them to position say
an extreme case hubble towards that
region of space and try and figure out
just what is going on there which is
creating this effect that you're picking
up at the South Pole this is a project
called androl why is nature the way it
is there was this wonderful section of
geological time which was squeezed very
very tightly so it wasn't five
kilometers deep it was one kilometer
deep and of course it had to be under 80
meters of ice and then 900 meters of
water and the ice had to move up and
down a meter with the tide it couldn't
be on the land such things happen so
there was New Zealand engineering
involved in this Italian German and
American funding and what they've
retrieved is a core sample that's a
kilometer long and so what we're looking
at here is sitting on the ice they've
reamed a hole with this kind of hot
water sleeve then they've put a nine
hundred meter pipe anchored it to the
seafloor and then using mineral drilling
technology they've gone down and so you
can see here with the sample that's been
cut in half and immediately recorded you
get these different straw
utter and depending on the climate
you'll get different things so for
example if there's an ice shelf overhead
the ice shelf rips off big bits are rock
and as the bottom of it melts those big
rocks will drop down comparatively big
if there's no ice shelf but there's
glaciers the glaciers are ripping stuff
down and you'll get a certain type of
sediment if there's fast moving rivers a
different sediment again and then also
if you get into the fossils you'll
actually be able to see what fossils are
there from what type of environment was
there so this will help with climate
change research because you'll be able
to get a better understanding of well
what is normal for the Earth's
environment biological research has been
going on and one debate that goes on in
the science and Antarctica is
longitudinal studies so should you
always be doing new fresh and exciting
things which may help you get some
funding or should you just keep doing
the same research again and again and
see how changes happen and both of those
have strong cases you know a
case-by-case basis and one of the things
as seeing the build-up of things like
DDT and mammals in Antarctica so you
start off with a pristine environment
and then you see how the modern age and
packs upon life-forms down there now
it's with global warming to see what
happens there here's an image from space
this anomaly here in the center was
quite strange and people wanted to know
more originally they had been a proposal
to take atomic waste in the 1960s put it
on the surface and Antarctica let it
melt through and just sit on the bottom
until it had decayed well it's really
good they didn't do that because it
turns out there's a system of rivers and
lakes underneath Antarctica and this is
called Lake Vostok the Russians were
drilling getting a core sample of ice
and much to their stunned amazement with
the Sun radar telemetry from space and
from aircraft they found out there was a
lake underneath and so NASA are now
looking at this in the context of Europa
and the Jovian moon in which there may
be life underneath the ice and so how do
you get through to it now there's a huge
debate about whether in fact you may
contaminate the life that's been there
for and
awfully long time with modern biological
material Antarctica some of you may even
be consuming it now bioprospecting has
become a huge industry internationally
and an Antarctica they found that there
were these proteins which stopped ice
particles forming which fish had in them
they modified those and now they're
putting them in various ice creams and
chocolates in America so you have a
creamier chocolate and the ice cream is
more smooth so looking at the types of
historic sites and monuments you have
the history of heritage is that as
mentioned the personnel are told to
treat them as shrines under the
antarctic treaty there's a developing
system which parallels that UNESCO
United Nations one saying their historic
sites and tombs things are formalized
and there's also a very clever thing
being put in saying well we're not sure
of what everything is so if we don't
know and it's pre 1958 let's just wait
do some research and then move on now
the Madrid Protocol set up Antarctica is
a very solidly environmentally focused
place up until then they've been a lot
of science but they're also been a lot
of waste and rubbish and so on so now
the committee for Environmental
Protection looks after the historic
sites and monuments it has area plans
and so forth with the history of
heritage so it's important to remember
that there's a big desire to remove a
lot of things from Antarctica so you've
got 10 years to remove it before it
becomes historic is what one
environmental person told me the
geopolitics of Antarctica dictate a lot
of things and one of them is the
heritage here at the front we have
Captain Scott's heart at the back we
have the American base now this Hut
there's a modest significance it's
important to keep it there but also it's
a very polite reminder that the British
and New Zealand connection in Antarctica
was there well before the Americans
arrived so you had the traditional
historic sites the basis of Scott and
Shackleton here you have a monument to
Admiral Byrd
it Admiral Byrd's bases were on ice
which is subsequently broken away and
melted so there's no physical remains of
the little America basis so this statue
here at McMurdo commemorates bird and
all of his achievements here's the hut
put up by at Hillary the first New
Zealand base in the 1950s now this isn't
where an historic site or monument is
but it could be Norway has claimed that
the tent left by a Munson is an historic
site in South America Chile and
Argentina have competing claims
Argentina drove to the South Pole first
so the Argentinian flag pole which they
put up which has subsequently been lost
in the ice and snow has also claimed as
historic site so are these what we would
normally consider valid historic sites
and monuments well perhaps not but in
the context of Antarctica they can have
great meaning at the moment there's a
big debate about others geodesic dome
there was a plan to dismantle it and
bring it back to the United States and
put it in a museum for the CBS with
budgets at federal level now being so
tight there's talk of actually just
demolishing it and so you can expect a
big debate over that within their
Antarctic community in the coming years
a lot of artifacts have actually been
brought back from the ice or a down
their stolen could be put in a museum in
this case a US Navy constellation plane
this was actually buried under ice and
snow but as the hot summers at McMurdo
have become hotter it started to
re-emerge and there have been cases of
planes being retrieved and brought back
to museums you can see here the graffiti
which gives you some idea of the melting
pattern over the years if you want to
take one of these planes back though
you've got to melt the ice and snow and
there's a huge cost involved there in
New York City there's a small memorial
to Lincoln Ellsworth the first person
and American who flew across the
continent and in Christchurch New
Zealand we have a totem pole carved in
Oregon and the very first hanger
historic sites and airports are kind of
airports are like an ongoing
construction zone now
and there's already plans to relocate
this which is a pity because it is such
a physical reminder here we have an
Australian plane that flew in Antarctica
had only flew once but it was restored
and again its geopolitical it reminds
people that you know intact occur is
also an Australian endeavor but my
former Museum in Christchurch we have
United States Navy dc-3 and one of the
fun things is with archaeology you can
send back the layers of paint so what
you'll see here is there's the Tiki you
can see the remains of a kiwi but in
Antarctica this plane was called mother
Goose mother Goose was at the front of
the plane down the back you can just
make out at the top lift it's kind of
like a curved shape to the left and then
like a little beak and there was the
goose and the goose is buttocks were are
positioned around the exhaust of the
auxiliary power unit so it's buttocks
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom they
decided that was a little not quite fit
for the fine people of Christchurch so
it got painted over one of the issues
with museums and heritage is when you
get these things that don't really have
a site as such a lot of research was
done about the ozone hole discovering it
in Antarctica and then monitoring it so
with the ozone hole you have this
incredible situation of humans realize
that they're changing the planet and
they collectively agree to change what
they're doing in terms of fluorocarbons
to heal the damage now that's a pivotal
point in human history this is one of
the nasa planes that did part of that
research so keeping that plane in a
museum in the future i think is very
important so why is antarctica way cool
the human stories of the Heroic Age of
Scott do tend to resonate and I think
they will throughout the years to come
if you've got thirty five thousand
dollars spear and you'd like to fly to
the South Pole for four or five hours
you can go down there as a tourist or
you can go on one of the cruise ships
for a lot less we just had an
international polar year although that's
mainly focused on the Arctic and how I
did indigenous cultures will cope with
global warming it is flying at the
absolute extreme you know it really is
the edge of where humans can go
and in addition to that penguins are
just way cool and everybody loves them I
took this photograph last year put it in
a competition and won a thousand dollars
so you know that's great so within tardy
air and space heritage you know clearly
air and space technologies opened
antartica up important discoveries have
been made it's analogous to some
extraterrestrial environments and where
concepts are tested and the aviation
history provides deep insights into
human bravery and endeavour one of the
things I found quite moving was they had
to do a rescue of somebody at the South
Pole and in the middle of winter and the
pilots walked out and the whole base was
lined up to shake their hand and that's
when the pilots knew how dangerous it
was that they were absolutely at the
edge and Tareq has always been used as
an analogy of the lunar environment
people like von braun went down there a
lot of other folks from NASA and it's
because it is so extreme and so
different so as you may have guessed
when it comes to lunar issues there will
be big debates there is an Antarctic
Treaty there is a space treaty but the
moon treaty has not been signed and
specifically by the United States so all
the moon just be for peace and science
will it be for the benefit of all people
if there are resources there should
everybody on the planet benefit or will
the free enterprise model come up so
you're going to expect a whole lot of
linkages are going to be going on in the
moon and this is really what's at the
hub of it all when you look at these
historic sites and Antarctica on the
moon do you have this truly amazing
experience and context that only a very
few can see or do you take things to a
museum and take them out of context
clearly the footprints are something
that will have to be preserved the very
first human footprints off our planet
and they're going to be there for a very
long time the remains of if you want to
know when something goes from being
operational to historic there it goes
the remains though aren't quite
everything you would think they throw
their rubbish out of the little capsule
before they took off so a lot of human
waste also got thrown out as well so one
will just be pristine scientific
some bits and pieces without a doubt
that this flag could be in the
Smithsonian I'm sure that I would I had
a friend who worked on the star-spangled
banner and we discuss this and she said
that you know this is probably the
second most famous flag in American
history without a doubt and I would go
as far as to say as human history Boeing
and General Motors were involved in the
rover so I'm sure the corporate
sponsorship type things if you could
bring this back to earth and have an
exhibition American wheels on the moon
do you think that would be a bit of a
good seller so when I talked about this
in the Smithsonian I mentioned that you
know now is the time to get involved use
the Antarctic system which works and I
talk to people in State Department about
this so the nation's agree on site
designation and management visitors are
governed by their own national law so
you don't get the National Park Service
looking after things you establish a
separate trust so that whole issue of
territoriality gets put to one side plan
de Luna basis for areas that will become
historic south pole station there's a
whole lot of issues there of you know
there's it would be great if they could
have kept those original buildings but
you know other things have gone over the
top of them and recommending visit
Antarctica ross island for the apollo
sites is an analog and south pole
station for the new moon bases when i
gave this talk last year it was all very
kind of way out there in a bit of mine
candy but then google has really
impressed came up with the lunar xprize
30 million dollars if you can get a
robot to the moon you can do a live
transmission and one of the bonuses as
if you get to an historic site and
yesterday i got the latest guidelines
for this particular prize and they're
very very wisely said that visits to
historic sites must be approved in
advance because the whole idea of and
here we have our little robot from
university x and oops it's just gone
over one of those little bags of waste
and something shorted out and no it's
not responding to control it seems to be
driving towards the american flag our
sensors show that the motors on the
right hand side of burning up because
the flag has been jammed in the wheels
you know that's publicity from hell you
just don't need that but the fascinating
thing of what is being proposed though
is that it will give the opportunity by
remote sensing to show an environment
where the vast majority of humans can't
go and I think Google are to be
commended for that so I thank you for
coming along the arm this afternoon my
body clock still thinks it's about seven
o'clock New Zealand time in the morning
but it has been a delight I like to
acknowledge Chris for putting this
forward and end on two things the first
is and this was realized at the time by
going to the moon we didn't discover the
moon as much as we discovered the youth
when people are up in space and they
look back and see this tiny little
beautiful marble and they see the
vastness of space suddenly people
realize that this is what we've got the
moon isn't an option you can't live on
the moon you can't make a life in
Antarctica you've got to be continually
supplied from the earth that we live in
and we know so well and on that note I'd
welcome any questions and comments and
if people would like to come up and
check or if you've got to get back to
making the world a better place I'll end
it there thank you so much
sure good question two things first of
all with the Eroica era huts developing
technologies that make virtual
experiences of a deeper nature and how
that is going to be I'm not entirely
sure certainly you know the visual
aspect is very important the second part
of the question I met Peter folks who
was the son of Vivian folks and he's
just set up a foundation in the United
Kingdom and we had a talk and lots of
people were suggesting this idea not
just me and he said how do I get British
school children engaged with Antarctica
and one of the things is that the human
component is very big so there's a book
just come out called robots and space
from smithsonian one of the authors and
he talks about how the human identity
thing is huge but how the robots
actually do far better science and in a
lot of environments where humans can't
go so what the Fuchs Foundation has done
is chosen a couple of people to go
around tactica and do their blogs and
people school children especially can
follow the individual and get that
empathy but at the same time also given
them access to a lot of data so they can
actually start to do some science and
that whole idea of being able to do
science through remote sensing for
example in Mount Erebus there are some
cameras and they've got a lot of
problems with the cold because the
batteries run down but some new
technologies may help but that's where a
lot of science is going to happen in the
future so developing ways in which
children and other people can access
data and you know just analyze it you
know draw themselves put it into Excel
or another version like that and then
just sort of see why okay what is the
temperature doing you know can I compare
it to the temperature in Syria over the
last hundred years you have very simple
tools that let people take data and get
some meaning from
and experienced it themselves would be a
major contribution cool sure yeah
at the moment they've got one where
they're going back hundreds of years in
great detail you know for looking at
chemicals and so on other ones you're
going back tens of thousands of years
you know and then when you're looking at
these rock samples you know you're
getting into some pretty deep history as
well so you know there are places where
they're looking at the earth temperature
over you know hundreds of thousands and
getting into millions of years and
that's part of the debate and it's an
interesting debate that goes on at the
moment of climate change of you know
what is normal what can be done and a
lot of scientists have made the comment
to me that they're very frustrated that
certainly within the British you know a
lot of the world now goes climate change
is happening we don't need to do any
more research and the scientists the
same way actually if you did a bit more
research you might get some idea of the
parameters and the possibilities and
from there you can do some planning so
for example was plum you know the sea
level going to go up 300 millimeters or
eight hundred millimeters well it makes
a huge difference to the planning cities
over the next hundred years but there's
now okay we're climate thing alright
terrible you know and so you know
suddenly things run off on tangents and
so forth but you have that ability you
know to get that record out of there is
exceptionally good oh yeah great hey
look once again many thanks if any of
you want to come up and have a chat or
whatever I thank you for this
opportunity once more have a good day
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
