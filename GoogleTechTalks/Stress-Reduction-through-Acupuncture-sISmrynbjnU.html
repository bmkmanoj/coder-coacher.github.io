thank you for such a eloquent
presentation alright today we're going
to start this is dr. Kim and he will be
doing the meditation and actually the
acupuncture demonstration show we'll
talk about certain concepts of Oriental
Medicine prior to that and also i will
be doing a demonstration of Tai Chi
which is a Chinese therapeutic movement
exercise so today we're going to cover
an area which is stress now we all are
familiar with this word this word was
coined by the English language as the
English term of death stress is a French
word so stress came from the word gate
stress and it became stress so anything
that causes the body to react in a
manner other than the normal state of
balance which homeostasis and some of
the treatments that we are going to look
at in terms of the Chinese herbal
medicine the acupuncture the meditation
that therapeutic movements exercise are
really trying to reestablish the
homeostasis or the body's own natural
balance order so homeostasis is a very
important word that is commonly used
natural therapeutics jargon so homeless
as you all know it's similar stasis
balance homeostasis how to achieve these
homeostasis now reenter medicine has
been around for 5,000 years and during
that time they have had experience to
research and test empirically by using
this medicine over thousands of years
certain specific botanical plants
treatments points and movement that can
help relax the body so we will look at
how the stress affects our body the
effects of stress on the body there's we
all are familiar with psychological
stress but besides a psychological
stress there's environmental stress
factors environmental strikes faster can
be specific agents such as you know
chemicals out there in in the atmosphere
can be chemicals in a building it can
also be the light UV light temperature
changes so on and so forth so we have a
lot of effects of our body within the
environment that causes stress but also
you might be aware that everybody that
is driving to work is under a state of
stress so some of you said I could be
driving could affect me well anybody
that drives over 40 miles an hour
actually is creating a stress response
in the body and we look at that now the
mechanism of stress are quite complex
however just be aware that stress will
work on a specific axis of the pituitary
and hypothalamus to the adrenal so the
the originator this whole stress theory
was dr. hans selye it was a Canadian
physician that actually moved from
Canada and did some research here at
UCLA in the 1950s and this gentleman
really pioneer all what we know about
stress today so he conducted this
research over 40 years of research and
he said that stress in a nutshell is the
nonspecific response of the body to any
demand put upon it so even though you
might think of stress as being an egg
effect you can have stress even from a
positive effect if you win a lottery
ticket which is a wonderful thing to do
that can stress your body and your mind
the same thing as if a lady that has
lost her son in the war has the stress
of losing the Sun a stress of the death
if this son somehow reappears and there
were not many cases like around world
war 2 where people were lost in the
jungles and then they reappeared well
just the stress of reaching him after so
many years will also create this havoc
in the body so when you talk about
stress the body goes through different
phases so it is broken down according to
the work of dr. Sonia into three
different stages one is the alarm phase
the alarm phase defines the initial
reaction to the stressor in other words
if you're under a situation from our ol
ancestry where we might have been
confronting different wild animals or
different tribes that would come and
raid the villager or the enclave you
will have this fight or flight mechanism
and this is really what gets set up in
our system this is the damaging part
that occurs within our body so when we
are in this constant state of stress
even though when we go out you know
we're not very likely going to encounter
any tigers or wild bears outside here in
Santa market but if you drive out of
this parking lot and you're not careful
what happens some car is coming down at
40 50 60 miles an hour 20 30 miles an
hour over the speed limit that creates
the same effect within our body as in
ancient time where we might have gone
out into the jungle and encounter all
these different elements so this is a
very important idea to see that we are
under the stress so the body has to cope
with the stress and it goes through
different phases if you're under
constant stress it becomes a resistance
phase so this taxes the body both
mentally and physically and if it's
prolonged prolonged over a long term of
time it becomes the exhaust l'espace
so at this point the system gets run
down okay and people have different
abilities of holding a pattern holding a
strong response to ER stress but over
time they will get run down if people
are constantly under stress time will
take its toll so how to deal with that
and how to improve the body's ability to
cope with that is where oriental
medicine is coming in why does it come
in because they recognize thousands of
years ago that the body has this innate
ability to be strong enough to deal with
different situations so you don't look
at the disease process but you actually
look at the terrain you look at how is
the organism doing while there's some
people that can get flus and colds every
time there's a fluent calls that comes
around and other individuals that don't
it's not the flu and cold is the same
virus it's your body's ability and your
body's own resistance so if your body is
strong if you have that immune response
that is very very appropriate to the
different circumstances you can
withstand a lot of these external
influences in ancient time they call
them external influences nowadays we
recognize them as viruses and bugs and
flus so stress is unavailable it can be
a positive negative the body count Lee
adapts and I just to stress it's very
interesting over my 35 years of practice
I've very often encounter patients that
were in concentration camps in Germany
during the Holocaust and yet the body
was able to adapt and as far as I'm
concerned that's just about the most
extreme stress that you can suffer some
of these individuals had been there for
34 years even as youngsters teenagers
and nowadays they're in their 80s how
did they cope all these years is that
their body had the ability to adapt as
much as it was suffering as much as it
was sad and a difficult time some of
people lost most of their relatives they
were able to adapt and that's the one
thing about the nervous system it has
this innate ability to adapt to stress
some individuals
that more than others so that's the key
thing now besides the actual so
individuals are unique to their respond
to stressor besides the ability to adapt
there are certain things that come into
place is these mechanisms of stress so
within the stress once you have this
stress factor that comes into place
there's a specific mechanism that is
triggered within the body so I want you
all look at this chart and see that you
have these basic centers within the
brain that correlate with a hormonal
system so this little graph is very
simple will show you how the pattern
goes you have the stimuli or you have
the stressor it affects the hypothalamus
this major like a major switchboard in
the brain that sends a message to the
pituitary gland which in turns release
is ACTH which is cortisol so when you
under the stress and constant stress
this mechanism keeps on going on and on
and on so it's a like a feedback
mechanism and it goes back and then it
releases more the idea being you need to
try and buffer this mechanism and how
you do it is by incorporating to your
daily lifestyle things such as
meditation acupuncture herbal medicine
and the Tai Chi exercise so the stress
can affect the body many different ways
some people get panic disorders this is
more of a drastic effect of the stress
within the body you can get the phobias
general and vy VZ store or the so called
post-traumatic stress post-traumatic
stress is very much into the news
nowadays especially since what since the
Iraq conflict we get a lot of veterans
coming back since the Afghan war however
this post traumatic stress had existed
way back in Vietnam and even in World
War 2 accepted was not well recognized
documented now more and more veterans
are coming back there's more ailments
that showing up and it affects a
multitude of system especially the
immune system the immune system gets
this
depressed when you are in this most
traumatic stress condition though that
is the the one side of the spectrum
where all our experience some of these
stresses at one point or another so in a
graphic way you can see the hypothalamus
up in the brain it releases this stress
factor through the pituitary in the
master gland and that's ACTH the adrenal
cortical stimulating hormone it releases
cortisol so cortisol is what really
damages the body over long term we all
have it when we need the extra strength
or the extra boost if you if any of you
have been in in the ocean and there's a
Riptide or current or big wave and you
really need that extra boost of
adrenaline power you will get it that is
good however if you have it sustained
over long periods of time that will
damage and that will do a deep
depression of your immune system so how
does traditional reenter medicine trees
stress on the left you see the picture
that's the herbal medicine you have the
acupuncture and you have the different
tools such as the cuffing and massage
and the right side is the diagram of the
acupuncture system acupuncture or the
acupuncture original theory is based on
the idea of Chi Chi is the Chinese word
for translation for energy in ancient
Greek they call it Numa in Indian
medicine or yoga how many of you have
studied yoga a few people have studied
that would be prana or the breath energy
that is done through yogic exercises and
many different cultures have this idea
of energy and energy balancing so if you
have this circulation of Chi that is
obstructed the acupuncture can actually
help the circulation it actually opens
up these blockages within the body so
according to the national survey over
health instead of over 2 million adults
receive acupuncture treatment within the
past three
you acupuncture has become a very common
practice when I started here when dr.
Kim started 30 40 years ago very few
people would have acupuncture outside
the oriental community either you had it
in Chinatown Korea and Japan that but
now it's become an established mode of
therapy as well recognized of its
therapeutic effect and the National
Institute of Health is conducting
Studies on that face so IQ puncture and
oriental medicine it is a complete
system in that they look at the mind and
body but it also will offer different
types of therapies one of them is herbal
medicine Asian bodywork you all have
experienced some of the trina the
massage diamo that is the idea of the
bodywork is one of the fields of
practice of Oriental Medicine the other
one we call it Chi exercise or energy
exercise anything like chi gong which is
the Chinese version of yoga tai chi the
school slow moving at slow movement
exercise that connects the mind body and
breath all those are integrated into the
practice and this has really developed
here in the States in the last 30 years
so oriental medicine does look at the
body as a total not as each individual
symptoms so when you have oriental
medicine and dr. Kim would do a
demonstration he will show you how he
makes these assessment and how he treats
you want to see the body as a whole not
just physical not just mental the
integration or both and some of the
classics of Oriental Medicine going back
to the Yellow Emperor who was
traditionally the founder of oriental
medicine was 5,000 years ago he
discussed the relationship of motions
emotions and organ system so we know
that emotion organ system are
inter-related today we have a new field
called psychoneuroimmunology it's a very
long fancy word to meaning integration
of mind body and immunity this is
nothing new the Oriental medical system
had it within its resources within its
tradition and within his medical texts
so the world organization the dub
h/o which is based out of Geneva they
recognize oriental medicine as a
modality of treatment for over 40 type
of diseases and some of them you might
think yeah we all know that acupuncture
has effect on joints and maybe on bones
but it does have effect on respiratory
system you know a lot of patients have
had acupuncture for allergies and asthma
and had very good positive effects so
certain disease processes that we might
not be so familiar with terms of
acupuncture are really very very
effective and respond quite nicely with
acupuncture so post-traumatic stress is
one of the areas that are actually being
treated and we have some of our alumni
and practitioner at are doing some
research with a VA right now if you can
treat and help in an individual with a
post-traumatic stress disorder it
certainly is much easier to work with
somebody that doesn't have this extreme
case so this is an extreme case with
oriental medicine can come in handy um
another tool that we have at our
disposal is so-called adaptogenic herbs
the word adaptogen is really a word that
was coined by a couple of former Soviet
Union physicians and they found out that
there are certain herbs that help to
increase the body's resistance to
disease they have to increase the body's
resistance to extreme temperatures and
extreme environmental factors so these
are dr. genic herbs help the body cope
more effectively with stress okay they
have a general strengthening effect for
the body and they especially work on the
adrenal gland so the adrenal glands are
a key mechanism that helps to respond
our ability to cope with stress okay so
what are these adaptogenic d'oeuvres and
what do they do they have an antioxidant
activity that's one of the key things of
damage within the body so they help to
buffer that it improves blood and sugar
metabolism it normalizes sugar
herbalism improves resistance increases
energy and stamina muscle tone strength
better focus concentration anxiety sleep
and a general feeling of well-being now
in the former Soviet Union they did some
research on some of these herbs and some
of these herbs were very effective for
their space program there are athletic
programs and also there the productivity
and they done some research in factories
research that lasted up to 10 years of
research on penn's of thousands of
employees and they found that that the
individual that we're taking some of
these herbs they had less time off at
work they were much better in health
wise and productivity than the people
that did not take these herbs so some of
these herbs you might have heard some of
these herbs ginseng is the most probably
most famous herb from the Orient there's
chinese korean japanese and even an
American variety of ginseng that is grow
in Wisconsin and one of our forefathers
here in America his name was Daniel
Boone you all know Daniel Boone he was a
very big ginseng trader so he actually
went cultivated the ginseng and shipped
it to Asia and had a whole listen on
that the other herb is a lutrel sabir
also known as siberian ginseng this one
was the main herb that they researched
in the Soviet Union and this herb had
1200 scientists that worked on it for 40
years in today's cost it would have been
five billion dollars worth of research
on this one herb that the former Soviet
Union did and found tremendous
properties in terms of helping the body
cope with stress and then another one's
called a stragglers that's one of the
most famous Chinese herb and she Sandra
she Sandra also known as we wait two or
five flavor bury these are tiny little
berries that are using Chinese
pharmacopoeia they are so valuable than
in ancient time they were also used as a
taxation system so you all know the
terms salary salary comes from the Latin
word salad which means
in ancient times people in the Roman
days used to be paid by portions of salt
that was almost their salary salario is
the the Latin word in terms of the
schisandra these five little berry pill
it has some very interesting properties
because in Chinese medicine we have five
major organs and these berries have
these five different flavors so
according to oriental medicine it
strengthens up all the organs however
all the modern research has found out
that has a lot of volatile balls and
other components that are very
beneficial for the immune system so
ginseng the most well-known and if you
can see it here it has the shape of a
man called ren Shannon in Chinese which
means man's root and it is one of the
most interesting herb that he has this
homeostatic ability it has the ability
to regularize the body where often
somebody has low blood pressure it will
raise the blood pressure if the blood
pressure is low and needs to come up
he'll go up but if it's high it will
bring it down also will have sugar
metabolism if the person is overtired it
will help to strengthen stimulate the
body unlike caffeine and if the person
is too revved up it would balance them
out so it has this normalizing function
or homeostatic function and of course it
has this ability to endure and buffer
the effects the negative effects of
stress on the body another point that I
want to share with you this something
you can have right here at the tip of
your fingers and you can massage
yourself there may be from points on the
body one of the main points of the body
that you might have had when you did
acupressure treatments here with our
fine therapist called Shan men shen men
is on the other side of your of your
wrist so if everybody wants to look at
this point take your thumb you see where
your little finger goes rather the
junction of that wrist this is at a
point in Chinese shen Min spirit man is
gate but it has effects I'm calming the
mind tranquilizing the body helps relax
the nervous
harmonizes mind and body this is a very
good point you can massage when you feel
stressed and you just need a little time
to relax so it is an acupressure point
also can be used with acupuncture but
you can massage it yourself so when you
feel stress you can apply this point and
it will help relax the body it's a very
basic acupressure point so you can learn
one item you can take home today is the
acupressure point and another thing that
we want to touch upon is that there is
things such as tai chi and qigong the
moving meditation which is a wonderful
exercise and we also have outreach
classes through our acupuncture college
college oriental medicine which we offer
to the public and you might look into
that too and maybe there's some classes
here at Google on Tai Chi and yoga so I
think without further delay i'm going to
give the mic to dr. Kim and you will do
a introduction on meditation and then at
the end we can open for
question-and-answer so thank you thank
you very much anybody has pain what kind
of pain to that keep doing okay anybody
else has any pain low back pain how long
did you have their pain do you have a

dr. Kim Renee is doing a diagnostic
method where he's taking the ball the
acupuncture Meridian system at the
ancient diagnostic mission home is very
effective ok I use the tongue to assess
these are you craving for wheat flour
product red or spaghetti things like
that do you like what you like it right
you're like hi whenever you eat a lot of
bread or spaghetti you will have more
pain there yeah so I should have should
it should reduce the reduced wheat flour

watches that yet so we'll lose your low
back pain where is it do you feel right
now it's there yeah turn around see
where where is it I read this area
so again is doing the pulse assessment
on the right side you can assess
different organ systems such as the
digestion respiration circulation and
liver gallbladder small intestine large
intestine stomach scream so you'll get
an assessment that you determine the
weakness in the body and go ahead and
proceed with that so that's that's what
what he returned and dr. Kim has
probably put over five million of those
Eagles for 40 years about at least
150,000 a year do you feel any sensation
on your row back right now yeah you can
feel okay just relax

keep your back pain day when the female
organ energy is not flow freely we have
more pain or when the large intestine is
not freely flow then you have more pain

have less pain and that's a fact also
small intestine to that's all it is see
if you feel better you're back now voice
okay we're okay that's fine I can how
long does that pain obvious neck pain
five years off and on
and you welcome to ask questions we can
have Q&amp;amp;A right now while he's treating
you can go ahead and treat them and
speak at the same time and I can try to
relax I have any questions about what
he's doing what what type of assessments
or treatment injury
so he is using different points
obviously it's the art is finally which
are the points individually the person
or the patient needs so there's a whole
combination of points you can use you
can select the points any of the 12
principal acupuncture me symptoms pain
on your back still there is pain yeah
it's loosened up fifty percent of
loosened up so I / bad know how many
percent is loosened up ten percent fifty
percent maybe twenty thirty cents yeah
it's better
interest like that that's that whole
idea of relaxation response and that's
how I coupon chose who can work on
stress this right nice work can be
painful okay anybody has any questions
about acupuncture or medicine is this
you need you need a year of you buy
anywhere for 210 treatment that's it
the clinic next life this is the I
persuade me so an empress clinic we
usually have our interns working under
the direct supervision of dr. dr. King
ague the chow we have many different
supervisors to the internet will do the
treatment can be under the guidance and
advice of their supervisors supervisor
cannot have anywhere between whining and
15 years of experience in the field of
Oriental Medicine so the patient comes
in gets an assessment of course the
interns not going to take 30 seconds to
assess if that takes only after 40 years
of practice you can do that it's going
to spend probably about an hour an hour
and 15 minutes make the determination
what the weakness is in the middle body
configuration your rental medical
assessments with a pause the Tong
questioning and at that point in we
determine which is the best type of
treatment he can give you and also
prescribe individualized purple compound
that will work on the innate weaknesses
that you might have so I see here that
you have a special offer for Googlers
twenty dollars for the treatment which
is very good after year you can get out
Ashton the back stay around turn around
walk around a few block worker if you
put in the work of your blogs and then
come back
any pain it's completely free yeah I
mean it was not all before I don't do
anything okay okay sit down okay okay so
these two niggas thinking care over her
low back this is temporarily to get rid
of the pain to get rid of this pain
permanently you need some more treatment
to make you female Olga and large
intestine healthier then you can
permanently get rid of this pain this
treatment will last for a while and
depends on how the energy goes in your
female organ and large intestine we
called o chão pain may come there if
it's conveys should be less than used to
be but then download many months later
it may come back again any questions ok
that's it ok any other questions that
you might have
the course of treatment at the it varies
depending on over the initiation of this
mission they might require two digit 5
is a very active position in this case
one treatment you feel the change but
you might have to have some herbs if it
