the biology department at Stanford but
that completely missed States his
background these physicist and an
engineer and has all kinds of advanced
degrees to prove that and is one of the
real movers both at the global level in
in climate change and within Stanford in
the new Stanford Institute for the
environment and and I who don't have
nearly so many degrees or qualifications
I'm a lawyer and an economist and or
tend to work on climate policy and we're
here to to talk about what's going on in
the climate area and and and and
certainly to respond to questions or
things in which you guys have a
particular interest so I hope you feel
really free to interrupt us and and
we'll try and take the discussion where
you'd like it to go so thanks Robin and
for having us here and it's up to Steve
now thanks Tom and I'll just use this
little thing here and I'll do on that
particular screen I don't know where I
got that from and I hope that nobody's
going to sue me for stealing their
around their logo but I figured you know
how you always write your company where
you're going to you're giving a talk and
I said I got an idea it took a long time
to figure out how to make that stay on
the screen and that disappear I wondered
if you guys put something in it but it
worked anyhow I'm going to try to talk
about this question can we define let
alone fix quote dangerous you'll see why
there's a quote clearly in 25 minutes is
not going to be possible to give you
more than a very fast overview of a lot
of interrelated issues and I think
that's better than some technically
detailed talk and read his technical
question ask it and we'll do it
afterward well tom is going to talk
about Kyoto that was just a cartoon that
was in the subways when the kyoto
protocol was negotiated back in 1997 you
may remember that was amazing to watch
an entire town linked around this of
course what I wanted to get to is that
the earth is looking kind of sad and
it's got the thermometer and when I was
showing this for another I just did a
medical book and on cancer one of the
for the students in med school were
there and they said but that's not the
accurate kind of thermometer and I said
well would have been an interesting
challenge for the artist if we use the
more accurate thermometer where to put
it and without losing a beat the kid
said Texas anyhow okay so what are the
thermometers of the world tell you by
the way the least greenhouse gas
emissions per capita in the United
States is the state we're sitting in and
the highest is the aforementioned
location of thermometer okay so here's
what we call global warming this is the
sum of the thermometers of the world
their widespread I don't have time to go
into why we have very large error bars
early and not as large in the beginning
but you could probably figure it out
much less coverage then less reliable
instruments better now this this is a
five year old picture you don't see that
we've been up here and that there's a
big debate with NASA saying we're now at
the warmest year in the last several
thousand and the Brits saying no it's
only number two but this made an
entertaining media dichotomy but in fact
there are a couple of hundreds of agree
apart and nobody can tell to the
statistical error even to twice that so
all we know is that we're about seven
tenths of a degree c plus or minus a few
tenths warmer than we were a century ago
and that if you look back over thousands
of years you can find events like this
one from 1920 onto 1940 but the overall
combination in particularly this rapid
rise of almost half degrees C in the
last three centuries we last three
decades we can't find any precedent and
there's lots of what we call
fingerprints to try to say how much of
that is nature and how much of that is
us global warming is not controversial
unless you listen those famous
professors Limbaugh and Crichton and
what's controversial is the extent to
which this is part of the natural system
versus how much we did
okay well what contributes to it is
greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and then
there's anybody know what that is we
were talking Africa right this there's
Kilimanjaro back there and that's when I
was very young and very thin and there
was still snow up in Kilimanjaro and the
reason to point out termites is there
imagine a chiral source of methane
methane is one of the greenhouse gases a
rather effective one is about one
hundred and fifty percent more of its
than before the Industrial Revolution
about thirty percent more co2 and we are
pretty sure that we are responsible for
that methane through a combination of
land use animal agriculture and leaky
coal mines and gas pipes co2 mostly
burning of fossil fuel some
deforestation cement making and so forth
so we know all that and and nature is
part of it were part of it when we talk
about climate change we generally mean
and this is a definition a legal
definition the anthropogenic the
augmentation to the natural system
because that has culpability namely us
and then we look at the at the risks of
those changes versus the costs of trying
to fix it and that tends to be the
policy argument but Tom will give you
much more and that it's much more subtle
than that ok back to kilimanjaro so
here's the snows of kilimanjaro rapidly
disappearing when i was there somewhere
around here and it's amazing to think
that in your own lifetime about thirty
percent of the ice disappeared and it's
not just there this is Glacier National
Park a nice icon for ice and the yellow
and the red together where the glaciers
were in 1850 the yellow is where they
were in 1993 they're disappearing fast
and our children and certainly our
grandchildren will have no glaciers left
in Glacier National Park and most
economists say so what this will go
anyway so then we get into the argument
out what's important how do we value it
and as every hour things traded in
markets the only measure of value and
we'll get to that one a little bit more
later okay let's get more local so what
we're looking at us on a century ago
till now the blue is the San Joaquin
Basin rivers and the red is a Sacramento
and basically this is a snowmelt map
life blood of California is water about
fifty percent stored in various dams
controversial as some are and the other
half is stored naturally in snowpack and
if you get warmer what a surprise the
snowpack melts earlier and is less there
at the end of the season so when you
need it most in our Mediterranean
climate toward the end of the summer is
when you'll have less of it plus if
you're hotter than you have higher
evaporative demand for agriculture and
cities and you have more worries about
forest fires all of that has really
focused Californians in an amazing way
it's been very bipartisan I am actually
pretty proud of the state that when Gray
Davis signed the Pavley bill to control
tailpipe emissions that for greenhouse
gases currently in court with the
automakers and the Bush administration
on the same side it was I was at that
thing at the Presidio and the Democratic
governor was there now just the last
year a couple of my colleagues and I
were sitting behind the governator and
that's because he not only accepted that
bill but he extended it to the largest
greenhouse gas cutting announcement in
the world and we are the fifth largest
economy argue one or two and the tenth
largest emitter of greenhouse gases so
it had clout so why can you get that
kind of bipartisanship on this issue
when you can't on others and inside the
Washington Beltway it's hopeless it's
because we're already a couple of weeks
earlier in the spring getting our
maximum run off this isn't just theory
on the other hand the theory says you
get warmer you melt snow duh this is not
surprising and when people say oh well
there must be some statistics tricks
yeah it's it's it's called ice melts at
freezing and there's the data of what
what's happened in the spring season so
this is warming couple of degrees C in
our area large in the global average or
says less than 1 notice that it got a
little bit cooler over there and there
are people say AHA no global warming i
found an exception it once i find an
exception i have disproved the rule uh
uh huh and you flip a coin a hundred
times and you do this experiment a bun
times you get 80 heads anybody think
that coin is not loaded of course it's
loaded well when it comes up when it
comes up tails that's the you know the
twenty percent time ah that proves the
coin isn't loaded that's the kind of
nonsense you here in the US Senate right
now the kind of nonsense you read daily
and editorial page is the Wall Street
Journal and those famous climate
professors Limbaugh and Crichton and it
goes on all the time and the media gives
equal credence to these people to 300
scientists studies that took four years
tom and i are both involved in the
intergovernmental panel on climate
change and we get pretty frustrated at
the level of debate where all sides have
given equal access there's no quality
control and you only have 20 seconds to
explain it so what you do is you get
equal status at the bargaining table for
ridiculously non-credible positions and
the only way people can find out is that
they go to your website and they read
real stuff and they have to put in and
also an affirmative action to do that if
we're going to get any policy to deal
with these things as Tom we'll talk
about later you have to have both
governments industry and public buy-in
and it's hard to get public by in when
they're bamboozled into complete
confusion well I won't talk about Carl
reef bleaching but we know that a couple
more degrees in there it's going to be
very very difficult for these reefs to
survive you could value them
economically by the fishing you could
value them by the tourists or you could
say wait a minute why does one species
us have the right when we're hell-bent
on doubling our numbers as fast as
possible and and quintuple economy as
fast as possible to knock out twenty
percent of the rest of the species well
we could have been just as rich three
years later if we did it more sensibly
and in a way that's where the debate
comes along and how you value these
things is not science its values okay
remember I said it's more controversial
whether what we've observed the warming
is not controversial I mean there are
still a few deniers around and even a
few with PhDs but they are there a tiny
minority and basically a joke in the
scientific community but how do you know
how much we did so this is some work
that's done mostly here at Stanford
Terry root my wife I have to you know
confess the bias I'm the last author and
there's some
least important and dynamic Manaus kyun
Mike Mastin Draya did it and what we
were looking at is what we call joint
attribution it's been well known that if
you look at climate models and surface
thermometers and you drive these models
with natural forces like sunspot effects
on energy and volcanoes and then you
drive them with anthropogenic forces
that means like greenhouse gases
aerosols that you get higher correlation
with the observed network of
thermometers when you drive them with
anthropogenic than with natural and even
higher when you do the sum but then
people have said all the thermometers
aren't any good and the satellite says
something else which isn't true anymore
but all these arguments are out there so
we said why don't we jump around the
debate about the quality of thermometers
that they're not widespread that not all
over the world and let the plants and
animals serve as a proxy thermometer and
that's what this is so what we're
looking at here is we're looking at
spring events so it's when flowers bloom
when birds come back when eggs are laid
and there's a couple of hundred that do
we got from long term records and there
they go from 1970 and the left side is
this laser working badly can I do this
this way yeah from down here across this
is the index of phenology phenology
means sequence so 106 means a hundred
and six days after January one so 128
means that it's late in the spring 106
means it's early in the spring and
there's a negative trend exactly the
same as the river run off that you saw
in California is replicated in birds and
cherry blossoms all around the world
this is a global signal where a couple
of weeks earlier in spring then we were
and this is consistent with warming the
question is warming due to whom so we
went to complete probably the world's
best climate model which happens to be
in the UK now and we took a look at the
index of phenology when you checked
these plant and animal movements against
an artificial data set produced by a
climate model driven only by natural
forces on spots volcanoes and what you
see is essentially noise nothing very
very
weak negative correlation what happens
and that's the lower left panel when you
drive it with anthropogenic forces well
you can see I can't there we are it's
quite negatively sloped meaning earlier
in the spring yeah not because the first
one is observed and and it's against
year right because year is the surrogate
forming now what we're going to do is
we're going to take a look at the at the
temperature which is produced in the
model so you could correlate temperature
in year and you could plot them if you
want it to that way but this is a little
more standard in the literature so we
just stayed with the typical model but
it could be translated what you see is a
downslope and what that tells you is
that the model driven by anthropogenic
forces is getting much higher
correlations with the plant and animal
data for the early bloom then the
natural not circumstantial but it's got
a very very high very very high
statistical significance and then when
you combine them you do even better now
is this proof no but it's pretty
compelling and it's one of a bunch of
things that we do so when the scientific
community says a discernible impact of
humans on climate it's a very very
credible statement in any one system and
in any one system you never know maybe
we've got the right answer for the wrong
reason so we not going to show this to
you but we disaggregated by birds by
trees by continent and of course every
time you do that you get less of the
variance explained but you get the same
basic pattern it's pretty tough for this
not to be real and it is also consistent
with what the thermometers told us 10
years ago this is not a surprise it's
just it gets rid of the argument oh you
don't have adequate thermometer coverage
because plants and animals don't know
anything about urban heat islands they
don't know anything about thermometers
moving out to airports they just respond
to what they get so that was one of the
reasons so what I want to try to
convince you is yes is something going
on and yes we're at least part of this
story okay so now let's get to this
question was in my title and I'm try to
what have I got 10 15 okay good so
here's Munich ray a reinsurance company
and they're not very happy about what
they've been doing which is paying out
Giga boxed not talking megabucks anymore
especially for hurricane victims but
also for bushfires the 30,000 people who
died in the heat waves in Europe in 2003
when they had a 4 sigma event has
certainly got the attention of that
trillion-dollar industry and they're
sort of the they're the boxing partner
for the fossil fuel industry which is
generally in denial and the insurance
companies generally hysterical and
that's obvious why in both cases they do
that and so he said we have to stop this
dangerous experiment so what does it
mean well let me show you the law of the
land this is the United Nations
Framework Convention anybody remember
the rio conference 1992 okay well
President Bush as in senior went there
he signed this not initially but he did
and it was ratified by the US Senate so
it is in fact the law of the land and
how many other countries tom 180
something i think it is the most signed
international agreement in the world 189
okay don't read it all just the red is
what we want to see stabilization of
greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere at a level would here's the
d-word prevent dangerous anthropogenic
interference of the climate system great
what does that mean well it means echo
system should adapt naturally food
production should not be threatened and
economic development should be
sustainable okay fine what is dangerous
mean still not to find so those of us in
the IPCC right the intergovernmental
panel on climate change and I happen to
be leading the chapter in working group
to which is vulnerability and impacts
chapter is called key vulnerabilities
and the risks of climate change in other
words what the government's want us to
do is address article 2 what is
dangerous anthropogenic interference so
we scientists immediately kicked it back
said we can't tell you that dangerous is
a value judgment it's about
acceptability no no you're the experts
so this football was getting kicked back
and forth we in government saying you do
it and we're saying we say you do it and
finally the compromise that we reached
so far so good is the role of science is
to tell you what can happen what are the
odds that's risk the role of
policymakers is to decide how much risk
is acceptable and how do you weigh the
loss of coral reefs versus the income
gained by shipping companies in the
Arctic sea ice melts there is no
calculus that can give you that as a
right answer that's value trade-offs
across in commensurate dimensions of our
metrics value and there are a lot of
methods out there a lot of them are very
mono directed toward only one value
system and what we try to do is be as
explicit as possible in the alternative
views that people have on making those
trade-offs okay so who decides what is
dangerous well individuals when they
make decisions villages States
corporations countries and
intergovernmental organizations all
defining it differently if you're in the
small island state your belief is it's
already dangerous coastal erosion sea
levels and increased hurricane
intensities have gone over the top of
them that is certainly not the view of
people who are investing in oil sands in
Canada so the hell no five degrees we
got two centuries let's not worry about
it we need to develop we need the oil so
you're going to hear all the time a
classical debate what's more moral
leaving the future richer a legacy of
wealth and infrastructure by not trying
to shackle entrepreneurial activity now
or leaving the future having to deal
with rising sea level melting glaciers
knocked out biodiversity increased
hurricane intensities and and maybe
flipped off Gulfstream's so you're
trading them off and a lot of the worst
events are a hundred years away though
you'd be building them into your
behavior in the next few decades but if
you discount the world than anything
ever over a percent it has very little
present value now the debate over
economics comes down to what your
discount rate is some economists will
tell you that's prescribed by market
behavior others they oh no no when
you're talking about planetary life
support systems markets have nothing
do it its ethics so this is all part of
why if you ever go to international
meetings at Tom will describe you hear
such a cacophonous debate where the US
will sit and they'll do cost-benefit
analysis of things traded in the market
since they talk about rationalism and
other countries will say one dollar one
votes not a rational paradigm that's for
it's immoral for people who have money
and then there's no conversation other
than finger-pointing not a very good way
to get international cooperation so it's
really key to get past that many ways to
define it and we'll talk a little bit
about that but it's ultimately as I've
told you not a scientific choice and
worse inherent uncertainty in every
stage in what can happen in what the
consequences are and in the cost of
fixing it and who pays to fix it we used
to start out with best guesses and it's
going to warm up two degrees that was
our best guess and people ran with that
and then we realize nobody buys
insurance because of the best gas the
best guess is your house won't burn down
and you won't get sick so obviously we
worry about the range the likelihood of
nasty outliers and we've been doing that
but now we've decided much more
important to do PDFs now in this
audience is pretty sophisticated when I
said the next slide which I actually
stole from mike maths and drea it works
really well with unsophisticated
audiences like Congress that's the only
PDF they've ever heard of and of course
the one that we're talking about is the
probability density function the upside
down I mean the upside down you the bell
curve so what is that this is how I
think you have to be when you're
honestly conveying what we know about
global warming in the future we're going
to have ten percent chance this is a
2100 should have said temperature change
above 2000 to the year 2100 where did
that spread come from it came from to
fans of uncertainty one fan is human
behavior how many people in the world
what standards of living will be
demanded what energy systems will use to
get there the other fan of uncertainty
comes in the internal dynamics of the
climate system how are clouds and other
things going to interact and amplify or
damp out what you predict it gives you a
very broad PDF you got a ten percent
chance that's ten percent area under
curve less than a degree baby doubling
where we are
think that means more Katrina's and euro
heat waves but certainly not going to
flip off the Gulf Stream on belt
Greenland and West Antarctica then out
here at the right hand end you've got a
10 or more percent this hasn't even
closed I mean the pdf's not even 20 but
that means is a small chance in the you
know and at least in the single digit
percentages that we could have larger
warming than the difference in a nice
asian interglacial cycle which is five
to seven in a century when the thousands
of years for those to play out that is
not a happy scenario I don't anyone who
argues that isn't a dangerous scenario
so you're back to risk management what
risk do you want to take remember
showing this and I'm gynec in the in
audience was an economist and and we're
always debating and I won't mention
names Tom but whoever it might have been
from Yale and and he said wait a minute
I do you mean to tell me you think that
the really big events the melting ice
sheets the larger reversibility is it
virtually everybody agrees we don't want
to happen there's only ten percent
chance of them you want us to redirect
industrial civilization for just ten
percent and we were eating salmon that
night and I said Joe which was not his
name there's only ten percent chance to
salmonella in the salmon so of course
you're going to eat it all right when
you fly home tomorrow there's only a
tenth of a percent chance the rivets are
going to pop off the airplane so of
course you're going to hop on it we
routinely what was the probability of
wmd we routinely make precautionary
decisions in medicine in business and
especially in the military at odds way
below that ten percent Russian roulette
with the Luger even though we're not
talking about killing us that's why you
salmonella so it is completely
irrational to argue that on the one hand
in business health and security we have
precautionary investments and actions
for less than one percent but in an
environmental science we have to be
ninety-nine percent objectively sure
this is what's called dripping hi
hypocrisy or even worse client pandering
for people who write campaign checks and
it's up to us to point that out and I as
you can tell I'm not try at that so what
we're talking about really is not truth
but
risk management it's about looking at
ranges of pds looking at the best that
science can produce and we these PDFs
who not drawn out of our left ear we use
a lot of data and a lot of a lot of
information from multiple areas okay
give me five okay all right so what we
have to do is assess risk is a function
of policy choices what you do is you say
what supposing we have the
business-as-usual world with triple co2
then you go back and you feed those
emissions into a carbon cycle model
which you then feed into a climate model
and it produces you know different
strengths hurricanes and different
patterns of droughts and floods and then
you feed that into models of Agriculture
and and look at the vulnerability of
society is organized in various ways and
if you don't like the outcomes you say
whoa whoa we get benefits by not being
so warm then people take a look at well
not being so warm means that you have to
increase the price of conventional
energy like a carbon tax or or some
tailpipe regulation how much does that
cost who pays and the cost-benefit
argument becomes how do you balance
those two analytically the way we do it
is we do scenarios of future World
Organization alternative technologies
and then we cost them through the
sequence of models so we're looking at
risk probability x consequence and
descriptive science the objective part
is what can happen and what are the odds
but now anybody want to tell me what the
objective data is on the temperature in
2050 2100 impossible frequent ism any of
you out here are classically trained in
statistics you're not going to like me
frequent ism is useless for the future
what you have to do is use frequencies
observations of systems various systems
of the past to construct models of
reality as you best can do them you
validate them against past events or
present data and then you put those
models together models of atmosphere
models of ocean models of ecosystem
models of population models of
technology and together they give you
projection capability from which you can
do monte carlo analysis which i assume
everybody knows what that is and that
you can
one of those nice bell curves but it's a
pseudo frequency because it's only as
good as the assumptions that went into
the construction of the models which are
based on current observations the future
is different it's disturbed and you
cannot be sure that what you learned in
the past is applicable and therefore in
the end the future is always subjective
where the frequencies like it or not it
doesn't mean it is an expert there's a
lot of expertise involved in trying to
pin down the relative credibility of
those projections that's how we do it
now to talk about this on the evening
news you get twenty second sound bites
in front of Congress five minutes not
too easy doing that i use gambling
metaphors and insurance metaphors
because it's very difficult to explain
truthfully that we don't have answers
nor will we have direct answers in
decades what we have is ranges
probabilities outcomes distributions of
lynners and losers and we're back in a
risk management so the normative
judgments the value judgments what is
safe what is dangerous what is fair and
who should pay that's the political
argument which time will tell you about
so you could say well let's just
internalize the externality this is back
from the bush one war and this was a
scientific american cartoon right the
gas was a thousand dollars a gallon we
have a little while for that yet and of
course the joke was that wait a minute
were under pricing because we spent all
that money defending the lines of oil
supply that's what you call
internalizing externalities it's an
externality to the energy companies what
happens to the asthmatic problems from
people who have to breathe air pollution
from improperly controlled exhausts or
the rising sea level or intensified
hurricanes so all of those have real
costs and if they're not part of the
cost of doing business then what you're
calling a free market is in fact a rig
market and it's rigged toward the status
quo so everybody here has a garbage can
picked up once a week right mine at
Stanford cost me five dollars actually
costs six because I'm lazy and I have
them pick it up on the curb if I put a
second I mean up up on the driveway not
on the curb if I put a second one out
it's two dollars why don't they charge
five again well because the truck is
there and the guys are there and its
economy of scale why isn't it free
because as labor truck landfill why is
my tailpipe your smokestack free what is
the
free market logic which I over and over
and over and over and over from the US
Senate that it's an interference or from
the energy industry or from the that
somehow this interference in free market
in fact it's restoring a free market to
charge the full freight it's just doing
things differently and it goes ox's that
are very powerful so that's again where
it's so important to this right well we
have certain policies of volunteerism
and I'd love this cartoon because can
you imagine the highway carnage rates of
speed limits and stop signs and traffic
lights were voluntary am I done I'm done
I won't tell you about New Orleans now
ask me about it later but the bottom
line about New Orleans is despite the
administration and others saying with
natural event natural event yes we don't
make hurricanes but we can soup them up
and in fact is very strong evidence that
there's a big increase the number of
category four and five and it's
definitely highly correlated in both
oceans to ocean surface warming and
that's a side effect we're already
seeing how much we want to spend getting
off the fossil fuel carbon a addiction
we're on to be able to slow that down
that's the political debate okay thanks
sure as long as people want
what did I do yeah here we go where I am
here okay look it's it's gonna have to
be really quick and then steve has has
already done a lot of really good work
and oh thanks right I tend to wander so
now stay here I'm going to talk about
policy issues and I'm going to be brutal
and and and and provocative and
basically steve was you know gave you
the outline that there have been two big
steps in trying to deal with building a
global regime to handle the problems
that that I hope Steve has persuaded you
are very real problems the first steps
were taken in Rio in 1992 with the earth
summit the second steps were taken in
December 1970 1997 at Kyoto with the the
writing of the Kyoto Protocol the
negotiations have been continuous since
that time and they were there there have
been lots of battles remember the u.s.
left in march two thousand and one after
the negotiations had essentially broken
down in meetings at the hague in
december at the end of november
beginning december two thousand when the
election was just hanging in the balance
before the supreme court no one quite
knew who was going to succeed today to
the clinton administration but the
latest events took place in montreal a
little over a month ago Robin Sergey
were there for four part of this circus
and and and and I'm going to try and
both bring you up to where things are
and give you just a little bit of an
explanation of why I think we have run
into what effectively I'm sorry to say
maybe a dead end with respect to the way
we have framed and tried to remedy the
problem so far I hope I'm wrong because
I I don't terribly like the idea of
starting over but much of what I'm
working on and what uh what a book that
some of this presentation is drawn from
will be about our about alternative
approaches if it is true that we have
run into kind of a political cul-de-sac
a dead end on the way that we've been
approaching things so far so let me just
make a few points here and the book is
going to be structured or at least the
first part of it about a series of myths
I'm just going to talk about a couple of
them right now climate change is not a
problem Steve I hope as simply destroyed
that these are just some issues that
people like Crichton and and and and
Lynn ball and others tend to bring up in
fact some scientists do I'm not going to
spend any time on that because Steve can
do a better job and it's not worth it I
do want to talk about a couple things
sometimes people say you vero let's
debate about peak oil or that fossil
fuels are running out and the problem is
going to solve itself because we're
going to be out of the major sources of
fuels that that that are the principal
sources of greenhouse gases I just if we
put our money there we're going to lose
our bets because what we're seeing
around the world right now is that
reserves of fossil fuels even in the oil
and gas sector let alone the coal sector
are a function of price and when price
gets up in the levels where we are right
now in the sixty to seventy dollar range
you've got a whole series of reserves
coming online some of them I've listed
here heavy oils whether they're in
Venezuela in the Orinoco Basin or up in
Canada in Alberta in the tar sands or
enhanced oil recovery deep water and
cold climate drilling
there are a whole series of reserves
that are out there that that don't make
or let me put it this way that delay the
any argument that we are running out of
fossil fuels to a point at which we will
have already cooked ourselves and done
the damage that climate is is is is
threatening us with so I just don't want
to stay there there's lots more data we
could do interesting pictures that that
you may have seen we could obviously do
a much better job with Google Earth then
these pictures are so far but many of
the problems if you look at where the
the lights are on which is basically the
white relative to where the major fossil
fuel and this means oil and gas rather
than coal reserves are you'll see the
problems are essentially infrastructure
or transportation problems it is moving
the gas from where it is found to the
places where the energy is demanded but
those problems while they're extremely
important are not the same as we're
going to run out and we have to do is we
have to take certain measures in order
to to forestall that there are
interesting issues that are worth
talking about in the question of the
intersection between energy security and
the way we get our power because it may
be that prices when you do add in
security costs have have are escalating
to a point that which alternative fuels
will actually be commercially more
successful than they've been in the past
but if we do have a less
carbon-intensive future it's not because
the fuels are not there for the
significant period that would that that
would produce that result okay I'm not
going to say too much about this
engineers myth here it's something that
we're spending a lot of time working on
but I just want to make a couple of
points there is a sense often among
people that if you come up with a
technological solution it's going to
spring forth and multiply in other words
conceptually if you figure something out
that it's that it really does provide a
potential solution to a problem like
climate change the process the problem
of course is that really the speed the
scale and the price paths of various
technical possibilities and as you can
see up here these are just highlights
from various studies of past experience
the the problems of getting from a very
good idea that is in the mind of some
engineer to something that is
commercially sustainable over time is a
much more complex path and it often
involves what what we could call fight
back by existing technologies and this
is particularly true in the fossil fuel
sectors because there's a huge amount of
room for prices to come down if the as
they become threatened by alternative
sources so the big question that then
I'm going to come to this at the end is
trying to figure out what we can do
about trying to speed up increase the
scale and and and and lower the price
paths of technologies which often means
focusing on a lot of stuff other than
the pure science it means focusing off
on and institutions and problems that
get in the way of a of a technology
coming forward from somebody's good idea
to a commercial scale that diffuses
throughout the world at a pace that is
much more suited to to solving the
problems I'm going to skip by we get a
lot of data on learning curves and all
the rest of that stuff that will appear
in the book and the only thing I will
say is that historically as this will
show you there is a very slow evolution
in private and in primary energy systems
in other words there has been a cycle
often of about 50 years in which you see
substantial shift occurring in which one
dominant fuel source changes its its
proportion of the total portfolio of
fuels and that's largely because most
fuels run through complicated
infrastructures and once those
infrastructures are in place they're
going to be there for some time and and
the issues associated with this so
our extreme at the present time because
i'll just give you an example i spend a
lot of my time in China and India and in
China right now they are building in the
past year and a half at a rate of about
70 gigawatts a year of power okay that's
and it's England's power source being
added every year and and somewhat more
if that's kool given what we can do at
the present time with engineering we
used to say the lifetime of a coal plant
was 35 years that's ridiculous now a
coal plant last practically forever with
what engineers are able to do to it
nuclear plans we used to say how to
40-year lifetime not anymore nuclear
plants is least 60 and well beyond
because the engineering is improving so
what we do now matters tremendously in
terms of the climate footprint that we
put down in the future okay now here's
where I'd like to focus some of a bit
more of my of my argument to you and
it's pretty simple i would certainly
stress that the problems that we're
experiencing in the kyoto regime and the
and the policy side of dealing with
climate are certainly not problems
caused by scientific disagreement steve
has made that point then I think it's
absolutely true the scientific evidence
the consensus about what is happening is
is is overwhelming and I want to suggest
to you that another problem that people
often throw up as as the reason why
we're having such difficulty in policy
it's because we really haven't designed
the regime very well we haven't had
smart enough people who know the
economics in there and then and I want
to argue to you exactly the opposite I
want to argue that in the years that
I've been working on this which has been
since 1992 I'm not quite as long as
Steve but I've been at it for some time
now the last thing that is the source of
the problem is weak economics in the
sense of people who are trained
economists at a very high level applying
themselves to solving this problem
indeed I would argue that when we look
at the structure of the Rio treaty the
United United Nations Framework on
climate change and on the Kyoto Protocol
that was formed under that framework
treaty you see a structure that anyone
teaching economics 101 or environmental
economics at Stanford or any other good
place would say gee they did a pretty
good job of figuring out how you're
supposed to deal with a global problem
like that and let me just illustrate
what I mean the first thing we know that
climate is a global collective good in
the sense that it doesn't matter where
in the world you put climate you put you
put greenhouse gases into the system or
where you pull them out the effect on
the overall climate system is basically
the chain the same that doesn't mean the
impact is the same it's different in
California than it is in Africa but what
it does mean is the emissions and the
sequestration the addition or removal of
emissions happen anywhere so everybody
ought to be involved Global good you
should have a global regime and that's
what we've done that's why we've got 189
members in the in the climate change
negotiations at the present time because
it's theoretically correct that
everybody should be part of this system
secondly we have overwhelmingly focused
on cost-benefit analysis to set the
level of stable concentrations that is
what is the goal well if you've spent
time with in the IPCC the UN body of
experts that deals with this what you
have our big attempts to figure out what
the costs of reducing emissions are and
much less successful attempts to figure
out what the damage is avoided would be
but the goal of this thing is to figure
out at the margin how much how far you
should limit climate concentrations
because it's a standard economist
viewpoint you figure out where it is
that the the benefit of the last unit of
reduction equals the the avoided damages
of the of avoiding I'm sorry of having
s climate risk so the theory is
absolutely an economist theory and it
goes further by saying how do we deal
with this problem well what they've done
is they've come up with a property right
system that's the whole structure of
these treaties and what do I mean by a
property right system once you've
figured out what is the allowable amount
of emissions by doing in theory
cost-benefit analysis you set that as a
cap you say this is how much emission is
allowed in the world in any given year
or any given five year period and then
you distribute rights to omit that much
carbon or carbon equivalent across the
whole world and in so doing you've got
to figure out of course how much is
India get how much is the US get how
much does China get if everybody played
in this inclusive game they don't at the
present time but you have to figure out
some way of allocating these property
rights and then what you want to do is
allow people to trade them okay and and
because what you have in that way is you
will end up as any half halfway decent
economist will show you you will end up
with the lowest cost emitters being the
ones who do the reductions because as
long as you can reduce for less than the
traded price of these permits what
you're going to do is you're going to
take those reductions pay the costs sell
your permit get your money back and make
a profit and if your costs to reduce are
higher than the average or the traded
price in the world you're going to buy
more permits because it's cheaper for
you to buy the permit than it is to
reduce your emissions so it's a
situation is designed to produce a
single world price the traded price that
will operate globally and at a global
level if everybody played you will get
the lowest cost reduction lowest cost up
for any given level of reduction the
other things that i'd simply stress
there are the models is is one that's
kind of based on the model of a of a
national state if you break the law so
you've been given X number
property rights X number of permits that
you can emit so many tons if you break
the law somebody's supposed to come down
on you same as if you stole something or
if you violated a some regulation here
course it's a big question at the
international level who that is who's
coming down on you and what are the
types of sanctions because traditionally
international relations don't have
somebody like the EPA or some other
agency that that is available to do this
finally there was one necessary trick
that that got thrown into the works from
the very beginning which was that the
develop although the whole idea here is
to do this on a global basis the
developing countries from the very
beginning before this started indicated
that they wouldn't play okay why because
they were not going to see constraints
in the amount of emissions that they
were permitted to have limit their
development so we imagined somewhere in
the back of our academic minds that
there would be a process that we can't
we call graduation which we got from the
world trade organization that says
developing countries should have special
trade status in in in the in the the
various tariff structures that we have
but when they get rich at some level
they graduate and then they lose their
special treatment and so the same idea
was in the minds of planners here that
there would be some sort of a process in
play that would suggest when countries
reached a certain level of income or
some other standard what we left
undefined they would enter into the
system so that eventually with growth it
would indeed become global okay now how
are we doing on just on time so okay
that's fine that's plenty all right the
history of the negotiations between
basically 1992 and the present time has
been in some important part of playing
out of diff
culties in implementing this economic
model okay it has not been dealing with
what I would call the hard problem which
is the issue of when developing
countries no matter how large they are
is emitter 'he's and China will surpass
the United States as an emitter as the
principal emitter in the world sometime
between twenty fifteen and twenty
twenty-five it's not clear it depends on
Chinese growth rates and and and and
other difficult things to estimate but
we've never really at any point in the
negotiations taken on the hard question
of the relationship between north and
south developed into developing
countries except in an extremely
indirect way I'll come to in a minute
the fighting has gone on only between
the rich countries because it's only the
rich countries who ever assumed
obligations under the Kyoto Protocol ok
they were the only ones who ever what's
called annex 1 countries and the lingo
of diplomats and lawyers who do this
stuff they've been unable to agree with
one another to the point that the United
States and Australia actually walked out
and the negotiations have been very
colored by the inability of countries to
agree on a whole series of things these
are some of the things that I think are
difficulties that we have consistently
experienced I'm going to come back and
talk about one of them in just a second
the trading instruments which we have
created require financial regulators of
a type that don't exist in the system
it's exactly as if you had a securities
market in this country but you didn't
have an SEC you didn't have anyone to
worry about the quality of what was
being traded we had that in this country
for a while we have watered stock and
all kinds of frauds and things that went
on and part of the problem is we're
experiencing some of that at the present
time in the in the implementation of the
Kyoto Protocol because we lack the
institutions that are there but I would
just want to focus on one thing down
here at the moma
you know we talked about having a single
pray signal for disparate goals and
climate change right now if we look at
European markets where you see trading
going on because Europe did enter the
Kyoto Protocol you'll see that the
trading which is very thin and very
spotty in the permits that have been
allocated to the different members of
the European Union is trading somewhere
between 17 and 20 euros per ton of
carpet ok it's see it's it's a price
that i think is unstable for reasons
i'll go into in just a second but it's a
price that if we apply this and we've
done some analysis to a number of us
utilities okay if that were the traded
price they're not going to change their
fuel composition one bit in other words
that price is not nearly high enough to
cause them to change their the ways that
they are currently producing now that
produces a real problem for us because I
think a lot of the theory that has gone
into this as well we'll set a low price
signal at the beginning that's what
Kyoto is doing and then as things get
more difficult and we see that the
sciences is is firmer in the minds of
the public that we'll be able to ratchet
up the signal in other words instead of
being $22 will raise it up toward a
hundred dollars where it has been more
or less ninety to a hundred dollars
simply because of the gas price rises
we've all been facing and we can make
our own judgments about what that has
done to our economy but the idea that we
can solve the various problems and I'm
going to come back to this in a second
that are implicit in dealing with
climate across time through a single
price signal or very difficult I believe
strongly that a low price signal such as
the one we are experiencing in part of
the world is very adequate and indeed
necessary for dealing with a part of the
problem I don't think is it it is at all
necessary for
it is at all adequate for dealing with
other parts of the problem and I think
the difficulty is in part that industry
everywhere and I think this is as true
of Europe and China as it is of the
United States is extremely resistant to
opening up the possibility of a
continually rising price signal okay in
other words I think that there would be
quite comfortable with a price signal at
the level we're experiencing it right
now I think what they're afraid of in
good part is that it's the camel getting
his nose under the tent and once they
open this up the price signals going to
continue to go up and in fact that's
what the economic analysis suggests is
going to happen so there is this
political paralysis that is occurring
not so much on the level of the price
signal at the present time but on the
structure of regime that will open the
price signal to areas to two levels of
which they are extremely afraid another
problem that I want to point out and
then I'm going to jump over and talk
about what I think are some of the
solutions because we have a limited
amount of time here I think it's a
mistake to focus as strongly as we have
on kind of a pure economic analysis I
think what we are doing is missing all
manner of difficulties that exist in the
reality of how people respond and who
responds to climate change problems so
for example energy security is now an
extremely important priority among
politicians all over the world in some
cases that's good from a climate
perspective I mean if people build
nuclear whatever else we think of
nuclear because they can keep the
nuclear on their own country that at
least has a lower carbon inputted it has
other problems proliferation and I
needn't go into those with you here but
it's it's beneficial obviously
renewables can have
strong dimension of energy security to
them because they allow you to actually
keep your energy industry at home but in
China energy security means one thing
and that's call and in India it's the
same story when you look at the
distribution of coal energy security is
not climate friendly in any fashion and
yet energy security dominates in
national politics everywhere I know
various types of environmental
considerations climate change priorities
are extremely low in the countries where
I work rent as that includes the United
States relative to economic development
and local pollution lots of others that
are there but I just want to point out
one thing that's here people keep hoping
that we can create a policy regime that
is going to induce technology change or
create various types of of climate
controls that are effective in changing
people's lifestyles everything we know
historically tells us that effective
policy usually follows technology or
pray shocks it rarely leads them and I'd
simply point to telecom and information
technology where you guys are the
pregnant what happened was a technology
shock led institutional change it was
the technology shock that destroyed the
old regulatory and monopoly structures
of the telephone industries unlike
rather than the other way around so what
I want to argue and I'll spend a lot of
time on in this book is trying to
understand other factors of economic
factor than economic factors that affect
decisions and very importantly among
those are issues in organizational
theory basically it's sad to say in some
ways because we all love to think of our
organizations as being innovators and
the like but basically organizations do
what they do okay most of the time when
change occurs it's not because of
organizations adapting to new
circumstances it's because new
organizations are being selected by the
changing picture of what is needed and
you know here
are right all around us at the and and
the idea that that we can take existing
organizations like energy ministries
that have been around for a long time
and control enormous political power and
tell them now you guys are going to
adapt you're not just going to be an
Energy Development Ministry you're going
to be an environmental ministry as well
and you're going to do it extremely
difficult to get people to shift their
organizational cultures so these are the
kinds of things I want to focus on okay
what can we do i'm going to skip by a
whole lot of junk here i do want to make
one point in passing which i think is
important to the rest of my argument
this is where the world's emissions come
from there are a very small number of
countries who dominate the world's
climate emissions okay and finstad of
having 190 people around the table you
had the right six or seven you could
deal with the greatest part of this
problem and that's going to be essential
for thinking about what kind of a regime
were actually interested in creating
because what's going to happen is
emissions down here are going to grow
most rapidly and indeed there's going to
be more concentration of emissions in
the future then there has been up to
this time here's the punch line and
where they where my work is going and
where I think if I'm right that various
types of difficulties are causing Kyoto
and not be able to solve those various
problems that it's been confronting so
far the most important of which is the
relationship between developed and
developing countries but lots of others
to which I very briefly alluded here's
what I think we have to do in thinking
about a different way of approaching it
climate is a derivative problem of three
economic sectors overwhelmingly and the
key thing about climate as opposed to
say the montreal protocol for ozone
depleting substances is these sectors
are at the very heart of what people
mean by growth and development okay this
is these are these are third rail
sectors in the sense it's the energy we
use it's the transport we have and very
often it's the land use
the use of land and spatial topographies
that that we make okay the government
actors from these sectors make decisions
on the development paths their economies
will follow who are those guys who make
those calls they are the line ministries
the energy ministry is the transport
ministries and they are the finance
ministry's who control the budgets for
investment that these guys need okay the
political priorities of these actors are
nowhere especially in the developing
countries focused on climate and when
they look at the world of environmental
constraints which they may be hearing
from their environment ministers who see
this as a an important problem and one
that frankly will help their own
leverage grow internally they hear
nothing but constraints and when they
hear constraints they really pull back
from it and here's an if we were in
Montreal or when we were in Montreal a
month and a half ago if you went around
that room and saw who was negotiating
none of the people who were there were
the people from the ministries who are
making the calls on national development
priorities okay they are overwhelmingly
environment ministers or foreign
ministers none of whom honestly have any
power whatsoever to affect the energy
trajectories or the transport
trajectories in their own countries the
second point I want to make beyond we've
got the wrong people at the table
involved in these issues the second
point is there are really three problems
we have a current problem that we can
see all around us in an intermediate
need for a low level price signal there
are lots of opportunities steve is one
of the world's real experts on them too
for energy efficiency that may even save
money or at a very very low price signal
will cause people to change their
behavior and and these these things are
legion we need incentives and it can be
quite a low-level signal ten dollars a
ton of co2 is probably sufficient for
most of it to adopt options to mitigate
carbon where the incremental costs are
low we would get big
savings from that and they're available
in the short run and some companies are
already realizing them and we need more
of them the second problem we have we've
got a midterm need to defuse more
rapidly than business as usual existing
commercial technologies that are
relatively less climate damaging now
most of those up or many of those
opportunities because we're talking
about the diffusion of technologies that
are known in Europe and the US and Japan
but are not penetrating China India and
nearly the rate they could so these are
issues in the countries that are not
taking on climate obligations even a low
level climate signal we need another
structure than Kyoto to create what I'll
simply call deals with them to get them
to alter their development path and I
think if we had more time I could go
into a number of such major deals to
which I think interests in those
countries who are mainly concerned about
development as their highest priority
would say yeah that's something we want
for our own country and they need
there's lots of the question of exactly
how you structure those deals is going
to be particular but I think we need to
spend a lot more time on it less regimes
less general rules more business deals
business now including some of the money
that we may be spending on Kyoto and
stuff that can be directed into the
public dimension of those cooperative
deals between private industry and
public agencies and an international
level the long-term need is to develop
energy transport land use technologies
that are currently across the commercial
technical and I think we need a huge
amount of work in understanding what is
the portfolio of technologies that's out
there and what are the problems in
getting from good ideas to rapid
diffusion at scale of commercially
sustainable technologies in order to do
this what I'm just going to close with
is each separate climate problem is best
approached through a separate
institutional pillar tailored to the
specific problem in other words I think
we want to move away from having a
general regime as we've tried to so far
under good
economic design and think about multiple
pillars and I use that strange word to
American years because the Europeans
have built the European Union around
different pillars meaning different
institutional arrangements one thing for
trade another thing for foreign and
security policy another thing for
justice and immigration a fourth for
monetary union and each one is a
separate institution with different
players who are really appropriate to it
you don't need a hundred and ninety
problems if you're going to work on
carbon on carbon capture and
sequestration because there are only our
three or four countries who matter in
that and those are the ones who I think
you're going to have a much more likely
chance of reaching an agreement between
then we are so far the kyoto protocol as
it now stands strikes me as a
well-tailored arrangement for a low
level price signal and I think if people
understood the Kyoto Protocol is
basically that even the United States
with any kind of rational administration
and I'll leave it to you guys to decide
whether we have crossed below that
threshold but at end of to $15 carbon
price signal is perfectly saleable in
this country there's a new bill by
Senator Bingaman out that that basically
works at that level and and I think we
will come to that as long as industry
comes to understand that it is not the
first step in a ratcheted up arrangement
that we are going to come up with other
instruments to deal with the larger and
more salient elements of climate change
that need a much deeper set of
institutional incentives than we have
and I'm not going to deal with the rest
of us because we're at a time but there
are like 150 more of these things and
another time thank you
um now's a good time for questions and I
think we need to speak very loudly so
the video on here you ask the question
actually from your speakers should just
repeat the questions in its capture Oh
got a few questions you guys
yeah given that the EU is on board with
the Kyoto 39 grand foyer and
the other major pollutants us isn't that
a perfect case to be made in trade
organization for example y'all remember
sending the UN private organization say
I talked to production designer because
we are identify these training yeah now
a very energy question the question is
one of the EU is on the board here the
US and the developing countries or not
so isn't there a way saying through the
apparatus is the world trade
organization that there are other fair
competitive conditions going on and
presumably just to finish your thought
that we have a right to impose your
order pinfalls or some sort of trade
barriers against good is reduced in in
countries where the we do not have choir
demonstrates they're two different
problems with that one you know the WTO
can't work against China in the United
States they're in India they're too big
in terms of straight power there are all
kinds of legal problems under it to be
very brief about it and I'll be glad to
talk about it separately there are WTO
decisions after 2002 so-called shrimp
turtle decisions that indicate that
countries may be able to impose trade
barriers against activities outside
their own borders which is what this
would be but those barriers and and then
here I'm going to sound like you know
usual crummy lawyer get extremely tricky
if what if the situation is such that
the the polluting element is not becomes
mixed into the good which is traded
limited to say to say that in you know
human terms it means if you're using
polluting energy and it is a productive
factor within a particular good which is
now going to cross lines that cannot be
under WTO law excluded it's only when
the when
when the factor is in some way
identifiable or or related to other
types of production conditions shrimp
turtle is is limited so there's both
political and legal problems why this
would be the case although the Montreal
Protocol did include trade sanctions in
it but they've never been used and the
success we've had under the Montreal
Protocol is not a fact of a hard law
model because hard lon the WTO is very
hard to apply against countries like
like the u.s. I just will say one thing
that that builds on I see this this
thing is back here when you actually
consider the number of countries in the
world who have assumed what I would call
a positive price that is they actually
have a charge that is raising their
industrial cost or the residential cause
for people it's an incredibly small
number because most of the signatories
of the Kyoto Protocol or developing
countries who have no obligations 16 of
the signatories are countries that were
part of the former Soviet Union or
Eastern Europe who are sellers in the
system meaning they received more
permits then the actual amount of
pollution they produce after the
breakdown in their economies that
occurred they're allowed to admit as
much as they did in nineteen ninety but
their emissions are actually lower so
those guys are not facing a positive
price they're trying to make money by
selling these things to to to other
people the ones who have taken on costs
are basically catted in Japan in the
negotiations after the u.s. quit they
both got major concessions to cut their
costs somewhat that the Europeans gave
them but the Canadians for example are
way way out of line with their Kyoto
targets they're not coming anywhere
close and with the elections last week I
mean first Alberta had said to to the
Canadian government that they had no
right to sign his treaty anyway it was a
provincial matter and they were
going to pay any attention to it but
even getting beyond that the the Tories
the Conservatives who won are going to
make no effort to enforce and my final
point is to twofold one within Europe
itself many of the countries of the
union do not have obligations to reduce
emissions those reduce the reductions in
the Union are overwhelmingly done by the
Northern European countries Germany
Holland and some others and given the
fact that they are facing relatively
high prices they're making use of a
complicated trading mechanism called the
Clean Development Mechanism to
essentially get tradable permits at
prices that are but down in the four to
five dollar range in order to bring down
their costs the market is slow at the
moment because the approval process for
these things is not as fast as people
would have hoped but the reason why the
European trading market is so thin is
European actors are waiting to see how
large is the supply of CDM permits that
are coming in right now at about a
quarter of the price so it could be the
compliance in Europe ends up being not
the twenty dollars that i referred to
earlier but more like four to five
dollars and that doesn't provide much of
a price signal for much of anything I'll
be glad to go into that in much more
detail and that's one of the areas where
I spent out I spent years trying to
design that mechanism and almost
completely screwed up because I didn't
understand how was going to be gained by
people who could who could work their
way around the rules just just one brief
a point on that I won't talk about the
leakage problem that he talked about
that's when if you have low energy
prices and a non-compliant there for
their products have embedded energy and
then the tire a cheaper the other
problem is you hear so much nonsense
about how the costs of compliance are
going to be bankrupting countries in
fact George W Bush said at Gleneagles
the Kyoto would have bankrupted America
I think that was close to his phrase and
almost all the economic studies it
looked at
a relatively bad kyoto without many
trades we're particularly giving you
carbon prices in the order of 100
dollars a ton to meet this this the the
obligations the dollar 50 gallon gas
price increase that we had would have
taken the equivalent of over two hundred
dollars a ton the economy is doing fine
and in fact we've already proved that it
was nonsense people have run economic
models with the full carbon tax i did it
with christian azhar and what we showed
was that the costs of even pessimistic
substitution of cheap energy for more
expensive energy but probably run in the
trillions of dollars present value if
you did it without without what we call
correcting market failures is still a
small fraction of the growth rate of the
gdp and even even even six trillion
dollar cost a hundred years from now in
Los gdp on the three hundred billion
trillion dollar GDP you would have means
that in two years later the doubled
population of the world is five hundred
percent richer in 2102 than in 2100 so
this nonsense you hear about the costs
are prohibitive I'm going to destroy are
going to destroy development it's just
nonsense it is not nonsense for the coal
industry for large autos and special
interests so part of the governance
structures and I agree by the way the
pillars will be trying to find ways that
you can get actors willing to do it when
they know that they're the front line
losers of this by side payments or if
you prefer bribes and legal bribes what
you need to do is try to find ways to be
fair as well as efficient and you know
bludgeon rules don't do that very well
they'll have to be some pick and choose
and then people say I you just favored
them but if they're the ones paying the
highest price well maybe we should favor
them at least the first 20 years to get
started so there are creative ways to
get around this without dealing with WTO
and other things at the moment there's
no creativity because there's no desire
at least in this country at the top and
the federal level to even fashion such
solutions the good news is the state's
our cities are some members of Congress
and sooner or later this heterogeneous
patchwork quilt of
of different rules in different states
which in my opinion is not a rational
way to help companies you know meet
their their obligations would be better
met through federal rules will probably
lead to a sea change whether it will be
federal rules because companies will
demand it not we in the environmental
side we don't have any cloud
what trying to cook one of our oil
for what
oh the routine wait wait elevator get
the protocols way below the current
increase that we've seen we've seen the
oil climbed from twenty dollars a barrel
to sixty dollars a barrel that's way
more than the cost of enforcing the
Kyoto Protocol it equivalence you just
have to run it across all sectors rather
zactly rather than on the rather than on
transportation sector alone but we do
see I mean in places in China where
where as I said earlier I do a huge
amount of my work if we looked in
2003-2004 we would have seen fuel oil
being burned for electricity in large
numbers of small operations across 10 or
you know any of the eastern provinces
and if we go there now you'll see almost
no fuel oil being burned except then you
know thought there's stuff in the bottom
they burn asphalt and effect or tires
because they're so short on power but
the fuel has been has been shifted
overwhelmingly into the transport sector
and that's one of the reasons why the
coal increase is so fast they've
basically emptied out there their fuel
oil capacity and even in the good old US
of A there are places in the Northeast
that are burning unbelievable oil for
direct heat of houses through
single-pane windows and leaky
infrastructure those are the cheap
things to fix and the New England for
example in New York are actually taking
action to do that fuel oil people the
door
I just wanted to ask you know I always
feel like if Economist's understood
consumer behavior we'd all be you'd see
nothing but a parking lot full of hung
guys out there because it clearly has
the best cost-benefit ratio of any car
you can buy given that consumers make
decisions based on fashion style attack
aversion and all kinds of factors other
than cost who is doing the best work to
adjust our culture so that conspicuous
consumption being saving the climate
rather than trying to kill as many
dinosaurs as possible and his survival
going to become a value that consumers
are interested in as one of the
attributes of their product it's as if I
knew something about this good I hope
you do I I get a lot of my research
money I probably should have confessed
this in the beginning from from from
british petroleum which fancies itself
as the most green of the energy
companies it's always questionable
exactly what that means they're you know
they're trying like crazy to market a
whole series of products that are niche
products that are designed to appeal to
various green consumers and they're
trying to I mean look at look at the
Financial Times or anyone else you walk
into Heathrow Airport what do you get
nothing but BP we're the alternative
energy company I mean they're really on
a massive campaign without divulging any
confidentiality at this point marketing
people can find the trace of a signal
okay so far so I'll let's do from here
you're talking
and I spent a fair amount of time
advising groups in Hollywood and there's
a very well-known actor who does a lot
on on on global warming stuff and my
wife Terry and I read the scripts and
make sure because he wants to say the
right thing but when I was advising one
of the groups about 10 years ago there
were a number of actors won't mention
names what they wanted to do is they
wanted to do TV spots where they were
basically playing scientists and
teaching people about science and I was
strongly against that I said wrong role
I want Tom Cruise sitting on the hood of
his hybrid while some big clunky fool is
trying to impress the ladies with his
Hummer and what you want to do is you
want to send value statements don't play
scientists you're not credible at it a
lot of them didn't want to do that and
so you can use that group in in value
directed ads but somebody's going to
have to fund it and get there and make
certain that they're not writing the
scripts they're gonna have to get some
some good advisory in the other thing is
we'll just go back to a simple trade-off
that which takes us back to this this
disjunction between legacy of wealth and
infrastructure versus cultural quality
of life and and other changes the Arctic
sea ice is melting fast we know that
we're responsible for most of it
nevermind the liars and spin doctors who
deny this this uncertainty in every
aspect of everything but it's very
likely that it'll get worse so how do
you weigh the benefits to the shipping
industry which have shorter pathways
across the Russian Admirals a thrill
they've been wanting this you know why
more reports forever and and you can
even calculate how much CLT you can say
from the shorter routes and it comes out
I don't run the numbers but it's tens of
millions more than that of dollars saved
so if you're doing straight cost-benefit
analysis in the one dollar one vote
aggregation rule that they do in the
office of management and budget what
you're going to end up saying is big
benefit from arctic sea ice now you're
going to wipe out the polar bear that
echo system is gone the arctic fox comes
along with it well what do they do for
our con
me what about the Inuit cultures or the
other indigenous people whose cultures
have built around the touch of sea ice
to the shore now they're not dying from
this in fact I've heard it said well
once we put Anwar up there they're going
to make a fortune running new oil rigs
but that's not the culture that's
established so what you have to do is
find equivalences in metrics other than
things traded in markets that people
truly value that's where what we were
doing earlier when we were talking maybe
Google Earth can help you need to have
metaphors that catch people where they
have true value in their guts and get
them away from the notion that the only
metric of importance is how much money
you have at the end of the year so we're
really arguing about a a battle of value
it's not a battle of economics I would
argue climate change is below the growth
rate in the gdp on both the damages side
and on the cost side of fixing it we've
got a lot of studies on that if I pick
really bad damages maybe we'll get a
couple percent of GDP it's pretty tough
Katrina current bill 200 billion it'll
probably double by the time we you know
have ancillary expenses there what's the
size of the US economy 10 trillion
what's two percent of that our growth
rate 200 billion so it's one year
knocked off us in five years from now
yeah it'll be a little bump it was like
the population growth rate curves after
the 19 18 flew a little bump but then we
got right back on the exponential so
when you take a look at all these costs
the numbers are staggering when you do
what I call the Carl Sagan problem
you're the billions and trillions but
when you look at them as percentages of
growth rates at let at had overall
impact on macro economic structure this
is not an economics problem as Tom said
although it has economic components that
are dramatic for certain groups and
therefore it's a problem of trying to
define what you value and then helping
out the disadvantage to get through that
so they stop becoming blocking
coalition's and that's where this
dissemble
damaging because it knocks people off
their good sense and makes it very hard
to get action because they think that
when the president tells them it would
have bankrupt of the country even though
let me be real blunt it's a lie I think
he probably even knows it's not the
truth but they covered it where was the
media why didn't they run the numbers
and show why that's nonsense well known
inside the you know the introduced and
the integrated Assessors so we have a
serious problem and the problem in my
opinion is more cultural and I agree
with you and we need opinion leaders and
we need good graphics and we need ways
to get people back to the values which
they fundamentally hold and get them
away from being bamboozled by numbers
that are so intimidating they just quit
and work on something else right steve
is never short on opinions right good
you sketched out a lot of the problems
with the current regimes and sort of
potential things but it seems like
they've all got problems you know like
you've listened to all these things that
have it fall into place is there any
cause for optimism or
went to some similar change in attitude
or culture or international legal
language is really good question I mean
I I see cause for optimism and and i am
still optimistic that they were going to
beat this thing when I reframe the
problem and part of the reason that I
that I did that reframing at the end is
I think that generally you're going to
get political results when you pose the
problem in ways that seem responsive to
solution as opposed to the kind of thing
I did with impossible stuff so a low
level price signal I think it's quite
possible if we framed it that way that
we could get Congress to go along
relatively quickly and I think most of
the rest of the world is already
indicating that is to say the developed
world is indicating that that such a
signal is is useful even in China and
India although I don't see any
possibility of a price signal I do see
certain policies and measures which are
consistent with that price signal on
energy efficiency air conditioned your
standards and things being installed so
I actually think we can get to that
level when I kick it up to the issues of
trying to change the development path
that is being installed in country I
mean all I can do is say that I spend
most of my time doing this and when I
when I I meet with people who do have
decision power in in countries and say
she wouldn't it from your standpoint
wouldn't it be a lot better to have an
increased percentage of your new power
coming from natural gas or so then then
from from from coal they say yeah that's
really consistent with with what we want
but we've got these problems to do that
infrastructure problems the fact that
for bizarre reasons that would take us a
long time to talk about the price of
natural gas is tracking the price of oil
okay so the price of oil goes up at the
price of natural gas goes up with it
there's no economic reason in the world
for that to happen certainly not in the
new markets of Asia so the delinking of
gas and oil prices would have an
enormous impact on what gets built
that's a soluble problem climate change
is a general issue i'm not sure but if
you break it down into components that
are going to have impacts on our climate
trajectories I think we come up with a
lot of problems that are soluble and and
I would like to see us doing much more
of that and then Technology Policy and
and how you bring on new technologies
well I think that's really essential to
get places like Google and others who
are innovators involved in thinking
through that problem because you know
technological change is not something
that we have no experience with and I
just don't think that we you know if we
turn it over to the defense department
or even worse the Department of Energy
they've got a clue on how to do that so
I think a lot of it is reframing the
problem and getting the problem into the
hands of people who have been successful
in solving similar problems rather than
trying to aggravate it the way you know
we economist did and said single / a
signal across the world that's it it's
not going to happen it's not happening
now but I'm not I'm not I'm not
unmistakable it when I when you start to
translate these things into what do seem
to me to be much more graspable
unsolvable problems maybe one last
question
um the Chicago climate exchange has a
pretty low price attached to carbon and
they seem to think that they can use an
economic model to solve these problems
outside of government federal policy but
a lot of people have concerns that those
credits that don't actually mean
anything because they're not really
certified can you just speak to that and
there are a bunch of markets around some
of them operating here in the United
States one of them probably the biggest
in the United States is the the Chicago
climate exchange and and and they allow
the trading between members on that
exchange in carbon permits but of course
this has to be completely voluntary with
respect to American actors that the you
know a company will take on a target and
then perhaps go out and satisfy that
target by buying a permit from someone
else who has reduced emissions the price
on the Chicago exchange I think I can
okay so this is this is oh maybe a month
behind the data there's a graduate
student who's updating this every day
but my slide is a little bit slow so
these are the prices this is kind of the
current price or the price two weeks ago
on the European trading markets and
these are this the size of these bubbles
are the volumes that that are that are
being traded the Chicago climate
exchange is down here it's a very very
low price it's it's it's it's on the
range of a dollar and a half to two
dollars at the present time because
precisely there is no the you know the
it's it's it's a purely voluntary
exchange so that you know my sense is
that what's going to happen here is that
here we see this odd mechanism called
the CDM which I can explain really
it says something like if you've got an
obligation to reduce emissions in Europe
or you have a voluntary target or
whatever by so many tons of carbon
equivalent what you can do is make a
deal with somebody in China or India
countries where there are where they
have no obligations but if they reduce
their emissions so for example if
instead of putting in a coal-fired plant
they built wind farm you can calculate
the difference in emissions that will
occur over time you can monetize those
as assets and then sell them the problem
that's going on with CDM and here as you
can see the prop the issue this price
the European trading system price is
much higher than the CDM price but
because of regulations that the
Europeans have adopted this can
substitute ton for ton for that so if
you think about arbitrage how can that
exist how can why would anybody pay this
amount when they could pay this amount
the answer is the pipeline that approves
these things which is a UN agency has
been slow and expanding the supply so
what you're seeing is extremely thin
trading on the European market because
people are waiting for this to see how
much of a supply there is down there and
what's actually going on in Montreal as
I as I spend time with Robin trying to
explain and I think she heard it from
the European delegates directly is there
is tremendous pressure on the regulator
to expand the supply of these credits so
that the ultimate price for compliance
in Europe will not be here but somewhere
down here and the problem that we're
having is that the way they're expanding
the supply of credits is not in doing
things like substituting wind for coal
or anything like that it's in a couple
of industrial gases one hfc hcfc 20
to which is the base for free on its and
it has a by product called hfc 23 which
is a terrible greenhouse gas eleven
thousand times worse per unit than
carbon dioxide so if you reduce a unit
of it you can get a huge number of
carbon credits okay and for reasons that
I'm not going to go into now I think
it's it's bunk I think these huge number
of credits that are entering the system
are not real gains and we're about to
see another huge infusion of fertilizer
companies which release in 20 into the
atmosphere going to be selling that as
well so i think this supply is going to
get pumped up the price for compliance
is going to come way down because of
this and we're actually going to see a
kyoto compliance signal somewhere down
here which is a very low signal but has
very little environmental credibility as
far as i'm concerned because i think
this is watered stock to put it simply
that's a quick analysis of a long
problem yeah let me briefly add a
slightly different dimension people tend
to respond to price signals that they
believe are long-lived as opposed to
fluctuations nobody is quite sure about
what the regime is going to be it's the
same reason after we had the big pulse
and gas prices and then it went back
down and then they started buying these
7,000 pound cars again with the tax
deductions because it was a perception
it wasn't indelible so when that the
single most important reason in my view
why we need a kyoto protocol it's not
going to do virtually anything for the
climate in the short run and if the only
thing we did over the century was kyoto
then you end up a couple of tenths of a
degree cooler in 2100 so depending on
where the climate probability density
function comes out you know your three
degrees versus 3.2 that's clearly not
sufficient in fact people have derided
the protocol is not working but the
protocol is is this an experiment and
learning by doing in cooperation and i'm
not disagreeing at all of the pillars
approach i think we need to have
multiple strategies but the single most
important thing in my opinion that would
trigger people to invest in alternatives
and not be so afraid is what they
actually believed that this was not only
going to happen but it was going to go
up as we heard from Tom people don't
perceive that now they don't know what's
going on so you do is you lack that
incentive you want to do well you don't
mind helping the world and doing good
but you don't want to be a fool you
don't want to be the one to buy up there
when you know others are going to buy
down there so then you end up setting up
perverse incentives to going the right
direction because of this patchwork and
the end and the lag the lack of
enforcement one last thing on that a
hundred and some-odd cities in the US
were members of this acclaim at work and
have climate policies so one of my
students a couple of years ago in our
Senior Honors Program decided that she
couldn't understand that because she
learned in economics class about the
free rider problem well so even a big
city like Los Angeles if it got it
cleared up its act in it and it
everybody drove a hybrid and they no
longer bought bought electricity from
the Nevada coal plants and they cut
their emissions in half I mean we're
talking tenths of a percent of the world
amount so there's still in a sense a
free rider on the overall Commons
degradation of everybody else why should
they spend positive money cleaning up
except if it has political bump well so
we checked around with these hundred and
fifty cities got about 50 responded and
found out politics was only the initial
driver there was a charismatic who came
along and pushed the City Council to
listen that's not what determined why
the city's eventually signed on to
climate policies it's because they
perceive that by putting light emitting
diodes in their in their traffic lights
there by having hundred thousand our
bulbs saving a lot of Labor on changing
lights plus they could calculate out
quickly the return on investment was
very very good if they have streetlights
that don't light the bottoms of
airplanes but instead only the streets
they have building codes that get single
pane windows out and double pane windows
in I know it predates you but things of
that kind that everyone at war if they
have a diamond lane and you reduce
crowding and air pollution which reduces
health costs it makes the city more
desire
for high tech business to move in that
they actually were getting positive
cost-benefit ratios that economists call
no regrets that means that you don't
need climate you should have done it
anyway and there's a big debate among
economists and engineers about how much
no regrets there is but be that as it
may it was the perception in those
cities that they were actually getting
economic or quality of life advantages
that drove it it was not that they
thought they were going to solve the
climate problem and by the way we feel
like better citizens because we're
making a statement we can't run rule the
world but if we're profligate then we
have no credibility to tell them not to
you hear that over and Seattle says that
all the time so I do thinks back to your
your your question car about about ideas
and and values I think that we have a
lot of opportunity from the bottom up if
we get some top down to make it easier
from the bottom up we run a mixed
strategy between these we're learning by
doing we're fumbling around the bottom
line is we've got to cut emissions to
about fifty percent below business as
usual projections by mid-century and
down near zero by the end or we're doing
more than doubling co2 and that's one
heck of a tall order and I'm not
particularly worried about whether Kyoto
with or without some entity is cutting
three percent versus four percent
because I don't see the difference in a
hundred years between three percent four
percent and zero well we have to have is
major cuts in what we need to do is
develop the co-operative model necessary
so that people want to participate so
economics is part of it and sent them as
a part of it but good old values is the
whole thing may be here here's here's
the disagreement between us about this
whole thing Steve and I are in no way
disagreed that a low-level pray signal
will produce real gains for us okay it
could be should be that there there
there are big gains to be had depending
how in if I'm going to talk like an
economist now that after I've criticized
my whole profession there are big gains
to be had for very low cost okay maybe
even no cost the system is rife with
inefficiencies the
were inefficient to system the cheaper
the cost part of the reason why Europe
went much faster than the u.s. is the US
was dealing with inefficiencies in its
energy system since 1978 under the
purple which was an act that we passed
in 78 in response to the first oil
crisis and Europe was filled if you look
at the European energy directives they
didn't happen until nineteen
ninety-eight implementation has still
not taken place to a full degree so that
the further you are I'm not going to
talk like an economist say further you
are from the frontier the more in
efficiencies you've got in the system
the lower the cost of cleaning it up and
we agree there are lots of
inefficiencies I think we also agree
that the getting the inefficiencies out
of the system is not going to deal with
the climate problem by itself the
magnitude is not big enough where we
disagree and where I guess I disagree
with with most people who are more
optimistic is whether the steps we have
taken to Kyoto are a good foundation for
using that same structure to get the
price levels up to the issue up to the
levels that are necessary to actually
deal with what I call diffusion and
innovation and my answer is no they're
not level and the Kyoto's architecture
is not an adequate foundation to build
upon and we're going to waste a lot of
time fighting to try and get Kyoto to a
place where it can't go and I'm saying
step back from it I want a low level
price signal but let's focus on other
sorts of mechanisms and incentives that
are tailored to getting beyond the low
cost efficiency gains that I certainly
agree with Steve are out there in
substantial amounts but not in big
enough amounts to deal with the climate
problem over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
