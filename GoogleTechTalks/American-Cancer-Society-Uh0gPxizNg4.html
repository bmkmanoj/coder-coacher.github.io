american cancer society today dr. cortas
going to give us an overview of what
American Cancer Society is he's going to
discuss the heavens for iam concept
something he's been working on for over
20 years
he's going to give us some ideas of how
american cancer society can actually
work with google now so everyone please
give a round of applause for dr. Elmer
you are that thank you very much Ashley
and thank you very much Gonzalo and good
afternoon everyone I'm extremely pleased
to be here at Google this afternoon I
already had a tour and I'm really really
really amazed by the way you will work
and your philosophy of a work here at
Google I'm extremely happy that this
happened as actually introduced me I'm a
physician by training cancer prevention
specialist that's what I do for for
living II i work in Washington DC and
one of the three largest hospitals in
washington DC called the Washington
Hospital Center what I'm going to do
first I'm going to get my jacket off I
can hear you don't worry jackets and I
like that that was doubting this morning
if I should wear a tie I should have on
my t-shirt but I'm think I'm going to
move around I think this is on too so
thank you very much first of all it is
very amazing how things happened this is
I think something it should be important
for you all the young people here you
grow up and you are used to when you are
a little kid that things that happen to
you are usually planned by your parents
bangla get it on when you are 13 14 15
then you start planning your own things
my song is there he's 14 and he prefers
to listen he's a boy to listen to his
dad that's the way it is but then then
it goes and when you have something in
your mind that you you have a dream or
you have a plan or something then you do
everything possible in Europe means to
make that happen and this is an example
of that I was in Miami at the airport in
my way to Peru to give a talk in Peru
and then
it's at and the waiting room of this
Airport and that person was there next
to me and say hi hi you know just a
regular airport conversation and this we
start talking and this one person says I
think I know you I saw you in television
and I have TV shows and I'm the regular
doctor for CNN espanol I have my
segments there every Thursday all that
stuff see okay that happen kind of
regularly to be in airport something
like that but this one person was very
special he said my name is Gonzalo Vegas
oh I work for Google oh really good so
we clicked one of those things that you
click with someone we start talking and
talking until we board the plane but one
of the things we plan at that meeting at
that little meeting was to make this
meat impossible this this one made
impossible he said I'm going to do my
possible to see if you can go to
Mountain View and we with us and give a
talk on cancer prevention and it would
be the interest of people to hear that
cancer can be prevent that cancer can be
a detective earlier and that's what I
said it's an example of things that
happen fortuitously but then when you
work towards your goal things happen and
I was telling my song about that I said
yes Daddy I know that probably he knows
that but I'm extremely happy 17 thank
you very much for making this possible
and that's it happen I'm encountering
airport and this is what's happening
here well I'm very proud also to us
actually said that last year in november
i was elected as president of the
American Cancer Society courage is the
largest cancer organization in the
United States and the largest
organization cancer organization in the
world the American Cancer Society
started in 1913 in was funded in New
York City and currently is I'm gonna
show you some pictures here dilemmas
my little thing here we have we have a
presence in over 5,000 communities in
the whole United States and our in other
places and we have three million active
volunteers 40 million donors home file
and we are the largest source of private
cancer research funding in the US we are
very proud that we helped to fund the
initial work of 42 scientists at the
time that they were young nobody paying
much attention I'm 42 of these
researchers they went to get the Nobel
Prize in medicine and physiology which
tells you about how we invest the money
that we received from the American
public in this research area on our name
when you ask people in the United States
name any health organization ninety-six
percent of the time the American Cancer
Society name comes up ah our budget for
last year was 1.2 billion dollars and
the remarkable thing is that eighty-five
percent of that money comes from
donations from the American people with
an average of only forty five dollars we
tells you that the popular support we
have is tremendous and the
responsibility we have missing men's
with the American people so you can
imagine that now I have this
responsibility of being the president
and the first Latino president is for me
such an honor
the American Society of course we are
accelerating the progress against cancer
in every community by saving lives
helping those touched by cancer and
empowering people to fight back this
condition I'm going to show you a little
bit how we do this how do we do it a big
chunk of our budget goes to research is
the largest source of private
not-for-profit cancer research found in
the USA almost three hundred million
dollars of plans goals for this research
every single year education we know that
cancer can be prevented cancer can be
detected earlier and let me throw out a
number for you right now this is very
important out of 100 people who died of
cancer nowadays in the United States 75
could have been either prevented or
detected earlier this is important in
other words to put in some other way
three out of four people with cancer who
would i would cancer in the United
States have conditions that could have
to be prevented or detected earlier
we're going to see which one are those
cancers later on and of course we do a
lot of this advocating issue which is
extremely important what is this that as
you know without policies without laws
nothing happens so early on we've found
out that
even though we gave a lot of money for
research even though we gave a lot of
money for education it wasn't enough we
needed things to change in washington DC
at the executive power or at the
congress that's why we have a huge a
group of volunteers millions as i said
four million volunteers many of those
are cancer survivors and they help us to
educate congressman politicians in
passing laws that are allowing us to
really put the cancer agenda in the
daily lives of Americans in the country
we have what we call the cancer
information service the NCIC the
national cancer information centers we
have we are the only group in America
that provide 24 7 365 days of this
telephone number available to the
American people if you call to this
phone number 800 a CH 2 3 4 5 22 7 2 3 4
5 anytime of the day or the night you
are going to find a voice that's going
to give you with an answer to your
question
questions my mother has been diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer what is that can
be cured a counselor and specialized
counselor can answer to your question
anytime I'm smoking nun I want to quit
can you help me yes we have a quick line
any time do they or denied that they
answer to your question this is really a
wonderful service that we have and this
24 hours and is bilingual in spanish and
english but we also have this cancer.org
it amazingly has you viewed you here at
Google you know this very well well for
a cancer organization based in the US
almost twenty-five percent of our
inquiries come from overseas from all
over the place they are asking on
questions from many different places the
world and of course we have many
publications that are books and
pamphlets all that stuff that we gave
away and we have many problems in the
communities on cancer prevention early
detection and patient services so this
is the call center this is the way we
have at the divisions oh we have a
places where people can go we have for
example what we call hope lodges you
know there are some people who live very
far away from from the cancer centers
they need to go and get treatment
whether they should treatment
chemotherapy and for them it is
extremely prohibitive to spend money in
hotels so we have this wonderful hablo
just huge houses and we host them for
whatever time they need to complete
their treatment see this is the way your
money is being used when you donate for
the American Cancer Society and before I
forget my blackberry is in my pocket but
I got an email from the California
division here on the person in charge
and they want to thank everybody at
Google because you had google our
wonderful partners of the American
Cancer Society every year you attend our
relay for lives here in Mountain View
and the surrounding counties and
every year you donate approximately
sixty thousand dollars for our work here
so I just want to thank you very much
Google for being partnered by the
American Cancer Society and this is
important to this program is what we
call the patient navigator program the
what did means is that when a person
develops cancer and that one person
doesn't have health insurance which is
very sad fact now in our country 50
million people are lacking health
insurance what navigators they do is
that they guide these patients through
the system and find a place for them to
be treated so in other words they
navigate patients in the turbulent
waters of our health care system which
is not doing well I probably need some
reform of course we empower people you
know with all these activities in the
advocacy and public policy we also have
a very active international program
because you know just south of the
border starting in Mexico up to Chile
the number one cause of death due to
cancer among women his cervical cancer
in imagine that it cancer that is one
hundred percent preventable with a
simple pap smear that is the number one
cause of death among Latin American
women
and that is not the self at the sad fact
is that almost eighty five percent of
those cervical cancers among these Latin
American women are found in curable what
we call a stage three four there's
nothing to do this cancer is the same
cancer prevention concepts like the one
we are going to share with you this
afternoon are completely unknown for
these people and go to Africa my god go
to Asia so we think that even though we
have a lot of problems to resolve here
in the United States of America for our
American fellows I think we need that
obligation to transfer some of this
knowledge to other disadvantaged places
in the world so this international
program is really working in that group
that regard and of course we have many
volunteer opportunities so if here at
Google review want to volunteer with us
just please contact the local American
Cancer Society there will be extremely
happy to what we do and you can give us
some of your wonderful time so we can do
more for Americans with cancer and also
of course we have alliances with many
corporations and actually this afternoon
Chuck is here with me because we want to
explore some possibilities working with
Google we would like to see what can we
do together how can we use the power of
google and the trust fund American
Cancer Society and the content that we
have so we want to explore how can we
work together maybe if conversations go
ahead some time from now we will be
saying that everything started july or
29th of 2008 and so hopefully we're
going to see that i'm going to change
this presentation to another one which
talks a little bit about what i do with
with my daily life
this is called the cancer ribbon torium
concept here I'm going to talk a little
bit more about cancer prevention which
is something practical that you need to
take home I used to be a medical
oncologist what does it mean to be a
medical oncologist as you'll know when
someone gets cancer and when when we
talk about cancer we are talking about
200 different conditions this is very
important as a concept that's why when
you maybe someday are going to hear in
the television there's no cure for
cancer yet what's going on see they
cannot big here for cancer because our
200 different conditions each one is
different from the other one is it so
cancer are all of these two hundred
different types of cancer as I said
before 75% can be prevented or detected
so I used to be in medical oncology when
someone gets cancer was telling you
there are three ways you can treat a
tumor three ways the oldest way to treat
cancer is the scalpel the knife cut it
out surgery those specialists are called
the oncology surgeons they operate
cancer they know how to do it they know
how to explore they know how to clean it
as the people call it surgical oncology
number one specialty the oldest then in
the 30s 40s I new specialty arose it was
radiation treatment once x-rays were
discovered this huge machines were
discovered the cobalt therapy machines
and nowadays what we call the linear
accelerators there are huge machines
that release high wave radiation and
they treat cancer and burn code marks
the cancer radiation treatment that is
the second way to treat cancer the third
form of treating cancer is a specialty
that started around the forest after the
second world world when by chance they
discovered that nitrogen mustard a gas
that was used in the war it's amazing it
was used in the war when the trenches
they discovered that some of these
survivors veterans they developed
leukemia when they were exposed to this
gas when they went to study these guys
master nitrogen they found that it
wasn't chemical that cool could also in
addition to cause cancer could destroy
cancer so that was the beginning of a
new specialty called chemo therapy
okay chemotherapy means that you give
drugs to a person either through the
mouth or through the Bane's directly but
these medications they go to your body
and kill the cancer cells that is
chemotherapy okay so surgery radiation
treatment and keep a medical oncology
are the three specialties well I used to
be in medical oncology for five years in
Peru I trained in how to administer
chemotherapy but something happened at
that time that made me uneasy of my
especial they are used to love it but I
realize that most of the cases with
cancer that were sent to me for
chemotherapy to give this kind of
treatment to these people they had very
advanced types of cancer but most of
these cancer were either preventable or
early detectable so I started to get
uneasy why why to give a chemotherapy
agent to a person which is a very strong
treatment when that one cancer could
have been found ten years before with a
simple pap smear and the things that
really change my mind when I asked to
these people with cancer with this huge
tumors do you know what a pap smear is
and people they didn't know do you know
what a mammogram is I have her but I'm
not sure what it is do you know that
cancer can be prevented I don't know so
people were lacking basic health
information but at the same time they
were lacking this basic health
information they were very knowledgeable
in all the entertainment world so operas
the life of the Michael Jackson or the
Madonna every body knew about these kind
of things that's why I got this idea
this concept that something needed to be
done for people to increase your
awareness in their early signs of cancer
to let them know that cancer is a silent
condition that needs to see the doctor
before they get a symptom so I quit
medical oncology I'm twen
years ago I embarked in this career of
cancer prevention and control which is
what I do and I'm going to let you know
a little bit later on so the concept is
that our health care system and that's
the reason I left medical oncology our
health care system is centered in the
person with a condition what does it
mean this is the reality of our health
care system in this healthcare system
all these people what are they doing
what they're doing is wait for a symptom
to appear to see the doctor think about
this in many societies in many groups
you only see the doctor when you have a
problem either you have a sore throat do
you have a tumor that's growing here or
you're loosing your weight or blood is
coming around you whatever Oh time to
see the doctor very few people are
proactive and see the doctor when when
symptoms are absolutely so if we have
this careful health care system
which is based on the person then we
create our extremely busy illness loaded
primary care system go to any Hospital
in America full of patients most of
those conditions preventable detectable
advanced cancer heart attacks strokes
uncontrolled diabetes that is the bulk
of our healthcare system and we spend
billions of dollars in this healthcare
system
are they often use the emergency room
you heard this because there are so many
people in the hospital's day people they
just want to shortcut and they go on to
go to the emergency room this is our
health care system it is extremely
expensive and efficient and we spent I
don't know okay 1.3 trillion dollars in
the healthcare system and the United
States is number 42 in life expectancy
in the world it's amazing so we're not
getting our money back why because
everything is condition disease illness
loaded with these conditions well in
addition to these people they have many
barriers many barriers to access our
health care system for example there is
no information there is linguistic
isolation for a lot of people they are
poor when they are poor your priorities
change there are no insurance coverage
you are lucky here they are fortunate in
this company to have wonderful
facilities hype was this morning for
your clinics there are great places you
have nutrition counseling you have
everything but that is not the reality
of millions of Americans 50 million
Americans they have no health insurance
and 25 million more Americans they do
have inadequate health coverage
so there are no programs that are
ethnically sensitive or culturally
competent for these people they don't
understand the medical healthcare system
so those are barriers that people have
every day that's why their security
comes what is the security for example
if you ask people do you think when you
reach the end of cancer are there any
pain medications that can leave pain
alleviate pain nineteen percent of
americans believe that there are no pain
medications that once you reach the end
you are going to die screaming of pain
that is not true and thirty percent they
don't know so if you add up these two
numbers that is like forty two percent
thirty two percent of people thirty two
percent that they are not aware of
something so important that there is a
lot of pain medication when you reach
the end of cancer so if you have people
thirty percent of americans believe in
that there is no pain medication when
you offer them screening activities they
all say no no I don't want that because
I don't want you even know if I have
cancer or not you see that great
fatalism seven percent of Americans they
believe that all you need to beat cancer
is a positive attitude not treatment you
see look at this this is amazing
are how much is it for fifty four
percent of americans believe that
treating cancer would surgery can cause
it to spread throughout the body so if
somebody gets a biopsy or get surgery
people believe that that's going to
spread the condition that's an old wives
tale from the last century but fifty
percent of americans still believe so
what i want to show you here is that we
here in America we still are holding
many misconceptions regarding cancer and
we need to change that so what are the
things that you need to do in order to
beat cancer there are some things you
have to do for example let me put
turning this off for a moment number one
the concept is the following one out of
two men and one out of three women are
going to get cancer during their
lifetimes think about this number one
out of two men and one out of three
women are going to get cancer during
their lifetimes that's one concept
second concept your chances of getting
cancer they start when you're a little
kid example skin cancer
they are studies that show that it is
the amount of UV light that you receive
when you are a little kid that's going
to determine your risk of developing
skin cancer when you are in your
thirties forties or fifties this is
telling me that we parents we need to be
careful with the kids young people that
don't have kids they need to be careful
with the little boys and girls if they
are around and with themselves meaning
that the risk of cancer starts at a very
early age a third concept that I would
like you to remember it's a very
important one cancer is a condition that
doesn't give you any pain any symptom
when it started this is important we are
the American Cancer Society we used to
have the famous seven warning signs of
cancer my god if you bleed through the
rectum if your are developing call for
hoarseness if you have a wound in the
skin that doesn't cure you know what we
drop those things in the sixties because
those things are laid cancer they're not
early warnings so the concept that you
have to really really really please put
inside you is that cancer is a silent
treacherous condition
therefore you have to do something to
try to find the cancers that can be
found early before this part and there
are only four tests that have been
proven to be effective in finding early
cancer I'm going to go one by one the
number one test is the pap smear the
psychology pap smears need to be done
every year after the first sexual
intercourse why sexual intercourse
because we know now that cervical cancer
ninety percent of cervical cancer cases
are due to the infection with a family
of viruses all the papilloma virus HPV
human papilloma virus it's amazing new
knowledge so HPV human papillomavirus
four species or four numbers of this
because there is a hundred of these HPV
is 100 of those four of those know by
the numbers 1618 28 and 31 they cause
ninety percent of cervical cancers among
women so look is amazing but at the end
of the day cervical cancer is an STD is
a sexual transmitted disease this is new
knowledge that's why we have now a
vaccine we have now a vaccine that has
been developed against two of these
strains number 16 and number 18 which
caused seventy percent of cases of
cervical cancer who need to be
vaccinated women little girls who hasn't
started sexual intercourse yet
see that's a new knowledge so that's the
number one test that proves that works
cytology pap smear the second test that
has been proven that it can work to
detect cancer is the mammogram a
mammogram is a test by which a woman
gets an x-ray of her breasts and cancer
can be found the size of a little grain
of sugar that size before you can be
touched when you find an early cancer
with that math you don't need to do
mastectomies anymore mastectomies
meaning that the whole breast needs to
get out that's past that's a thing of
the past for most women now in the US
why because we are finding that the
mammogram can find it cancer very earth
who needs to get a mammogram every woman
after the age of 40 how often once a
year they need to get a mammogram if the
woman got sisters or mother with breast
cancer then they need to start at the
age of 35 only for very high-risk women
who are the women who have mother and
one sister with breast cancer the
American Cancer Society recommends the
MRI the magnetic resonance imaging of
the breast for the rest of women that is
not necessary okay so first test pap
smears once a year every after the first
sexual intercourse number two the
mammogram test number three you are
brilliant here but you should know this
may be for your parents what is a test
is called a fecal occult blood test fobt
fickle from feces that's commencing
a cold blood test what does it mean this
test needs to be done every single year
in a person men and women after the age
of 50 why because it is after the age of
50 that you inside your column and
remember the digestive tract system
please allow me to say this some people
that remember your mouth your cell focus
your stomach and then comes 15 feet of
small bowel and then at the end we have
five feet of large bowel or corner
that's it very end in that large bowel
which is five feet people over 50 they
develop little pieces of meat that are
hanging like a little pieces of broccoli
there they are called polyps polyps and
we know is that these polyps one out of
ten polyps they become cancer and you
know what they bleed by they don't bleed
a lot so when people go to the toilet
normal grade no problem not you
that those fees they may have drops of
blood mix with the stools but there is a
test very easy test called fobt fecal
occult blood test that can be done at
the doctor's office actually we do it we
give it to patients they take it home
they get a sample they put some drops
they sent back to the office and they're
red and the result comes positive what
does it mean positive that that one
person has blood in those stools what we
do we ask the person to come we gave
them some laxatives we clean the guts
and then the person gets a colonoscopy
an exam by which it too small to be
introduced into the column and the five
feet are examined looking for these
little polyps and you know what they
take them out through the colonoscope
cancer can be prevent can you imagine
that's what every time you hear
that a person has died or has been
diagnosed with advanced colorectal
cancer you should thin by yourselves on
Micah that one person didn't know the
facts how is it possible that nowadays
in America where we have no this tool
somebody can be found to have an
advanced colorectal cancer impossible
you see lack of information that is a
third test okay first this was the pap
smear the second the mammogram the third
the fecal occult blood and colonoscopy
positive and the fourth which hasn't
totally demonstrated that came to
increase the life of a man who gets this
test is the PSA the prostatic a specific
antigen p from prostatic s from a
specific day from antigen which is a
protein that we measure in the
bloodstream of our men combined with the
rectal examination to see the men has
prostate cancer every man if he decides
to do so need to have these tests after
the age of 50 listen that's it x-rays of
the chest they don't work MRIs of the
chest they don't work what else
sonograms they don't work what else all
these markers they do in your budget if
they don't work for tests can find the
most common cancer that killed people in
our country
so the preventatives hi what is the
preventatives I the preventatives I goes
when the number one killer of people in
America who is that cigarettes every
single year listen to this number four
hundred and forty thousand Americans
died because of cigarette smoke 440,000
which is equal to twelve hundred a day
which is equal to 50 an hour and look at
what happened in the last weeks with
this salmonella scare that we had all
over the United States 1000 case is none
there's I mean the whole country was
paralyzed who cares about 1,200 people
dying every day Z what cigarette smoking
if our kids they don't start if adults
can quit we can really control thirty
percent of all deaths due to cancer in
the United States whatever be this one
out of three people who died of cancer
in the United States of America died
because of cigarette smoking
that's a big chunk of prevention so you
don't smoke great you are not in that
group the other prevented did think that
I will under interested for you to know
is regarding maintaining a healthy
weight eating well and exercising we
have some research now that's being
gathered that shows that if a person has
a healthy weight but more than a healthy
weight a healthy lifestyle is going to
prevent breast cancer prostate cancer
and colorectal cancer so what is the
advice here very simple to say and
difficult to do eat everything but in
small portions and try to prefer fruits
and vegetables over animal food if you
like animals would go ahead that's no
problem with that but be moderate with
the size of the portion that you eat
hidden okay and the second one is the
exercise put in your agenda your 30
minutes at least 30 minutes of exercise
in every day that is extremely important
that may be preventing colorectal cancer
breast cancer and and as I said also
even a colorectal prostate and breast
which are big chunks so you see
cancer is a condition as I said at the
beginning that is not one this is there
are 200 different conditions well we
know now for example that the number one
the most frequent this is a concept also
the most what we call prevalent that's a
scientific work the most common cancer
among women is breast cancer that is the
most common the most common cancer among
men is prostate cancer the second most
common among a man after prostate is
lung cancer the second most common among
women after breast is also lung cancer
and the third most common among men and
women is colorectal cancer is it that
what i was talking also only about
colorectal breast prostate and lung
because they are the chunk like us Oh
eighty percent of deaths due to cancer
are these four guys as are you heard
there's prevention and early detection
for these four guys
breast mammograms celebrates examination
be attentive see your doctor once a year
post it as i said the PSA the
examination blank don't smoke colorado
FOBT and colonoscopy you see these four
killers they have way to be prevented or
detected park so the american cancer
society we are extremely interested in
people knowing these facts and starting
to incorporate this knowledge into their
daily lives you are young mulatto
billion people here you are in the time
in your lives were lifestyle is going to
be extremely important and is going to
determine your risk when you reach your
fifties and sixties you're in your 20s
30s this is a time that you have to eat
well you have to acquire the behaviors
that are going to allow you just to
travel through time and decrease your
risk of cancer in the future so I think
I'm going to stop here my work I don't
want to present the the rest are some of
them are very gross or have some
pictures that don't want to impact you
but just to complete the story I was
telling you at the beginning once I
discovered that most of people they
didn't know the basic facts I started to
use radio and television to reach out to
people with knowledge I have daily
programs on television I'm sorry daily
radio shows I have weekly television
programs and reaching out signs of
people most of my workers in Spanish and
reaching out to this Latino immigrant
community but 14 years ago when I finish
all my studies my second specialty
actually I was hired by a hospital in
washington DC this hospital is called
the Washington Hospital Center and I
remember meeting with the director of
this cancer center and he told me it was
1994 he said you're the first cancer
prevention doctor I met
in this big cancer center we have
surgeons radiation therapists and
medical oncologist but you're the first
on preventative guy that I know what
would you do if I hire you he said well
I said what I would like to do is to
open a little clinic here for people who
are of low income but this clinic is
going to have a sign at the door that's
going to say this place is for people
without symptoms oh she said what who's
going to come to this clinic I said
people who are aware of my television
show my radio programs and they are
already convinced that they have to see
the doctor before they get a symptom I
he say who's going to pay for this I say
people are going to pay out of pocket
because even poor people when they see
the value of something they invest in
their health and he said well I'm not
sure your plans kind of bold but try it
if it doesn't work then you have to work
with the medical oncologist seeing
patients okay I said that's fine so we
started the clinic and in three weeks we
filled appointments for six months so
the demand of the public was immense why
because at that time 1994 my radio
programs my TV shows were they were very
popular and i already have convinced
people that they needed to see the
doctor before a symptom appear that's
called the prevent torium prevent
arguments at work that I coin to us
opposite to the old sanatoriums I don't
know if you remember in the history of
Medicine they used to be all sanatoriums
were people with tuberculosis or mental
health problems they used to go and die
in this place is it was very sad what
the sanatorium was that the proven
torium is a place only for people
without symptoms and then we have chats
on nutrition we talk about smoking we of
course
the blood pressure the whole staff I
examine patients you know from head to
toe and we do this for tests that I'm
telling you so people pay 120 dollars
once a year for the checkup and then
come back every single year it's exactly
like Jiffy Lube lay your car you take
the car for a tune-up get up see you
next time so that is a concept that's
what I this have morning when cansado
took me for the health clinic here you
have and I saw that a lot of your
consultations are preventative and
that's the way it should be and maybe
one of a no special office needed to be
created here at Google only for the ones
of you that want a prevention consult
I'm not sick I'll have no sore throat I
don't have anything I just want to talk
about smoking or I just want to talk
about do a check up on me maybe even a
mammography unit can be placed here so
women who are over 40 but I don't know
how much percent of your workforce are
over 40 but you can go take a break
instead of going to play volleyball
there you get your mammogram and then
you have the result you can have the
whole thing right here only for
prevention well I'm going to take some
questions I think that is the bulk of
what I wanted to say I just want to
finish saying that there is a lot of
hope and a lot of positive news
regarding cancer nowadays it is not as
used to be in the 50s or the sixties
even the 70s or 80s nowadays as we speak
there are 13 million Americans who are
cancer survivors why is that because we
have wonderful early detection methods
and we have wonderful treatments so
cancer is not the killer anymore that
used to be
we have wonderful ways to treat it
wonderful ways to detect it it is up to
people it is up to people to really know
those things and they can go to see the
doctor before they have a symptom to
find them earlier and it is up to
organizations like the American Cancer
Society and others to release this
message to the public and it is also
hopefully up to organization like yours
to work collaboratively with other
organizations to put this message out
maybe beginning for you with the
Googlers and maybe put in for the
general public all these tools on cancer
prevention because you know what cancer
can be prevented cancer can be detected
for 14 years in a row in the United
States the number of people dying of
cancer is decreasing and decreasing and
decreasing so we're making good progress
but we need to do much much more and I
really appreciate Gonzalo again the
opportunity to talk to you all here and
this is going to be a thing in you to
whatever but thank you very much for
this opportunity Gonzalo we have
questions that would be very happy to
yes we got seven more minutes for
questions thank you very much dr. Huerta
for coming he was amazing thank you
got any questions please if you can go
to the center of the room please I
didn't have my radio show today I get
questions all the time in the radio show
so I didn't have my fixed today so ask
me any questions any questions you may
have regarding cancer I would be very
happy transfer the patients that you see
in your Center what percentage have you
actually detected early cancer very good
question wonderful question what is the
rate of the textual cancer I have in my
clinic as I I didn't actually mention
this but the main risk factor the main
characteristic of a person to develop
cancer is H it is after 50 for the bulk
of cancerous start so my population at
this clinic is young because they are
the newly arrived immigrants the average
age of my patient is only 34 so
therefore the number of cancer is low I
have seen almost 25,000 people in these
clinics and i have found 83 cases of
cancer these cancers that i'm finding
are very early treatable but that is the
rate 82 out of almost 25,000 people and
second question is what about some of
the the silent killers the ovarian
cancer my dad recently died of
transitional cell cancer of the kidney
and
the things where they say there isn't
early detection exactly wonderful
questions yeah if you remember when I
said that three out of four cancers that
killed people in this country can be
either prevented or detected earlier
unfortunately that means that one out of
four cancer that killed people in this
country cannot be prevented cannot be
detected early the list is long brain
cancer kidney cancer ovarian cancer
stomach cancer pancreas cancer leukemias
lymphomas there's a list of cancers that
cannot be prevented or detected because
we don't have the means yet to do it we
are working hard we are funding
researchers for them to find these tools
but at this time we cannot give you any
answer tonight there's going to be a
program in Larry Cain they invited me to
appear i'm not sure if they are going to
ask me later on i'm still waiting for
their confirmation and this about a fact
that i have commented to a group of
people in lunch and it has to do with
these little things here cell phones
this little device when you put it right
here is sending electromagnetic fields
and research has shown that if you put
this little thing next to the
five-year-old little boy or girl the
electromagnetic fields go almost to the
other side of the brain if you put this
little thing next to the brain of a
ten-year-old goes almost half way
through inside the brain in an adult
most surf of it initial research that we
are still confirming showing that in the
side you use this little thing you may
get more what we call acoustic neuromas
tumors of the nerve that conducts
addition to your brain or maybe brain
cancer we're still learning about that
so we are in the preventative side what
is the thing you have to do consider
this thing as a very useful thing I use
it I'm not intending to stop using it
but you know what for a short
conversation one minute yes put it right
here no problem great to talk to you
later but if you're going to have a
conference call or you're gonna talk to
your boyfriend or girlfriend for 20
minutes 30 minutes one hour even a
salesperson don't put it right there get
your little court or even the Bluetooth
because it's 100 a less energy from the
bluetooth but the point that I'm trying
to make and probably hours either myself
or our chief medical officer tonight
hurricane is going to say consider this
little thing as a possible source of
complete disease
just two
put an analogy go backwards and you
cannot because you're very young to 1948
1948 1949 it was a huge discussion about
the possible effects of cigarette
smoking and lung cancer like a nobody
believed that no you're crazy this
cigarette causing cancer no way even my
own organization American Cancer Society
we didn't believe it we needed proof
proof proof it took for us 11 years
until nineteen sixty to pass a
resolution saying yes cigarette smoking
causes cancer on how many millions died
over those years that's I'm taking dad
same attitude you know what be careful
with these things use it because our
important extremely important but you
know what they may be may be harmful for
you and we may find out that they are
harmful for you in the year two thousand
and twenty eight or 2030 when you
already got all that exposure during
those years and don't give it to kids
don't give it to kids
any other question we got time for one
more question
you said um you've been working with the
immigrant communities in DC so do you
have any breakdown about how r which
ethnic groups are they
disproportionately affected by cancer
these days or other is there any data
about the the breakdown thank you yeah
well immigrants are coming from all over
the world the United States is a nation
of immigrants we come from all over the
world but over the last 50 years most of
the immigrants are from Latin America
also Asia they are coming by thousands
and thousands among Asian Americans for
example they have higher rates of cancer
of the breast they are starting to have
breast cancer and there is this paradox
they're like which in Japan and many
Asian countries breast cancer rates are
low but once they come to the u.s.
something happens that they start
getting breast cancer they also get
cervical cancer a very high rates
especially the newly arrived Korean
Vietnamese communities because they
don't know about prevention they're very
shy about going to see the doctor you
know so they don't get up smears one day
they are bleeding through the vagina
they see the doctor cervical cancer I'm
sorry those are some of the most
frequent cancer among these Asian
communities also a very rare cancer that
is in the throat that's also very common
among them among Latinos out of the 40
million Latinos in this country
sixty-five percent of them are Mexican
Americans they are the majority and
obesity rates are very high in these
communities and we are seeing the same
pattern of distribution of cancers as in
the general population meaning breast
cancer lung cancer are the most common
among these people what happens that
even thought they have the same
distribution
the frequency the incidence is lower
among these immigrant communities we
don't know why but they have less cases
of cancer the problem is that when they
go to see the doctor again they're late
huge tumor for all those berries that we
show you no insurance etc so they live
less time this revival is less so all
another cancer is cervical cancer and
another cancer among Latinos is liver
cancer as you know liver cancer is a
cancer that can be prevented through a
vaccine because eighty percent and that
is another cancer in Asian Americans its
liver cancer that's a very common among
them why is that because liver cancer is
the consequence of chronic infection
with appetite is B and hepatitis C virus
so if you prevent by vaccinating kids
for epic I this be then you are going to
prevent a liver cancer in the future
another cancer that is very common among
Latinos is stomach cancer which is very
common in Latin America and they think
it is because of the infection by a
bacteria Oh helicobacter pylori have you
her about this story this is very
fascinating
for many years we doctors are very
dogmatic dogmatic meaning that we we
learn something and for doctors is very
difficult to change that thing that they
gave you at the school of medicine and
the dogma was that enough nothing could
grow in the stock the stomach was so
acid you know it does this high a
chloride rukh acid that the dogma was
nothing can grow inside the stomach
nothing for years well it was in the
1970s two hours through Australian crazy
guys they demonstrated that the stomach
of dogs they had bacteria the bacteria
here in the stomach of dogs they went to
look for these bacteria among human
beings and they found the bacteria there
too so they wrote in scientific papers
you know we are finding bacteria in the
stomach of people or the doctor say haha
look at these guys are invited bacteria
haha they said their contamination may
be in the laboratory they kept
researching and they found that these
bacteria cause gastritis acute
inflammation of the stomach they wrote
in a paper again scientific paper
helicobacter pylori causes gastritis
mm-hmm nobody believed because the dogma
was so strong one of these guys he had
to prepare a broth with bacterium water
okay and previously he had a gastroscopy
and his stomach was beautiful clean they
took biopsies everything fine and after
that he took the broth with bacteria and
he developed this terrible gastritis
luckily he took antibiotic let it go and
clean himself he published that no way
that cannot be possible it took 20 years
of work for all the doctors you start
believing and these two guys dr.
Marshall and don't remember the other
guy they got the Nobel Prize two years
ago because they discover that the
bacteria can cause gastritis and can
cause stomach cancer here in the US is
luckily very very not frequent this kind
of infection in poor countries up to
eighty percent of little kids they
already have the bacteria in their stock
so you see all these things that we hear
the Cancer Society we try to research
and try to fund and maybe this is the
last word just to us to thank you again
if you are American Cancer Society
contributor and invite you to keep
working with us so we can just wipe out
cancer from the United States of America
thank you very much dr. overcoming to
thank you very much for coming to all of
you guys and we are gonna you know share
with you and for some of you guys that
you know that this is a panic Googler
networking event and we got some
t-shirts for you if you want to just
come here to the side and you can get a
t-shirt thank you again dr. Huerta thank
you thank you thank you very much thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
