and very excited to welcome our guest
speakers from instead we have edges esky
who's the vice president of engineering
and also Eric Rasmussen and instead I'm
sure many of you are familiar but there
are a bear area based nonprofit that
focuses on using technology in emergency
situations like for example natural
disasters or disease outbreaks and
google has had a very long relationship
with instead that we're very proud of
going back to as far as 2006 so we were
actually there there first fender when
they were a very new start-up in palo
alto and we actually continue to support
they work particularly in southeast asia
where they're working on disease
surveillance and management and they
have an innovation lab in cambodia but
today it's going to focus on it can
haiti right after the earthquake they
were one of the very first organizations
on the ground and they actually worked
directly with search and rescue efforts
to identify survivors under the rubble
and actually and free those survivors so
very exciting if it were very proud of
it and we're very excited to hear a
little more today about the work that
they did this so welcome to instead good
morning good afternoon it's a pleasure
to be here thank you for the opportunity
to talk my name is Eric Rasmussen i'm
the CEO for instead I'm instead as
Joanne mentioned has a very long
tradition with Google we were the first
organization that I know of that Google
spun off we are an independent 501c3 we
work on two particular things one we
work on humanitarian base free and open
source software that we have used in a
number of very difficult places and it's
for information flow when it really
really matters it information move the
other thing we do is technical capacity
building we have the ability to teach in
the developing world with the people
actually using our software and we give
them the opportunity to make that
software their own we opened our website
in January of 2008
what we're looking at here is about two
and a half years of effort and just
about two years to the week after we
opened our website Haiti happened and
that's what we're going to talk about
today what it means that have an agile
technology ethos when lives are at stake
on the twelfth of january two thousand
ten infrastructure in haiti effectively
disappeared things that used to be
difficult even in the best of times
became all but impossible i have had 18
or so deployments i worked in Katrina I
worked in Banda Aceh a I've worked in
four different Wars this was the worst
I've ever seen the numbers are little
soft nobody actually knows but it's
something on the order of a quarter of a
million dead and about 1 million
homeless and about a quarter of a
million destroyed buildings absolutely
astonishing level of damage the United
Nations was there when in about 48 hours
and they are in charge of most aspects
of disaster response on the
international stage we showed up very
shortly afterwards and as a consequence
what we have here is the first
humanitarian forum two o'clock on that
saturday i believe afternoon the
earthquake had been on a Tuesday one of
the things to note here is that nobody
on there in the room speaks Creole
that's important we went from that
humanitarian forum meeting back over to
the Port au Prince airfield where we
were working with the United Nations
search and rescue dispatch center we
first found our colleagues on the
Icelandic search-and-rescue team and
then went right next door to the
adjacent tent to the UN search and
rescue dispatch center where you see in
the brown hat nakoda tada who is an
engineer with instead working with map
action an implementing partner for the
office of coordinator for humanitarian
assistance for the UN and they are
working on trying to get information
around the field to dispatch search and
rescue teams just like this there were a
lot of search and rescue teams that were
on the ground
by the time we got there this is four
days after the earthquake and we have
something on the order of 50 teams it
was 56 at the end of the
search-and-rescue phase you can see
under us a nine teams are there that is
roughly one-third of the entire US
contingent of urban search-and-rescue
teams it is very difficult to move
around port-au-prince in the best of
times when the streets are blocked and
there never were any street signs you
wind up having to give coordinates it
turns out that coordinates are not
always latitude and longitude mg RS is
another version and there are many many
more beyond that coordination of
information on where things were located
was a big part of our collective problem
you also note the plus 88 that plus 88
means that people are using satellite
phones to communicate because until we
got well into the first week there were
no cell signals working efficiently in
port-au-prince there was some scratchy
stuff but not much the people who were
picking up folks out of the rubble we're
taking them to where they could and
those three hospitals i just showed were
a part of it this was the MINUSTAH
hospital that is excellent lighting as
you can tell within that surgical suite
because it's sunshine we were doing this
in the open air we did more than 50
amputations in the street because there
was no heavy equipment in haiti and it
was necessary to simply remove limbs for
people who were trapped and it looked
like this and unfortunately as I
mentioned nobody spoke creole and these
people speak only Creole so we have a
bit of a problem in communication health
information systems were English
messages written on bandages the people
who were uninjured still had no homes to
go back to so they went where they could
and established what they could for
living conditions this as you can tell
is in a bit of a depression that
depression was six weeks before the
onset of the rainy season you can
imagine what this looks like and you can
see some of the floods that washed away
some of these camps on YouTube critical
infrastructure includes water pumps and
part of what we saw here is the normal
delivery of water which is in these
water sachets this is ordinary for Haiti
but ordinarily those sachets our two
cents apiece by the time we got there
they were ten cents apiece which
dehydration and hygiene were already
beginning to suffer we found that there
were people still trapped in the rubble
alive when we got there and people like
this man walking to work trying to get
the country back together again that's a
working hypothesis would hear people
screaming hear people moaning under the
rubble and had no way to contact central
authorities and needed to have a method
to do that we also found this that radio
stations were coming back up but radios
require either the delivery of
electrical outlets for power or delivery
of batteries and they were few or
running off a carb which required fuel
and that was in very short supply
however cell phone charging systems off
the batteries that you see their car
batteries or a common industry so we
knew that we'd be able to reach people
by cell phone we went out to find out
just how the search and rescue teams
were doing business what they required
in the course of their day we attended
the same briefings that they did and
then we got to work this is nico de toda
working on the port-au-prince airfield
and he did not sleep for most of three
days working with people all over the
world and an important aspect of our
lifeline is the red circle that you see
over there that is a began satellite
terminal we'll talk more about that in
just a minute and we also tuned in very
quickly to the cell system in haiti
itself and you can see that nico is
beginning to exchange data is that we're
working for the systems that we knew
were live in port-au-prince we began to
get friends with this man Hamish
Pritchard formerly of the uk's british
antarctic survey team and he was
carrying messages to us and i'm gonna
let ed jasor ski our vp of engineering
take over from there ed thank you Eric
and as I transition I wanted to talk a
little bit about what was the end result
of our work in Haiti we ended up
deploying a system that allowed
survivors with cell phones to actually
text in their location or whatever help
they need it in whatever form that would
then get routed to a crowd flower who
was providing crowdsource translation
and geolocation
into thomson reuters teams who are doing
a journalistic system for Haitians so
they could get targeted messages saying
this hospital opened this clinic open
HIV medicines are available here all
life-saving or at least life improving
information that they need to help
themselves like journalism for the
survivors and then of the RSS feeds etc
to use her Haiti as part of this project
466 that you might have read about and
I'll talk about it in a second but at
the end of the day 25,000 people were
helped over a million text messages were
sent out in order to help them with
information and I want to tell you a
little bit about what as an organization
we do to prepare for that what is a sort
of work that happens before that and
more importantly what are other works
that we're doing because instead
disaster response effort is really under
twenty percent of what we do and as I
google.org a grantee we think it's
important for you to hear understand and
engage in a way that you know might be
interesting to you and helpful to the
needs of the field so as Eric said what
we do is we helped create deploy and
maintain technology that helps in
humanitarian situations this includes
public health in villages in Southeast
Asia as well as more extreme crisises
like Haiti with things in between like
supporting different organizations
during the h1n1 crisis helping hospitals
hook up information to report syndromic
for aisle I surveillance and with the
way we work is really having very small
teams where a very small group that goes
out to the field learns the requirements
implements them does a lot of design in
situ to see what's really the problem
that needs solving and evolves the
technologies constantly to help with the
problems that we face and Google Dora
came to us three years ago two years and
a half ago without with a challenge they
said you know if you choose to accept
this challenge we want you to deploy
technologies that will help national and
international disease surveillance in
six countries in Southeast Asia that in
a way that spans from village reporting
all
the way to international policy makers
and ministries of health exchanging
information now we were lucky because we
were working as in the support of a
group that was doing the international
exchange of information think about
China Vietnam Laos Cambodia deciding to
share their disease numbers these are
numbers that could change tourism
figures it's a national security to some
extent but then going all the way down
to the field and helping with mobile
phones and whatever technology would
work the reporting of these diseases and
to give you an idea of the magnitude of
this challenge imagine there's an
organization in Cambodia right now we're
ten people meet in a room and they tell
them we will ask you to go and help
disease surveillance in the whole of the
USA you don't speak English you don't
read English we want you to transform
the way real-time disease surveillance
gets done in the USA now go and these
Cambodians get on a plane and come to
the USA right of course with some
contacts etc so I want to tell you a lot
about that about the techniques that we
did to design these technologies so as
Eric mentioned we got created in Ted as
a TED Prize in 2006 by Larry brilliant
immediately after that actually in 2007
we formed the current team and we
immediately started through a phase of
rapid prototyping trying on things
seeing what technologies were out there
that would help both in a crisis
situations as well as doing things in
two weeks trying them out in the field
this picture of her hips sorry this
picture over here is from the first
prototype of a tool called geo chat that
was actually tried out in Palo Alto
search and rescue exercise operations
two years ago a lot of interaction
design experiments with it things that
tapped into Facebook data to see that
could help monitor for diseases or get
disaster teens together we started
working with the people in the country
seeing what data was available what sort
of infrastructure they had what data
they considered important that was up to
date you discover lots of things for
example poultry density maps you know
chickens per square mile is a very
important map in Southeast Asia with all
the h5n1 and avian
flew risks that they have so you start
learning these things and how they get
integrated into processes what are the
technologies they use what is
organizations and the politics behind
them and what are the local innovators
that are really working with the skills
and resources they have to improve the
system so with all of this week and
working with local universities we call
last of our first steam there and
started working and our team now is all
made out of cambodian folks and locals
who are getting training as part of the
exercise and we found many issues the
first issue is in disease surveillance
collaboration gaps is the problem
sometimes somebody has the right
information about a disease outbreak
happening and it doesn't go to the right
person or people that work in animal
health and human health and humans are a
type of animal so somehow they should be
interrelated don't work together
different monitoring systems different
alerting systems and we had to bridge
those gaps also gaps in literacy and
connectivity obviously there was very
little appropriate design a lot of
efforts come from outside they drop ship
with a parachute nice technology and off
they go and these things they barely
work they don't get used as intended
nobody knows how to maintain them I've
we've seen in villages where the clinic
had solar panels that only work for a
week three years ago and we're never
able to be maintained again and the same
thing happens in digital technologies
and finally no sustainable innovation
you know what Google how important it is
to have a culture of challenging your
own assumptions and moving the ball
forward and really seeing what is the
next step like that innovation is part
of your DNA and what we saw there was
very little thinking about how tins
instantiate innovation processes in
country I mean how r Cambodians going to
invent the next technology that is
necessary in Cambodia so I'm going to
take a little bit about how we tackled
these challenges the first one the first
set of collaboration gaps that we saw we
started tackling with the design of
technologies over thirty percent of our
users people registered in systems using
things actively every day never access
the internet
it's all like never as in once a week
they never access the internet actually
they might not even probably know that a
lot of the systems they're using have
cloud-based data centers behind them
they're just exchanging SMS messages
with other people sending data into
databases receiving alerts and the whole
notion of navigating to a web page also
see that information is probably not
there we have huge gaps with local
languages and we have some dude that's
here for you to look at afterwards but a
combined which is the language of
Cambodia is the closest language that
exists today that is close to sanskrit
if you see some letters here it's not
benefited from eddie modernization in
terms of the shape of the language the
characters how a sentence are structured
there's multiple alphabets depending on
what you want to say and cancer that
support this are not in high demand in
the market so there's a slow adoption of
Hans's that let you type an SMS in your
own language and finally you think of a
country with a lot of rural areas a lot
of villages with small clinics and
health centers like these with no
electricity no connectivity and who do
you think requires the information the
most to see what diseases need to be
monitored for and who has the best
information about what is going on in
the field is these people in systems
metaphor they are your first sensors and
they're your first and best and fastest
actuators so they're the ones who you
really want to empower with all the
information that you can and you want to
bring into these collaboration systems
right now the challenge is they take
disease numbers in a piece of paper it
goes into a pile that pile gets sent to
the capital city every once in a while
or to the province gets typed into a
computer system then it gets typed into
another computer system and six months
afterwards it gains visibility at the
central level right and a lot of the
rapid response really happens through
phone calls and people just trying to do
an ad hoc process every time the
challenge with that is that the right
people get missed an expert that could
have contributed get left gets left off
or as we found out phone numbers change
some letting the field just wants to
send something to their to the Rapid
Response Teams they lost their
address book number or the number change
suddenly they're out of the loop and
it'll be course but you get in a 4 by 4
later in the weekend to drive and say
the things personally and these are
other challenges that our technologies
are facing so and what we're going to
tackle it is designing technologies in
the field so the pictures were showing
is from visits that we do with our local
team to discuss these requirements and
these challenges in the local language
to some rapid prototyping and implement
some tools geo chat is one of these
tools it's evolved over the last two
years it's a mixture of groups plus
messaging with geolocation built all
together a lot of different components
you could think of our from different
tools you're familiar with but the whole
notion that somebody could send one text
message and it goes to a group of people
and somebody else in that group replies
and it goes again to the whole group of
people as a chat room can be really
revolutionary as simple as it sounds
probably because it is as simple as it
sounds the notion that we can bake in
geolocation from the get go into almost
everything means that analysis mean is
simpler and I'll tell you more about the
two later all you're seeing here is a
screenshot I took just this morning six
hours ago over in a book DeHaan province
in northern Thailand jungle near the law
border we're sending some disease
monitoring numbers and I think these 246
5329 all relates to a number of sick
people or people with a certain disease
being exchanged and by instead of by
replacing the paper systems going
hierarchically with peer-to-peer based
systems that share information in the
cloud we're making that data get to the
people who need it in a faster way
another one of our platform technologies
is a riff and the technologies that help
to haiti survivors was were built on
riff the 46 36 short code you might have
seen stuff about was sending messages
that were authored in this environment
where you could say what are the
messages of the population is sending
them sending in categorize them do the
translation do some analysis and slicing
and dicing to see what are
trends from the field what are people
asking about what are the issues with
their facing and then author things in
English get them translated to Creole
and blast them out to a Geo targeted
groups and this allowed us to send
messages like these that generic health
messages people started seeing that
there were people complaining about eyes
so conjunctivitis messages started
coming out helping prevent a very rough
disease hospitals were opening and if
you're short of trauma the diet rukh etc
hospitals these sort of messages can be
vital we did an analysis with Thomson
Reuters foundation of what was the
impact of the EIS system that we were in
technical support of it was really their
initiative we provided the geekery to
them over seventy-five percent of people
receiving these sort of messages change
their behavior a courtesan so now
instead of thinking about cell phones as
a way of reporting data and visualizing
it while we're away think about how we
can use those two way radios essentially
to give the data that could help the
crowds self-organized faster and better
and you know these messages went only to
like if we went to under 30,000 people
if you think of over you know two
million people affected it's a drop of
water but it's a start of a trend it's
the largest scale system of this sort
that has ever happened and I think it's
kind of become a milestone in the
history of humanitarian technology about
how to vote survivors and their mobile
phones after a crisis and as we go
through working in the in the field and
the way these designs we find additional
gaps for example you saw these little
messages before with these numbers
obviously somebody's trying to report
some data would it be good to be able to
do the feature extraction and be able to
analyze that and put that into you know
databases for better analysis so what we
start doing is little you know cluster
and collection of services that help
with these bits and pieces locating on
somebody when they're sending a location
in like a MOOC DeHaan or something like
that is easy when they're sending local
village names in locals
misspellings its rougher so obviously we
have to wait to extract those place
names from their messages and we've
built systems that combine machine
learning algorithms and human feedback
to basically allow users train the
system how to parse information so we
went out there to the field and we try
doing some training to send in a
structured data to an SMS system and we
did a very simple exercise we want you
to report five cases of malaria and
three cases of dengue so I want you to
send em 5d3 can you do that can you send
an SMS with em 5d three big letters on a
slide right and it's very visible
everybody send that and we saw what came
in and analyzing what came in people
send anything from common misspellings
like missing the letter by one
separators new lines expected things all
the way to somebody who just sent 53 and
we asked why did you just send 53 didn't
you see like m5 d3 and they were like
yeah but everybody else is sending the M
and the deal ready so why should I pay
with my credit to send those two extra
letters right if you try to surmount
these issues you'll have to train a
whole country right in a whole
countryside in how these things work so
you really have to make systems that
adapt to their way of thinking so seeing
tags it's a pun on syntax and it's one
of the systems that we've built on top
of geo chat to allow people report data
and it uses very simple user feedback to
extract the data and the numbers
regardless of which order they come in
and uses some heuristics to do that and
all of this stuff is open source and it
can be used by anyone in their projects
as well another huge gap not just
reporting numbers that we found is a gap
in literacy I mean you dealing with semi
literate people people who know how to
read and write but following certain
sorts of instructions authoring certain
types of messages and mobile phones are
beyond the capability of the training
and so we think that technology can help
and in this case non digital technology
what you're looking at here is a
clinician in a rural area of Cambodia
who has the task of reporting certain
diseases every week to make sure that
they go into the central analysis as
fast as possible and they don't really
couldn't get them to send the sin taxes
that were necessary to report this data
so we need some sort of aid was needed
and our platform team nico di da da
working with the I new innovation lab
team which we'll talk about in a while
started putting together these
non-electronic wheels essentially that
allows somebody in their own local
language to dial in the little cutouts
to the left what they need to report and
on the right they get some numbers then
they just dial in into an IVR system you
know to to do and in goes the data the
smart thing about this it's not just
that it's a physical device that they
can hold in your hands that they can
build on their own we have a you're
creating a website where you can enter
the data that you need to report and it
will give you PDF cut and assemble
instructions that you can print and put
together by yourself the way that the
data is encoded in the numbers to the
right includes some error resiliency
you'll notice that they're all prime
factors basically of two primes and
based on the numbers that get reported
in we actually can tell whether they
made a mistake sending the data whether
they should have been supposed to be
reporting that data and we can even
guess with a high margin what was the
data they were probably intending to
send so even if they miss a digit it's
not like there's a very small difference
between reporting one case of malaria or
11 cases of malaria here we can tell the
difference and it makes for much more
accurate data from field from locations
that otherwise would not be able to
report this sort of information this
fast and here's one of our early
prototypes made out of paper of course
the final version has things in their
local language and because it's made out
of paper people just write other stuff
on the disk for their own instructions
from reminders and so on helping them be
more productive and responding to a
protocol better and there's a whole
bunch of building blocks if you're
interested in the architecture behind a
lot of instead services work a lot with
national wireless operators we have
direct VPN connections to the people who
operate the largest phone companies in
Laos Cambodia Thailand sometimes we get
asked how to manage their data centers
and configure their phone systems in
production it's kind of scary in a way
but on top of their infrastructure we
have these messaging gateways
essentially multiplexers and
demultiplexers that can work from a
direct connection with a phone company
all the way down to a little phone
plugged in as a modem to a computer and
bring all those messages into one soup
and then route things to the different
applications appropriately geo chat is
one of such applications and we have
seen tags and other applications coming
on top of that riff as the 81 and it has
other applications built on top of that
and what we're seeing now is an
ecosystem of people building your own
applications on top of ours to fulfill
their own needs in health this might not
sound revolutionary to your like
obviously we make platforms you know you
make wave you put an API on top you let
people build their own stuff it's a way
of thinking right let that innovation
that is up the fringe of your effort be
taken on by your users but how many
medical record systems do you know that
you could just go and do a mashup around
and get some data and add some
functionality to how many medical record
systems you think in low income
countries are built in a way that a very
low level developer with just some PHP
skills can bring in an extent and the
answer is pretty much zero so by
actually allowing this sort of
architecture we enabled cases like these
where a local partner in Thailand they
needed to report real time spikes in the
reporting from hospitals of people with
influenza-like symptoms right without
before the diagnostic just get the real
time spikes and I've never even actually
have to admit I've never seen the
application itself but people who have
seen a chunky looks great and what it's
doing it's taking real-time reports
through geo chat right off into this
custom app that using the api's gets the
data in
put it in a database does some very
simple trend analysis and comes back
with alerts to the right geocoded
facilities about disease alerts and this
sort of innovation if brought into low
income country health systems we thing
can be huge because a lot there's a lot
of local inventiveness and also there's
a lot of local passion to help improve
your own society but you know when you
don't give them something to stand on
they just have to start from scratch and
it's just too hard and this actually
gets around that problem another example
of an emergent architecture was what was
done in Haiti we're all these different
building blocks now across organizations
including samasource Ushahidi crowd
flour instead person finder sahana just
kind of came together coordinated or
real-time skype chats with messages
coming in from this company confirm
company going out through none tiem riff
out through RSS feeds to a crowd flower
from there through RSS feeds tuya haiti
and then analyzed by people and people
typing back things in into person finder
or Sahana as appropriate nobody had
planned its architecture before and it
was great that it was put together it
helped it saved lives it helped things
become better I think the challenge now
is to help systematize and plan this
when you're in a crisis you have to
really put on the blinders and say what
is the basic things I can't depend on
right so we have to transform this
fantastic fluke into something that is
predictable something that is
systematized where the organizations can
work together and all the response
agencies that need it can rely on this
in a in a way that's predictable so I
talked about the collaboration gaps I
want to talk a little bit about how do
we design these systems and I just
talked about a couple of the
applications we've built I gave the
metaphor of people coming to the United
States from Cambodia with a mission to
improve the health information system
and to
years make it real time web shared etc I
challenge somebody doing that for Obama
but nevermind and you come with your
they come with their own idea so what
might work what might not work their own
cultures so does anybody who's working
over there so if Marco Polo when he was
in his travels he came to Africa with
his own concept about what was out there
in the world and european lore had lots
of stories about you know dragons and
fantastic animals and when he went to
the field he found differences between
all these things he had heard about on
what was in reality so if i told you now
put yourself in marco polo shoes and
then they say imagine an 1 an animal
with one horn who roams the planes right
who is huge and kind of magical in a way
nobody ever sees them to up close and
this guy starts thinking oh wow you know
it's these unicorns you know something
like fantastic i got to go see them
myself and then sees this right that
tells you how your own lenses you know
what you walk with as your own mindset
can actually change what you expect to
see now when you're going into design
health information systems for low
income countries you cannot afford to
get the design wrong and there are many
things you can do to get around it but
the first one is really a very zen
attitude of don't expect you know if
you're expect if you're expecting you're
already one step behind the game and so
we use methods to actually get ahead and
across those barriers the first thing is
using agile very aggressively we're a
small team we only have like four
developers in a platform team and for
developers in our I lab team and they
all use agile practices you probably do
here at Google as well our platform team
uses six-week releases with Julia
iterations XP scrum sort of stuff and
our AI lab team uses Kanban doing more
real-time prioritization of tasks and
that this allows us to have a constant
dialogue with our users going back every
two weeks and saying is this right is
this right is this right
is this better a or b right and keep
evolving the system faster because we
don't know our users don't know the
context is changing and to discover what
works you need that dialogue and that
constant discovery approach we also use
design techniques that allow us to
experiment with systems even before they
get built this is a picture of China our
product manager in Cambodia she is in
charge of making sure that we understand
our user requirements doing the
interaction design rapid prototyping and
field support and what you're seeing
here is a live exercise of something
called Wizard of Oz and somebody had to
explain Wizard of Oz to me because I'm
haven't seen the movie as a kid but in
The Wizard of Oz at the end of the whole
journey to meet the wizard they are in
this big room and there's big magical
being appears and they start interacting
with him and it turns out that it's just
a guy pulling strings behind the curtain
I don't pay attention to the man behind
the curtain and what we do sometimes to
discover what applications are needed
before we ever get the chance to write
one line of code we do the same thing we
tell people in a clinic hey you know
what we have this fantastic new system
this fantastic new system will if you
send this text message send you back
what are the priority procedures you
have to remind your staff off to be able
to detect and you know constrain that
disease in an earlier way and they're
like oh this sounds like a fantastic
system can i try it oh absolutely send
this text message to this number and
you'll see the response or call this
number and you will interact with our
specially trained operator who will be
able to tell you the information and the
operator is somebody signing outside the
clinic the system is somebody sitting in
the back of the room like you are
pretending to be the system and replying
with the data and so we get the real
feedback right it's like so what do you
think is that response useful well no
actually I need more information about
pediatrics because we work with a lot of
schools here ok let's do this again try
it again system more Pediatrics right
and now the message comes back with more
information
on that and in that way pretty much in
an afternoon you can go through a whole
gamut of potential applications you
could do you could kill fast the ones
that are not applicable and get a better
understanding of those which are and the
thing is getting to what's appropriate
for every level we realize that in
different context different things are
needed what you're seeing here is a live
you know touchscreen kind of interaction
with avian influenza tracking data from
strong gay joke back in two thousand six
or something when these like you know
large stable touch screens were starting
to become familiar and we see some VHF
radios local cell phones and we don't
come in with a presumed idea of what
works with chosen cell phones for some
of our tools because it is what's
appropriate for them sometimes SMS
sometimes it's voice now we're working
to see if we can integrate for domestic
stuff some of our efforts with a more
VHF and radio base technology because
that's appropriate for the local needs
so if you expect something to be the
solution you know the Silver Bullet if
you expect something to work in a
certain way because it worked like that
in other places or if you expect the
people to prefer one design of our
another one you'll be surprised so
that's why we have to keep on our toes
and I think that the last but most
important aspect a challenge that we
found in the field was as systematizing
an innovation process and innovation
culture how do you make people feel the
ownership of the problem and given the
tools and the capital and the skills and
the connections and everything else to
go and tackle those problems really say
I'm going to take my stab at this again
in in the US and in high-income places
you're used to the ability to that you
know that if you put your effort to it
you could get some data about your
community and get some good
visualizations and maps and do something
about your environment or your health
process that's why you probably work
here in low income countries that ball
still starting through is still starting
to roll and our approach to bridge this
gap was to set up what we call an
Innovation Lab two years ago
we created a local team we're working in
open spaces where other people from
around the country in the region can
come and collaborate they are working
every day on distilling what are these
issues in the field what are the simple
technologies that can be built and
gaining skills in interaction design
development quality deployment and
support to make these technologies run
the pictures here are coming kind of
rough it's a low contrast thing but what
you don't see there is like an open
space of one of our physical labs with a
set of developers working doing
technologies and applications that were
demanded by local people they discuss
the requirements in their own language
they coded them up they deployed them
and they're doing the support and the
maintenance and evolution now and
imagine what could happen if you could
have local developers understand the
basic building blocks of these sort of
systems at work in humanitarian
scenarios they know how to make SMS
applications that work at the carrier
grade right so they could build an
application that since two million
messages per hour just like that they
know how to make mapping applications
they know the basics of GIS they know
how to make applications that work with
KML they know how to do basic analytics
they are not afraid of learning new
languages and actually we encourage that
all the time saying try something new
expound your boundary now just get out
of that comfort zone as a way of life
and it's gone into this stage where I
love coming to the lab every time I go
because they go like oh ed by the way we
made this application here it's being
used for this and this and that in
Animal Health tracking or something and
fYI there's like 200 people using it in
such province it's like ok awesome and I
know that it's all done by locals for
locals and that this is a sustainable
long-term set of skills that exists in
the country there's another aspect to it
and what you're looking at here is a
picture of a Bangladeshi woman who works
for Grameen Shakti Grameen Shakti is an
energy company a social enterprise they
make solar products hiya fish
clay ovens and biogas sort of products
and what they do with their solar panel
stuff is that they don't assemble the
things in China just bring them in and
deploy them they bring the crates of
materials of resistors the boards and
everything and they train women at the
village level to assemble it a woman can
walk up to a Grameen Shakti office woke
up with a basket full of resistors and
capacitors and some boards and get some
training about soldiering assemble
whatever she can get electricity some of
these boards and come back and sell each
one that works at eight cents a pop in a
average day they can probably make
around a dollar a day assembling these
boards a dollar a day puts you above the
poverty line right and it also means
that the women have skills to maintain
and support and no quedan support
businesses around solar panels Grameen
trains schoolgirls to troubleshoot these
solar panels right if a solar panel
breaks they don't have to call somebody
in China or get a replacement there's a
local business somebody for a couple of
dollars might help you fix your stuff
and this is a great example of how if
you push a lot of your kind of like
assembly to the edge you're creating a
set of skills that will allow others to
innovate and create their own businesses
and create their own opportunities and
their own social enterprises with these
newfound skills and in a way what we're
doing at the ilab is similar with
digital technology right I am sure that
at one point in time some of our lab
members will come up with this great
startup idea and want to help society
with technology and like their
organization and make a living out of
that and that to me would be a success
right because it means that we're
getting the ball rolling in an ongoing
way in the country there's another form
of innovation that happens that our
innovation lab helps with which is
designing tools that are not just
helpful in the problems that you know
about up front but also tools that will
help with problems that you haven't yet
seen geo chat as simple as it sounds
with like it's just chat with some
feature extractions and like alerts I
mean what's a big deal well to then the
big deal is that they're used to having
all these special purpose vertical
applications where somebody says oh you
could attract mile area now here's a
malaria applique
you have to use a malaria database to
tracking the malaria number and then
send the malaria thing to the malaria
report and then they get this other
application saying tuberculosis patients
get trapped name age sex here oh wait
they have HIV you have also to put them
in this other database name age sex
there it's a mishmash of technology and
one of the clinics we had we say like
how many patients do you see well we see
like I don't know like 30 40 every day
except fridays why that oh because its
forms Friday we just spend on Friday
filling out the forms that our donors
and our systems required just typing
things from paper into a computer and we
try to design our systems in a way that
the users can define the use cases up
front right geo chat doesn't tell you
you should report malaria or you should
deport dang it's not like dengue chat
whatever we let the users come up with
that and design their own protocols and
prioritize on their own unfortunately
that sounds logical and almost obvious
to you but it's not the way people have
been exposed to technology a lot of
low-income countries if somebody came
and told you or what you should use
email for well sometimes I guess it
could be helpful but uh I know at least
a couple of people who could use that
but um there's a there's a lot of local
innovation you just use the tool you
figure it out and they're figuring it
out on their own using these mobile
applications and here's an example of
the translated slide that shows the sort
of protocols that they invent on their
own to report things if I try to
systematize this do the h1 in one
suspect case application it would be a
lot of effort it would be special case
it would not withstand winds of time
probably after two months it would be
unused and just by creating a platform
with little add-on apps we allow users
to define these sort of things and then
just use the tools and adapt the apps
that's necessary or not they're just
like see the messages they need in their
conversations yet another way that we
help the local innovation is supporting
events that do the whole network right
we talked about our partners such as
change fusion that are locally built
systems for these 700 hospitals in
Thailand there's a whole network of
organizations that are participating and
wanting to
participate in this we've helped sponsor
the first barcamp in Cambodia the first
barcamp in Myanmar and we're doing the
first bar Kevin Laue pretty soon so if
you want to come to the NTM you're
welcome towards the end of the year and
you know what bar cams are right and as
an open event that helps people bring
together and share peer-to-peer centers
of skills and knowledge you actually
accelerate innovation it's also great
hiring grounds when we were looking for
people you know whoever steps up to the
plate just speaks at a bar camp probably
has some of the right materials to work
with us I want to branch embark MP and
gone specifically because it was the
largest one in the history of the planet
we only had six people from abroad there
we had facilitated the organization but
organization was done by locals and the
night before numbers of attendance had
skyrocketed between like 300 to like
three thousands on the online
registration tool we actually thought it
might be used for some sort of
demonstration at one point in time we
got quite worried Myanmar is a very
closed sort of country the government is
a really controls a lot of the
communications bloggers were asked not
to congregate for a bloggers association
meeting but we were able to do bar can
by working with organizations that had a
relationship with the government that
we're able to get the message through
that is this is great for the local
economy like internal business exchange
and things like that and 3,000 attendees
came through the previous largest
barcamp was 1,000 attendees in China no
sorry in India and three thousand people
showed up at barcamp up 3,000 people is
massive and it just speaks of what is
the hunger for innovation and data
sharing that exists in this area these
are just some of the organizers to give
you an idea and you can't see them but
they're all very happy under da another
example of user-led innovation is um we
had all these community village people
exchanging messages about diseases peer
to peer through geo chat as I explained
before when ketsana came through a kiss
Anna was a large tropical storm that
came through a manila
entire land basically flooding the place
is drawing houses very high winds it
just started sweeping for a lot of
villages causing a lot of destruction
and floods and as an example of user
innovation they started using geo chat
as a way to do peer to peer support and
messaging and alerting what was going on
not in like that there's a storm coming
from because they don't have access
maybe to like the big sort of forecasts
but they were with their local knowledge
able to send alerts such as this river
is flooding right no sensor is looking
at the river trust me this river is
flooding watch out tell people to move
away from it tell people not to stand
down wind outside their houses because
the house will collapse on them and
we're having a lot of injuries happen
that way or stuff that flows off the
roof or from under the basement and just
hits them and this peer-to-peer support
network was something that we didn't
foresee we knew that you know having
people interconnected in a reliable way
would help these sort of trust networks
form but actually seeing it in action
was really transformative and again a
voice that if you empower people with
the right tools they have plenty of need
for these sort of communications and
finally our innovation lab in Cambodia
is a multidisciplinary team we have
program managers who are working with
the accounts and are working with a
government and with NGOs that do like
them landmine picking up and that they
do you know like to work alone Superman
intend this is a picture of our library
and you might not read them so I'm just
going to tell you the sort of books that
you'll find side by side you have ending
hunger you have smart mobs you have
directory of Cambodian NGOs and you have
the pragmatic programmers write books
all of all of those in the same library
and that tells you kind of what sort of
plays the lab is we have ending hunger
next to the pragmatic programmer tells
you something about this sort of work
that is going on and the sort of
cross-disciplinary thinking that has to
happen every day where people are
challenging each other's ideas we call
ourselves a social technical team
because we don't know how to describe it
we're not about technology worried about
applied use and we're not just about
sociology and the policy of disease
surveillance we're
but changing the numbers and making an
impact so we haven't found a better way
to describe it than that so essentially
this is some of our work this is a
little bit about how we work and what we
do and i invite you to help us in ways
that you think are appropriate and want
to help what you don't see very well is
this is a picture of some buddhist monks
who wanted to help us so they came to
our innovation lab and they blessed the
generator they said we know the
generator is important to you for your
work so we will bless it because we want
you to keep doing this sort of work and
that tells you you know you can help
from your strengths I can tell you
Google technologies are helping a lot
you know in all the sort of work I've
shown you before things like Google
prediction API those things are awesome
they're going to the same thing that's a
lot of work as soon as we get the key
approved but um basically they're going
to save us a lot of work that otherwise
we would have to start cranking on our
own or finding people in the
universities who can like contribute
that in an open source and cheaper way
simple things like the Google widgets
you know the little charts API is those
things can help my lab in Cambodia gate
give great interactive applications with
just you know some HTTP calls and those
kind of productivity boots are really
helpful and of course everything with
Google Earth and the geospatial work
that you're doing is also critical for
this sort of work and that that's still
sort of building blocks like the
prediction API the widgets really allow
our teams to focus on the unique
problems that are found at the edge and
I think it works great as a as a
partnership so if you want to learn more
about like crisis response we have some
things here examples of the equipment is
one of the satellite me again terminals
whoops they're kind of expensive after
them hf radio satellite phones and we
can talk about how to you can work on
hacking your own community and its
safety processes locally or if you want
to learn more about international stuff
later on and how you can help from what
you do in your team already so finally I
wanted to thank Google the Lord for
their so
it's been very hard work these last
years in a very intense way but it's
been I think a great very innovative
initiative and in the upcoming years
we're really excited about how to see
these platforms that we've deployed and
are being used by the thousands really
snapping all those local innovation
opportunities and all that creation that
can happen in the other countries in a
way that really hasn't happened in
public health before and in Africa
another way areas as well as a Southeast
Asia so here's my contact info Twitter
etc if you want to talk and I think we
have some time for questions so if we
can do that just one or two that's great
ok so maybe one or two questions sure
obviously fabulous work here one number
that's stuck out in my head though you
said a million SMS messages in Haiti hmm
tell me about billing and well what
makes all the stuff go because you know
people in the one guy who's trying to
shave a couple characters off his
message well billing uh the way it works
really is about partnerships with the
private sector it's about partnership
with the phone companies in Haiti
obviously the phone companies knew that
they were going to be part of the
critical national infrastructure they
were working twenty-four/seven they had
lost staff they have lost facilities and
antennas and they're really working
nonstop to get that cell system up we
were talking with the CEOs and the
owners and the product managers of
digital and voila who are the largest
organizations getting direct VPN
connections into their data centers
talking smpp directly into their servers
working with their team every day that
would be like we have to turn the server
off because we have to move the data
center because we have a problem with a
generator and the data okay we're off
for one hour starting now okay up now
real-time collaboration across countries
and that sort of collaboration at the
technical level and at the commercial
level is critical in Cambodia we have a
short code that is available nationally
for geo chat user that is free to send
and free
for users to send things in and free for
alerts to go out now I tell you there's
a free short code you can use to build
any sort of social application in
Cambodia right now in Lao pretty soon
actually it's working but we haven't
announced it in Thailand it's working
and in Vietnam pretty soon and China the
Chinese interesting so that's the
national government is it's a mixture of
the national government and the phone
company is really sometimes coming in
through the GSMA sometimes coming in
through connections to the owners or
through the parent companies ministries
of Health do not have much power in low
income countries phone companies are
more powerful so you have to know how to
talk to them and actually we have a mix
of experience if instead including
working in the private sector for many
years so we can get to our negotiating
table and talk you know how can you help
support I don't Cambodia health and you
know support your business at the same
time this is sort of when when we can
help design and we've done it yeah any
other questions
all right oh you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
