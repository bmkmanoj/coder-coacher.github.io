innovative and controversial biologist
author of over 75 technical papers and
books very interesting I must say most
recently the sense of being stared at he
studied at Cambridge and his director of
the parrot Warwick project they're
funded by Trinity College and he's going
to speak about some research he's doing
on that project about extraordinary or
unexplained abilities of humans and
animals so there's going to be a
45-minute talk followed by 15 minutes
for questions and answers
let's welcome Rupert Sheldrake Oh Joe
sides have gone on to them sorry
just a moment
okay
thank you I'm talking about the extended
mind the mind beyond the brain and I get
to start with a few reflections on the
nature of consciousness we don't know
how consciousness works or what it does
this is one of the things which in
science is sometimes called the hard
problem because there's no known obvious
reason why we should be conscious at all
or exactly how the mind works and
consciousness studies is one of the most
exciting frontier areas of science today
what I'm going to suggest is that our
minds are filled like that they're not
confined to the inside of the head they
spread out into the environment around
us and because our minds are extended
beyond our brains they can can have
effects at a distance which are
surprising from the conventional point
of view and help to make sense of a
range of controversial phenomena like
telepathy so the first point is that the
question of where is the mind located
I'm suggesting that minds of field like
and spread out beyond brains in a
similar way to the way that magnetic
fields spread out beyond magnets cell
phone fields spread out beyond cell
phones and the Earth's gravitational
field stretches out far beyond the earth
these fields are within and around the
material systems they organize and I
think the same is true of our brains the
place where this becomes easiest to
understand is in terms of vision and the
question of how vision works most people
think they know how vision works and
science has told us a great deal about
it and what we know is that when you see
me standing here now for example light
is reflected from me goes through the
electromagnetic field in inverted images
appear on your retinas changes happen in
the cone cells and then impulses travel
up the
optic nerves and various bits of your
brain become active that's what happens
during physical physical the physical
side of perception there are two
problems here first of all there's no
explanation in this as to why you should
be conscious at all that's simply not
explained by describing what happens in
the nervous system and the second
problem is that according to the
standard view all this is supposed to be
happening inside your brain if the mind
is nothing but the brain which is the
usual assumption within the academic and
medical worlds mental activity is
nothing but brain activity everything
you're seeing is inside your head
somehow miraculously in an unexplained
way changes in your nervous cells lead
to a kind of virtual reality display
inside your head by which you see what's
going on in the world so right now for
example somewhere inside your head
there's a little virtual Ruppert it's
somewhere in your brain and you think
it's right out here where as I'm
standing here talking if you look at the
sky the sky you're seeing is an image of
the sky inside your head so your skull
must be beyond the sky a recent paper in
a leading consciousness journal was
called is your skull beyond the sky
because if the sky you see is inside
your head the skull must be beyond the
sky the answer of the author was yes my
answer would be no in fact I suggest the
very common-sense view a cut a view
that's so simple it's hard to grasp that
when you're seeing something the image
you're seeing is where it seems to be
your image of me is located not inside
your head but right here it's in your
mind produced by your mind but it's not
in your brain is projected out and I'm
suggesting our whole visual experience
of the world's projected out to where it
seems to be our minds are projecting out
all that we see so visions are two-way
process light coming in the outward
projection of images this I suggest
happens through what I call a perceptual
field which is a kind of morphic field
another category of field that is part
of a theory I've developed which I don't
have time to explain today
but it's a field phenomenon and in in a
sense your mind reaches out to touch
what you're looking at the image your of
what you're seeing is superimposed on
what's really there sometimes it's not
as in a mirror reflection when you have
a virtual image or in an illusion or a
hallucination but usually it is so what
I'm suggesting is that you can by
looking at things your mind touches them
there's a sense in which you might be
able to affect things just by looking at
them is this true can you affect
anything by looking at it think of
another person can you affect another
person by looking at them of course if
they see you looking at them we all know
you can but what if you're looking at
them from behind through a car window
for example no son those smell they
can't see you're there they don't know
you're there can you affect them just by
looking at them well most people think
that that does happen 90% of the
population have had the experience of
feeling that sometimes when they're
being looked at from behind they turn
around someone's looking at them surveys
show that more women than men have had
that experience it's still a very large
majority more men and women had the
experience of looking at others and
making them turn around but most men and
women have had both these experiences
and I guess most people in this room
have experienced these things personally
so the sense of being stared out to
well-known phenomenon found all over the
world children know about it adults know
about it but it's not part of the
standard scientific map you won't find
any reference to it in psychology
textbooks there's virtually no research
literature on this until about 15 years
ago and it's extraordinarily under
researched in spite of the fact it's
very well known the standard scientific
education that most of us receive makes
us think well that this must be some
kind of illusion so probably most people
in this room have been trained to
dismiss the phenomenon by saying oh it's
just a coincidence you turn around all
the time if no one's looking at you
forget about it if they are you think
the Sun mysterious sense involved but
it's really nothing but either
coincidence or peripheral vision or
something like that
that's the standard way of explaining it
away but now many experiments have been
done to test whether this is real and
the simplest experiment involves people
working in pairs one sits with a
blindfold with their back to another the
other person either looks or doesn't
look at them in a randomized sequence
and in each trial the person has to
guess if they're being looked at or not
hundreds of thousands of these trials
have been done the overall results show
positive significantly a very
significant effect when things are
repeated over hundreds of thousands of
trials with many independent
replications they become very
significant even though as in this case
the effect is fairly small these results
these experiments have also been done in
Amsterdam in the Science Museum in one
of the largest experiments ever
conducted for more than 20 years this
experiments been running more than
20,000 participants have taken part the
results are again overwhelmingly
positive and significant rather
surprisingly this phenomenon also occurs
through closed-circuit television
various experiments have been done
whereby people's skin conductance is
measured with electrodes on their
fingers this measures emotional arousal
and it turns out that there's a
significant change in people's emotional
arousal when they're being looked at
through closed circuit television by
someone on a monitor in a different room
this works been replicated as well at
one of the people who's done it Marilyn
Schlitz is right here in the Bay Area
indeed she's right here in this room and
so there's an abstention body of work
showing that people can tell when
they're being looked at even through
closed-circuit television this is
something which has become of great
interest to the security agencies and I
can't divulge exactly who or well but I
can tell you that the security forces
are very interested in this question
could a potential terrorist for example
tell when they're being watched through
closed-circuit television the answer to
that is probably yes if they've trained
their sensitivity a bit this phenomenon
is well known to security guards
security guards are well aware that if
people are looked at from behind they
can tell when they're being looked at
private detectives know that when
they're shadowing people when they're
following them they shouldn't stare at
their back because the person's likely
to turn around
and catch their eye and blow their cover
people in the martial arts know about
this and there are martial arts methods
for training your sensitivity to feeling
people's intentions or looks from behind
and in the closed-circuit television
industry which now involves millions of
CCTV cameras engaged in surveillance
work many operatives know that you can
affect people by looking at them I gave
a talk about this in Washington DC last
year and one of the guys in the audience
told me afterwards that he was in fact a
security guard and when he was trained
by an FBI trainer they told him if you
see someone doing something they
shouldn't do just stare at them hard on
the screen and they'll probably stop it
and I said to him does that work and he
said sure
I don't see almost every day he said we
all know this stuff he was amazed that
this is a controversial issue within the
academic scientific world because in
people in the security industry take
this for granted in the British special
services the SAS when people are being
trained how to stab others in the back
they're trained that you don't stare at
the person's back before you stab them
because they're likely to feel it turn
around and shoot you so these things are
completely taken for granted yet there
are a huge scientific anomaly it
shouldn't happen if the minds all in the
brain but if our visual activity
involves the outward projection of
images and even the kind of resonant
projection when you see some your
computer screen it's not a direct effect
in that case just seeing the image can
affect the person something else is
going on
I think our minds are in fact extended
beyond our brains in every act of
attention and perception this is not a
new view it's a view put forward by
Plato and other Greek philosophers it's
the view of perception in most Hindu and
Buddhist philosophies it's the view
taken for granted by traditional people
all over the world and it's the view
taken for granted by Western children
under the age of 10 or 11
studies on children's intellectual
development shows that most children
assume that vision involves this outward
projection that's why Superman comics
and things show rays coming out of the
eyes of superheroes it's a very popular
childlike way of seeing or understanding
Piaget the developmental psychologist
who studied children's intellectual
development said that by the age of
about 10 or 11 the average child learns
the correct view which is that thoughts
and images are invisible things located
inside the head we've all been brought
up with the correct view in spite of the
fact there's actually no evidence for it
no one's ever seen a thought or an image
inside a head and our own experience of
seeing things Outsiders directly
contradicts this theory so we bought
into a theory that's totally at variance
with our most immediate experience and
I'm suggesting our minds reach out
beyond our brains and the sense of being
stared at is one aspect of this animals
feel it too many animals can tell when
they're being looked at there's a lot of
evidence for this from wildlife
photographers and hunters and many
people say that they can feel when
animals are looking at them Jim Corbett
who was a famous well Tiger shooter in
during the British Raj in India author
of books like man-eaters of Kumaran said
that his life had been saved on many
occasions by feeling the look of at
Hidden tiger the hair on the back of his
neck stood up as he felt this Tigers
presence and escaped I think that this
isn't just something that happens
between people and animals and people
and people I think it happens between
animals and other animals and it may
well have evolved in a predator-prey
situation if prey animals could tell
when predators were looking at them
they'd tend to escape better and the
natural history of this is virtually
uninvestigated because it's been a taboo
area not really on the scientific map
until quite recently
anyway as I say this is an area where
this research going on actively at
present and it's one of the ways in
which our minds seem to be
extended beyond our brains and have
effects which ought not to occur within
the standard view of things but which do
seem to occur and which most people have
actually experienced themselves and this
is one of the phenomena that I call a
mystery of everyday life it's something
almost everybody even every child knows
about but most scientists have been
trained not to think about it or to
dismiss it because it doesn't fit the
paradigm or the model if we move to this
extended mind model it makes good sense
there's another way in which the
extended mind idea makes better sense of
our experience than the idea that it's
all in the brain and that's to do with
the way that social animals are
coordinated with each other all social
animals have to work together by
definition in a harmonious way for the
society to hold together this is shown
most graphically in the case of flocks
of birds here you see a flock of
starlings the flock can fly together
they can turn immensely quickly without
bumping into each other here are some
other pictures of flocks of birds of
starlings and the astonishing maneuvers
that they make some of you will be
familiar with animation computer
animations of bird flocks like Craig
Reynolds classic Boyd's model from the
80s which seemed to show you can just
explain it by nearest-neighbor
sensations actually you can't
those novel and those models are
biologically naive they assume that
birds look at their nearest neighbour
process the information adjust their
flight and change direction that takes a
lot of time nervous systems work slowly
compared with computers and the birds
are reacting too fast for that to happen
the best computer models of field models
that treat the whole flock as a field
phenomenon and I think they are indeed
field phenomena that members of social
groups are linked through social fields
or morphic fields of the social group
the same applies of course to schools of
fish like this one and especially when
predators attack they can scatter in
different directions very rapidly
without
bumping into each other the whole group
seems to move as a unit as a kind of
field and the individuals move in
response to the field which is both
produced by the individuals and acts
back upon them it's more than the sum of
the parts
acting it's a kind of emergent field
phenomenon I think all social animals
have such fields joining them together
even when they move apart a pack of
wolves for example has a morphic field
of the group when some of them go away
like a dart wolves go hunting to fetch
food for the young that are left in the
den the field isn't broken it stretches
and I think they remain connected at a
distance through this stretched field
change a change in one can affect the
other through this field that connects
them that I think is the basis of
telepathy I think it's a normal means of
communication among separated members of
animal groups or even non separated
members I don't like it's paranormal
anchors normal I don't think it's
supernatural I think it's natural and I
think it's essentially a form of animal
communication within groups another way
of thinking about this is through
quantum entanglement and Dean Radin who
gave a talk here at Google some time ago
a few months ago has written a book
called entangled Minds suggesting that
when people have close social
relationships and interactions their
minds become entangled so that when they
separate that there's still an
entanglement between them so a change in
one can is reflected by a change in
another quantum nonlocality entanglement
of quantum particles is well well-known
well and been well documented and it's
in fact the basis of now technological
applications in quantum cryptography and
quantum computing and what that shows is
that particles that are part of the same
system when they move apart change in
one is immediately associated with the
change in the other this is independent
of distance unlike many other physical
phenomena it's it doesn't matter if it's
an inch apart or a mile apart its
distance independent entanglement or
non-local connection I'm suggesting
something like that happens in the case
of animal groups
and in social groups in general
including human groups and because I
think it's basically an animal
phenomenon that we share in because
we're animals rather than some kind of
spiritual phenomenon that only humans
have my first Studies on telepathy and
where it with animals and I started with
the animals we know best like cats and
dogs and other animals that people live
with and get to know very well and which
form bonds with their human companions
the first stage in this research was
Natural History every science begins
with Natural History and no one had ever
done this so I collected lots and lots
of stories about people about their pets
what did they see in their pets behavior
that suggested something might be going
on beyond normal sensory information I
soon collected thousands of these
stories that I classified in a whole
series of different categories on a
computer database the fact that people
report these phenomena doesn't prove
they're right about their reports but
for me the plural of anecdote is data
and when you have hundreds of reports of
the same kind of phenomenon from all
over the world at least it shows lots of
people are observing or think they're
observing the same kind of thing and
that then has to be investigated further
for example on our database we have
hundreds of reports from cat owners
saying their cat seems to read their
mind and know when they're planning to
take it to the vet the cat disappears
and after it's happened a few times
people try to avoid giving the cat any
clues they don't let it see the carrying
basket they try not to think of the word
vet some people even ring the vet from
work so the cat doesn't overhear the
conversation and then they swing by home
on the way back from work to pick it up
and it's still not there
so many of these stories that we did a
survey of all the veterinary clinics in
the Northland and yellow pages
65 of them rang them out and said do you
ever have a problem with people missing
appointments with cats 64 out of 65 said
yes it happens all the time and the
remaining ones said it happened so often
we've given up the appointment system
for cats people just have to turn up
with them
and the with dogs and cats another very
common phenomenon is the animals knowing
when their owners are coming home a lot
of dogs and cats wait at a door or
window when the owners on the way home
even if they come at non routine times
even if they come by public transport
even if they're in friend's car and even
if the people at home don't know when
they're coming many many of these
stories about 800 of these stories with
dogs on our database about 500 with cats
also stories about lambs that are raised
by hand on milk that do it a few rabbits
and guinea pigs and ferrets that do it
parrots parakeets budgerigar
that do it a range of animals do this
but all of them are mammals and birds I
haven't come across any cases of return
anticipating reptiles I've tried hard to
find such cases and including launching
Appeals for information in journals like
reptilian international and I haven't
come across any convincing cases of
snakes
monitor lizards or fish like goldfish or
insects like stick insects seeming to
feel this it only seems to happen with
mammals and birds that form close bonds
with their owners well is this just an
illusion when I discussed it with one of
my skeptical colleagues in Cambridge
Nicholas Humphrey who's a psychologist
to my surprise he didn't deny the
phenomenon in fact he said well my dog
used to do that my mother always knew
when I was coming home the dog would go
to the door I said but surely the dog
couldn't have heard your car from the
other side of Cambridge from many miles
away against all the traffic that's
there irrespective of the wind direction
and he said Oh on the contrary it just
shows what sharp hearing they've got and
because he and I differ in many respects
in our opinions yet we share a belief in
science and scientific method this led
to the idea for an experiment and the
experiment is the person goes at least
five miles from home the place where the
dog waits is filmed continuously on time
coded videotape the person comes home at
a randomly chosen time communicated by a
pager they don't know that
advance the people at home if any don't
know when they're coming and to avoid
familiar car sounds they travel by
unfamiliar vehicles like taxis well I've
done hundreds of those kinds of
experiments with dogs and the results
are pretty clear-cut the dogs go and
start waiting over and over again when
the person's coming home in fact in them
with the most sensitive dogs when they
form the intention to come home before
they've even got into the taxi this
research has been written up it's
published in journals you can see the
full reports on my website and it's now
being replicated by an online open
source science project where people are
putting up pictures of their dogs
waiting at the door on YouTube so you
can actually see ongoing experiments of
this kind the this slide shows a survey
of dogs and cats that do this a random
household survey done in two locations
in Britain and two in California you'll
see that about 50% of dogs are reported
by their owners to anticipate the
arrival of a member of the family an
average of about 30% of cats for some
reason the Californian cats do it more
than British cats we haven't worked out
why but even in Los Angeles where the
most impressive animals seem to live
cats do it less than dogs and that
doesn't necessarily prove cats are less
sensitive than dogs it may just prove
that some of them are less interested in
these experiments with dogs that know in
their owners are coming home we've done
lots of these experience you can read
the details online if you want if you
want to but basically that what these
graphs show is the number of seconds the
dog stays at the window and these are 10
minute intervals after the person leaves
home you see the dog does sometimes go
to the window when they're not coming
home like here and here and when you see
the videos in most of these cases
they're going to look at things going on
outside to bark at passing cats and so
on they're obviously not waiting but
we've included all the data so there's
no bias and introduced by any subject
to judgment what you see is the ten
minutes of the first ten minutes of the
homeward journey they're there and there
the dogs are at the window most and
they're there also before the person
actually gets in the car and the car
starts moving that's because people form
the intention to go home before the car
actually moves you have to think about
it before you get in the car
and but the highest amount of time at
the window is when they're on the way
home these data where of course
challenged by skeptics as you know
anything to do with telepathy is
immensely controversial there are
vigilante organizations that have been
set up to try and discredit research of
this kind there are active groups of
highly motivated skeptics they vastly
outnumber researchers in this field the
total number of subscribers to skeptical
magazines in the u.s. is about a hundred
thousand the total number of full-time
researchers in parapsychology is about
five so there are numbered about twenty
thousand to one by well organized groups
of skeptics and so of course and rightly
so
this work was criticized by skeptics one
of them Richard Wiseman a British media
skeptic and psychologist said that I
must have made mistakes in the result
faulty randomization the wrong kind of
vehicle to bring people home so I
invited him to do his own experiments
with these with one of the same dogs the
same dog I worked with here and these
are the results of the three experiments
he did in the same location as you see
it's an almost perfect Oh almost perfect
replication that most time the dog was
that the window was on in the first ten
minutes of the homeward journey and
showed exactly the same kind of pattern
at first he argued these refuted my
results because the dog went to the
window before the owner set off and the
rest of the data could therefore be
discarded but in fact most people don't
think that's a valid approach I
certainly don't
he himself now admits that this is in
fact a replication of the effect he
doesn't agree with my interpretation
but his his own results clearly
replicated the same pattern as my own
not only animals but people commonly
show telepathic behavior or
sensitivities these things have widely
believed in our society the great
majority of people in America Britain
Germany South America India in fact all
over the world think they've had
telepathic experiences skeptics
dismissed this by saying well these are
just uneducated people prone to illusion
and it's all just a delusion in their
minds of false interpretation of what's
happened to them inadequate
understanding of chance and statistics
and so forth you're all familiar with
those arguments but starting as a
biologist I wanted to look at the things
where this happens most commonly and
most biologically one case in the human
realm is with mothers and babies many
mothers claim that they can feel when
their baby needs them a lot of nursing
mothers have what's called the milk
letdown reflex that for the benefit of
the men here which is the majority is a
reflex that occurs with nursing mothers
normally when they hear the baby cry
there's a release of oxytocin from the
brain that causes the breast to prepare
to feed the baby this special changes
occur in the breasts the nipples start
leaking many women experience a tingling
sensation some women experienced that
when they're away from their baby they
may be shopping in a supermarket and
suddenly their milk that's done they
feel their breasts tingle most women
when that happens assume that the baby
needs them they used to just go home
nowadays they call home on a cell phone
they're often right not always but very
often and I've done detailed Studies on
breastfeeding mothers in London that
show that the odds against this
happening by chance at the time the baby
really does need them where the odds are
about a billion to one against chance in
the study I did so I think there's
something really going on there and this
is a very good area to study telepathy
it's very biological it's easy to see
why natural selection might have favored
this ability a mother who
knows when her absent baby needs her is
more likely to have a baby that survives
than a mother that doesn't know and so I
think that natural selection favors
these abilities they have an
evolutionary reason for being there
they're not just sort of curiosities on
the very fringes of parapsychology
they're central aspects of life and
until the invention of modern
telecommunications the only way that a
mother could know her baby needed her
immediately
when she was where far away from it was
through telepathy it's the only way
people or animals could communicate it
at a distance until the invention of
Telegraph's and telephones
well telephones are in fact one of the
ways in which telepathy emerges most
strongly in the modern world it's
evolved along with technology and right
now it's on the increase because people
use telephonic communications so much
surveys show that the great majority of
people have had experiences of what I
call telephone telepathy you think of
somebody for no apparent reason and then
that person calls and they say that's
funny I was just thinking about you
surveys in a variety of countries have
shown that more women than men claim
this experience about 95 or 96 percent
of women about 72 percent of men there
are some national differences in men the
most sensitive men in our survey were in
Argentina the least sensitive in Britain
the with other kinds of telepathy the
figures are still way above the 50% mark
there are majority of people but much
less common than telephone telepathy so
what's going on here
it's very common I imagine most people
in this room have experienced it is this
just an illusion what are the skeptics
say well what the skeptics say and what
most people in this room have probably
been trained to say and probably heard
said very often is oh well it's just a
coincidence you think of people all the
time one of them rings and then you
think oh it must have been telepathy but
you forget the millions of times you
were wrong a reasonable hypothesis
chance coincidence and selective memory
but where's the data in science it's not
enough to put forward an armchair
hypothesis you need data skeptics have
been advancing that argument for a
hundred years since the invention of the
telephone and there was not one shred of
data to suit to support it and nothing
in science deserves a free ride and you
need evidence anyway I've developed a
test to try and find out what's really
going on is it just coincidence or not
for that you need statistical
experiments and how I've been doing
these tests is as follows
imagine you're somebody who has this
experience and you volunteer to be a
subject in one of these experiments you
give me the names of four people you
might be telepathic with typically
people you're closely related to family
members girlfriends boyfriends close
colleagues people you know well you give
me their numbers and their names you set
at home you're videotaped continuously
while you sit by a landline telephone
with no caller ID system we then pick
one of your four callers at random using
a randomizing device call them up and
ask them to phone you they found you the
phone rings before you pick it up you
guess who it is I think it's John you
pick it up hi John you're right or
you're wrong
it's an objective fact it's on film and
your chance by getting it right by just
guessing is 25% one in four well in
these experiments the chance rate the
25% chance rate is there and the actual
hit rate 45% is what we found and this
was with hundreds of tests and the
probability figure for this is 1 times
10 to the minus 12 in other words this
is way beyond what you'd expect by
chance this is a highly significant
statistically significant result it's
not just chance whatever it is it's not
just chance we then did these tests with
we're two of the four callers were
strangers that people had never met but
whose names they knew the other two were
people they knew well and here we found
with young with the unfamiliar callers
the
the success rate was pretty well at the
chance level just above with the unn
with the familiar callers it was way
above chance in this case 52% so these
telephone telepathy tests are a new way
of testing for telepathy they've given
highly significant positive results
there's no effective distance in
accordance with other research on
telepathy we did some of our experience
with young Australians and New
Zealanders who'd recently arrived in
London whose nearest and dearest were at
the Antipodes the other side of the
world their hit rates were actually
higher with people in Australia in New
Zealand than with new acquaintances in
England showing that what matters is
emotional proximity rather than physical
proximity and this has now been
replicated in a number of plates studies
at Cape Town University at Amsterdam
University by dick BIM and his
colleagues and recently at Freiburg
University in Germany and it was also
done as a replication for a TV show in
Britain under controlled conditions with
the Nolen sisters who were an eighties
girl band and that's now available on
YouTube tube you can actually see
there's a five minute clip showing that
experiment you can get to it through my
website www.jfn.co.jp/toho we've done
very similar experiments with emails for
emailers random choice of who's going to
email you people have to guess just
before they get the email who's sending
it we have fixed times for this
experiment you know you'll get an email
at say 4 o'clock so at 3:59 you have to
send me an email with your guess then
the person sends their email at 4
o'clock and with a CC to me from the
emails themselves we know to the exact
second when the guess was sent and when
the actual email was sent and so we can
show that the guesses are made before
the email has been sent
it's built into the technology we've
done there's also with people being
filmed for security reasons to make sure
they're not cheating by means of mobile
phones regular phones MSN Messenger or
anything like that and the results of
the email experiments show a similar
effect the chance level of 25% the film
tests 47% is the hit rate and again we
get a higher hit rate with the familiar
than the unfamiliar callers we also
found no effect of distance in these
email to Leppa theists well these tests
lend themselves to automation and I've
recently been in the last couple of
years developing a whole set of
automated online tests for telepathy and
some of them are automated email tests
the whole of this can be done online we
register online you put in the names of
your email as the computer selects an
email or at random ask them to send you
an email by sending them an email so the
whole thing's done by email and all the
results are recorded in an online
database
I've also have a similar experiment
working with text message tests on on
mobile telephones and there's both the
email than the automated text message
tests are giving significant positive
results these are being done by anyone
who wants to do them it's completely
open science I don't know that some of
those people couldn't have been cheating
perhaps they were there's not much
incentive I think to cheat because most
people are trying to find out how
telepathic they are and there's no point
doing it if you're cheating but some of
them could have been the only way to
deal with the cheating thing is for
anyone to do it themselves if you do it
you'll know if you you're cheating or
not you could do it with a group of
friends who you trust and see what the
group results come up with these can be
set as classroom experiments in colleges
and schools and some instructors are
already doing this and when you register
for the test you put in a group name
and people could then recover all the
results from that group name online on
the online database so in some
universities instructors have set these
as homework assignments as in a study in
scientific methodology it triggers off a
very lively debate among students it
gives results generally positive which
bring in debates about the nature of
statistics and also a debate about could
some people have been cheating and if so
who there's the only way you can really
guard against cheating is either by
trusting people which you won't trust me
if you're a skeptic or anyone else but
you can trust yourself and your friends
hopefully or by having two experiments
done under oppressively
rigorous conditions where people are
strip searched search for hidden mobile
phone devices implanted telephonic tooth
implants and spy type equipment skeptics
will go to any length to say that people
must have been cheating and actually
there's there's only a limited number of
precautions you can take against it in
practical terms so that's why by having
these experiments wide open for anyone
to do at least you can organize your own
group do your own tests and this area
this area of research can now be
participate riu don't have to take my
word for it or anyone elses word these
are all published in peer-reviewed
journals you can read the text online on
my website but you can do it yourself as
well the latest experiment which has
only just become technically possible
which is now being programmed in England
and should be ready soon as a automated
straight telephone telepathy test where
you register online if you're picked to
make the phone call you get a text
message or an email telling you to call
your friend you call a landline number
which is say a dedicated landline number
you get a message welcoming you to the
test you give your group number so it
knows who you are who the people are
involved in the test and then it rings
the subject and says there's one of your
callers waiting on the phone to talk to
you who is it
press one for gym press two
you for Susan press 3 for Bill you make
your guess and as soon as you made your
guess the line opens up you get to talk
to them these experiments I think have
the potential for being very popular
participate ori experiments i've been
talking to people in the mobile
telephone industry and some of them are
interested in developing intuition tests
programmed into the phone these won't be
experiments but ways of training your
intuition instead of a caller ID when
the call comes in there'll be a simple
program easy to do which says who's
calling you know and then quick key you
can have a quick key thing you press one
for for Jane two for Jill three for Bill
etc if you don't know who's calling
you're in a hurry you just answer it you
pass but if you do make a guess that'll
keep a record and you'll see how many
you've got right you can see if you're
getting better with time if you're
training your intuition and this way we
could find more talented subjects for
our more rigorous experiments I have a
variety of online experiments proceeding
right now another one is a photo
telepathy test and what that involves is
you two people do this test one of you
when you register you upload a photo of
one of the people there's a series of
twenty ten second trials and in each
trial the subject just sits there it
says trial one begins in the ten seconds
pass the other person either sees your
photo or they see a photo of something
completely different at the end of ten
seconds it a box comes up was your
partner looking at your photo yes/no you
click and you can have feedback or not
as you choose at the beginning of the
test the data are all stored online it's
a fun experiment to do and I'd like any
feedback you have about how best to
spread these kinds of experiments but
several people have suggested this would
work very well on Facebook or other
social networking sites because the
problem I have is to get people to go to
their computers at the same time as
other people to do experiments most
people are too busy it's hard to arrange
in facebook they're all on
you've got people online anyway waiting
to interact and here's a way they can
interact in a way that's fun to do and
can you tell if someone else is looking
at your photo the results so far suggest
that people can positive significant
results I also have a joint attention
test designed to answer the question
when you're looking at the same thing as
somebody else do your minds come into a
kind of resonance can you tell when
someone else is looking at the same
thing as you
in that test as twenty trials each trial
has two pictures by chance you're
looking at the same one or different one
in each trial and after ten seconds each
of you has to guess was your partner
looking at the same picture that again
is giving positive above chance results
if joint attention works so there's a
kind of resonance you can actually feel
when one other person's looking at it
what about real television what about so
50 million people watching Obama's
acceptance speech at the Democratic
convention now that's a bad example for
doing an experiment because everyone
knew it was happening but with regular
TV if you went into a room the two rooms
adjacent to booths each have TV running
one of them showing live TV that's
actually playing right now to millions
of people the other one showing a TiVo
door recorded a program that was
broadcast hours or days ago that
probably no one else but you is watching
at this moment can people tell the
difference interesting experiment huge
relevance to modern media which involve
millions of people having their
attention focused on the same thing at
the same time no one knows the answer
because that experiment has not yet been
done but I mention it because some of
these experiments are immensely relevant
to modern media many of them are very
cheap to do many of them very simple to
do many of them work through interactive
websites and I think this is an area of
research which can not only involve a
lot of people but can also involve a
kind of public debate about the results
the results can be the the programming
can be transparent all my tests anyone
who wants to can see the coding study
the randomization system and so forth
and in Britain I've recently been doing
a project with one of our leading
takes a very intelligent and reasonable
skeptic not some a dogmatic
ideologically motivated and and I think
go way beyond any limits of science and
reason in bigotry and Prejudice but we
have one in Britain the editor of the
British skeptic magazine professor Chris
French who's a friend of mine and he's
been running some of my tests himself
while I've been here on the west coast
over the last month or two and when I
get back I'm going to find out just what
he found so far looking online the
results he's got a coming out positive
and in in line with the kinds of tests
I've been doing myself but this is
something we're open-minded skeptics and
proponents can cooperate on research
where the results can be easily
obtainable and where there can be
research going on way beyond the narrow
limits of academic laboratories with
papers just in peer-reviewed journals
that no one reads anyway to participate
research which can engage large numbers
of people so that's more or less the
state of the art and a few other people
are engaged in this kind of thing there
are a number of researchers in
parapsychology and psychology doing this
kind of research one or two other people
are doing online tests notably Dean
Radin who spoke here at Google recently
better I'll just end by saying that the
idea of the extended mind the mind
beyond the brain a mind that stretches
out through fields gives us a way of
extending the frontiers of science we're
not leaving behind science and reason
and descending into a kind of black mud
of superstition as Freud called it we're
extending the realm of science to
phenomena which are widely known about
which most people are really interested
in and which may well have a perfectly
good scientific explanation but which
haven't been part of the rather narrow a
kind of science that we're used to so I
think that this is important because it
makes science more relevant not less it
expands science and it makes sounds more
interesting to more people so I think
this is a good thing I think that some
people think it's a bad thing but anyway
that's my opinion and I'd be interested
to take any questions or comments that
you may have yeah
ever able to introduce noise the system
NORs so you had two colors of wine bush
that was being called and one of the
lines were cuts and the command law
didn't know whether the lines of patent
this so both people have the intention
of calling bill in one person is
actually making through yes have you
performed that experiment so does that
affect your results a good question I
mean could we actually interrupt these
experiments randomly I haven't tried
doing that it could be done the trouble
is in the interests of full disclosure
when you get people to take part in
experiments you have to tell them what
they're going to do you know it's part
most committees ethics committees
require you to disclose the experiment
so be hard to have random interruptions
of tests without telling people in
advance that this might happen in which
case you might change their intention
they might think well maybe nobody's
really going to be answering the phone
so I think it could interfere with it
but I think it's an interesting
interesting point yes ever since Dean
came here earlier this year I've been
telling a lot of people about SCI and
basically the conversation usually ends
as soon as the person I'm speaking with
thinks of James Randi and they kind of
put up a James Randi shield where they
won't let anything get past
yes it's wondering what your response to
that is well for the benefit of those
who don't know about him there's a
Sandra called James Randi who often
appears on TV and he's a very anti he's
one of these ideologically motivated
skeptics who believes psy as impossible
and he's offered a million dollar prize
or says he has it's there's a lot of
questions to whether he actually has the
million dollars or where it is for any
successful test of psy and people often
say why don't you apply for the Randi
prize well it's a very good question and
I can tell you my answer first of all
this man is not a scientist
he has very he's no scientific
credentials or understanding in it on
his website it says the prize must be
won for people who produce an
unequivocal unequivocal demonstration of
cyber
it requires no expert analysis that
seems to rule out any statistical
experiments then he's later said oh well
I will accept statistical experience but
the odds against chance have got to be a
million to one to get million-dollar
prize so if the odds against chance of
nine hundred thousand to one you fail
the test
third you sign over to Randy all
publicity rights you have all legal
waivers so he has complete control of
all publicity arising from this and
fourth and most important for me he's a
liar
I he said he's a deceiver by profession
and he's a deceiver by Nature and my
reason for saying this without being
sued for libel is that he wrote an
article in a magazine about my dog
research called dog world probably very
few of you read dog world but lots of
people do and in this he said that we at
the James Randi Educational Foundation
of repeated Sheldrake's experiments they
fail then he said we've also examined
all his videotape from his experiments
and showing the dog goes to the window
all the time and it's not as he says it
is an unequivocal statement I emailed
him asking him to tell me give me the
details of the experiments he'd done
what journal were they published in
where's the data reasonable questions
that a scientist would ask he didn't
reply I emailed again he didn't reply so
I emailed his scientific advisory board
and they advised him to reply so he then
replied and he said well actually these
experiments were done many years ago
when I looked after a friend's dogs for
a couple of weeks in New York and I lost
all the data they were lost in a flood
so I've got no data and they've never
been written up so what kind of evidence
is that if I produce evidence for say
and say why did them years ago I've lost
all the data but just believe me he
wouldn't go for that I'm sure
and then the examination of the
videotapes he had to admit he'd never
seen the videotapes he'd simply made
that up
now the man with such a low degree of
honesty I don't think he should be an
arbiter of scientific credibility or
truth I do believe however that real
skeptics people with proper skeptic
scientific training and and who have
track record of honesty rather than
dishonesty are worth engaging with and
that's why I'm doing joint experiments
with Professor Chris French right now
thank you for a great talk is an open
line my did the skeptic
so you said you mentioned your fondness
for the scientific method but there's a
very key but subtle difference between a
scientific study and statistical study a
scientific study has to include a
falsifiable theory of how this works do
you think that that's an unnecessary
assumption in science should expand
beyond it or do you think that these
experiments actually do have some sort
of a theory it's a good point and and
first of all I don't think that all
science requires a theory no one knew
till recently how aspirin worked
no one knew till recently and they
probably still don't know how super high
temperature superconductivity worked
those lots and Newton didn't know how
gravity worked
we still don't I mean its base is
supposed to happen on the basis of
gravitational particles gravitons that
no one's ever detected so lots of
phenomena can be recognized as phenomena
without a theory however I do have a
theory I didn't go into the theory today
because I was mostly talking about the
phenomena I have a theory of morphic
fields and morphic resonance which I put
forward in my first two books a new
science of life in the presence of the
past and when I did that people said
okay you've got this theory where's the
evidence
now I concentrate on evidence people say
ok here's the evidence where's the
theory well there is a theory and I
think the theory of morphic fields of
social groups for example make some
predictions telepathy should occur
between people you know well much more
than people who don't for example it
should be independent of distance it
makes a number of predictions which
these experiments test and so far
support and so I and then there are
other theories that some people have
quantum theories of telepathy you know
quantum entanglement theories those make
certain predictions too which are being
tested so there's not just one theory
there are several several so I think
this is a truly valid field of science
it's based on experiments
theories predictions tests I think it
meets all the criteria far better
actually than many orthodox areas of
science like super string theory which
makes no testable predictions or
multi-universe theories in cosmology
which postulate quadrillions of
unobserved universes for which there's
not a shred of evidence you can say that
kind of thing it hold down prestigious
chairs in leading universities so no one
has to be aware of double standards
about this kind of thing Thanks actually
I'm not surprised at all my mom always
tells me that if she thought about me
when I was calling and she lives in
Europe yes but I have actually different
question do you think that art and the
media and our television and movies in
fact exist to create this entanglement
of society and is shared intuitions so
it's in a sense not very surprising
because we are using these products over
arts and all these communications media
very interesting point and you know the
the joint attention which I was talking
about is the basis of these minds when
you're all seeing the same thing in
child development by the age of about
one normal children develop what's
called joint attention and that's why
you see parents and their babies look
reading books together walking long
streets here they see a dog naked doggy
and everyone say you know it's just
looking at the same thing pointing
seeing things is part of normal
development people who don't do that are
often autistic so part of our normal
human consciousness throughout human
history is involved the ability to form
this kind of mental resonance with other
people consciousness is a shared
phenomenon in many ways now in
traditional societies you know a
storyteller would have the attention of
a whole group sitting around a fire for
example so that's again an old
phenomenon but what modern media have
done is extended this to an
unprecedented level through link-ups
TV link-ups like the Oscars or the
Olympic Games where literally billions
of people are seeing the same thing at
the same time and I think this takes
something that's a normal human
phenomenon to a totally new level and I
think it does play a part in social
cohesion
the way our societies work but it's
extraordinarily uninvestigated and
nobody's ever done an experiment to find
out whether people can tell whether
they're seeing the same thing as
millions of others or not at the same
time and as I say I think these
experiments can easily be done given the
media that we now have let me just do an
opportunity to mention another
experiment that may interest people here
because this is people knowing about
computers I set up a joint attention
sound experiment on the internet but my
coding the programmer hasn't yet got it
to work but how that works is you have
samples of ten clips and Clips five of
them are real radio stations that both
broadcast in real time and on the
internet so you've got sons their musics
being listened to by millions of people
some of the ones we use for example or
talking some word Chinese talk shows
from Shanghai and and we then have
another five clips which are recordings
of similar radio stations recorded days
weeks hours before and after listening
to each clip you have to guess
was this a recording or was it live so
that's another form this can be done
using internet technologies as I say I
haven't got it to work yet because we
had unbuffed we had buffering problems
and time lags these were entirely
technical problems we haven't solved but
this kind of thing is perfectly doable
thank so much well thank you for your
talk and I have a quick question if you
start with the premise that the mind
extends beyond the body through space
then I think there's a very little
stretch to imagine that it also it can
extend through time and I was wondering
if for instance for your phone
experiment you've run such an experiment
where for instance you would have the
subject tried to predict who's gonna
call before a random number generator
would select the person will will
actually place the call yes I've done
that I have a precognitive version of my
text message test and also of the email
test where we changed the programming so
that we ask people to say who's going to
email you shortly or who's going to send
you a text message they send back their
guess and the second guests received by
computer does the randomization and gets
the person to do
those results have been coming out at
chance levels so far we haven't done
very many of them fewer than we've done
in the telepathy mode but that it can be
done with this kind of online program to
experiment you can just flip the program
to a precognitive or telepathic so you
haven't received any it's not in that
case ative results no not in those cases
but i think that the evidence for what
dean radin calls presentiment feeling a
few seconds in advance about a getting
of kind of pre echo of an emotional
arousal the evidence for that is very
strong and so i think there are ways in
which there are future influences of a
rather mysterious kind that can
influences and of course the minds
extend in time in the past which is what
memory is all about so memory and
collective memory I have a theory of
collective memory called morphic
resonance this is another major part of
my research that I haven't talked about
at all this afternoon but I think the
minds are extended in space and in time
they're extended in time even through
our intentions every intention we have a
future intention like and where I'm
going after I've been here which train
I'm going to catch on but all these
things are future intentions where I'm
going tomorrow our minds stretch into
the future all the time through our
intentions we're connected to the past
through our memories and I think that
some of these depend on things that
science doesn't at present have on its
map of reality but our minds I would say
in short are extended in space and time
they're not just I in our brains now
thank you
I have a couple possible questions here
first one is I had a lot of trouble with
your vision analogy and I wondered is
that just an analogy or do you actually
mean that to be another manifestation of
your theories of morphic fields and them
the women vision being projected out yes
it's not just an L the word projection
is a kind of analogy or metaphor but the
idea that our vision is extended I think
that my image of you is where you are
now I don't think it's in my brain and
no I really think that's that's not just
an analogy and it's not just as I say
it's not just my theory if you take a
sort of majority vote of people and
theories through the ages it would be
the kind of 99% of humanity's theory of
vision the theory it's all in the brain
dates back to Kepler and Descartes in
the 17th century and and has never
really been terribly successful because
it they in consciousness studies one of
the really big debates as how does
visual perception work is there a
virtual reality display inside the head
if so where is it how does it work and
if it's virtual why should it be stopped
by the skull rather than go through it
how do you account for you know if you
cut the optic nerve a person's going to
go blind or if you damage a part of the
brain they're going to go blind or if
you damage another part of the brain
they're going to yes lose a lot of
capacity now that's certainly true I'm
saying it's a set light comes in changes
happen the brain projection goes out so
cut any part of that circuit and it's
not going to work you know it's like the
TV set to take a somewhat different
analogy the picture you see on your TV
depends on the electric supply on the
transistors the condensers the wiring
but also on a transmission coming from
outside the the I think the brain is
actually more like a TV set and receiver
and interact with influences coming if
you cut the wire pull the plug out cut a
few wires on the TV set the screen will
go blank but that doesn't prove it's all
inside the TV set okay one other quick
questions will earn this would seem to
be enormous ly useful for survival how
come we aren't a lot better at it than
we seem to be for spying what surviving
you say other survival sure it's it's a
very it is an interesting question you
see if you look at the use of these
abilities in traditional societies I
used to live in India and I worked there
and in India most people took these
things for granted in Africa they take
them for granted and they use them in a
way that is helping and surviving people
go to people who are desperately ill and
when they need them not because they got
a phone call because they just feel
those mothers go to their babies in our
society first of all we've got
technology that works really well
probably better than telepathy you know
telephones emails and so forth in here
and secondly we live in a society where
educated people have been brought out to
disbelieve in these things we've all
been taught if not explicitly at least
implicitly
it's a kind of illusion only stupid
people believe this kind of thing if
you're smart you've got to be a skeptic
and if you're a skeptic you know it's
just sort of faulty statistics is that
we're kind of D evolving ourselves in
this regard though well despite all
attempts to suppress it in our society
is actually coming up more and more
through modern technologies telephone
telepathy as I say as the communist kind
and until telephones were invented I
think probably there was less of it
around I think more people are
experiencing telepathy today than they
did a couple of generations ago because
so many people have phones and even
cellphones so it's a constant presence
in their lives thank you hi um so I just
had a question about um it seems like
there's a couple of different kinds of
social fields I mean at the beginning of
the talk you showed these pictures of
flocks of birds and yes fish and they
had a very kind of specific geometry to
them yes and then towards the end of the
talk you were talking about people
interacting and you were saying how
these experiments don't seem to depend
much or the results don't depend much on
the distance that separates them hmm
so I just wonder if we're seeing the
effects of two different kinds of fields
or is it just the same kind of field and
it's I don't I don't really know that's
a very that the question is it's an
important one because the flocks and and
the schools of fish depend on position
and exactly its coordinating positions
of movement and I think that's a kind of
social field primarily concerned with
the coordination of movement where we
experience that is when we're walking
along the street it's surprising how
rarely you bump into people and in
countries like India it's amazing when
you see the chaos of the traffic system
how the whole thing just keeps flowing
and people weave between each other it's
the same with traffic systems here which
are a bit more regulated I think this is
something we almost take for granted but
it's actually rather amazing how rarely
we bump into people or things and and
people can flow through each other and
so on so I think that's one of the
aspects of social fields which should do
with movement coordination there's
another kind which work at a distance
which are more to do with calls and if
one kind of telepathy is do with calls
you're in need you desperately need help
you can sort of as it were and someone
can pick it up and come to you that is
the kind which I think has now evolved
along co-evolved with telephones and
emails and things because they are
actually calls not necessarily always
with a high emotional need or content
but sometimes so I think yes that it
it's not just one kind of field that
does all these think they're all their
versions of the social field but
carrying out different functions one
movement coordination and that's
something which in termite nests ants
nests and bees hives when they're
building structures together you get
cooperative architectural activities
that kind of field which coordinates
movement in a special way that must be
very important but the core ones are
almost by definition to do with relating
to absent members of the group and
trying to bring them back so it's a kind
of extension of that field but it's not
exactly the same
so I find the the idea of entangled
Minds very interesting and possible but
what I don't see how the minds would
manage to meet I feel it intuitively it
must be possible for two minds to meet
each other in a sense without meeting
physically or seeing each other or
having any connection in a physical
sense do you have any ideas on how this
might happen
I think Minds get entangled through
interactions our minds meet through
interactions and these don't have to be
through physical meetings they can be
through emails through you know social
networking sites through telephone and
so forth but it's interesting isn't it
that despite our incredible connectivity
today the airlines are still full of
business passengers flying around the
world to meetings and you would think
that Airlines would have gone out of
business if minds could interact just
through international communication
systems there seems to be something more
about the interactions occurs in person
when there's a bodily presence and
that's of course much more a natural
form of interaction your whole body
interacts through implicit and
understanding of social body language
movements gestures etc etc so I think in
personal meetings there's a far more
intense and and varied level of
interaction than in just conversations
where it's only the voices that are
interacting or in emails where it's just
the written words that are interacting
but of course you can interact in that
way and people do build up quite close
connections or relationships at a
distance and those that would that
interaction would be enough I think to
set up a field where you could still get
telepathic connections in those contexts
but the vast majority of telepathy is it
occurs in the ordinary world is between
parents and children best friends lovers
husbands and wives close colleagues and
so forth and I haven't actually studied
in the context of social networking
where you may have people who become
very close friends or closely linked
without ever having met physically it
would be interesting to find out how
telepathic they are
and back I really like your TV analogy
so if you cut a wire inside a TV it
stops working if you cut the optic nerve
this person stops seeing if the TV
station stops sending the field to the
TV the TV doesn't work what get in the
hole
huh what fills in the hole so what what
has to break for the person with a
perfectly functional brain to stop
seeing well I don't quite got your point
yet so if there's really an analogy
between yes field that the TV is
receiving getting something that some
sort of a field that the brain is
receiving in order to be able to project
an image yes or to see to have a vision
then so the physical analogy I
understand breaking something physical
it's a TV and breaking something
physical inside the brain both break the
vision but brick it's easy to break the
electromagnetic field and see the TV at
work how can this field that humans
human brains have can break well there's
several ways that happen first of all
when we go to sleep
it all goes blank so it depends on our
state of consciousness and much of the
time hours a day we're not seeing
anything when we are asleep if we dream
then we have an interesting situation
where this kind of projective activity
of the brain and end of our minds can go
on when we're not actually seeing what
we're seeing in the dream and those are
more like hallucinatory images some
people when they take loose energetic
substances and close their eyes would
see all sorts of things that aren't
really there and interestingly people
subject to extreme sensory deprivation
kept in darkness for weeks like in some
Tibetan meditation practices often
experience very vivid hallucinations
there's also ways in which our
attentions extremely selective and we
see what we want to see and we don't
notice lots of other things so there's
something that attention itself can lead
to attentional blindness or what
psychologists called inattentional
blindness things that you're not paying
attention to you're blind to even though
they're there and affecting your field
of vision
that might be morally equivalent to the
sort of hole in the mind as well there's
a famous video lots of people have seen
where people are playing a ball game and
someone in a gorilla suit walks through
the room and you tell people to count
how many times they bounce the ball and
most people count and tell you and they
never see this guy and they say look
again do you see anyone in a gorilla
suit and people can't believe that they
haven't seen this it's a very clear
demonstration of this form of
inattentional blindness and you think
this cannot be explained by physical
processes in the brain well it can be
explained by attention or inattention
and but then you see we come back to the
question of the nature of consciousness
itself what controls attention and how
does attention work then we come to the
the vexed question of how does
consciousness work what does the web see
how does the mind work and in the world
of consciousness studies the scientific
field in which these things are started
there's no general agreement on what
attention is how the mind works what the
mind is what its relation to the brain
is this is really truly I think one of
the most exciting frontier areas of
science where there's a variety of
different theories there's no consensus
view there is a consensus view on what
happens in the brain you can measure it
but how that relates to the mind to
attention and so forth that's a realm of
wild speculation at the moment with
vying schools of thought and it's a
paradox really that the thing we know
least about is our own minds and their
relationship to our bodies and it's
partly because science has ignored this
until about twenty years ago
consciousness was virtually ignored by
most scientists even psychologists and
then in the 20th century behaviorism was
the dominant School of Psychology in
American and British universities and
that said forget consciousness all we're
going to do is measure objective
behavior movements of muscles secretions
of glands things you can measure that's
objective the rest is subjective and is
no part of science but now we recognize
subjectivity consciousness is part of
science we need to think about it
scientifically but it's a field of
science that's quite new and we're in a
way we're on a new frontier here thanks
I I came towards the second half of your
talk later in the talk so this question
might have already been answered you the
most of the experiments seemed to be
proving or finding out whether certain
phenomena exist or not has there been
any experiments conducted which find out
the environment that is conducive to
produce such effects like yes I mean in
among people who work in parapsychology
there have been a number of experiments
that look at variables affecting the
results generally speaking people do
better if they're feeling relaxed and
and not under stress the telepathy tests
work better with people you know well
them with strangers so there are a
variety of things that affect how people
respond in these tests also some people
do better than others and there's a long
line of research in parapsychology
called the sheep goat studies that show
the kinds of results you get depend on
what you believe skeptics sometimes get
less successful results than people who
believe they're possible sometimes
indeed skeptics get significant negative
results showing that there's something
in the sort of they're somehow getting
it but giving the opposite answer as it
were so a variety of factors personal
social and environmental affect these
results this is a field of research in
which relatively little has been done I
mean the people who are doing this work
in the US about 50% of the research
effort is in this room with Dean Radin
and Marilyn Schlitz and you know this is
not a field where there's hundreds or
thousands of people working was very
very few in India I don't know of anyone
there was one Narasimha Rao here in
Andhra University who did this research
but like in India there's probably one
retired person doing it in England's
about ten or fifteen people in
universities but this is a there's a
huge amount of research could be done in
these areas that hasn't been done
because not because it's difficult not
even because it's very
pensive but because the taboo has held
back this field of research
hopefully it's breaking down though and
I think we'll see that there's a great
deal we could find out that would be of
great interest to a lot of people thank
you being a street-smart that that hard
to define scale I have found that many
entrepreneurs they're the reasons why
they get ahead is because they know to
whom to trust which employees to hire to
which customers to extend more credit
and is any way to identify that skill
and it's any way to teach it good
question
the I think that the word that most
people would use for these abilities the
general word would be intuition and
intuition is a blanket term that covers
a variety of these abilities able to
feel premonitions pick up subtle cues
all sorts of things are involved in
intuition and I think it's also very
likely as you say that people who do
well in business are people who use
intuitive skills because business people
are always in fact all of us are working
in an atmosphere of uncertainty where
you can't be sure in science there's an
attempt to try and pin things down and
make them more certain but scientists
have to be intuitive too because they
have to hire people and know who to
trust just like everyone else does and
also have intuitions about what kind of
research is worth doing what kind of
experiments are worth trusting there are
people who claim to train intuition
there are lots of people give workshops
on training your intuition whether they
work or not I don't know I'd like them
to put their participants through some
of my telepathy test before the workshop
and afters and we could then quantify at
whether people are at least getting
better at these kinds of tests but at
the moment there's a disconnection
between people who do scientific tests
in this area and people who claim to be
able to train intuition in the
it's not quite clear know how well
they're doing it or how successful they
are I think they probably can train it I
think these are things that we can try
there's no reason in principle why we
shouldn't be able to train our intuition
in these areas just as we can train our
physical skills and things like playing
the piano or train our taste buds and
noses and getting to know about wine and
that kind of thing everything in
principle should be trainable so if the
effect is so strong in a sense from all
the expense conducted then why after a
long term of scientific skepticism and
still is is now the data becoming
available well it's a partly a question
of you know who sees the data you know
the data are there there's quite a lot
of data a Dean Radin summarized in his
books very well I think the the
conscious universe and his recent book
entangled Minds a very good review of
this scientific experimental data it
doesn't get out there very much and this
is partly a sociological question it's
to do with the taboo for example I've
submitted several of my papers to lead
my work on the dogs for example I
submitted that to animal behavior which
is the leading journal on animal
behavior this is animal behavior and I
got a letter back from the editor saying
I'm rejecting your paper immediately
without refereeing because no referee
for this journal would take seriously
any paper that claimed that so-called
telepathy was in it actually existed
I've just had another paper react
rejected on those grounds the
replication of my telephone telepathy
paper was rejected by perception
magazine and the editor there said any
experiment that shows positive results
for telepathy must be flawed so he was
rejecting it without refereeing and when
the author of the paper wrote to the
editor saying well surely you remember
that Galileo had a problem the Cardinals
who refused to look through the
telescope aren't you afraid you might be
a bit like the Cardinals the guy wrote
back said that's the risk
I'm prepared to take at least he was
honest so there is a very strong
prejudice and I've anyone who works in
this field encounters it media reports
in serious media like the New York Times
Scientific American are dominated by a
skeptical point of view and if any
positive report is there they
immediately we learn a media skeptic
like Michael Shermer to say it's all
rubbish they get the last word so there
is it's a sociological phenomenon I
would say the data is there and I think
that it it's a taboo that mainly affects
educated people who've had a scientific
background because they feel they'll
lose credibility my own view is that the
way things would change is not through
piling up more data but by the
equivalent of the gay liberation
movement within science I gave a talk at
a unit in Cambridge where there were six
staff members who attended my seminar I
was talking about my work with dogs
and afterwards each one of the six came
up to me and said you know I'm really
interested in this stuff I think it
happens I've seen it with my own dog you
know but I can't talk about it here
because everyone in this department so
straight and when all six including the
professor had said the same thing to me
I said some you know why don't you guys
come out you'd have so much more fun if
you could actually talk freely and I
think science would be so much more fun
if people talk freely in every
scientific Institute there are people
who've had these experiences who have
dogs that know when they're coming home
from the lab and that kind of thing but
the social taboo means they don't feel
they can talk about it and I think if we
let go of that though I'm not saying
correct blind belief is what we need we
certainly don't we need rational
scientific discussion but that's
inhibited by prejudice and taboo and it
facilitated by free conversation well
there have been other scientific
theories which have been not well
received but you know the scientific
community was eventually made to see the
light why is this different I asked
myself that question why is it that this
field has so much taboo around it when
others don't
for example the astronomer royal in
written president of the Royal Society
master of Trinity College Cambridge Lord
Rhys member of the House of Lords
believes in multiple universes he holds
down the highest positions you can
possibly have in British scientific life
he hasn't a shred of evidence for them
yet that's acceptable where telepathy is
not why I think the reason is that in
the Enlightenment at the end of the 17th
century 18th century the movement of the
Enlightenment was a movement to liberate
humanity from religion and superstition
in favour of science and reason that was
the social movement and I think at that
time things like telepathy and what we
call what are called paranormal
phenomena were classified as
superstition and since then there's been
a sociological phenomenon where smart
people are defined as smart by not
believing these things which is why
newspapers with a demographic of
university graduates like the New York
Times can't write about them
whereas ones that we're with readers
with no intellectual potentials their
pretensions like the National Enquirer
feel completely free to write about
these things in an exaggerated and
totally unreliable form and that of
course reinforces the social taboo and
so a self-reinforcing sociological
pattern and I think it's so strong
because it was embedded in among
educated people somewhere around 1800
you know whether there was a reaction
against mesmerism and that kind of thing
and I think it's really embedded in the
intellectual world ever since and it's
become a deep-seated habit of thought
that's my own view so what then is a
morphic field if it's not saying the
electromagnetic field or gravitational
field at all what is it and morphing how
do we actually measure it directly we
can't measure any field directly we
measure them through their effects we
measure electrical fields through
electrical effects gravitational fields
through the measure X through an
instrument rather than having to have a
human sort of part of the equation say
on the receiving end at least well on
ascending in art other way this you
measure these well you measure them
through their appropriate effects
there's no reason to suppose a morphic
field might be measurable by an
electrical instrument if it interacts
with a
chuckle activity in a way that's
measurable by that instrument it might
do it might not is an open question for
me but the first thing to do is to
measure them by their actual biological
effects just as you measure gravity
through gravitational effects like the
swinging of pendulums and things you
don't measure gravity with an electric
meter you measure it with gravitational
things like gravitational devices
pendulums and whatnot
so you're trying to characterize these
fields you know things like in a gravity
universe d squared Lord electromagnet
yes is where I am I've left out the
husband library yes I mean I've spent 10
years developing this theory written two
books on it etc of how these fields work
and what they are and it's not really
fair on this audience that I haven't
actually gone into the theory there's a
lot more name than I said but that's
partly because it was all meant to take
own you know 45 minutes for the talk and
15 for the questions we're actually 23
under let's say over time but those were
those were my instructions yes the very
very briefly morphic fields organize
self-organizing systems they have a kind
of built-in memory they work by
patterning in determinate systems that
would otherwise not have a pattern they
impose restrictions on other words why
otherwise chaotic or indeterminate
systems there is lots of things you can
say about the fields and ways in which
you can test for them but I can't at
5:26 p.m. tell you what they are right
now sure and I think there's people
behind me there's a summary on my
website of the morphic field theory
which you might like to look at yeah um
I'm intrigued by this notion of
skepticism of telepathy because there's
so much acceptance of other things like
homeopathy
homeopathy and all the things that are
skewered in the bad science column in
the garden midweek so how come they get
up they get more play than they should
and people will take you know scientific
 from mapa the vendors but but
they won't accept physical results from
you
I think a lot of I mean it depends who
I'm talking to you I give seminars and
giving one in a couple of months time at
Chris French's department at Goldsmiths
College London which is he's the main
professor of skepticism in Britain he's
professor of anomalous psychology and
this this is the one of the main
academic hotbeds of skepticism I give
talks there people listen
there we have reasonable discussions and
they know about the results and very few
of the people there exhibit this kind of
prejudice skepticism that I encounter
all too often a kind of ignorant bigoted
type of skepticism I think one of the
reasons that there's so much of that is
that people are really skeptical have
such a strong belief that they should
they know in advance the evidence must
be wrong you say if you believe it's
impossible then if I come in on say
here's results that show it's possible
either it proves I'm a fool I've done
the experiments so badly or
incompetently I've got false positive
results and haven't been smart enough to
see it or I'm a fraud I'm trying to
deceive you in the world and so the
instant reaction is one of hostility and
accusing people of being fools or frauds
um Richard Dawkins who's a very smart
man and is in this area not very smart
at all he's a very bigoted skeptic and
he came to interview me for his most
recent TV series in Britain he had one
against religion a two-part polemic
called the root of all evil
and his most recent series was called
enemies of Reason it was about research
in parapsychology and alternative
medicine they didn't tell me it was
called enemies of reason beforehand and
they asked me to take part but I've had
enough experience of these negative
media treatments and I'd seen his
previous series that I was very
suspicious and I said I only agreed to
take part if it's a genuine scientific
discussion about evidence and if he's
really open to discussing the evidence
otherwise there's no point and they gave
me a written and I said I wants in
writing they gave me a written assurance
that this was the case so I agreed to
meet him and he came to see me and he's
we started off there was a handheld
camera they put us facing each other
and he started off by saying he said I
dare say we agree about quite a number
of things Rupert she said but let me
tell you what worries me about you and I
said okay what worries me about me and
he said what worries me about yours
you're prepared to believe almost
anything and Sun should be based on the
minimum number of beliefs so I said well
okay well let me tell you what worries
me about you I said you come across as
prejudiced and bigoted and I think you
give science a bad name so we didn't get
much very far with that conversation so
then he said the trouble with telepathy
is that people are his owner then he
said extraordinary claims require
extraordinary proof it's a standard
sceptical slogan so I said well what's
the extraordinary claim I said the
majority of say normal people in Britain
believe they've had telepathic
experiences in that sense it's not
extraordinary its ordinary most people
have had it you're making the claim that
most people are deluded about their own
experience where's your extraordinary
evidence for that and he couldn't
produce any at all you know just at all
people have a very false sense of
statistics and probability and stuff
generic arguments then I said well look
okay why don't we get down to the
evidence and actually discuss the
evidence which is why we've met he said
I don't want to talk about the evidence
and I said well why not he said there
isn't time I said well we've got plenty
of time he said it's too complicated I
said no it isn't he said anyway it's not
what this program is about and so I said
well I he didn't know I'd sent him my
papers three or four papers two weeks
before so you could look at them
he hadn't looked at them and he was just
trying to trap me into saying something
silly and then put that on TV
right so I said I'm okay well then then
there's been a misunderstanding because
I said I didn't want to take part in yet
another low grade debunking program he
said it's not a low grade debunking
program it's a high grade debunking prep
so then the producer said cut and the
cameras stopped rolling it and so then I
said to the the the director is this a
debunking program or not he said yes
it's another Richard Dawkins polemic and
I said then you're here under false
pretenses because you told me it was
about evidence said I didn't as well
your assistant did he said can you prove
it I said yes and I produced the email
with this and I said I'm afraid there's
been a serious misunderstanding he said
well I'm afraid I have to agree with you
that she should never have told you that
that's not what it's about it's a
blemish and I said well I'm going to
have to ask you to leave my house and I
didn't sign a release I wouldn't
actually mind if all that was put on the
TV but I've written up an account of
this it's on my website it's been
published in several British journals
called it does if you want to read the
details it's on a count called Richard
Dawkins comes to call but that that's an
example you see of someone with a huge
media presence an enormous intellectual
prestige because a lot of people think
he's an incredibly smart guy who speaks
for science in this area whatever his
virtues as a geneticist he doesn't know
anything about it he's speaking from
prejudice and ignorance and and that's a
very bad thing to do if you are as he is
professor of public understanding of
science it doesn't further a public
understanding of science and that I'm
afraid is why the debate on this is not
often based on evidence and very often
based on prejudice stereotypes and
ignorance so the other thing that
strikes me is that here at Google we run
hundreds of thousands possibly millions
of experiments every day which are based
on perceptions because we do present our
testing on results and so on yeah like
recently we changed the color of the
results from one shade of blue to
another because we found empirically
that people preferred that yes um
so I'm wondering if your theories and
models of this could be potentially
tainting our results because once we've
shown is 1 percent of people that will
that will change how the rest of them
behave
is there something we can measure in
that well you could set up morphic
resonance type experiments which
that one that one kind of experiment is
which should be actually being done
where you have some new kind of puzzle
you get people to solve it and then you
see if other people who haven't seen it
can solve it more easily after one not
have done it a version of it this is
morphic resonance the memory theory I
didn't talk about today oh yeah I think
it could possibly influence your results
actually I mean a form in which I'd like
to test it was thought out by my son
when he was taking the national school
exams age 16 in England we have a
National exam called GCSE General
Certificate of Secondary Education as
you know and he came to me one day and
said I and my friends have thought of a
way of getting higher marks without
doing extra work and I said that sounds
good how's that going to happen he said
by morphic resonance and I said well how
will that work he said well in the
physics and maths papers we're going to
do questions 15 and 16 first then go
back to question 1 2 3 etc will be 10
minutes behind everyone else in Britain
and we are to boost by morphic resonance
from their answers and because all the
exams are done simultaneously of course
to avoid cheating so I said well that's
a really clever idea and I said but some
of your friends must be morphic
resonance skeptics and he said yes they
are and and and I said what did they say
they said what if morphic resonance
doesn't exist and he said we discussed
it we came to inclusion if it doesn't
exist we wouldn't lose any marks but it
does we'd gain them say we're all going
to do it they all did it they all got a
stars but they were probably smart in
the first place to think of that but
that provides a perfect example of a
test you see and I tried to persuade the
head of science exams in the Austin
Cambridge examination board an old
classmate of mine to turn our entire
National Education exam system into a
test where have several several of the
questions in a different order so you
could see if and they'd be randomly
assigned to thousands tens of thousands
of candidates to see whether people who
did questions after others were getting
higher scores he thought it was a really
good idea for a few days then he called
me and said when I'm going to be
retiring soon and I want to have a full
pension and
yeah I just don't think I can run this
test and so anyway in Google you
probably could and it would be that
certain kinds of tests like that would
be influenced by what other people have
done I don't know how it would relate to
what you do Google would be a wonderful
arena for this kind of research
well these test harnesses that run
continuously - did try on Adwords and
yeah start saying yeah yes I can't I
mean I don't know enough about how
things work here to suggest simple easy
to do low-cost experiments that could be
done using existing Google technologies
but I'm sure they could be done BAM yeah
so now we've reached a 5:35 is there a
cut-off Heiser core I mean I'm happy to
go on a few more minutes but perhaps we
should draw think yes one more question
yes have there been any experiments with
people with non special abilities like
being able to guess things are not
special abilities or non special
abilities own own special bit
I haven't myself worked with people with
known special abilities because I prefer
to work with ordinary people because I'm
interested in what I call the mysteries
of everyday life you know the things
that ordinary people know about if you
work with people who are professional
psychics then the skeptics are
particularly active they say oh they're
cheating they've learned how to cheat
because they're constantly cheating
people out of money and stuff and it's
very hard to get beyond that kind of
argument when you're treating dealing
with say Sai Baba materializing vibhuti
or something like that and it's very
hard to hard to replicate - because
really people with special abilities
don't particularly want to be treated as
frauds and tested repeatedly by
aggressive and hostile skeptics and so I
prefer to work with ordinary people
testing ordinary abilities but that
doesn't mean to say that it wouldn't be
interesting to test people who do have
extraordinary abilities or who are
unusually sensitive and the intuition
tests on mobile phones that I was
talking about earlier if people did
these intuition tests a lot of people
would be able to identify themselves as
being unusually a good
telephone telepathy and they would there
be very good people to test in a more
rigorous way so hopefully that kind of
test could allow people to identify
their own abilities and indeed improve
them by training and experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
