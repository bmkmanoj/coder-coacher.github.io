second regular talk we move away from
specification but to nevertheless
incredibly challenging problem that of
layered wax Michael is going to present
it yeah welcome to my talk fighting
layout paths first slide Who am I system
architect evil I'm active webdriver
kombucha and regularly our conference
speaker I haven't written a book yet but
who would serve algae in the test would
shriek write a book okay maybe not such
a good comparison but he also some tools
i like to use with kind of IntelliJ IDEA
and close or key to find packs just to
get a little picture of me so here's a
jenna i would like to present you sweet
techniques to fighting layout bugs i
guess the most interesting the
interesting technique and the main part
of the torque is a last one detecting
typical layout box using image
processing and javascript but first
things first first technique named
continuous HTML validation the idea is
to prevent layout bugs but i always
delivering let it HTML pictures hmm that
idea is ever seen but new but but i'm
curious who has integrated HTML
validation and it's at a regular basis
and its development process Wow four for
four people this order would be a little
bit more okay so how do we do it the
first thing I that came to my mind is
maybe you already know there are some
krauser extensions which do hi HTML
validation mmm but those only working
one krauser they don't validate pages
automatically you always have to click
some buttons to figure the validation
Evan might argue well that's okay most
pochama's only mainly work as one
krauser can do this but just one killer
argument against pulse extensions is the
cause I extension can't make the boot
fail if there's inverted HTML and that's
what we want don't be so another idea
might be and to scan quiet during the
boot process so so that you get
something like compiler errors but turns
out doesn't do the idea for HTML
validation because most also HTML is in
some kind of justify its tech files some
kind of templates or even an j bar code
so it's there isn't a chip steady HT my
efforts anymore but there's a lot of
presentation logic around it so well
guess it's very hard problem to scan for
valid HTML files templates so this is
not a good idea so the baby's only good
ideas to validate HTML to me upfront and
chest yeah I suppose you have some kind
of continuous integration server they
run your test suite I hope some of you
guys already have one and chest which I
run on the confusing equation discover
so why not start with a very simple
separate test they'll visit some
well-known pictures start with your
homepage and then I guess you know which
pages are specially on your website and
need some attention and just crepes are
HTML and center to very data and see if
you have a valid HTML I mean is it good
to have it HTML by the way if you don't
have valid HTML the powers I must guess
about what you really wanted to have for
Dom tree and if it guesses wrong or if
you just forget a closing tag so Dom
tree is not what you expect when you
fight your CSS and so you'll CSS
selectors don't match anymore and so I'm
going to get layout works but another
option would be
if you have this code which validates
HTML why have a separate front and chest
if you already have a test speed of
syrup on a chest then just check every
time you get a page if it's valid HTML
and of course it shouldn't really went
severe there are are already tools which
validate HTML tidy or movies a w3c
market validation service this is a
service you can download and install and
that's also a publicly available server
from the WCC can volley validate by
putting in ul to your website or by
uploading an HTML file or by direct
input and yeah some sample HTML with a
missing closing tag and T are some
options and if you guys check get these
wet bar and also here small red icon if
I can and if you scroll down you get a
each warning or error which is tected to
get a good description wise as well
though right useful and it's maintained
yeah it's always improved and it comes
from WCC though I guess we should be
using is for validation but I suppose
wasn't satisfied this is approached
cause I wanted to feel faster than less
confusing creation boot machine detects
a test convert HTML I wanted to let it
was detected on the developer mission
when he is developing HTML or templates
or whatever so I came up with another
solution and with a simple servlet
filter how does it work first the plus +
point is it works on all browsers of
course cost eps on the server side and
if many dates each tml automatically
they are cool so but some other
requirements i had it should not hamper
daily work and it should
developers should have benefit from it
but it should not separate from it by
slower loading times of pages it and of
course should also use which I see a WCC
mark appel edition skills yeah and i
wrote a sachet class satisfies the
sphere point and here's how it works I
hope you has a little bit family I was a
surfeit spec as they also do food a
message on each server through town and
in there I flipped the htp loop spawns
and key httpservletresponse and then I
say do filter on the filter change so
the request is processed and this is
Pawn scrapper that's two things first if
you leave right specs or bytes to the
browser so the HTML goes into the
browser as fast as always and the same
singers that's why it's called tht bc
perfect response it baha service prawns
in an internal yeah byte array and when
this message who turns the blue food
unless it i have the whole response in
the browser and you the cause i can do
its been lying stuff as well i also have
it in my buffer and if it's an if it's
really isn't HTML which was served I
could be something else CSS image
whatever but if its HTML I detach the
HTML from the buffer and sent it to the
market validation service and then I get
an answer Oh laterally let it or not and
then I'm I haven't closed to response
yet I haven't closed the outputs to you
so what I do now is I after the closing
issuing I check i apprenticed a smaller
script it's not that which displays
little box which is I sorry no red well
each developer will immediately see if
its HTML is valid or not yeah cut it
cause I prefer to do for this let's see
if it's works
there's this small web app where I
downloaded some webpages from that and
here's the description and you see see
here's the surf at filter checks all
words and it currently uses the publicly
available very data but of course if you
do this internally in your company you
should install your own validation
service so you have it on your internet
yeah it starts a tomcat
and here we go
so what you see now is the HTI peach and
you see this yellow box there and now it
turns red wow great we're not ebay maybe
I can click on the view is that button
and then I get all the the arrows which
are there hey I don't want get too into
detail here and I also wanted to show
you where it i'd share my page of cross
there are someone's internet okay it
works fine some final thoughts for the
sting try it out this mile the surface
filters open source just downloaded try
it out feedback is appreciated of course
another point is how to lose it
sometimes if you have a enterprise
website nutrient to create a third-party
HTML snippets ads or whatever and of
course sometimes those said parties new
boots aren't valid hmm what to do about
it can't change them course you have to
indicate the first thing maybe a most
easy thing to do is to indicate the
switch and thuy about vacation to turn
off air so that's nice if you develop
and don't see the ad think it's cool it
makes your website faster and if you
can't do this or maybe it's important to
that so stupid well most easy thing to
do is to have some special HTML commands
and your produce HTML and then extensors
a surfeit filter and before you sense
the HTML to the validation service just
slip out those third-party HTML snippets
which you are not interested in
validating so you only check your own
HTML which is surrounding so those
nipples
yes so much for the technique number one
technique number to a little bit similar
continuous CSS validation same idea we
went layout packs by always delivering
well it's a SS and once again I would
like to ask justice at a regular basis
in its development process Oh two guys
cool okay this is an opera developer
Angus um yeah why once again it's so
easy to have a typo in your CSS I mean
you have charcoal look who a block of
CSS Woods will be a keynote wiser paola
my CSS is quite hobos so the block is
not valid it just takes the next one but
yeah the guesser block which is ignored
has some meaning so you will probably
have lay out back somewhere if you
somehow enter some characters course on
it committed and should be commit
command but commit box didn't pop up in
time I guess you all know this kind of
error and so we definitely want to have
valid CSS so yeah as they are power
exchanges of course this is the same
slide then you always saw same argument
supplied can't makes a good field so can
we maybe scan files during the build
process hmm CSS is not only and CSS
files it's also an HTM a style elements
or even style attributes but
nevertheless why not validate the CSS
files and turns out that most of the CSS
normally yes and CSS files and style
elements or in statements are well not
so much you I guess it depends from
website website but
often there are lot CSS files and yeah
why not check sir so of course we don't
want to you were to view again and yeah
there's some CSS validation service
already that provided by the WCC and
speaking of layout box there's one
layout back here does anybody see it
it's hard spot then walk you to me for a
long time I give you a hint first I
thought wow this is by intent that you
want this design to be so where I did
some investigation there is an image for
the upper right corner hmm well I've
even WCC don't get it right I guess this
really an issue about layout layout
parts why should you use this validation
service it complains about something we
know as CSX CSS hex like this one you
don't want to have warnings there'd be
two such things by purpose but only
about some CSS there are a lot of CSX
CSS hex which are absolutely ok the star
is used a sec which is often used for IE
is absolutely ok so you can go with CSS
X and don't get warnings button again
the CSS validation service complaints
about unknown CSS properties most of the
time krauser specific ones like most
border layers or the typical IE once was
inline JavaScript expressions or fri / i
don't know what we did two years ago in
a project was to uses CSS relationships
the nice thing about this
it's actually java code which you can
download and open source so we can move
if I it and twist it to your needs the
markup validation service as far as i
know a bunch of Perl scripts which you
need to in Sona pesci service but this
is just playing java code and a built-in
motor around it this is slip a snippet
from our promix am I and what we did was
to validate or CSS files a sec except
those which are meant to be for the IE
which were included by this conditional
command in the ischium air I guess you
all know so this doesn't validate all
CSS but a lot of CSS dallas it worked
quite well and I thought about open
sourcing this moat you too but turns out
all the code you will which is really
important fits on one slide so I decided
not to start another source boy it can
put it on one slide yeah I don't want to
go into details here can see you can
have a look at it later who'd want to
play rounders just download it and see
if it fits somehow on your build process
of course you could also validate CSS
tune your front-end test I mean doom
scanning CSS files you already know is a
good idea you should do it on your CD
machine so the build will fear but what
about the CSS which is in HTML and yea
once again use one artist why not can
lose this it's the same likes HTML
validation and product s and why not
have a saw that put um I haven't done
that yet I st. sounds like a nice idea
to me hey there's one problem I sink and
how do you get feedback because you can
detach JavaScript to CSS
have to have some stage of passage and
errands and go back for well maybe one
come up with a nice solution for this
one day but when its CSS is by far not
good enough this is a recording of
housings of the public website from the
German television station and you see
even if they had valid HTML and well it
CSS there are some amateur sauce is
missing because our requests all images
found in CSS and gets for 400 4 hours
mmm Oh another saying is this is a
special page in their website and I
guess they had some design in factoring
and some CSS changed and there was one
special page there's this odd HTML
doesn't fit to the new CSS and so you
get something totally probing even if
you have where it HTML and see that the
website doesn't look good and just
directly leads me to technique number
three detecting the air box using
javascript in image processing what is
the idea here the idea is nothing less
but detecting layout parks by simulating
the human eye wow that sounds a little
bit like artificial artificial
intelligence and then nobody has a
definition for antigen so maybe it is
but it's quite easy and that just some
clever algorithms so let me show you
some more typical layout works it G is
the spot the text goes on so it's
truncated here at a vertical edge and
also here oh another one this is Richard
which there's not enough space for
showing all the step
text so it takes in another current Nero
but you don't see it so the Texas
truncated as a horizontal edge or this
one yeah the text not text is not
truncated here but it's it overlaps a
vertical edge and this doesn't look
professional bad singers if you have
layout packs this just looks
unprofessional and you don't want people
saying about your company to be
unprofessional and this even help those
limits backs are everywhere even on
sites of big companies here this is most
of the time that's a home page but some
page deep down isn't a magician
hierarchy G here's my yahoo pool fire
yes I guess this is a localization issue
and German Texas most of the time longer
than English text so develops here's in
football so how can we oh another
example means yes no overlapping but I
think there's some space missing its ass
do this doesn't look good together so
how to automatically detect those types
of layout box here's the idea in the
first thing is we need to know which
pixels belonged text and then we need to
know which pixels belong to a vertical
or horizontal edge and if in knows we
can do some end and if text pictures &amp;amp; H
pixels overlap we have found a layout
back and then of course we need to
somehow we produce this found back so
let's start with detecting text I have
put in a simple text detector and it
works like this then as a expect as a
front end test and the lever for the
page as the first thing I do is I inject
we would JavaScript level you to the
page jquery and then I do jquery star
this selects all elements and then I say
CSS color black and this means far as
the text of every headline FB link or
every paragraph becomes black so I take
a screenshot and then I say give all
text on the page the color white and
then i take another screenshot and all i
have to do now this compare those to
chris king shots and are different
pixels are problem checks let's see how
this works in practice this is a page i
want to analyze the first thing i do is
make Africa or the text black there then
I do make all the texts right and here's
the difference wow really this is all
text pixels Oh pop rose up in the
station put the original page in the
background fill it out yeah Oh seems to
work first problem solved next one
detecting vertical edges I think edge
detection is actually a problem already
sore in computer graphics there are
sophisticated I wasn't for it but don't
like sophisticated algorithms most of
time they are quite complex and we only
interested in vertical and horizontal
echizen I am a person hope a little bit
more easy ilysm once again I
photo/silvia at gtech Torah which
injects Jake Valley and to help myself I
said all the text to transparent at the
beginning so i have no checks so can
concentrate on detecting edges and of
course and take a screenshot then i find
that acute pixel sequences of a certain
manipulates that each pixel has the same
color or at least a very similar one and
then i select those which have a high
contrast to the left all right
Jesus of my vertical axis I have to do
some cleanup I only want to have
vertical edges of certain lengths but
works quite well we will see well here's
my page first step is to let all the
text disappear not interested in text
here I'm innocent than vertical access
so where we have a lot of candidates
here those are all candidates for
vertical edges the same colored pixel
sequences and if I look for pics of the
quenches which higher only high contrast
to the left or right I get this and last
step is to clean up those little
artifacts which happen to collect
minimal length and since the mini
lengths here was 16 pixels and wow seems
like detected already collections and of
course it can do the same with
horizontal axis if you put them together
Europe or your particular oh it's on to
lectures cool so we have on our checks
pixels you have our edge pixels let's
duel and hey cool the others we found a
layout back let's see product um I have
a little class cord layout back with a
helper method mark buggy pixels on what
I do feel look back this is hard to see
this is even the faded version also
website so what I do is I replace each
baggy pixel by a circle the videos 5 of
black pixels so I get a buggy area and
then I finds the outline of this buggy
area and for a sick red line around it
then this is turns out to work really
nice so here's my buggy area on my the
small circles around some bug fixes and
this is the outline
and I can't stresses on us this is an
automatically detected layout work the
first time I saw this picture a lean
vacancy Wow this will you worked of
course there are other types of layout
bugs you Jesus work for example you see
that there's text there I can't eat it
ok can I know what standing it but it's
hard to read I think there's a layout
Burke takes text which is hard to eat
there can be two reasons for it here you
can select different color schemes but
sometimes it's also the case that you
would see sss pool anywhere forgotten
some CSS the selectors or you have
change to HTML and suddenly you have a
collect link texts on blue background or
you have right link text on yellow back
home then yeah I see that right off so
how do you go about those types of layer
parts where we need to know which pics
is belong to text Oh already solved this
problem the next thing we need to know
is the background color want to text but
that's not hard to do yes that's get the
outline of the text pictures and look
what colors are here and last thing you
need to know is the actual text color
shouldn't be Zetas should it I mean
clean and black isn't it but if you zoom
this is what the actual actually ran out
by the browser the Texas and realized
and if you look closely here to say L
this isn't in black this is found again
blue there's no black pixel of that but
turns out you don't really have to know
the exact color all you need to know is
does it have a high contrast to the
background and if not its layout back so
I don't want to get into the details
here house I wasn't exactly works but I
want to announce an open source library
I have put online it's called fighting
layout backs try it out what does it
offer and not much its moment but that's
over the limit and detect in valley
village where it's ready detector this
one scans for image elements which an
invalid source attribute may be the
source attribute is empty or it points
to an image which produces a funnel flow
response then we have this detect text
near or overlapping oh it's on to etch
and vertical edge detectors which I just
showed you and we have this detect text
to low contrast detector hour long class
names aren't there yeah and of course i
want to show you how it works
so let's start with this you take text
in here overlapping vertical edge test
here we go I have a webdriver instance
it's a firefox driver by the way
currently only the firefox driver is
capable of taking a spin shot but
comparable be able soon and so up our
tribal be able to which is should be
released I hope this year if not this
year then costs next year and yeah what
do I do here just instantiate the
detector class and then I say I gives a
screenshot you actually I don't have to
do this but if i do the detector will
take a screenshot not only sees it says
and I layout back and then I say find
layout box and I give it to try on this
will analyze the current page and yeah
hopefully it will turn the layout back
which I turned out here so let's see if
it works
at work yesterday
you see the exit actor and the HD take
that work and Wow lettuce we have
detected some texts near / 11 vertical
edge and we have when we're also page
which was analyzed and we have
screenshot let's take a look at it
which one is it a scoop on today this
one
the eris detective text me or
overlapping with Grich who oh thank you
thank you very much let's say another
one detect X was too low conquest is
actually the same code just another
detector and another website here it is
check texts too low contrast finally out
backs and lets you are set
yep the errors detected text is too low
contrast let's take a look at the
screenshot Dallas Texas to low contrast
for today yep it worked once again
okay a small outlook of course there are
more typical layout bugs out there the
most often seen one I can sing as this
with our you have different layouts and
different browsers this is chrome is
Firefox and you see here is backing this
behind the text input fear here this on
the next 12 it's pull but here's there's
a link which is not cool or kids I'm the
next line so normally you don't want
this maybe it's okay for you but
normally you don't want us and we're how
do you go about us then we have several
web drivers which change take
screenshots we can use them and you need
to somehow compare those screenshots but
we can't of course do it pixel for pixel
because there might be slight
differences and interior lysing so I
guess we need to come up with some fuzzy
hair goes to compare those screenshots
and I haven't tried it yet because I
can't cloned I can only take screenshots
with firefox at the moment but I think
the first thing is I blew a screenshot a
little bit and then I shrink it but to
serve the sides and then I can do the
comparison with some flesh words who the
pictures don't have to be the exact
color but this at least same color and I
think it should work we will see when
the next left driver lewis comes out
it's another typical layout back mmm
this is a light box which displays a
video and unfortunately the light box
doesn't has enough space to contains
over you so you get squirrel bus here
they don't make much sense because if it
wouldn't be there the place would be an
ass so it's not nice it looks
unprofessional what can you do about it
yeah scrollbars most of the time looks
the same
but can do is it's a little bit like the
school and screenshot technique they
find supplement jizz in your screenshot
let's detect school bus and emerges and
they feel your page isn't supposed to
have a scrollbar but we detect a school
where then you probably have a layout
back there or going two years this is
the detector which is not coming on it
there might be pages there which chefs
corbis by intense so mature out to go
abuses but should be a sensible detector
for pages which should not have score
about as is another one I often see that
some Putin borders you see some sunshine
guns went wrong here and here there's
some space between the border and the
box content this one is a little bit
harder but I still seeing this is
automatically detectable because just
ask yourself how we detect this kind of
the awkward where we see there's a
certain pattern here which marks the box
is the top of the box and this petaq
continues here and there's some space
between it some some Lions I think this
should be you could express this in an
algorithm I haven't tried out yet but i
think it's scoob ok another one here's
some text is conjugated it's not at a
vertical edge so I not sure how to go
about it I really would like to have an
OCR optical character recognition
rivalry in jville so I could detect text
in my page and it should not to take
this one cause it's complete and so I
could compare but I haven't found a good
OCR rival yet at least not in the java
source law and the last example sites
that spacing here and here there's an
indentation problem I think so
I really have no idea how to go about
this type of the epoxy I hope you have
some ideas don't have an answer for
every question that I'd be nice who take
those types of back to wouldn't okay
well once again back to the freighting
little box library it's it's it's really
not more than a proof of concept at the
moment but i hope this that it comes
something like find box pine box is
library but she takes to pick ullapool
coming backs and java classes invitingly
outbox should become a library which
stands typically effects of web pages on
something similar of course
contributions are welcomed if you have
examples for layout box which are online
sends them to the hoop i would like to
have a catalog of typical layout packs
and if you have such a catalog we can
sing how we go about it to automatically
detect so we have ideas for algorithms
to detect automatically layout works let
us know and if you want to contribute
code if we be nice to if I could start
something yet um some final thoughts of
course there are many open questions I
would like to try to answer to first one
is when should detectors be executed
first option is of course you can once
again fri to separate front and test
which wizards some features which you
you know your website best you know
which features are special and some
attention I'm so enter Jessica that
might work but maybe it's also whether
to explicitly expressed in your front as
tests that you assert that the current
page has no layout box
and then this match our method I some
way out bugs you figure those detectors
you want to use and to detect any out
bugs or the third option why not every
time you'd get a new page or click on
something or mix something change why
not find layout works every time well
turns out we have seen the test that
takes some time some seconds and the
more detectives you use some more time
to take but on the other hand side if
you do this once in a night in a nightly
build who cares if it takes one hour or
two hours and the last thing I want to
mention this what about false alarms
whatever detector says oh I detect it to
lay out back and you look on it and say
no this is my design I want to look at
lexus hmm but you can contribute a patch
to the fighting the outbox library
button again let's look low how find box
use the source for alarms the first
option is they have a configuration fire
to exclude certain classes or back to
chapter so we don't get false alarm I
think it's quite easy to do a
configuration fire which has some words
and some exclude patterns so some
detectors will not be executed by for
this who else may be weak another idea
is to exclude certain areas of the
screenshot but the whole page but only
certain areas maybe listen some kind of
coordinates or maybe listen some pattern
recognition they specify the region the
top left corner so reach in a pattern
right corner or maybe an iphone mask I'm
not sure then let's start with a new air
and it's nor detector for certain page
if he knows as a person are I'm saying
else's improvement Wow
number 25 bucks has also this capability
to scan the source files for commands or
this sometimes I think they also support
annotations and classifiers that you
explicitly specify this is some Java
code which I no breaks fine packs but
assist by attend and I could imagine to
invent some kind of special HTML
commands which detect your passes and if
it detects it it just says ok I know you
won't want don't want me to report
layout back here ok so quite easy isn't
it yeah and as it's the last slide and
before I take questions I would like to
thank you for your attention there is a
very interesting presentation I must say
there's going to be more of a political
battle where you're going to try and
tell the developers as a whole bunch of
bugs and tell the testers that they
didn't pick many of them up one of the
questions that I want to ask is you
mentioned about testing these layout
bugs across browsers but I was not sure
if you actually pointed it out in your
you know in one of these programs how
you actually do that I think sis
cross-browser a problem it's a special
one because all as a layout box can be
tested in one plaza how do we do about
it but if I guess if you use that driver
you have one API for all kinds of powers
so you can take a proponent test run it
against Firefox and in the future run it
against cone run it against i.e boo ie
would be a problem it don't take
features on IE and it against obama and
the same phone a test run in different
browsers and all the time to check
oh noes it wouldn't be solution have to
compare yeah okay no you can do it but
you have to somehow know which
screenshot
from one possible ins to the other
browser if you have the screenshot of
the same page from two different
browsers then numerous treats us into
the detector which we haven't yet but if
you have it you can compare I hope to
satisfy some how you answer I have a
solution and code yet but I can imagine
as possible the precondition would be to
have a screenshot of the same page on
one closed and the same page a
screenshot of the same page from another
poll and then a clever compare a little
don't think it's that hard look thank
you for this presentation I think it's
which is our Christopher Columbus
solution to this rather clever solution
to you to something like this I'm a
question is some I think you mentioned
suming i find myself suming a lot of web
pages and scaling the text of the 34
charm so a lot of pages break them oh
you can detect that as well i guess and
detected automatically as well vienna
suits a question correctly what about
detecting layout bugs when you zoom in
the page i might only it zoomed on one
slide to show you how text looks
magnified but of course this is a big
problem if you assume a page the text
gets broken and sometimes this causes
layout box I haven't seen this very
often I'm not sure of that driver
support assuming we should showed me
it's supported yeah
yeah maybe we can do it with a keyboard
shortcut pursue me yeah of course it's
absolutely valid front and test too soon
your web page and then together the air
/ detector I yeah you should do this how
is Oh with this work with something say
like canvas if you've got words in a
canvas and some the the words
overlapping because obviously we're
looking at it visually it's a layout bug
but you can't actually hook into the
canvas to see how things are yeah hmm
where this wouldn't work would it only
the current detectors which I have
programmed only detect text overlapping
etches so the question here is how do
you detect overlapping texts hmmmm I
could imagine that you can if you
somehow know your webpage good enough
you can hide certain elements this
JavaScript and take screenshots and if
you know there's some special box some
special cameras which has sec just hide
the text and there take a screenshot
that detect all the texts which is on
the remains on the page and then flip
around hide all the other text and just
display the text and the canvas it takes
the text pictures and then once again do
a bit of ice and let's say overlap your
fountain elbow
oh thank you a couple of simple coition
do you use it in you production process
not yet then no more question I think I
just imagine how it fishin's how much
appreciated it has in real production
process you know but we use to
continuously integration process to be
detecting every day every single comet
of our HTML guys now and if we have
several tens of several other commutes
every day so can be highly detectable
wit or app can be raising false alarms
well so on yeah this is always the same
with new technology this library is
quite new I have developed it in the
last month's so and if you introduce new
technology do it carefully step by step
so what I propose is start with a
nightly build it just checks some pages
and see how many false alarm you get and
how long the detection of layout
partakes and then just once you started
you can increment lee go from there step
by step by checking more pictures or do
the tests more let's see how it scales
maybe we can also paralyze the detectors
to run on different machines so the time
it takes to attack layout box shortens
yeah but start is a little step and see
how it goes from there okay first of all
I'd like to say
thank you very much because you're gonna
make my design team very very very happy
so thanks in advance the second one is
uh advance advance warning of a request
that I'll probably ask for you when
anybody else working on this one of the
biggest layout issues that I find in our
application and it's a proper
application is we need to scan pouches
or some text or images and then shove
them up later on for somebody to
validate and say this is this is good
this is not good and i find that we
waste I don't know forty percent of the
time telling the people whose condom to
do a better scanning because if it's
can't even look it up as a regular image
it's fine i think they serve it up on a
browser any browser then half the time
we have to send it back in so I guess
I'm fishing for ideas do you think we
might be able to muck around with you so
that we are testing images of images or
images in order to try and if even if
even if it just points out you know ten
percent of the errors then I'll have
saved up a lot of time for that so you
may not have an answer right now but
I'll be I'll be following up with you
Ottawa yes mm-hmm okay I'm a little bit
over hand by this question mmm test
images for images test images mmm i mean
what i use here is a combination of
image processing and some clever
javascript and you can't do this if you
just have a screenshot so you need to
have the access to the analyze page in a
browser so it can execute some
JavaScript to easily detect layout works
yeah that's that's all I can say it's a
moment i but but let's discuss I'm very
interested to learn about your process
of detecting layout bus and what kind of
layout box do you have let us know maybe
we find a solution
so there was a class of layout bugs that
I didn't see mentioned in there but I
did I did see demonstrate it on your
yahoo page the it has your your picture
and then the text box and the text boxes
below the picture when based on the
styling of the text box that should
definitely have been to the right and i
think that was again because the german
text for the submit button ended up
being too long and pushing the pushing
the flow down so i guess that would be a
flow error and the only way I could
think to detect that would be some kind
of rule somewhere that says this is
supposed to be to the right of this I'm
just wondering if you think this library
is going to evolve to cover those kind
of layout bugs as well yeah short answer
no as long answers actually I wanted to
present a fourth technique and this is
the idea is the taking the interpreting
the design as actual requirement but you
have to test this means if you say it
must flow to the right this is a
requirement you have to test and I think
this was this library gives you is the
starting point to build your own tests
to validate your design requirements
another example would be if you have a
design normally you get a good deal has
scissors which says the main column has
200 pixels the right Carmen's handled
pixels or something like that so there's
pain space of ten pixels penis but we
have a vertical edge detector why not
apply it and see if the etches matches
our good defined by the design and I
think maybe I hope you can use some code
blitz from this library to actually
verify your design requirements but I
don't think it fits into the library
