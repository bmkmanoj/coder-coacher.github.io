health at Google speaker series dr.
Munich is here today to discuss social
networks and community reengineering and
specifically how to create health
through information and policy dr.
Munich is an assistant professor of
Health Policy and management at Columbia
University the overseas over 2 million
in research grants and has published
over 55 original research studies and
venues such as the New England Journal
of Medicine J AMA and the american
journal of public health his work has
appeared multiple times in the New York
Times National Public Radio and
televised media outlets such as CNN and
so with that I'll hand it to Peter hello
everybody and so I am just getting off
the airplane from China I'm a little bit
desi bear with me um so I'm going to go
through this and then I will have some
time for questions at the end and if you
feel something that's really burning you
can feel free to begin so what am I
talking about today is the the state of
our nation's health and how we might fix
it though America's in in in really bad
shape and a lot of people think about
this about the health problems in this
country is relating to the health system
and today hopefully i'm going to show
you that it's not really a health system
problem although the health system is
contributing to quality of life issues
in this country but rather the way that
we've basically structured our society
and the way that we think about
addressing disease and preventing
disease needs to be completely rethought
so I'm going to sort of give you a
framework for doing that now the tired
old adage is you know where scientists
we have to sound scientific and a gram
of prevention is a kilogram of with a
kilogram of treatment or something like
that so the you know thing everybody
talks about prevention and prevention is
a way to to address disease in this in
this context or in any context like you
know who wants to who wants to get sick
who wants
to get cancer even if there's a cure for
cancer right that we want to prevent
disease before it occurred fine but it's
not exactly that easy right you can talk
until you're blue in the face about
Latoya oh you know we need to diet and
you need to exercise and you need to
stop smoking but people don't like to be
told what to do and so just providing
this information isn't really going to
change anybody's behavior in fact even
when your doctor tells you hey look you
really need to stop smoking only about
one to three percent of the patients
will actually even try to stop smoking
so we need to actually come up with an
entirely new framework for thinking
about how we prevent disease and that's
going to be the topic of my talk today
before i get into that let's go back to
the health system let's just let me just
outline the problems that we're facing
here okay don't we have a graphic here
it's coming up on my screen there we go
okay thousand five we're not getting the
previous graphic okay anyways ah ok
we're having slight technical Oh in 1975
let me go back to that even though you
can get 1975 in 1975 the United States
trying for left with industrialization
hit the back of the fat and I and costs
for for health care were also in the
back of the pack in terms of you know
being being a little bit high but and
they were still a little
lower than Switzerland for instant
though you know 11 framework for
thinking about this is let's just pick a
group so 45 year old females let's and
let's let's let's look at 15 year
survival so 15 years survival basically
tells us okay well what are your chances
of making it over the next 15 years and
I'm just picking one select group
because it's easier to think about
things using one sort of case study so
in nineteen seventy five females ranked
about ninth in terms of life expectancy
of all nations in the world for which we
had life expectancy data and health care
costs in the United States were second
highest in the world now between 1975
and the present we would expect health
care costs in the United States to
increase relative to other countries and
the reason we would expect that is
because other countries have national
health insurance and because the
government is paying for everybody's
health care universally and they have to
contain costs you see the issue with
health insurance costs is that they
inflate much faster than the regular
regular rate of inflation so in health
care costs are going up at eight percent
per year inflation is going up a three
percent per year it's really easy for
costs to get out of control so all these
other nations with national health
insurance programs ration care and they
ration it based on you know this is most
cost effective but what that ultimately
means is that the people that live
within those nations are not getting
access to the most high-tech most
expensive medical care it's just a fact
of life if there's $100,000 new cancer
prevention agent you're not going to get
it unless you can pay for it out of
pocket and you live in one of those
nations right the Americans are getting
access to the highest tech care not
everybody is right we have an uninsured
population we ration based on ability to
pay but we are getting access to the
highest debt care right
so based on that we might expect higher
costs in the u.s. right but we would
also expect that we would have gotten
something for it here's 2005 here's the
United States on this axis this is per
capita healthcare spending this is what
I would have shown you on the 1975 graph
but we don't have it and this is the
percent surviving 15 years so in the
United States 45 year old woman's chance
of making it 15 years pretty good
ninety-four percent but it is way behind
the pack in terms of other wealthy
western nations and Japan in terms of in
terms of 15 year survival and one of the
things that you this really striking
here is that the costs are twice as high
is these these countries right that I
said we would expect but the survival is
much much further behind in fact every
year the United States loses ground to
all of these other countries and we're
not just losing ground to all of these
other countries we're also losing ground
to industrializing nations Costa Rica is
ahead of us now Tilly is ahead of us now
in fact we fall into 49th place in terms
of life expectancy worldwide that's kind
of sad though something is going on
there's something about the United
States that's making us less healthy and
you know the thing that the thing that
most people would say was it would be
like well you know maybe it is something
else maybe life expectancy isn't the
best indicator what about health well
let's take a look at this this is
something I put together using a new
data set that we just created it at
Columbia called the dss ndi and it
allows us to look at self-rated health
status over time and mortality over time
and what we're seeing here is that the
health of Americans you know
historically was increasing you would
expect it to increase you would expect
health over time to increase this yeah
we have better medicines and we have
maybe
a better diet and but in fact it's not
increasing it plateaued sometime in the
1990s and they started to go down and
their other quality of life indicators
so here's here's what's happening with
all those health care expenditures this
is what it's doing to our economic
quality of life they're here this is a
compensation after health care
expenditures in thousands of 2006 US
dollars constant dollars over time and
you know you hear about real wages in
this country real wages are increasing
right every year real wages increased by
you know over historically by about one
percent or something like that meaning
that our income is outstripping
inflation but if you subtract healthcare
expenditures from that then actually our
real wages are going down and they're
going down because health care costs are
going up so high right remember in that
last bit we saw that health care costs
had gone to twice that of any other
nation though the median income
household is actually losing money over
time because our health care costs are
going up and they're going up partly
because we're spending so much money on
medical technologies and things like
that but also partly just because we're
getting sicker so remember we're just
sticking with with females in our case
study example here this is the time
period between 1961 1983 and what you're
looking at is this is the United States
of America not all Americans are good
with geography and these little blotches
are counties within the country and this
is actually really concerning and what
did what it is is these little salmon
patches indicate counties in which life
expectancy did not improve the life
expectancy improved we are evolving as a
species every year life expectancy
improved for human beings we're involved
we're evolving genetically and we're in
we're evolving socially so you know
we're lowly kind of sort of tackling
wars and nutrition problems
but we also tend to just evolve with
mate selection and things like that and
as a result life expectancy should just
keep going up and up and up in fact I if
you look at Swedish female life
expectancy it's probably one of the most
consistent biological phenomena ever
recorded it always increases by one
point three years every ten decades this
very consistent life expectancy is meant
to increase we only really see drops in
life expectancy in extreme circumstances
so for example in the former Soviet
Union when there was a transition to
capitalism life expectancy plummeted
sub-saharan Africa with AIDS life
expectancy plummeted these are very very
very very big social events economic
disruptions war infectious disease
outbreaks we're not seeing any of that
in the United States I guess we get a
little bit of economic disruption lately
but but in general nothing really really
big this is the same map in the period
1983 to 1999 now remember these diamond
areas are the ones during that life
expectancy did not change and everybody
was worried about that like oh there's
some people who are not benefiting from
increases in life expectancy in this
nation the red dots in this particular
graph in the next time frame Joe areas
were life expectancy actually declined
for women so what we're looking at for
some counties for some places in the
United States is a phenomena that you
would expect only to occur in the
context of a massive outbreak of disease
a massive economic disruption something
like that now one of the things that's
sort of striking about this pattern is
that we see that it's mostly in this
region of the country that we call this
stroke belt this is like a you know Rush
Limbaugh territory people people going
from their homes to their car to their
office lots of car culture lots of
high-fat food things like that we might
expect
that that this is being driven by
obesity poor diet things like that okay
now remember going back to this other
graph once again that what we're talking
about here is in my immediate comparison
is the United States relative to a bunch
of European countries in japan right and
australia though if the united states is
falling behind on these measures we
might think well okay what's different
about the united states in these
countries probably a lot of you are
thinking in the back of your mind well
obesity right obesity is much worse in
the United States than it is in these
countries you might also be thinking
about something like smoking of course
we associate the French with cigarettes
immediately in our mind but actually
Americans are big consumers of
cigarettes so then we're talking about
women Jack Japanese men smoke like
dishes but as Japanese women do not and
we're making comparisons for females
here so what we're looking at here is
the change in smoking rates over three
time frames and remember we're using
this really unique we're using this
really unique framework right we're
looking at comparisons between 1975 and
2005 right and we saw that the United
States is just falling further and
further and further behind in terms of
survival right so for smoking to explain
the United States falling further and
further and further behind over time we
would have to see an increase in smoking
in the United States relative to those
other countries we're comparing
ourselves to right so what this bubble
graph shows is anything above this zero
percent line means that smoking rates
are increasing anything below means
you're decreasing and this little white
bubble here is the United States we're
seeing that amongst all of these
countries
that we're looking at here in our
comparison that actually smoking is
declining more rapidly in the United
States than these other countries and as
it turns out the baseline prevalence of
smoking was not amongst the highest so
Americans are not more likely to smoke
on average than Europeans however one
thing about Americans it does stand out
as they smoke more cigarettes right so
you know your French you lived in France
what the French do is they you know you
have a cigarette you eat dinner you have
a glass of wine you have a cigarette
Americans are kind of like like always
smoking cigarette after cigarette after
cigarette so we actually consume many
more cigarettes than any other nation in
the world on a per capita basis but
there are fewer Americans that smoke
regardless the prevalence of smoking in
the United States is is dropping faster
than it is in any other country that we
cannot attribute this falling back and
life expectancy to smoking okay what
about obesity that was on all of your
minds to in 1975 it turns out Americans
were bigger than anybody else in the
world but over the period 1975 to 1985
we were amongst the bottom nations in
terms of increases in obesity in the
nineteen eighty five to nineteen
ninety-five period again we're in the
bottom in terms of increases in obesity
rates and in 1995 to 2005 where again
towards the bottom and in term in terms
of increases in obesity rates so even
though we started off heavier other
countries are gaining weight much more
rapidly right so obesity cannot account
for the United States falling behind
well what's going on I mean when we
think of these other countries we think
of people walking around carrying bag
gets right we think of beautiful
buildings we think of nice communities
we think of social cohesion we think of
social welfare states we think of all of
these different things
it could be potentially explaining these
differences in life expectancy right so
let's take a quick peek at what does
potentially matter in terms of
population health this is a study I did
in 2009 and basically what I did was a
we looked at we looked at the risk
factors that we could look at that were
social and traditional sort of medical
risk factors for bad health outcomes and
we try our objective here was to rank
them to figure out like okay well what
is it that's really making Americans
healthy or unhealthy and what we see
here is up here towards the top is
health insurance being uninsured versus
being insured it has actually relatively
small impact so we're talking about let
you know like a three hundred thousand
years of perfect health lost due to not
having health insurance no this measure
is a little bit funny you can think of
it in terms of years of life loss but
it's a measure that combines health and
mortality it's called a quality adjusted
life year don't worry about that just
think about it in terms of years of life
loss though health insurance is actually
not a big driver of population health in
fact you know those 300,000 years
distributed across all you know 300 300
million Americans is a tiny fraction of
a year per per american it's not our
insurance problem which is a big problem
it's not to be belittled it's a huge
economic problem the uninsured go
bankrupt because they have no health
insurance but it's not necessarily a
health problem being overweight just as
small binge drinking how many people
over the last weekend had more than five
drinks that's considered a binge drink
binge drinking also pretty small in
terms of the overall impact on on health
in the United States this measure
non-hispanic black is actually a measure
of racism this is
after controlling for income and
educational attainment and what we're
looking at here is you know what what
sort of social deprivation is your
average non-hispanic black faces and
what that does to their life expectancy
here we have obesity and we see that
obesity is starting to become more of an
issue than these other factors so
obesity here we're talking about 100
here's here's a 100 million years of
perfect health law so this is one
hundred and five hundred thousand one
hundred whatever the point between 100
and 200 million 150 150 million yeah I'm
right off the plane fold years of
perfect health loss to obesity and this
is going to start to take a bit of a
chunk out of life expectancy about six
months on average so if we got rid of
all be city in the United States doing
that obesity is actually causing health
problems which we're not even one
hundred percent sure of but assuming
that it is and we got rid of four beat
all be city in the United States we
would be gaining about six months in
life expectancy right okay what about
high school dropouts when you think of
Belgium or Sweden or Japan you don't
think about high school dropouts they're
doing much much much better in education
than we are and education can have a
huge impact on health just the cognitive
impact of educational loan can have a
dramatic effect on health over your life
course and it's not super intuitive to
think about but it actually turns out
the people who are high school dropouts
are much more likely to get into
accidents be able to sort of cognitively
evaluate the risk framework education is
a it is a tool that we use survive
within complex ecological niches right
so
the society we live in is incredibly
complex and to navigate that you need to
have some cognitive ability but
education also does other things for us
that our health preserving right it gets
us a job that will give us health
insurance we get that little bit it
gives us a social network that's much
less likely to drink or smoke so it's
going to reduce our risk factors for
here and they're educated people tend to
be thinner so there is that it's a whole
host of social it's a measure of a whole
source of host of social risk factors
that that potentially contribute to poor
health outcome here is current smoking
smoking is a huge huge huge social
problem but it's not as big of a problem
as poverty so when let's stop and think
about poverty for a second you know when
you're thinking about these other
countries in Europe you think about
egalitarianism right eep taxation system
poverty in the United States does not
mean that you're you know severely
materially deprived but it does mean
that you don't have the resources to
live in a safe neighborhood or a safe
house you don't necessarily have access
to high-quality foods poor neighborhoods
tend to have high fat fast foods people
consume that kind of stuff it's like
education it's a whole host of things
that amount to material deprivation and
psychosocial deprivation so egg actually
turns out that poor people are less
likely to have buffers for stress and
stress for reasons that I'm not going to
go in I just don't have time to go into
it but stress is considered a major risk
factor for poor health outcome okay
though poverty we've got a lot of things
going on dress is probably one of them
all of these things are just sort of
selected random risk factors from a list
of things that you could potentially
come up with if we could actually add
stress to this column maybe it would
come out to be a bigger problem than
poverty but this is all that we could
actually study and look at in terms of
in terms of social risk factors so at
this point in my talk I'm going to start
to get a little bit mushy and less fatty
and we're going to start to hypothesize
a little bit about some of the stuff
that's going on here now if you think
about if you think about the social
network of people who are poor they tend
to have fewer social connections right
and they also tend to be in social
networks where people are more likely to
drink more likely to smoke more likely
to have other risk factors the people
within your social network their
behaviors are going to be primary
determinants of your own behavior we do
things because the people around us do
things the people that we respect and
love are the people we emulate so if
people around us quit smoking we're much
more likely to quit smoking and the sort
of leader in this area of research is
Nick Christakis at Harvard University
who actually looks at the effect of
changes in behaviors within social
networks over time so let's first take a
quick peek at at what happened to
smoking over a long period of time in
one particular social network in in
Boston Framingham Heart Study it is this
animation captures the years from
nineteen seventy one to two thousand
three a period during which Americans
quit smoking in large numbers
represented here by the number of gray
dots declining over time the animation
also represents how smoking cessation
may spread given the influence that
people appear to have on each other's
behavior within a complex and evolving
network of
social relationships during the 1990s
entire clusters of smokers within the
network appear to quit in concert and
groups of adjoining nodes are seen to
become white quantitative analyses
demonstrate a tendency for smokers and
non-smokers to form clusters within the
network and for smokers to move
progressively to the periphery of the
network so that by the end of the study
the prevalence of smoking appears higher
at the periphery of the network and at
the center okay so here again just to
reinforce that the dark notes were
smokers in the white nodes were
non-smokers and you see that the more
people that quit within your social
network the more likely you are to quit
within your social network over time and
one of the thoughts here is that ok well
there are there people that are sort of
like alpha right there they offer people
the people you emulate these are the
people that you know and william the
williamsburg e and hipsters they can get
people to ride fixie fixed gears
bicycles without brakes all over the
world it was just in Bangkok and their
people writing fixed gears bicycles
without brakes and Bangkok their people
in beijing doing it their people in
Shanghai doing it these are the thought
leaders that change behavior within
local so local networks and then that
those behaviors sort of spread out if
you don't Rob society and this is a
whole idea behind behind social networks
driving behavioral change now it's not
just things like smoking it can be
anything things are contagious and
prevention can be contagious and bad
behaviors can be contagious as well
right so if kit kat has an amazing are
you eating a kick-out now even if kit
kat has an amazing marketing campaign
and they target the hipsters and the
hipsters start eating kick cats and
everybody's going to be eating kick cats
right and then if the hipsters are like
the cats are uncool man then everybody's
going to stop eating pig fat and that's
just basically the nature of our social
networks and social marketing
but it actually turns out that you're
very body shape and type can be dragged
dramatically altered by the changes in
the body safe and type of people within
your social network this stuff is very
powerful and the spread of obesity
within a network also nick Christakis is
where we'll we'll sort of illustrate
this obesity is a multicentric epidemic
with many people influencing one another
and forming ties in complex ways the
network gets more compact and dense as
more or ties appear and the entire
network gets heavier over time
quantitative analyses demonstrated
tendencies for obese people and
non-obese people to form clusters within
the network so that by the end of the
study this clustering can be discerned
as in the densely interconnected
clusters of obese person here and here
and then oh okay fine so though fine so
so far what if I saw what if I what if i
told you I've told you that that the
health of Americans is sort of getting
worse over time and that it's not
getting worse over time because of
obesity or smoking or other sort of
traditional risk factors that we thought
of I've pointed to a list of other
alternative explanations that sort of
stand out when you think about the
difference between date United States
and France or the United States and
Sweden you think about income
inequalities and things like that you
also think about strong social cohesion
right so you think about you think about
countries that that want to lift up all
boats evenly even if even if some people
have to pay have a penalty for it you
tend to think of you know when we think
about Sweden the CEO of ikea could be
living next door to somebody on welfare
and you wouldn't be able to tell the
difference because they're both driving
the same car they have the same house
it's like uber egalitarian right the
United States is
Richard in a very very different way
socially and one possible hypothesis is
that it's this difference in structure
that's driving health and these
differences in structure manifest
through social networks to change the
health of all Americans wishy stuff but
we'll come back to this in a second to
sort of make my point i want to show you
an image that i rode the train by every
day when I was a medical resident this
is a neighborhood in the Bronx to
support a poor neighborhood obviously a
lot of these houses are sort of burned
out but there's still lots of people
walking around and on the streets and
living in these places it's not pretty
to look at it's kind of stressful to
look at right it's kind of just just
looking at it makes you stressed out
there's crime in this neighborhood the
housing quality is obviously quite low
and they're all sorts of dangers people
burned to death the mortality rate was
very very very high in the Bronx
especially in that in the 1990s now it's
starting to gentrify a little bit here's
a series of pictures I'm just going to
go through really quickly from a
photographer who does time-lapse
photography of the same neighborhoods in
the same areas the same buildings over
and so this is this is the Bronx in the
1970s you can see you probably don't
want this guy living in your front of
your building you can see that it's a
low-income neighborhood and there's
something very insidious about the
psychology of of this this neighborhood
it is like I said stressful just to look
at and that stress manifests itself in a
lot of different ways one is that you
just sort of these neighborhoods have a
sort of tendency towards disorder and
disrepair so here it is 10 years later
you can see that the guy's gone um
somebody else there and the building is
now burned out
but there's still in the rubble all over
the sidewalk but there's still lots of
people living there and then here we
have 10 years later at the building is
completely gone and some of the other
buildings on the block are now abandoned
though you just get the sense of a
prevailing sense of despair and stress
and that probably has a strong impact on
our psyche it's very very very difficult
to live in that environment and I would
argue and there's actually good animal
evidence to argue that this stuff gets
basically semeta sized that when we're
stressed it disrupts the basic core
functioning of all of our bodies
regulatory systems we release porta
zones that disrupt our immunological
functioning we release adrenaline that
disrupts our ability to regulate blood
pressure we can talk about this in the
question-and-answer session but your
environment is internalized within what
is potentially internalized within
within your body now let's think about a
public policy solution to this imagine
that we planted a garden there here's a
garden that I just came from in Hangzhou
in China this is she who and it's 30
miles 30 square miles of this like
basically willow trees and violets and
water and little stone bridges and lakes
when we think about this it's just
relaxing why do we like this stuff so
much you know humans evolved in nature
we enjoy nature there's something about
the aesthetics of this is relaxing to us
if we have parks what do we do in parks
we walk around we feel very tranquil
relax we socialize we exercise in parks
we go to parks to jog around rather than
jogging next to the highway because it's
just much more pleasant to do so and
this is the kind of thing that
encourages healthy behaviors you
probably see that I'm probably going to
get back to social networks with this
stuff and the grand scheme for social
engineering now
not every neighborhood is obviously as
bad as the Bronx in fact most of America
looks like this right this is something
that we see all the time it's everywhere
the whole country looks like this almost
like this is this whole sort of weird
sprawling mass of weirdness all
throughout like from from the Atlantic
to the Pacific and this is what our
country looks like and this is actually
not that much more pleasant at least for
me to look at in the Bronx like that
with his burned-out buildings and
everything else but it's also not an
environment that's conducive to doing
things like exercising this is an
environment this is a car culture
representation you know you get from
your couch you get in your car and you
drive to the bank and the bank is really
far and then you have to drive to the
next door down there and that's really
far and each time you know you have to
deal with people in traffic and nothing
is pretty so you know we could throw in
as a public policy measure a light rail
system right so we throw in a light rail
system and now people have to get out of
their house and walk down to the train
and take the train down here maybe this
is a good public health intervention
maybe this is a way of thinking about
public health policy we need light rail
to get people out there and exercise
this is also going to be a major drag
right as your bank is here it's taking
you like a half an hour to get to the
bank and you know in the next door is
down there and it's going to take you
half an hour to get back to the next
door because nobody's using this light
rail system and whatever but at least if
maybe if we put in some trees it'll be a
little bit nicer it won't be like a hot
walk in the Sun the you know things are
a little bit prettier things are a
little bit more relaxing I don't know if
this satisfies many people another thing
we could do is rezone this area so that
we can no longer have urban sprawl right
so now we're talking about low-rise
apartment complex with storefronts and
all of a sudden that starts to look a
little bit more comfy
cozy this changes the way that we view
the community in which we live this is a
community in which people are much more
likely to walk from store to store it's
also probably a community in which
people are going to be more likely to
socialize in right you're more likely to
sort of meet your neighbor and to talk
and and and it turns out that the more
friends that you have the longer your
life expectancy because this is a huge
buffer for stress and we're social
animals and socialization is is is good
for us there's one thing that's sort of
missing in this rendering and that is uh
this whoops not that it's not that
either ah not that e'er it's this which
is a bike path now this is a very
controversial bike path that just went
into park slope in brooklyn and
everybody hated it because I it they
thought it was going to take away did
take away traffic lane and potentially
disrupt parking space and then you have
bicyclists around that are in a nuisance
but actually the before and after
evaluation so that it reduced traffic
speeding by 75 percent and getting
increased the number of bicycles in this
area from 349 to over a thousand in a
three-month period per day and before
this bike path went in about half of all
those 349 bicyclists were on the
sidewalk now only three percent of them
are though it's led to some basic
improvements in the way that people
interact with their environment but I
would argue that this actually has a
much more profound effect on this
community than could be possibly
measured by bicycle traffic you know
these people are doing something that's
less polluting and is going to be
improving their health but it's also
having a much larger impact on the whole
neighborhood and that is that it's
normalizing this concept is normalizing
the idea
that we should be exercising that we
should be commuting from point A to
point B people are very very susceptible
to these messages and you can't tell
them you can't tell them hey go out and
exercise you have to make it normal to
do so and you have to make it normal to
do so without saying anything people
will brag about riding their bicycle in
the same way that teenagers brag about
drinking so much that you a puke or or
the Williamsburg in hipster bragging
about having crashed into the back of
sorry guys I know your Williamsburg Ian
crack crashing into the back of a car
without brakes uh because they didn't
have you know brakes on their fixie
bicycle and they were still getting used
to it or whatever people will adapt to
healthy things in cool ways the same way
they will adapt to harmful or unhealthy
things in cool ways what's important is
that it's cool that's all that's
important so can the city and the city
make people exercise more by running a
clever advertising campaign maybe it
could help or it could hurt but by doing
these little things that nudge you you
can more effectively change behavior now
I started off by saying the United
States okay health is getting worse than
these other countries right and I then
said that obesity and smoking were not
probably the main drivers of this but it
probably had to do something more with
the way that these other societies were
structured right and that this structure
was probably over time improving the
health of these other European
comparison countries relative to the
United States right so the United States
was probably getting more sprawl ii in
these countries were probably getting
more developed in terms of more
sophisticated in terms of implementing
more metro systems and more high-speed
well and they have Federer schooling and
the schooling outcomes have been getting
better over time whereas in the United
States they've been staying the same or
getting worse and that could be
explaining why the United States is
falling behind I also sort of showed you
some social network stuff that showed
that thoughts and ideas spread through
social networks right and I then
provided an alternative framework for or
sort of modifying the US and the
lifestyles that we lead in subtle ways
policies that change the aesthetics of
our neighborhood policies that nudge
people into doing things that are
healthy for them and normalizing
behaviors that are healthy right the
ideal is not to tell people that they
should be drinking lots of water but to
make it cool to carry around a water
bottle right we associate that with yoga
right it's cool to carry around a yoga
mat people are going to think you're
doing yoga even if you don't you can
walk around and carry your yoga mat so
we want we want that to be the norm and
these norms will spread within the
social network though there's some sort
of interaction between the things we do
in public policy and the way that people
behave within the neighborhoods that are
affected by those public policy that's
the overall Gestalt of everything that
I'm saying but I also said one other
thing and that was this stuff is fluffy
right we have no data behind this we do
have some data we even have some animal
models and this and that but we don't
have we don't have rock-solid data that
we can take to a policymaker and say
look if you put in this bike lane or you
put in this public transit or you rezone
this neighborhood that you're going to
get healthier Americans out of it right
so how do we get there well this is
where Googlers come in and the only way
that we can really get there is through
the gold standard of scientific research
and the gold standard of scientific
research is something called a
randomized controlled trial and the idea
behind a randomized control
trials you basically take a group of
people they all agree to be in the study
and you give you randomly assign some of
them to receive what you're in
intervention you're doing and randomly
assign others to be in a control group
right what you do something are we out
of time okay and if we have that kind of
data then we can be a hundred percent
assured or nearly one hundred percent
assured that whatever it is that we're
observing is true now one way of doing
this with neighborhoods obviously we
can't just randomly assign people to
live in the neighborhood that's been
improved and a neighborhood hasn't been
improved but we can randomly assign say
that we think Google and laboratory
Google employed and we we randomly
assigned high on bc if you do you're
Mike I think you guys might accidentally
be on average hello hi you you you're
mine
get it there we go big it's cut their
home video for you so um so what we can
do is like see that Google was a giant
laboratory and we had all of google
employees to do this and Google
employees live are everywhere in the
world they live in some now we've got no
video but we have a REO fee Google is
live in some communities that that look
like that looked like the first one with
a big big straight feet plain urban
sprawl area some people live near parks
some people live near small residential
areas if we randomly assigned folks a
education I exercise promoting
intervention and then looked at how it
distributed throughout the Google
Network like did people that live near
parks start to exercise more and people
that didn't live near parks not up take
it did people were randomly assigned the
exercise intervention who live near a
park exercise more and then spread the
information to another Googler who lived
there another park and then they
exercise more then we would actually be
able to come up with an overall model
demonstrating that living near a park is
actually going to increase your chances
of exercising for example you can do
this with anything you can do it with
food you can do it with a diabetes
program you can do it with anything but
we want it we want to show ultimately
that that your neighborhood has a huge
impact on your psyche and that that
psychological mindset in turn affects
your internal health state though this
is the information that we would
ultimately need to get to the point
where we can go to policymakers and say
you know look we need to change the way
that we are structuring our society and
we need to start nudging people towards
healthier behaviors but we also need to
create a
hoods that are safer more aesthetic have
better modes of transit and so forth
yeah that's my half-birthday we have
questions
oh man I wish I knew the answer to that
question like why is it why is it that
Europeans don't sprawl and we do I mean
I guess we have a lot of space but it
must also just be it must also just be
cultural you know I mean I usually
munities that are that have some
awareness about this will put laws on
the books thing that you know you can't
you can't sprawl like this is the this
is the city limit you can't build beyond
that point this is agricultural zones I
just came back from China they have
those laws on the books they get very
upset when you know builders building
areas that are zoned for farming because
they want the cities to be very dense
and high so that so that the public
transit systems that they're building
everywhere actually reach everybody in
the city it's the most logical thing to
do but for some reason historically just
hasn't existed in the United States mmm
what
yeah so the comment the comment was
because they can't they can't hear in
the other room the comment was like it's
it's that American drive for
independence you know like we want to
will we have a car culture and we want
to we want to have our private house
with our wife and 2.5 kids and the car
and we want to live our lives that way
and we have the right to live our lives
that way whereas in other countries
there's more of this notion of like well
we're all in this society together and
there's a sense of solidarity and if
you're going to go whore at some place
you might all pile into one car and go
there as one big happy non family is it
any other questions are coming
hmm
mmhmm yeah when we were actually just
talking about this a little bit and so
you know obviously actually I think that
that Google is doing that here and that
the long-term plans of actually putting
in bike lanes on campus is a great idea
as a start but an intermediate and as a
sort of intermediate step I'll get to
tell see in a second but as an
intermediate step one of the things that
needs to happen both here and probably
also in New York is that Google should
play its role as a citizen of the
community in which it lives and advocate
at fort at the community council level
especially at the community council
level at the county level to to improve
the existing city infrastructure because
a company the size of google has a huge
impact on policy making because the
community wants you here and and and you
can say you know we want the community
to better and we want it to be better in
these ways and you can do that within
the context of chelsea it's a little bit
more difficult in some ways but in other
ways it's a little bit easier because
New York City is already bought and sold
on the idea of improving their their
communities and they have new york city
has a interdepartmental collaborative
framework where they were the Department
of Health and the Department and the
Department of Transportation and the
Department of Sanitation and
Environmental Protection they all work
together to to meet objectives like
improving health and they have to fight
against community board though if Google
can go to the community board and say
hey look you know where were one of the
biggest players in your community and we
are employees really want bike lanes
going into and out of the company then
you can you can you can get that you
already have some but there needs to be
more and they need to be more extensive
so that employees who live they in
Central Park can have a
protected bike lane to get all the way
down to their work for example so that's
a start I mean there's it's very
difficult to get out of an enclosed
space the question then becomes well
what can you do once you are out of that
enclosed space you know getting to and
from work outside is is going to be it's
going to have a huge potential positive
impact on the psyche of the employees if
they can bike to work rather than go
underground take the subway come back up
up into their office and be inside all
day you know though so advocacy for
greater public infrastructure would be
wonderful indeed any others yeah right
but you can actually build parts so
that's the whole idea is that with the
the health department's it there's no
underfunded but they can work with parks
department's and with city councils and
and mayors and governors to to advocate
for more green space and you can put you
can put parks in the most bizarre you
know like a park doesn't have to be any
particular geometric shape you can fit
four parks and all sorts of different
areas abandoned lots and things like
that like the High Line park yeah so
this if this is a prime example the High
Line was just an old freight elevated
freight railroad in new york city that
has been sitting there resting forever
and the city basically said well let's
turn that into a park and put what it
parks a very beautiful park space going
along the whole top of the of the great
line yeah pretty odd pretty awesome
google it yes it's near cool okay thanks
everybody
