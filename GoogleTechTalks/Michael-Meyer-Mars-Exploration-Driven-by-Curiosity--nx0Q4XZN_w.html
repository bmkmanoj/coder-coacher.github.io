Google Talk today we have the privilege
of hosting dr. Michael Meyer nice a
scientist head of mars science at NASA
let me read a little bit from his
biography because it's interesting and
it shows you that pat on how to become a
head of mars science so michael meyer is
a senior scientist at nasa headquarters
in the science Mission Directorate he's
the lead scientist for NASA's Mars
Explorer exploration program responsible
for the science content of current and
future Mars missions and program
scientist for the Mars Science
Laboratory the curiosity mission during
this period dr. Meyer has also served as
the science liaison for review of human
space space flight plans committee and
he was also awarded the Presidential
rank award for meritorious professional
service Maya was the senior scientist
for astrobiology and program scientist
for the Mars Odyssey mission that was
launched in 2001 and is still orbiting
Mars the astrobiology program started in
1997 with dr. Meyer as the discipline
scientist so he actually made his own
discipline and the discipline is
dedicated to the study of the life in
universe since 1993 dr. Meyer managed
NASA NASA exobiology program and from 94
through 97 dr. Meyer was also the
planetary Protection Officer for NASA
responsible for mission compliance to
NASA's policy concerning forward and
back contamination during planetary
exploration dr. Meyer was the program
scientist for the Mars microprobe
mission ds2 and for two phase one
shuttle Mir experiments
Meyer was detailed from the desert
Research Institute so this was at the
University of Nevada where he was an
assistant research professor from
nineteen eighty nine to nineteen
ninety-seven from nineteen eighty five
to nineteen eighty nine he served as
associate director and associate in
research for the polar desert Research
Station department of biological science
florida state university in 1998 he was
a visiting research scientist at the
cultures and center for algae and
protozoa in cambridge england dr. Meyers
primary research interests is in
microorganisms living in extreme
conditions particularly the physical
factors controlling microbial growth and
survival he has conducted field research
in the Gobi Desert the Negev desert
Siberia and the Canadian Arctic he is
also a veteran of six research
expeditions to antarctica to study
microbial ecosystems in the McMurdo Dry
Valleys and investigates krill
phytoplankton relations and research
primary productivity in the videl see
his experience also includes two summers
working as a treasure salvager of the
coast of Florida and North Carolina so
when it comes to little things that live
in difficult places I think how dr.
Meyer here is the expert for the field
so please welcome dr. Michael Meyer
it's my pleasure to come here and
obviously when I was growing up I didn't
have as my ultimate goal to be the lead
scientist of the Mars program it just
happened that way what I'd like to do is
give you a little bit of overview of the
Mars program and then also then really
dig into what the mission curiosity is
doing how we got there and its
capabilities on the surface of Mars so
first off you know if we do a comparison
this these are stretched but essentially
they're they're approximately the right
size and reference to each other so the
thing that you want to note is Mars is
about half the size and diameter of
Earth and it is impressive how big the
moon is compared to our planetary
brethren what I want to do is point out
there's a couple of it you know major
differences you know half the diameter
it has about one-third the gravity has
about actually more than one or less
than one one-hundredth the atmosphere
Mars has 11 hundred the atmosphere that
Earth has Mars has a slightly elliptical
orbit so it's seasons are not symmetric
its atmosphere is over ninety-five
percent carbon dioxide the atmosphere of
Earth is you know mostly nitrogen and a
fair amount of oxygen so there are major
differences but there are some
similarities you know one is they are
formed at the same time four point five
six seven billion years ago there are
terrestrial planets Mars early on
apparently you know this is what we're
really investigating was warmer and
wetter may have had water on the surface
at the same time that life started on
Earth Mars was more like Earth and
because of that we see it as a potential
for having had life almost more
importantly
Mars today does not seem to have plate
tectonics we look at its surface and
over half of it is ancient there's
ancient rocks on the surface this is not
the case with our planet our planet has
plate tectonics has biology it has
erosion we have a relatively new surface
to look at but because of that the
record of what happened on this planet
the get life started and early evolution
is almost completely erased we only have
a few examples we don't have the record
here but Mars will have the record of
what was going on the first billing
years of history in our solar system at
a time that life started in our solar
system so by going there we can explore
what would have been happening the solar
system will life got started we might
even have evidence of life starting on
that planet and maybe even its evolution
so because that Mars holds a really
great potential to not inform us not
only inform us about planetary processes
early evolution a sort of thing but also
inform us about how we got started so
for that I think it's a good reason to
explore Mars so we've had a program and
it's been very successful and it's
culminated in curiosity landing on the
surface august six universal time we
have a maven plan to launch in 2013 and
what i liked it you know the big news
two days ago was in fact we have a
program that takes us in the future hmmm
there we go it's oh my god we lost it so
what I want to point out here is that in
yellow we have collaboration of the
Europeans so we've been doing that all
along and so after 2013 we weren't sure
what we were going to be able to do as
an agency in terms of Mars exploration
but as it turns out we're contributing
communications with exomars trace gas
orbiter we've selected a discovery
mission that is going to go to the
surface
and do sighs mama tree and heat flow
measurements of the surface our first
view of physical mission really to the
red planet ISA is sending a rover with
life detection capabilities in 2018 and
we're building a major portion of the
organic analyzer to be incorporating
that and what was announced on Tuesday
is in fact we were planning to send
another Rover based on the MSL
architecture to explore Mars so we have
a future we have things to do having a
program is great we learn lots of things
you know some of the things that have
happened the last decade and a half is
that we've been on map out the planet
extremely accuracy in terms of altitude
we've been being able to measure the
impact rates and also tells us where
Isis in the subsurface the role of
carbon with Mars there's reduced carbon
in the that alh84001 but also somewhere
on the planet Mars there is a hint from
magnetometer measurements that at some
point in time Mars did have plate
tectonics now this has to be you know
more research has to be done to verify
that we found where the water is where
the ice is the structure of the crust is
actually thicker than we thought we one
of the big boons in orbital science in
the last two missions is in fact we see
I should be talking we see minerals on
the surface that had been an association
with water we can see broad areas of
what was going on and planet and then
one of the things that's kind of
revealed itself as we thought more about
it is at Mars because it goes through
times when it really tilts over on its
axis and comes back when it tilts way
over ice will form all over the planet
and then when it tilts back that I can
get covered and we can have basically
buried glaciers across the planet that
are in not in equilibrium but because
they're buried there they're insulated
and the last well beyond their you know
they should be so we have sources of
water and the mid-latitudes on Mars that
shouldn't be there but they're less
over from the last time Mars tilted over
on its axis and what this does is it
provides an opportunity for disagree
librium which life could take advantage
of looking for speaking of looking for
water we found it in many different
forms Mars Odyssey found life I mean
found water in the subsurface had the
poles lots of it it really boosts our
estimation of the inventory of water on
the planet it just happens to be in the
form of ice we've also measured it with
the radar know the thickness of it we've
seen flow features on Mars and this has
been very intriguing and and helping us
convince that early on Mars probably had
a warmer and wetter climate and in
particular if you look at this it's a
perfect picture of a Delta a delta is
you have water flowing into standing
water similar to what happens in New
Orleans it's picture-perfect it really
does encourage us that we had at least
water stable enough on the surface that
you could have a lake for a period of
time Mars exploration Rovers this one
happens to be from opportunity it found
calcium sulfate that's gypsum this forms
in water this is stuck in a vein so
water was actually liquid concentrated
in calcium sulfate and then as it
evaporated left that deposit and then
curiosity just recently announced now I
guess it's about a month ago binding
these this bedrock that kind of looked
like Russian cement it's a conglomerate
we find those on earth in the bottom of
riverbeds so this is the best of an
evidence to date of that we had flowing
water on the surface of Mars so let's
talk about curiosity we've had a
progression and Rover capabilities
basically the real purpose is to
increase the proportion of
instrumentation that we can take to the
surface and what we're able to do with
it so basically if we look at Spirit and
Opportunity their instrumentation only
wait about five to seven kilograms
depending upon what parts of it you want
to
out image and the rover itself was like
100 75 kilograms but we look at
curiosity nine hundred kilogram rover
but it's carrying close to 100 kilograms
of instrumentation so we've increased
the percentage of what we can carry to
the surface and certainly vastly
increase the capability so let me go
quickly through the instruments as they
show up dan dynamic dynamic album
Neutron measures hydrogen measures
nitrogen measure neutrons which are a
proxy for hydrogen and so it can tell
you how much hydrogen aka water is in
you know first meter of the subsurface
REMS is the weather station mask am is a
binocular camera several dill tur wheels
highly capable we'll see some pictures
of that later chemcam is a laser-induced
breakdown spectroscopy light in certain
wavelengths and the spectrometer camara
net so it gives you elemental
composition and so if it was in this
room it could basically sample the whole
room in terms of what things are made
out of including you radiation detector
this is a high-energy radiation detector
a broad spectrum and what that does it
gives us a very good idea of how the
radiation environment out in space as it
comes through the atmosphere it gets
translated so you one of the issues
maybe with health is that although
galactic cosmic rays are dangerous what
they might generate as they come through
the atmosphere actually might be more
dangerous or less and that's good to
know and also we suspect that there is a
very important interaction with
radiation on the surface of Mars and the
bloated chemistry that may be going on
on the surface
the far right is Molly that's a hand
that's the hand lens imager it's concede
down to about 14 microns it has its own
light source it also has a UV light
source so sometime in the future as
we're playing around that we'll see if
there's any fluorescence but the real
job is to look at mineral greens and
rocks apxs alpha particle x-ray
spectrometer gives us elemental
composition this is a new and improved
version of what's on opportunity in
spirit and also what was on Pathfinder
for that matter Marty is a descent
imager so basically its primary
functions re over it was designed to
just basically image as we got toward
the surface the highlight of this
mission is that it's a roving analytical
laboratory and it's laboratory are two
instruments chemin and Sam chemin is an
x-ray diffraction x-ray fluorescent
instrument what it does is it gives you
mineralogy it tells you what the
minerals are what the spacing is in the
atoms Sam is a gas chromatograph mass
spectrometer tunable laser system
basically what does does is tells you
what everything is made out of so it's
these two of giving you mineralogy and
what they're made out of greatly
complementing each other and really
vastly improves what we can get out of
the rocks we find on the surface of Mars
to to determine what the environment was
when these rocks are made so we took
that Rover package it into this error
she'll give you an idea of the size
here's a real person who's about average
I realize when it's going through slides
I didn't have any pictures of the sky
crane system because I assume that
everybody has seen seven minutes of
terror and but I'll just remind you that
besides packaging up you have to unpack
it and you have this weird Rube Goldberg
device of having your Rover hanging down
from a bridle with the retrorockets up
in space we launched it November 26
picture perfect this is the picture of
the back of the cruise stage with solar
panels on it and on the way did science
rad was turn on radiation detector and
it was an interesting experiment well
one it works and a another satellite
aces was also measuring radiation in a
similar environment and so they both
detected the same thing but one of the
nuances of this is kind of interesting
is radiation detector being inside the
whole capsule would be saying the same
radiation as if you were an astronaut in
a capsule and the Orion capsule going
off somewhere so this is a nice first
measurement that gives us an idea what
the real radiation environment is for an
astronaut as are on their cruise to some
other destination so one of the really
nice improvements in our capabilities
and exploring have been on the
engineering side and this one is the
most graphic example we did not send all
these spacecraft here to Gale Crater but
I put the landing ellipse is there to
show you how we progress from biking
which landed in 76 its size of its
landing ellipse Pathfinder approximately
150 kilometers in this longest diameter
Mars exploration Rovers a little bit
smaller down to about 100 kilometers
Phoenix is smaller than that and then
MSL curiosity we have a landing ellipse
at the most 20 kilometers in diameter in
the long axis the importance of this is
there's no way we could have gone to
Gale Crater a place that has
morphological evidence that water
interacted with stuff layering so
there's a history too I'm to reveal and
also mineralogical evidence of a place
that's interacted with water we could
not have gone there with any other
mission to this date until MSL because
we needed that small landing lips be
able to place everything where we needed
to go
well the good news is we landed
successfully we're still not quite up to
fifty percent but doing pretty good so
let me show you this this is a video of
the descent imager what was seen by the
descent imager so this is what the
imager saw during the process of
unpacking the cruise stage and dropping
toward the surface of Mars we are
decelerating so that's the heat shield
dropping way and if you watch closely I
can actually see it competi surface
risto genetics similar to wile e coyote
modi a phenomenal and so this movement
right now that you're seeing is actually
the rover kind of the back shell and
everything and the rover pack into it
swinging around underneath the parachute
where you hidin I'm the Emily engine
preparation powered way we're down to 90
News second an altitude of 6.5
kilometers and setting
slightly deal at the time about 14
minutes so this is actually on board
soap it if it didn't work we don't have
any Indian monster right so this was not
stream back during the telemetry we're
down to 86 meters per second at Alice's
forefathers descending we expected so
they're trying to get the radar getting
a signal back from the radar and seeing
around Silicon sail far away ten point
eight years vertical off the ground
solution on table standing by perpetual
separation so in a minute you'll see the
image jump and that's basically the
rover room dropped out of the back shell
which if you've ever seen a video it
scares the hell out of me every single
time so now pitcher stabilizes it's now
under its own flight single garage
moliere seconds getting close now it's
going to start lowering the rover itself
from underneath the jetpack constant
velocity accordion nominal altitude air
five point nine years we found a nice
flat place we're ready for Scott grab
some interactions of the vector rockets
with the surface they only know they're
20 feet away the wheels just drop down
it's got greedy started
Thank You final good morning jingle does
he remains strong hey go down phenomenal
yeah you don't huh everybody now is like
holding the rabbit's foot biting your
tongue but actually usually right here
it's you can see the pebbles on the
surface
I'm sure that wasn't me the if you have
a chance go ahead and look at it online
but the resolution is better but one of
one of the interesting things with this
is is that it now looking at that we're
really worried about the rocket flume
just causing all sorts of distortion
that you wouldn't be able to see
anything on the surface and when we
analyze it there are several features
that even during all the dust flying
around and everything you can still see
those features and so what that means is
that you can do terrain recognition and
hazard avoidance on the next mission if
you care to spend the money to do it but
what it means it's possible so that's
really is a good harbinger for the next
mission that we send to the surface in
terms of ability to get to where we want
to go so here's a landing site picture
taken by mars reconnaissance orbiter to
high rise and that actually is the rover
and a little bit of bright spots next to
it from rocket plume in fact this whole
area is in fact affected by the
retrorockets with with the low more
analysis we see all the pieces that were
involved in getting through the
atmosphere and landing safely on the
planet and in fact hi r i was was even
able to take a picture of the back shell
in the parachute as is coming descending
through the atmosphere so turns its
capabilities are just fantastic so this
gives you an idea of like the final
moments and you can even see scour spots
from the retrorockets interacting with
the surface of Mars oh yeah and we also
you know we put put the name on here
just in case you go to Mars looking for
one of the Rovers you want to pick up
the right one this one's labeled no
mistake this is looking on the north rim
of the crater this is probably about 40
miles away getting an idea of the
abilities of the camera and looking to
the south of us that's Mount sharp this
is the reason why we're going to Mar to
Gale Crater this mountain doesn't look
very big here is 5 kilometers high the
reason why we picked it is because we
can see layers at least in the bottom
third and the layers have minerals
associated with them we have clays and
we have sulfates so we know that we have
a record of the time when Mars went from
being warmer and wetter kind of neutral
to being a colder and drier and more
acidic planet so we're hoping as we
explore Mount sharp and go up there we
can actually sort through Mars as they
went through this major transition of
going from a more benign planet to the
one it is today using the m100 camera on
the mask am look over here kind of at
the toe of Mount sharp this is this is
where we think the entrance is where we
want to go and this gives you an idea
you can see the layering we can see that
there sediments there we know that we
land in the right spot because those
layers are leaves of a book that will
reveal the history of Mars and its
climate evolution in just giving idea of
how spectacularly this camera is that
little dot right there is in fact the
size of curiosity and so when we get
there and start climbing up along the
valleys here as we explore it should be
a pretty spectacular journey so now let
me just show you some baby pictures this
is a the mask am plus the spectrometer
lens of the libs instrument the chemcam
chemcam works amazingly well with one
shot it feeds information to three
different spectrometers a full broad
wavelengths from infrared to ultraviolet
the picture on the on your right is the
first rock that it's ah did
coronation and it works but technically
well and it's going to be a fantastic
survey instrument here you can see one
of the things that that lens does is
that you can use it as an imager and so
you can see exactly where you you shot
the rock and so you can see five shots
over on the right hand side and the
purport the importance of this is rocks
are heterogeneous when you hit one small
spot you have to know whether or not you
hit a belt spar or another crystal so
you get an idea of what exactly you you
shot when you get the elemental
composition you know one of the things
that this is a a pretty neat way to
explore the public has a slightly
different view of our you know doing
this but so this this is a self portrait
of curiosity in an area called rocknest
this is where we spent approximately a
month and a half digging in the dirt and
measuring rocks in the area and you can
see right here five scoops of where it's
been digging the up through the sand and
dust running through the system
primarily you know to clean out the
systems you know any earth organics that
we might have brought with this we're
kind of rinsing out the whole sampling
system with Mars dirt to to reduce you
know any potential contamination and
that's work fairly well and this is the
first time we've taken solid samples and
fed it into the analytical laboratory
just as a note in terms of contact
instruments that's the arm out on the
arm we have two instruments apxs and
Molly and then also a drill and so here
on the on the left is Molly with its
lights on you can see two white lights
right there the UV lights are also on
and if you flip back and forth from them
on and not on you can start to see a
blue haze from the UV lights and then
over on the right hand side is alpha
particle x-ray spectrometer so here
Molly works is certainly well it does
some Z stacking it has infinite focus
and so one of the nice things they can
do is go through take a whole series of
pictures and then you pick which one you
really want wood and all be in focus
here's a spectra of apxs the important
thing of this is is that we're seeing
animal and composition the instruments
working and you know this is a basalt
kind of what we expected but you know
this is we're just starting things we're
kind of getting a background of
information on the Mars and it's just
nice to see the confirmation of what we
expected we have a weather station I
think one of the things that really
amazes me is the range of temperatures
that you suffer every single day on the
surface of Mars we're seeing almost 100
agrees in Fahrenheit variation this does
have some very practical effects such as
the arm will grow and shrink by one
centimeter just because the temperature
change not a good thing if you're in the
middle of drilling and having that kind
of movement one of the things that
really surprised me I didn't quite
realize it is that you have pressure
changes every single day on the order of
ten percent it's huge if this was you if
you were there you'd be popping your
ears every 22 hours it turns out that
this is all thermally derived the
atmosphere are so thin the surface
facing the Sun heats up tremendously and
causes a huge circulation and actually a
big pressure wave that just basically
moves around the planet as it follows
the heating of the surface causing a ten
percent variation of pressure amazing I
just want to show you here one of the
things that came up recently is marcie
the camera on mro spotted a dust storm
brewing pretty good-size these white
arrows mark it out of concern to
curiosity because it affects you no
imagery and that sort of thing that
you're taking you might want to buckle
down with your cameras
close the hand lens dust cover but it's
a bigger problem for opportunity since
its solar solar powered it turns out
that that dissipated and so one of the
nice things to do we have a weather
station on Mars we have orbital
information it is be really good to get
an understanding of why some of these
pretty large dust storms show up and
then disappear well sometimes they'll
show up and then go global which has
happened to pass okay Dan is showing you
your thermal and epithermal neutrons the
variation between the thermal epi
thermal neutrons tells you whether or
not there's water in the subsurface
that's working very well and it's doing
a survey so as it moves along it gives
us an idea they've seen as much as a
two-fold variation and hydrogen content
so this is kind of the overall near-term
plan we landed in Bradbury landing we
have this hunky unit that we've been
exploring over here we see this crater
terrain which is very typical of much of
Mars so it for some reasons more
consolidated the impacts on it last
longer there there that's what gives
Mars the old look to it particularly in
the highlands and then the third train
what we call the fractured unit seems to
be an extension of whatever causes
alluvial fan coming into Gale Crater and
this seems to be the lowest part of it
and so we've been headed to an area
called glenelg with the expectation
because we're going in wrong direction
in terms of getting a mountain sharp
that will just go back in the same
direction when you head out and glenelg
will look the same coming and going
being a palindrome so here's what we
landed right here we had pegged this
area to having a Louisville flan a fan
but we had no mineralogy that clued us
into what it really was because it's
covered with dust but it did have a high
thermal inertia so we knew there we
suspected there was consolidated rocks
underneath that dust and we weren't sure
what it was
when we landed this is one of the scours
right next to the rover we win another
30 meters or so we found another outcrop
that looked just like this this is
bedrock you see these round pebbles you
see the matrix itself the stuck together
and then also a third place about a
hundred meters away from original
landing site we see more this what looks
like a Roman concrete we landed on a
riverbed a river that is you know ankle
to waste steep fairly rapid flow we're
in the right place that water had to go
somewhere we're thinking that the
glenelg area it's the lowest-lying area
near there so maybe the water pulled
there so we're ahead in that direction
so let me talk a little bit more about
the other instruments Sam Sam and of
itself is pretty complicated it has like
54 bounds 52 heaters it's amazing it
works at all and we've done some
atmospheric measurements these are not
real surprises although the amount of
nitrogen was a little bit more than we
expected but you see argon and nitrogen
the two second two major constituents
what will be interesting as we sort
through isotopes figuring out what has
happened to the atmosphere through time
the isotopes will give us a clue so the
meteorite that clued us in to the fact
that we had Martian meteorites was ETA
which stands for elephant hills 7900 one
it had glass inclusions they were able
to measure the gas trapped by that glass
and that pegged in Tamar's and now we
have some measurements these match up
great with those it proves that those
are Martian meteorites but also what
this does is port in some great results
that we're going to have in the future
as we're looking at the different
isotopes that tell us the processes that
cause Mars to lose so much of its
atmosphere so as I mentioned earlier we
spent a
good portion of time at rocknest here's
a picture of the arm getting a scoop and
this is results from chemin this is the
x-ray diffraction x-ray fluorescent what
happens the x-rays go through the sample
they get bent by how the atoms are
arranged with each other and then
basically the brightness and distancing
of this tells you exactly what kind of
minerals are there very effective 10
minutes later you have a result as
fantastic to give me an idea of what
went into doing this this is what an xrd
xrf looks like in the lab they've had to
package it down to fit on Sam and now
there's a commercial version that fits
in a briefcase so you can take it out in
the field and do mineralogy right there
which is fantastic it's also been
adapted to by the carnegie to look at
minerals in paints and that sort of
thing and this is Jackie much re who's
the head of curation at carnegie and so
that's kind of cool that's being using
that way also we also have results from
sam essentially what happened this is a
what's called evolved gas analysis you
take your sample you heat it up and the
more you put into it it starts breaking
down gives off gases it gives off oxygen
sulfur dioxide hydrogen sulfide and
there's approximately they like 200
channels or so so this is just the plot
of some of the channels that give you
more information of basically the
molecular weight of oxygen hydrogen
sulfide and sulfate so that works yeah
it can really tell you what the rocks
are made out of one of the interesting
things is is that they found chlorine
compounds coming off at very specific
points and so what this does is point to
potentially perchlorate
this is something that was found by
Phoenix and the poll earlier each layer
train there was no expectation or you
know agnostic about whether or not
perchlorate of his only in polar areas
or whether or not as would be global and
here we are near the equator and we're
finding some perchlorate and this is has
significant effects on looking at comp
organic compounds and it looks to us
like the traces of organic compounds
that we're finding that Sam is measuring
are actually products of the perchlorate
breaking down and interacting with up
with other carbon in the system you know
such as carbon dioxide that sort of
thing so although looking confusing it
points to that the instrument is working
fantastically and that even traces of
carbon are being picked up by the
perchlorate and it just is it kind of
spells good news we did not expect on
measuring sand to actually find organic
manner because it's probably the worst
environment on the planet to expect
anything organic to survive just because
the high radiation environment all the
things are going on there's a listing of
why you wouldn't expect organics we
found in San so one other aspect of this
mission that I particularly enjoyed I'm
proud of nasan NASA for getting this out
to the public is that the public
outreach part of it I think it's been
extremely successful it is one of those
things although all the metrics we have
or tracking public interest and
accessing web pages and that sort of
thing are off the charts as far as
curiosity is gone and I think this is
great it gets the next generation really
interested in science technology so we
land it over here we've headed in this
direction we're actually near the edge
of what we're calling Yellowknife Bay
here's an image of it we actually are
just finished parking here doing a 360
panorama basically getting a very good
feel of the area and picking what is
going to be the
first rock that we're going to drill and
feed those in the analytical lab and one
of the real interesting parts is seeing
this layering stuff these flat plates
that we're calling schaller looks
extremely interesting we're trying to
figure out there's a reasonable way to
drill that material and get samples into
our analytical lab and so we're going to
be doing that for the next month or so
depending upon how interesting it is and
then after that word then we're going to
head off to the base of Mount sharp and
head toward here for the for the rest of
the expedition which will be happening
in in less than a year and with that I'd
any questions I'm happy to answer yeah
what smell charm problem by the impact
of created the crater and why would
it have layers it's anybody yeah so so
excellent question because most craters
that you see a central peak and the peak
is is formed by the rebound of the
impact this is not the case it is a
little bit of a mystery how you got a
mound that size and the crater so one of
the clues that it's not a rebound mound
is that Mount sharp is actually higher
than the rim of the crater these let's
say the the favorite running theory is
Craig was formed it was completely
buried and then later on it was exuding
except for the central mound stayed
there so it's kind of zoomed in a
washing machine kind of mode where when
scoured out the moat around the mountain
and so what we're seeing the layering
and Mount sharp is in fact luring left
over that was crater wide seems
fantastic but we're dealing with you
know three billion years of history it's
not too unusual I'm the Grand Canyon is
about 1.8 miles deep and that has two
billion years of history of the American
continent so we're hoping that Mount
sharp with its layering will have a
similar record 2020 Rover that you're
sending up yeah um so you said that you
have a so to speak of geochemists and a
geologists on Mars what's the plan for
that Rover which to me it's
goal if I remember right it has a really
really long mission time compared to the
previous ones a lot of time yeah the
Mars exploration Rovers had a 90-day
design lifetime and you know one lasted
seven and a half years an opportunity
still going and it's about to hit nine
years in january curiosity has a two
year design life I'm one Mars year
actually so the expectation is 24 x 2
years is quite a long time for that
Rover to be running the we think that
the 2020 rover will have a similar
lifetime but we we have to weigh the
potential of using solar panels versus
radio isotope thermal electric
generators and so that has a real is a
big variable in terms of what the
expected lifetime would be because solar
panels will dust up wear out and at some
point in time you get lucky we're
unlucky where you don't have enough
energy to continue we are forming a
science definition team to to tell us
what the real the actual objectives of
the mission would be but it's certainly
along the lines of not only looking for
a place that could have supported life
but also looking for evidence that of
what may have been there what may
preserve evidence of life so we fully
expect that it should have some organic
capability yeah I was a particle
physicist before I joined Google so I'm
interesting that in the radiation levels
we've seen like two or three spikes on
the way to Mars and
reason and what is the average and the
spike regional on the surface of ice
yeah so I don't know the numbers in
terms of sieverts and that sort of thing
the cause of the spikes are basically
solar particle events whether or not the
coronal mass ejections or s eps whatever
we don't use any connard's let's go yeah
so essentially you know kind of a rule
of thumb and and you know the the
important part is in the details but the
rule of thumb is is that compare an open
space it's about twice what you see on
Space Station because space station is
predicted from by the Van Allen belt it
turns out that on the surface of Mars is
about half of what you see in space so
it is similar to what you may see in
space station and the reason for that is
is just that you have a planet on one
side of you shielding you from half the
galactic cosmic rays this is very simple
thing the atmosphere doesn't seem to do
much for you although I didn't show it
but we've seen a correlation between the
pressure wave that comes across and
actually the amount of radiation hitting
the surface so there is some effect and
it's measurable but it's not it's a
minor effect so um there was some
concern about contamination of the drill
bit because I've got remounted I read an
article about that it so how does that
affect the announcement on Monday ok so
the drill bit contamination was a little
bit of an issue because they when they
made it they quenched in an oil which is
not a real good idea if you're going to
measure organics so they went through a
real process that clean that up and so
we think that whatever contamination is
left is pretty minor there's also come
some concern about
the Teflon bushings that hold the drill
bit during progressive percussive
drilling and but they can characterize
that it's not a problem the announcement
of what information we got from Sam has
nothing to do at the drill bit because
we haven't used the drill yet so all of
that is from the scoop itself and so
that's why that's part of the reason why
the amount of carbon that ends up being
reacting with the perchlorate and
showing up in the gas chromatograph is
we think is carbon actually coming from
something else like carbonate coming off
or any other carbon in the system but
not low molecular weight carbon that may
actually be in the soil or as a
contaminant so we don't think it's
coming from earth itself except for
maybe some of the slight derivatives
ation product that we're carrying with
us so yeah the drill is something to
come and where we hope to start doing
that before the Christmas holidays
thanks for coming just just totally
delight to me what was the inspiration
and motivation for the audacious skyhook
and just my morbid curiosity what was
the escape strategy once the curiosity
of touchdown so yeah I mean
interestingly enough there's there are
components to this whole system that
have been used before so for instance
the bridle and the idea of lowering your
payload down beneath retrorockets they
actually did that on the Mars
exploration Rovers where they had record
retro rockets attached to the parent you
know underneath the parachute and they
lowered the airbag system before they
actually inflated the air bags and
dropped it so interestingly enough they
had a bridle concept that they'd already
tested on Mars so wasn't totally insane
to go go that pathway it turns out what
was the driving factor is every single
time they came up with the design where
the spacecraft would land with the
Rockets underneath them
they ended up with a huge problem with
rocket plume interaction with the
surface it gets extremely unstable and
any slight variations caused a major
perturbation and exactly how to hand and
the way it has been handled in the past
is you actually turn off the Rockets
before you touch down which has its own
risk so because of that you then you
need two things you need you need legs
to land on because you need some kind of
you know shock system and then also once
you land you have to get your Rover from
the platform down to the surface so now
you need ramps and that sort of thing
and they kept on running into just this
beam on the surface and getting the
rover down was going to add you know
several hundred kilograms in terms of
mass and and somebody came up with hey
you know well if we just lower the rover
and have it land on the wheels we don't
have to add legs and we don't have to
add a ramp and so that was the real
motivator and seve saving several
hundred kilograms in terms of what the
landed payload is that you can put on
the surface the exit strategy for the
retrorockets was as a system comes down
it knows how much thrust that's using to
keep a steady descent toward the ground
at some point time when the rover
touches the surface all of a sudden your
motion sensor and the amount of threats
are using you go hey I weigh half as
much as I used to a second ago and so as
soon as that's recognized the bridles
cut the retrorockets keep on they go
full throttle and it just flies off and
the only real control of it after that
time is in fact just fly away there's
all the brains are on the rover
I just curious manatee
well curiosity yeah so one of the great
things about having the Mars exploration
Rovers lasts for an extended period of
time is that you got to upgrade the
software you got to do more experiments
in terms of mobility and so one of the
things that it's instituted on this
mission that is kind of interesting is
what's called visual odometry so the
system itself can look around and
recognize its environment and go well I
must have traveled ten meters and and so
that's an improvement in terms of
knowing exactly how far went and that
sort of thing they've also instituted a
little more cautious approach to
understanding wheel slip and and that
was actually one of the real problems
that got spirit into trouble was it when
it didn't go anywhere and kept on trying
to go somewhere really dug itself into
the into the small crater that it was in
recent news of the water ice on Mercury
affect the future of Mars machines
actually in a weird way I think it might
add a little greater understanding in
terms of the subtleties of exploring
another plan and what does it really
tell you it wasn't the water on Mercury
that well that's a big surprise and
that's really interesting but also the
announcement that they're sort organics
associated with the ice that is
particularly interesting and what that
does is help highlight the fact that one
of the big mysteries on Mars is not is
that we didn't find organics yet really
on the surface because there should be
organics just from raining down from
space from chondritic chondrites and
that sort of thing so there the what
that does it highlights that there
should be organics on the surface of
Mars and our thought is if it weren't
for such a high radiation environment on
the surface the ice on Mercury is
shadowed by a crater and
and the organics themselves are shadowed
by a crater too so there's that's why
they're still there and haven't been
kind of vaporized away so in the roadmap
that you showed you said the robotic
missions in 2020 of those a defect
potential human exploration maybe we
Google glasses with future technology in
terms of land inside whatnot yeah
interesting one of the things that we'd
like to do as an agency is better
coordinate our future exploration and
having the science and human exploration
work cooperatively toward hopefully for
Mars actually and so the the president
had suggested that we be well say that
we should be getting to Mars in the
2030s and I think by exploring the
planet this way robotically as we set
things up and do some measurements that
help reduce the risk for humans to go
that as we go further along that line I
think will improve the capabilities and
potential / humans to go to Mars the
radiation experiment is a great example
of we are doing something that will will
be extremely useful for human
exploration when they go to the red
planet I think I answered your question
curiosity's robot arm function on earth
or is it designed specifically for low
gravity heart so curiosities arm can it
function on earth yeah I think it can
but be but in a low-gravity environment
and also the wide temperature regime
that we see on Mars you can test things
out here on earth but you're not going
to know exactly how it behaves until you
get there and then do some tests outs
and waypoints and Mark how everything is
operating you might have noticed on some
of the images there's some targets that
look kind of like you know nuclear
Regulation Regulatory Commission symbols
and what those are actually targets so
that when you move the arm around you
can you can find out where exactly it
goes with the set commands and you can
then get more used to have the arm
behaves and and improve the efficiency
of when you're doing sampling that sort
of thing I suspect they couldn't
actually move the arm full length with
the full instrumentation on the end of
it on earth and earth gravity in general
not so much related to NASA why do you
think about the Mars one project that my
still send humans to Mars beats like
sometimes around 20 24 great no I you
know this is one of these things where a
government agency by its very nature has
to be conservative and what we can do in
the commercial sector is great and you
know I they have a very interesting and
clever engineers and then I think they
have a reasonable shot I mean it's
realistic and what about the fact that
it's a one-way trip for humans to Mars
well you know there's there's a list of
people I'd want to send on that trip
but you know and interesting enough I
know if any number of people who be
would who would volunteer for that so
the NASA is not in the business of
creating heroes and so would never
consider a mission that was only one way
but in the commercial sector you can do
that and it certainly makes it a lot
easier except for the person that goes
did you walk us through a typical day in
life the rover how many experiments you
can run how far the traveling Oh
actually that's a that's one of the real
learning experiences of being on the
mission is how painfully slow everything
is so one I think everybody here
realizes that you can't joystick the
rover you can't drive it like this you
have a time variance any anywhere from
eight to forty minutes depending upon
where Earth and Mars are in reference to
each other so the way a day works is a
orbiter pass goes by in the morning
quotes in the morning and when we get
that data back is when the day starts so
we now have a data dump of what the
rover did the previous day the team
meets they look at the the data see what
happened did the rover do what it was
supposed to do did the measurements work
was there something exciting that the
rover just discovered well the rover
didn't discover it but you know data
that took that got everybody excited so
then the rest of the time and basically
morning and mid-afternoon is ok let's
say it the rover did was supposed to do
so now you build your sequences what
sequence of measurements you want to do
you want the rover to Rove you need to
bump up against a rock and take a
measurement there you plan out what is
going to happen sequences get built and
basically by late day evening they get
sent to Mars and
they get downloaded on the rover and the
rover by now is ready to start a new day
and it gets his instructions to what to
do what you can do in anyone's all
increases with time as you get more
comfortable with how many things can you
do at the same time without breaking
something initially whenever we did one
it we did an instrument for the first
time essentially we would just do that
instrument make it you know make it easy
reduce the number of factors that could
have caused it to you know to reset or
that sort of thing but we've gotten to
the point now where for instance the
weather and the rad instrument and the
Dan instrument now run is kind of
background routine so there's not a
there might be some commanding because
you want something special from them but
in general they're done every day it's a
routine measurement you can go on to a
webpage and get the marg weather for the
day type of thing so we adjusted to that
running for instance Sam which is
probably the most complicated instrument
that actually has to run overnight and
so we if you're going to do a Sam
experiment that you know that's all
that's the only thing you're going to do
not only because it length of time it
takes to run but the other part is it
uses up a fair amount of energy you have
to heat up your piping and that sort of
thing heat up the sample because you're
doing a bald gas analysis so essentially
if you're doing that you don't have
enough energy to do much else other than
to being back the data that sort of
thing chemcam is now gotten come from
enough that it can shoot several targets
in a day as opposed to just one the
mastcam is it it actually has a very
interesting feature it has so much
memory that we figured out the best way
to use it is when you get someplace new
in order a different perspective go
ahead and shoot an entire panorama keep
everything on board send back thumbnails
of the images that you took
and then when you go through the
thumbnails you go oh that that's really
interesting let's look at that then you
ask the spacecraft to send back the full
resolution image so there in general we
are able to do now probably you know a
couple of instruments at the same time
except for maybe the ones that you use a
fair amount of energy just to get it put
it in perspective the RTG is producing
about 110 watts so that's each you know
that's the amount of power you have it
in you know each hour type of thing and
so you have to manage it so that you
don't reduce the battery power by more
than forty percent
at sybase what will continue after let's
thank now Michael and we can get around
