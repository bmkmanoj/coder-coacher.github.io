Dawkins community I'm very happy to
introduce the second keynote
presentation of this conference and Vera
p to introduce mark davis and and look
staff who will speak about
internationalization problems and at
Google so mark is a very well-known
person who who was one of the concept of
Unicode so he has a very deep
understanding of these problems and
we're very proud to to see you here
today and yuka has a done his TD at
sanford on our nice walking also also in
google at Google for these problems i
would say that we are very interesting
in your presentation and and working at
unicode give you a lot of competence and
specifically for your work also in how
to represent languages in documents and
xml documents and HTML documents and you
have worked on so many companies there
from april to either an unknown google
so you are the right person sir so let's
uh sir
alright thanks very much Cecilia it's
also in order to work with with mark I'm
going to be giving a brief introduction
to Google Plus internationalization so
Google Plus is a new product that we
came out with a couple months ago and
had a lot of not all of them unique but
many of them interesting
internationalization problems many of
which were solved some of which are
still ahead of us so first what exactly
is it it's basically a social network
but it's also a platform designed to
make it easier to share things with
other people and establish your online
identity so it has certain key features
the main one being circles that you can
control what you share people with so
you control you know what you share with
whom there's a feature called hangouts
which is basically a multi-user chat and
video conference feature where you can
have up to 10 people doing video chat
with each other and look at youtube
videos together and as of yesterday
there's broadcasting there's Google Docs
sharing that sort of thing and actually
you know I'm just going to skip this and
go straight to the demo because it's
better to just see how some of this
stuff works so so basically it's the
main interface is sort of a stream where
you can see right now bride Horowitz is
talking with a bunch of people online
right now a bunch of people have shared
a bunch of things either directly to me
or just with the public and I'm
following them so it allows both the
intimate sharing model as well as sort
of a twitter-like broadcast model all in
one in one product so and the way it
does that is using circles so i could
say maybe create a circle right now that
I can call da kenj so I can sort of lump
together people that I meet here so I'm
going to scroll this up to the top so
it's easier to sing right so you know so
for example I know that mark is here so
i can add him and then let's say that
I'm looking for more people well as of
just yesterday we launched a feature
where you can search not only all the
people but all the posts so I can notice
that Oh Kevin marks is here and I can
add them to that new circle that I just
created
inge so now I can follow whatever Kevin
marks decides to either share with me or
in this particular case it's a public
post sort of like a tweet so so how does
internationalisation fit in well this is
the first google product we're proud to
say from the first day of its launch
supported 44 different languages so i
can very easily i'm just going to use
the the debugging flag here so now right
now all my interface obviously Kevin's
post is still in English but the rest of
my interface is all in French here yeah
it also works in right-to-left languages
as well this we're particularly proud of
with a full RTL layout where it's
properly mirrored there's a few few
minor bugs we're still working out but
but mostly it works pretty well
including if i start typing in a
left-to-right a language it'll start it
will automatically shift over the the
context of the share box that's just a
brief introduction so you have an idea
what we're talking about so it has a lot
of the same problems as other social
networks do and other web apps so what
are some of the week all sort of
bloopers things that we had problems
with especially early on so this is a
page this is the very first dialog box
the user ever sees when they first sign
up when the interface is set to Japanese
so does anyone notice a problem about
ninety percent of the text is in English
right so this this string as it turned
out was untranslated because it was
never it was basically hard-coded in the
well it wasn't actually hard-coded but
it wasn't properly extracted basically
into our translation database for
translation and it wasn't discovered
until right before the launch so sort of
the lesson learned is and the reason why
it wasn't discovered is because you
would only see this screen if your first
signing up well all the Googlers that
we're testing this had already signed up
so they weren't testing this this new
dialog box that just got added so sort
of the lesson learned is to make sure
you check not just corner cases but you
know you suck things like signup flows
things that users would only go through
once in various languages there were
also a few others
related things with rtl languages that
needed checking that were early on in
the signup flow so this is another thing
that was on our initial marketing page
is anyone speak Turkish here or do you
notice any problems yeah the characters
aren't right and it's it's actually it's
a it's a unicode encoding problem which
was particularly embarrassing for us
because mark is like the world expert on
on unicode well it turns out it wasn't
google technology with someone used some
image editing software i know if it was
photoshop or illustrator or something
that didn't properly handle unicode
correctly and so when they created these
marketing photos the text got garbled so
a this was a screenshot from Twitter a
blogger actually caught it before we did
so the lesson learned here is
particularly when you're dealing with
images to sort of double check because a
lot of the image editing programs out
there don't properly encode things as
well as say that Google sweet does you
know in general the google docs do a
pretty good job with unicode but
whatever i'm not sure which image
processing software we use for this but
it garbled in all right another problem
we had with rtl languages this is
probably a lesson that yahoo learned
many years ago that we had to relearn if
your brand starts or ends in punctuation
like +1 or google+ it has particular
pitfalls for right-to-left languages so
since the plus is interpreted as
punctuation which would come after the
LTR google when we type in google plus
it shows up as plus google and this is
the hebrew layout but it was similar in
arabic and persian so we had to do
various things to try and fix it one of
the things we tried and failed to do was
at a left-right marker which it turned
out one of our templates just escaped as
lrm so for a day we were showing an
escape character which made it even
worse so just there's particular
pitfalls for punctuation at the
beginning around this was from about a
week after launch anyone here speak
Chinese this is tradition you notice
anything about this this is the gender
selector
yeah it says choose your gender female
or other yeah so a lot of people were
like well which I don't get you know so
and what had happened it was a minor
glitch in our translation database were
the the translation for traditional
Chinese for male was accidentally
deleted and the lesson learned here is
having a good system for user feedback
we have something we call Google
feedback that's integrated is baked into
a lot of Google products but especially
Google+ that makes it really easy for
users to report bugs and we very quickly
as soon as this error happened I'd say
within hours we had almost a hundred
feedback messages with people saying
what am I other and thus we were able to
quickly change it in a few hours
basically you know it was a little bit
embarrassing but it could have been much
more embarrassing figure gone on catch
so this is another thing that wasn't
embarrassing at first this is my friend
Erica and you notice that we clearly
know that she's female but it says erica
has not filled out their profile yet so
we had a number of users including on
that feedback engine my favorite
feedback was began with I'm sorry but
I'm an English teacher and it went on
from there complaining about their
referring to Erica so one is that it's
somewhat unstandardized use there in the
singular but in particular if you know
someone's gender you want to use the
appropriate pronoun which in English
would be Erica's not filled out her
profile yet so that's now been fixed and
Mark will get into a little bit of how
we fix that because there's some
interesting ap is that we developed to
help fix that there's more complicated
problems involving numbers as well so
this is one problem that we solve where
we said okay Vic Gundotra hung out with
10 people and then this is my friend
Josh who's very lonely he just hung out
with himself so you see that's 10 people
but one person so it's a properly
inflected for English but it turns out
that many other languages are not as
simple as English where you can either
say equals 1 then it would be person and
if it's anything other than one that its
people for example in Russian the
translation for Vic Gundotra hang out
with 10 people is this messy 10 it's
basically pusson like we have to kind of
abbreviate it because the ending
Russian depends on what the number is
before there's several different endings
that can you can have and again mark
will get into how we how we solve that
particular problem there's a similar
problem in other languages like French
where adjectives can reflect based on
the gender so here again it's clear that
we know that Vic Gundotra is a male or
he's revealed that online however it
looks like he has a you know gender
identity problem here where we're not
sure if he's he's male and married or
female and married right so a similar
kind of problem there oops so now I'm
going to pass it off to mark who's going
to talk about some of the core
technologies in particular how we solve
that gender and plural problem
thanks Luke and one thing I want to
point out is Luke joined us just around
january so but has been instrumental in
pulling all of these things together
he's the PM for the google
internationalisation google+
internationalisation so he's done a
great job what I'm going to talk about
is a little bit of the technical
foundation behind this and then Luke's
going to come on a little bit more and
talk about another piece of it so the in
terms of internationalisation we use
kind of the same foundation that we use
in other Google products so we're using
Unicode every place for all of the text
data that we have we are using core
internationalisation libraries depending
upon for dates times numbers sorting etc
and this depends on some common open
source projects like CLD r which is the
Unicode locale data repository and I see
you which is a very prominent
internationalisation library and we're
using our localization process which
involves translation memory and
management and so translators feeding in
and out and Luke will talk a little bit
more about that this is pretty standard
for google so we didn't have to do a lot
here and most of the Google engineers
are very let's see sort of brought into
the process of making sure that we cover
all of these languages because our
standard policy is to have at least 40
languages for products so what I'm going
to talk about our some of the things
that we're a little bit different that
we did for Google+ and so these include
plurals and genders you just saw about
that the universal language settings
which Luke is going to talk about in
more detail name checking the alphabetic
index the integrated translate pseudo
localization and continuous localization
so let's talk a little bit about a
fairly easy one index letters
what we do is and I think we don't have
a demo here but if you go there's a link
we can show you which which shows the
use of this in google plus it turns out
it's not trivial to figure out exactly
which letters a language uses in an
index an index something where you put
up a bunch of letters to the top you
click on one and you jump to a bucket
and these vary across languages you see
some things like the CH and Slovak sorts
as if it's a letter and items will be
grouped under it rather than under C for
japanese chinese and korean those
present their own particular problems
there are a couple of different major
orders for Chinese and you don't
actually show the characters that go
into a first character that goes into
that bucket as the name of the bucket
for Chinese and then with Japanese even
though you have a kanji character you
actually will bucket it under the
corresponding kana character so these
all present some difficulties that we
had to work through name-checking turns
out the interesting and one of the if
you have followed google+ at all you
know there's been a certain amount of
controversy about the Google name policy
we're not talking particularly about the
policy but about some of the features to
separate out some of the the chaff in
people's names and those include trying
to trying to make sure that we are using
common names that people use and that
we're excluding kind of overly fanciful
characters you see someone's over on on
this side of the screen there's mark
with a Cyrillic a we wanted to make sure
that people weren't mixing scripts that
could be used in spoofing there are
decorated characters in Unicode like
ones with circles around them and so on
there are very fanciful characters which
are symbols in this case I think this is
like that M is really an alchemical
symbol and then the upside down a
is is a math symbol and then you get the
are for prescription and then the K is
some other special symbols so we see
these a lot we also see people with sort
of spurious spellings lots of characters
in a row or that they use combining
marks in a way that actually combining
marks in a good display will stack up
words kind of indefinitely and we've
seen cases where people will stack like
50 combining marks and you get weird you
I interactions because this name
actually goes up and down like that so
some of the techniques that we used are
listed here I'm not going to go into
them in detail but the main goal is to
kind of separate out some of these more
fanciful uses of characters now the
plural problem Luke gave a little bit an
example of some of the kinds of problems
we see you have one emails everybody is
seeing something like this the problem
is we're a placeholder changes another
part of the sentence and so the old
workaround for this is to present it
like a form style like you'd see if you
were filling out a form when you're
taking an airplane and coming in you
have low form and says number of emails
and you you've got a box and people are
used to kind of that formulation and
avoiding the plural issue in that case
but it's very clunky and ugly and
especially in a social context we wanted
to have much much more natural language
so what we really want is to fix this
and the other problem is an LS added
three person to his circles we also need
to change placeholders in response to
gender so we add an API that handles a
certain class important class of these
things so it handles the the gender so
that you can a parallel translation of
messages for gender and plural it
handles the complex plural rules and
I'll talk
briefly about that and it handles the
personal gender rules now what it
doesn't do is handle gender of objects
so in German for example a girl is
neuter and a gas station is feminine
okay don't ask me why but that's that's
the way it works and these kinds of
things we don't handle it turns out to
be very difficult because you have to
look upwards determine what the
grammatical category is the category can
change wildly occurring two languages
because language is organized the world
in different ways and then unit would
need to inflict the thing according to
where it is in the sentence and how it's
being used in the rules from inflections
in the categories are exceedingly
complex so we don't do all of that so
here's an example from a Serbian for
example Maya opposed valla Rocha and
then latosha pose fo my you so Maya and
Rocha are both changing depending upon
which one I'm using where and these are
just the personal names so we're not
handling that as part of this package I
said that the plural rules are
complicated here's an example from
English and Ukrainian English most
people in this room will understand and
know the rules for it's fairly simple it
turns out English ordinals or some of
the more complicated ones but for normal
pearls it's very simple Ukrainian gets
more complicated because it behaves kind
of like English ordinals I say first
second third and then I get up to 11th
so I skip 11 for the st form but then i
go to 21 the slavic languages work very
much like this so i use a plural form
that goes with one skips 11 goes to 21
31 41 etc and then I have another plural
form in a lot of these for the two case
and another plural form for a few case
in another plural form for the rest of
them so this gets complicated
cated arabic is our worst one Arabic we
have six different forms of the plurals
here's a chart from the unicode site
which shows the different forms and
you're not expected to read this there's
not a test but it just gives you an
impression of how many ways in which
languages can do different kinds of
plurals and it's complicated so what the
translator actually sees the the
developer will put in something simple
like he will put in as the zero case the
one case in a plural case we always use
the zero case even though in many
languages is not separated formally
according to the grammar but often you
still want to rephrase it so you want to
say you have one friend or you have no
friends which is kind of sad but you you
want to phrase it in a different way so
you have the equivalent of you have no
friends or you have no circles so in
serving what the Serbian translator sees
is we take the English messages and we
fold them out into all of the cases for
Serbian and then the Serbian speaker
will translate each of those messages
same for Arabic Russian and so on
genders we have three genders and that's
not just because we're in the Bay Area
we have three genders because there's
always an other case where we don't know
your gender you didn't you decided not
do you decline to fill it in or you
didn't want to expose for privacy
purposes or it's a person that we don't
have that system we don't have your
profile we have an email from you but we
don't have any other information so
others used for all of those cases now
what turned out to be kind of an
interesting problem was to get the
developers to recognize when they needed
to use gender
and it's fairly clear if I'm saying John
did X okay that we need gender that
fairly clear check out her profile so if
you see pronouns like his her there
often times there is used to avoid a
gender in in English as we saw earlier
it turns out the users anytime you
mentioned the user then you need to put
it in but there are a lot of cases where
it's indirect so if I say welcome
welcome to google plus if you're if you
are male then I'm going to use a
different word in Italian than if you're
female so these are cases these indirect
cases are actually kind of the trickiest
and they involve a lot of education of
the developers to say look you know even
though this doesn't require gender in
English it does require gender in some
of the language that we use so go ahead
and use this API in order to deal with
this and then as Luke talked about we
also have the problem with adjectives
and so forth so any terms like you are a
participant in French you'll get Andy
you're not being upon whether it's
feminine and so forth so the we ended up
having to support this in C++ Java
JavaScript quit and enclosure templates
and then it's also supported as part of
the open-source ICU effort and it's used
throughout Google this this is from
search we do not have all of the
locations in all of the products having
gender and plural we're slowly
identifying them and prioritizing them
so that people can introduce this into
their api's I mean into their user
interfaces so we're now going to talk
about universal language settings and
her back over to Luke thank you Mark so
this is a project that we've been
account a little bit before Google+ but
Google+ is where we finally implemented
a Google as you know has a lot of
different products a lot of different
web apps and over the years
unfortunately there's been different
language settings for different products
so just to take for example the ones
that we give to enterprise you know if
you sign up for google enterprise
applications and you're an English
speaker in Switzerland say like many of
our colleagues that work in the Zurich
office then you find that you have to
set your language preferences for Gmail
and then calendar and then Docs and then
groups each one of these has a separate
language preference so we knew that that
was frustrating for many of our users it
was also the case that each of them only
let you select one language whereas in
some cases maybe gmail works in say an
indica language but maybe Doc's does not
so how do you you know so if we were to
unify them how would we set it up so
that you could get gmail and your
preferred language but then Doc's you
know maybe you would default to English
or some other second choice language the
other thing is that each of these
products also has somewhat inconsistent
ways in which they resolve the language
by that we mean figure out which you I
language to present the user so our
solution that we came out within Google+
and we're slowly integrating into other
products is to allow ranked language
preference list so as you can see here
this particular user has u.s. English as
their first choice language and then
Italian and then French so what's the
advantage to this so one is that if your
first choice language is a relatively
small language that's not supported in
all products then we can show you that
language in those products that do
support it and then if not then will
default to your second or third choice
the other thing this allows us to do is
to be smart about what content we show
the users so we might for example if
this for this particular user we might
not automatically translate Italian and
French websites right because if they
already speak Italian and French then
they probably don't want to keep having
to dismiss do you want this translator
there no I speak those or maybe
when we show them certain search results
we would rank those search results in
these languages higher because we know
the user speaks those languages so what
signals do we use so we have what we
call that a child parameters mostly an
internal tool used for testing but it's
sort of as a override there's the
explicit user preferences that we
mentioned before that are stored in the
cloud there's the browsers except
language that comes across in the end
the HTTP header and I'll talk a little
bit more about that in a second there's
the browsers you I language there's
whatever the primary language is for the
given domain and then finally there's
geolocation of the users IP address so
one sort of controversial thing which
this is a mean that somebody made
internally is that Google does not honor
the accept language header if it's only
English so in other words if you have
anything other than English or you have
English and something else then it sits
in accordance with this list here but we
skip over the accept language if it's
just English and to explain why that is
it's basically sort of a utilitarian
philosophy is that we did some some
number crunching and found that although
there's many english-speaking users that
find that frustrating as they say damn
it I've set my except languages to
English you should respect that that
there's a large number of users around
the world who have their accept language
set to English but who clearly do not
speak English like there's I think a
huge population especially in Southeast
Asia that for whatever reason have their
browsers incorrectly set so and those
and particularly cuz a lot of these
users are sort of emerging markets users
they're using this web cafes and stuff
like that where they don't have full
control it would be particularly painful
if we were to switch all those users to
English whereas it's sort of a minor
inconvenience for the english-speaking
traveler who is usually the one that
gets affected that being said we
recognize that this is a pain point and
part of the universal language settings
is at least making sure that anyone
that's logged in should have their their
cloud based settings respected which we
don't currently do a good job of so
that's that one of the innovations we
did with Google+ another one had to do
with our local is a
process so this is your again like the
earlier slide mark showed you this is
not an eye test you're not expected to
actually read this but this is one
person's representation of what our
process used to be with 17 separate
steps where different people would Ford
things on in some cases it was you know
people with Harvard degrees that whose
whole job it was to you know move things
from one folder to another all day it
was very manual and sort of clunky
whereas we've changed it to be what we
call continuous localization which is as
a developer checks in a string into our
database it's automatically updated
updated to a tool called google
translator toolkit which is actually
available externally as well which syncs
up with google translate so it's machine
ated translation as those strings get
checked in they automatically get sent
to translators around the world who then
translate them and then those get
re-imported into the product on a daily
basis so we're able to very quickly turn
around translations often within as
little as a day or two in a process that
used to take several weeks maybe so
that's part of how we were able to
launch it in 44 languages and do so from
day one because of that much quicker
process another thing that helped is
suit a localization which I'm sure many
of you are familiar with this is where
we take an original English string and
we make some transformations to it to
make it look like another language so
the the one on the right for example is
adding a bunch of diacritics so that we
can verify that whatever code is
involved handles Unicode properly and it
also expands the string because you know
those of you that know that you know the
okay is two characters in English but
maybe in German at 17 characters so by
expanding it we can make sure that the
you I can handle longer strings for
certain languages and then on the left
we have what we call fake by die so this
is a simulation of a right-to-left
language where everything so it's
basically English just spelled out
backwards so that way we can check all
of our right to left layouts and it's
easy for an english-speaking developer
to see where there's errors you know you
don't have to speak Arabic or Hebrew or
something and or
to test your layouts with that so it's a
it takes a little getting used to to
read it but you you know most English
speakers can kind of you know figure it
out well enough to be able to catch bugs
so these are both invaluable tools for
for debugging and troubleshooting and
now we'll bring mark back up and we'll
do some Q&amp;amp;A oops I keep stumbling over
there so does anyone have any questions
no questions at all
okay you mentioned that yeah you have
this whole library for doing
translations and everything but it
wasn't clear for me it was an effort to
educate developers or do you actually
have a better system of storing strings
so that you can translate them
automatically okay yeah the let me flesh
out a little bit of what happens so the
developer produces a file that contains
some strings we actually support a wide
variety of different formats for those
strings to be in in they can be
extracted directly from templating
systems they can be in separate XML
files they can be in separate Java
property files and so forth the
extraction process takes wherever those
are checked in extracts them into a
common XML format and then the XML
format goes through the entire process
that that you saw Luke give and it will
go in and then come out the other end we
get some more XML that is in the
particular languages that we're dealing
with then those get unex tracted back
into source that corresponds to whatever
the developer originally had so you
might get another Java property file is
that does that make sense okay
I have one question you say that your
your API button gender management has
been quite recently done in fact and now
is a used by different products of
Google how does has been done because as
it it'd be difficult to to insert such a
new functions inside the existing
product so was it was it was it easy um
it was it was not a Lucas smiley no it
was not trivial it we went through quite
a number of iterations the the API was
actually fairly straightforward to
introduce and so the API for plurals and
gender we made some we made some
additions to it but part of the problem
was getting it adapted into each of the
languages and especially when you're
adapting into a templating language then
you have a lot more work to do because
templin language has its own syntax and
so you have to try to figure out how it
all matches then swear were some of the
other issues some of the other issues
were really educating the translators on
how to deal with this new format and
what to do and how to handle the
different forms and what they meant
making sure that the entire machinery
from start to end didn't hiccups oh this
is a new kind of special syntax and we
needed to make sure that when it went
into the translation process it didn't
cause hiccups that were reflected back
to the user which stop to build because
if I check in some source code and
there's a problem with the translation
that can stop the extraction for all of
the text in that in that file and so we
had to make some changes that allowed it
to only block certain messages where
people had this had syntax problems or
something like that we also had people
by convention every message has a
description and the description is what
really allows the
insulator to make sense the message if I
have a one word message in English like
file then the translator has no idea
does this a file like physical thing
that I'm filing something is it
something I put papers into is it a verb
is it a noun so you have to have a
message that makes sense and spells out
what the translator has to do but then
you we also add an extra marker in that
description that tells us oh and this
message is supposed to be plural so we
better see the plural syntax in it and
then we also look at the syntax and see
well this has the plural syndics in that
we better see the marker in it just as a
double check to make sure that people
don't make mistakes so it actually was
quite a long and involved process do you
want to and I think yeah I guess the the
other piece that mark alluded to a bit
in the talk is just educating developers
on when and where to use it so there's
the cases where English and flex are
more obvious where it's you know cindy
has added you to her circle versus his
circle that's fairly straightforward
it's harder in the cases like the
married case there where you have to
show them hey and in other languages it
makes a difference whether the user is
male or female and although that being
said there are a few Google products
where people started using it before we
even announced it so some people are
very enthusiastic about it so it's
somewhat idiosyncratic which developers
and which products either took more
convincing and more education or who
there's some that just jump right on it
in many cases it's Googlers that are
from that speak many of the languages
that get affected who have been you know
suffering through bad translations all
along who are really happy that finally
we're fixing it so especially the
Russian speakers were just overjoyed
that there's this very clunky
translations are now looking much better
yeah we actually we checked in the code
we've made no no announcements nothing
and we turned around in a couple days
and we found that of three or four
products we're already using it even
though somehow they discovered it was
very curious yeah
internationalisation we're just working
on the text is not enough you've
actually got to work on the structural
layout of the of the displays and that
sort of thing where you can't just leave
it into just the texture ah I said by
dies probably then well yeah the I mean
it in a way you can you can deal with
the whole thing is kind of a
globalization process and we we like a
lot of people break it up into the
internationalisation part and the
localization part and the
internationalisation part is making sure
that the core code handles all of the
languages all of the characters that you
call services in order to do things like
formatted eight instead of throw the
month year and day together with some
punctuation and hope that it works so
part of that is the internationalization
then and then the localization is making
sure that all the strings work we do
there there are definitely in the
localization side there def definitely
constraints by the way that we work we
English as always our source so whatever
can be expressed in English we have to
make sure that the message descriptions
are clear enough even though the English
may be ambiguous we also end up having
to make sure that the the developer
properly uses different messages where
they could have a different translation
different language okay took the file
example and I could have two instances
of file and that that doesn't actually
occur but a bunch of cases do occur
where the developer uses the same
message for in two different contexts
and they need to be have radically
different translations and if the
developer uses the same message the
translator stuck and so we have to go in
and help them to understand how to code
isint angle this stuff so that it can be
handled properly I'm not sure if that
answers your question that I
ultra you should put one section
okay so there's there's a few simple
examples where it's more than the text
so one is this example here with the
pseudo localization is that one of the
internationalisation problems is that
this button here that says start a
hangout should expand or contract to as
necessary with the string so there's
many cases in which developers will just
who just use English and who don't test
using tools like this might just assume
that a button will always be the exact
same number of pixels but then as soon
as you test it with other languages or
pseudo localized languages then you
realize oh I see this has to be dynamic
so that's a simple layout thing when
you're dealing with right-to-left
languages much more complicated because
everything has to be mirrored but I
think you're getting a little bit more
subtle even where you're saying that in
some languages or cultures there might
be sort of bad associations or things
that are more than just text so some of
that has to do with the way we localize
things like icons so it's an old example
but when we give in our talks often is
on Orkut they used to have an ice cube
that meant cool which is funny in
English but like that joke doesn't
really translate very well so they had
to come up with similar icons that meant
cool you know or the equivalent of cool
in other languages or similar things
like in Google+ we had some problems
we're searching for something in with
the traditional Chinese interface
looking for Taiwanese stars sometimes
like mainland stars would show up and it
was sort of like getting that search
algorithm working properly were if
someone was searching in traditional
Chinese most of the search results would
be in traditional Chinese those sort of
things it's a little bit more than just
straight translation and it has to do
with the cultural less significance yeah
I will say that we we do run into these
and have to adjust them in some cases
people have a little bit of the wrong
impression like a lot of people will
bring up well why does the color of
mourning in mourning mourning for death
in some East Asian countries so that you
should avoid it it turns out that's not
really true i mean it may be the color
of mourning but they
use white paper and they have white
screens and so on and we black is the
color of mourning here but we use black
for text and so on so there are many
cases where it's sometimes overblown I'm
not saying you're doing it but it's but
we do have to make pay special attention
icons in some cases there are certain
features that will be enabled or
disabled depending upon the language one
thing that I don't think Luke talked
about was one of the issues we have to
do is whenever you're introducing a new
string it actually has to be under flags
so that we don't show it until we
actually have the translations ready so
that's part of what we do because we are
running people are getting new features
all the time you want to make sure that
you don't see the new feature until the
translations ready in your language
so um it seems like one of the goals of
your effort is it has to do with being
able to manage costs of
internationalizing you you have a you
have a common core that you can use and
no I'm curious so the thing I'm curious
about is it makes sense to me that
Google might choose not to support some
language because it only has 200
speakers in the world right something
like that or only a million instead of
20 million do you but have you reached a
point where technical issues about the
internationalization are essentially not
a relevant cost factor have you been a
have you gotten to a point where you
don't have to worry about like do we not
handle any any right-to-left languages
at all because it's too expensive to
make that shift or are you still are our
technical issues about supporting a new
language still they still hit me once in
a while yeah that's that's a very good
question i'd say just at the very
beginning you talked about the cost
management but part of the reason why we
and so many other companies have adopted
a this this sort of internationalization
vs localization model is that we can
have much much more robust software
there's this old model where you produce
the software here and then throw the
source code over to some lab in japan
and say ok make it make it work in
japanese and we don't do that in any big
modern company doesn't do that because
it's incredibly error-prone you end up
with different SKUs you different
different bugs it's the whole process is
the nightmare both for us and and for
customers so part of is not cost it's
just it's quality as far as the
impediments definitely by dye is a big
issue when we we first introduced a 40
language initiative in Google about
three years ago I think something like
that and we said all the major products
have to handle
40 languages and you saw a huge amount
of effort people really coordinated
around getting this done and you saw a
whole bunch of products go right up to
38 and then they hit this this wall
because for a UI Arabic and Hebrew
represents some significant obstacles
now but once you once you handle those
and you can handle those basically with
the same internationalisation techniques
and we have services that you can call
to wrap the text in a way that works for
all of the rtl languages so I think the
the only major language that language
issue that can cause an impediment would
be like Mongolian which is only written
vertically and that would be a big issue
for us to take on because that would
require a huge amount of work other
language issues when you talk about
search for example some of the big
issues are how do you how do you segment
so we need to put into place processes
for dividing up text into words so that
you can uniformly search them and we
haven't done that for a couple of
languages for I think Khmer and Myanmar
Burmese but it's a matter of putting
together sorry the resources to do that
I mean to fit it's it's fairly
significant amount of resources to do
that to do that segmentation and then
synonyms are big issue how to determine
whether two terms which could be just
inflected forms the same word really
represent the same thing and that's
that's actually those are very tricky
research ish problems we've had a lot of
success with Google Translate which
takes kind of brute force approach to
translation and for that the main
impediment is having lots and lots of
bilingual documents I mean facing pages
so if you look at Google Translate I
think we have about
five languages and it's basically
limited by the number of instances of
good bilingual text if there's a large
corpus of good bilingual text than we
can translate from Myanmar to Tamil and
if there isn't then we can't Thanks yeah
actually your last comment relates back
to something I was going to ask you
about earlier for your particular work
I'm all right in thinking you you really
don't take any knowledge of grammar into
account at all I mean one way to tackle
the question about gender of nouns will
be just to say well it's a huge problem
over all languages but it is finite and
I don't know why its lateral but it is
lots are below but it's dead too short
ever in German but on the other hand you
could say well you know your example
about girl was it dust nation the reason
it's neuter is because it's a diminutive
is he made matron do you feel that the
rules don't buy you an awful lot because
there's too many exceptions or it
becomes too complicated you seem to be
saying that the whole google translate
is very much a statistically driven
thing you know whenever I say that it
seems to generate that with probability
0 point nine nine so that's what we'll
do yeah um well we're not we're not part
of the translate team so we can't really
speak for them and I'm sure they've
talked about it in other venues but
basically it does it it uses the ability
to analyze pieces of corresponding
bilingual text in order to get to avoid
the problem of coming up with and
analyzing a language model and people
have been doing had been doing that for
30 years and it turns out to be
extraordinarily expensive and
time-consuming and difficult and
problematic and it turns out that you
get a huge amount of value I mean we we
could not support the range of languages
that we have in google translate if
every time we had to do a new language
we had to develop this incredibly
complicated language model in order to
support it it just it would not scale
any more question
