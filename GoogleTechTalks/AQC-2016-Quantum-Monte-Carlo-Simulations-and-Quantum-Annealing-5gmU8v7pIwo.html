GUGLIELMO MAZZOLA: I would
like to thank the organizers
for this possibility, and
I'm Guglielmo Mazzola,
from ETH [INAUDIBLE] group.
And a lot of things
that I will present
will be actually done in
collaboration with the Google
group, both here in
America and in Zurich.
And also with Zhang Jiang,
who will present tomorrow.
So since the title of my
talk is quite generic,
let me just drop a
couple of slides,
in order to
understand the problem
that I would like to tackle.
So we saw, in the previous
talk, that a multi-speed quantum
tunnel is a valuable resource
for quantum annealing.
But it's also true that quantum
tunneling is happening now,
in nature.
It's also happening now, in
this room, as it was recently
discovered to be an important
tool for [? unimportant ?]
things that [INAUDIBLE], water.
So the idea is that as we borrow
quantum tunneling from nature
into quantum annealing,
we would also
like to use the same
numerical tool that
are used in [INAUDIBLE] to
investigate these phenomena.
So among all these tools,
quantum Monte Carlo
is one of the preferred
for a many-body correlated
simulation, because
in some cases,
like this, ultracold
bose gases, it
can provide an
approximation-free methods
and then completely
match the experiment.
Now, we know that--
I will explain also
that quantum Monte Carlo
deals with the equilibrium
property, at most.
So you can compute density,
energies, correlation function.
Instead, here in the
quantum annealing business,
we deal with the efficiency.
So our observable is runtime
of the quantum annealer.
So here, we want to make
sure they're on time.
So if we put a quantum
Monte Carlo algorithm
into a classical computer,
how does the runtime
of the algorithm scale with
the complexity of the problem?
We know that in real
devices, [? they show ?]
a scale as delta minus 2,
where delta is the minimum gap
that we found during
the annealing.
So it does similar things,
also, for quantum Monte Carlo
runtimes.
Notice that I also put a
very old computer here,
because I'm not interested
in the overall speed-up
of the quantum Monte
Carlo to the real machine,
but only in scaling-- so the
scaling with the complexity,
with the system size.
So if a runtime of
quantum Monte Carlo
matches the one of
the quantum annealing,
we could predict, in principle,
the complexity of a problem.
Instead, if this is not true,
then the quantum Monte Carlo
is just a classical device that
quantum annealing should beat.
So in other words,
can we further
extend the [? realm ?] of
obligation of Metropolis Monte
Carlo from calculating
the equilibrium properties
of any substance, like they
claim in the original paper
by Metropolis, also to predict
quantum annealing performances?
And this is the thing that
I'd like to tackle partially
in this talk.
So that line now is this--
I will first provide you
an introduction,
because not everyone is
familiar with
quantum Monte Carlo.
And then I will show some
results from different models.
So let me start.
So first, why do we use
quantum Monte Carlo?
Well, because we cannot directly
solve the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation because
the computation [INAUDIBLE]
for doing this scales
exponentially with the size.
Instead, the quantum Monte
Carlo-- the effort always
scaled linearly with
a number of couplings.
So you can treat
the larger problem,
and this is what
people did in the past.
So they used quantum Monte
Carlo as a representative
of quantum annealing,
when compared
to simulated annealing.
I bet that you are
familiar with this plot.
So what is-- but
in the Monte Carlo,
so the key object is to
determine density, which
is e to the minus beta
H. H is the Hamiltonian,
which is complicated
because we have--
it's the sum of
[INAUDIBLE] operator.
Beta is the inverse
temperature of the system.
But integral, basically,
use two things--
the first is a linguistic
or formal realization that
means that a thermal density
matrix is [INAUDIBLE]
an evolution in imaginary
time of the operator H.
And then the
second, which allows
the computations [INAUDIBLE]
times short-time propagation
is much more simple to compute,
with respect to compare
to the arbitrary
time beta evolution,
because we can use
the [INAUDIBLE].
And then we can
split the exponent,
and now the explanation of
a sum [INAUDIBLE] operator
is still the product
of the exponential,
like the [INAUDIBLE].
So the idea is that to split
the evolution over a period
beta in [INAUDIBLE], and then
the evolution from a state q
to a state q prime
is just the product
or the short-time propagator.
And then we just integrate out
[? the ?] intermediate state,
and then this is where the
term &quot;path integral&quot; comes
from-- the integration over
a possible intermediate state
can be seen as an integration
over a possible trajectory
in imaginary time that connects
the two states, q and q prime.
Clearly, since the [INAUDIBLE]
[? approximation ?]
works in the continuous limit,
the number of these [INAUDIBLE]
infinity, so this becomes
continuous trajectory.
And in the locus of point in the
q space, [? are ?] [INAUDIBLE].
And again, since we know we
want to complete the trace,
so we have to-- the final and
initial state is the same,
this path must close
true to themself.
So again, these are a closed
trajectory in imaginary time.
These are the objects that
the integral transforms.
So then we are basically
done, because if you
want to compute the
partition function, then
we have also to integrate
over the state q.
And then formally, we
have this integral,
which means that the integration
of an intermediate state
means that you integrate
over all possible paths
in that [INAUDIBLE] space.
And then the weight of this
path-- [INAUDIBLE] of this path
is given by the product of the
short-time propagation, which
generic can be written as an
exponential of something which
is called action S, which
is a functional of the path.
So since I like to
be general, I don't
want to specify the action now.
So formally, it can
be written like that.
So at the end, the
partition function
can be written as a sum
over a possible path that
covers the space.
Each of these paths has a
weight, which can be different.
And then again, the
paths are infinite,
but there are paths
that contribute
more to the integral,
which are the ones that
are [? set at the ?] point
of the integral, which,
as characterized in
these conditions,
are to be stationary,
as a function
of the functional derivative.
Clearly, again, this is a
system-dependent functional
that I don't like
to specify now.
So the idea is to compute this
integral with Monte Carlo.
So what you do-- we have
our energy landscape.
So we start our
simulation with a path.
And then Metropolis
tells us that we
have to evolve this
path by proposing
updates [? the ?] formation,
that we can accept
or not with this weight,
which is e to the minus S.
And then again, we
define pseudo-dynamics
in the simulation
time, that they should
sample the partition function.
So now, it's better
to not be confused.
The fact that there
are two times in our
slides, in our
pictures, because there
is the original tau, which
is the imaginary time, which
goes from 0 to beta, and
is the parameter which
labels all the intermediate
states in the path integral.

And this is something that
you can take in account.
And then there is
the time, which
is the simulation time,
which goes from 0 to the time
total of the simulation,
quantum Monte Carlo, which
is [INAUDIBLE] all the
Metropolis step that we
do in our quantum-- in our
Monte Carlo simulation.
Notice that the evolution
of this ring polymer
has nothing to do with the
time-dependent Schrodinger
equation, because it is a
purely classical process.
No?
And then we are free,
basically, to decide
which is [INAUDIBLE] evolution
of this object-- of this ring
polymer.
For example, something
that can be simple to use
is to follow Parisi and then
define a [INAUDIBLE] Langevin
equation as a question
that [? covers ?]
this pseudo-dynamics in which
the rate of modification
of the path is given by
our generalized forces
of the function
derivative of the action,
compared to the path.
And then our [INAUDIBLE], which
is a Gaussian white noise,
which is suitable
for [? equation ?]
[? dissipation ?] condition.
If we plug this equation,
we can simply-- simply,
OK-- it is possible to verify
that the stationary [INAUDIBLE]
distribution is the correct one
that you want to sample again--
so e to the minus S. And
then we can also farther
go with this
classical isomorphism
and then, for example, ask
if our simulation started
with a path in this position.
And then at the end of the
simulation, the path is there.
What is the most probable
pathway-- so sequence
of modification
of our path-- that
will fill this
transition, this process?
Then it is possible to see
the dominant trajectory
in simulation time.
Now if we [INAUDIBLE]
determine this equation, which
is quite complicated
to solve, because there
are an effective potential,
which contains the functional
derivatives of the action,
up to the second order.
Notice that it would be nice
to have this information,
because if we know
which is the most
dominant trajectory for
our pseudo-dynamics,
we could also
understand with that
the typical [INAUDIBLE] rate of
our Metropolis pseudo-dynamics.
But we can still do it, if
the model is much more simpler
but yet general, and the
model is a double well model.
In this model, we can prove
that we can find still,
a priori, the transition
state of this pseudo-dynamics,
and then we can understand which
are the [? delta correlation ?]
time of our pseudo-dynamics.
Let me remember
that our partition
function is a sum of paths.
But only a few paths contributes
most to the integral, which are
the [? other paths, ?] which
are stationary with respect
to the action.
And for a double
well model, there
are essentially-- there's
two kinds of paths
which fulfill this condition.
The first are paths that stays
in the bottom of the well-- so
in the pictorial in this case.
And these are trivial,
so they will only
contribute to the
unperturbed distribution
of each separate way.
And then there is the
path which is non-trivial,
which is called instanton.
And its locus of point is this,
and its shape of the trajectory
is that.
And why it's called
instanton, because it
stays a long time in one
well, in imaginary time,
and then performs a
jump, a kink, and then
stay a lot of time in the
second well, and then go back.
It has to go back because
of the periodic boundary
condition imaginary time,
which are important to sample
from the trace.
So now we claim that-- so we
can argue that this is also
the transition state for the
pseudo-dynamic of our quantum
Monte Carlo pseudo-dynamic
because why?
Because this is
the path-- so this
is the point which
has 0 forces, so it
is the one which is most
statistically relevant, which
is not the trivial path.
And then also, it is the
path that topologically
connects to the two wells.
So we argue that the quantum
Monte Carlo dynamics, in order
to do the transition, must cross
this transition point, which
is [INAUDIBLE] instanton.
And then we can calculate
the statistical weight
of the instanton,
which is like that.
So then we can calculate
the action [INAUDIBLE]
[? directly ?] its
exponent, which
goes like delta square, where
delta is the [INAUDIBLE]
splitting of the double well.
So basically, we have
done-- we have conjectured
because-- let me summarize.
We [INAUDIBLE] integral, we
have a classical field, which
evolves in simulation time.
We can define a suitable
pseudo-dynamics.
In this case, it is
a Langevin equation.
But it does not need to be
exactly a Langevin equation.
It can be, also, a second-order
Langevin equation or also
a [INAUDIBLE]
Metropolis, as long
as the update is a sensible
local deformation of the path.
And then for a
double-well model,
we can a priori identify which
is the transitional state
of this dynamic.
And since we know
the transition state,
we can apply Kramers'
theory, because now this
is a purely classical process,
which lives in a [? stable ?]
potential.
And then Kramers
tells us that the rate
of escape over a barrier is
equal to the statistical weight
of the transition state.
In this case, it
is delta square.
So we argue that the
relaxation time--
so the [INAUDIBLE] time of
QMC for a tunneling problem
will scale as delta
to the minus 2.
And this is what we
numerically will prove now,
because we can pick a
double-well model in 1D.
And then we know the
action looks like that,
and the Hamiltonian is the
same standard, continuous space
Hamiltonian.
And then what you
are going to measure.
So we start our simulation
with the path localized in one
well-- for example, this.
And then we perform
local updates.
We have to wait a
lot, until we observe
the instanton trajectory
for this model, which
looks like that.
So the projection of the
imaginary time [INAUDIBLE]
in 1D should look like that.
So basically, we are waiting
the number of Monte Carlo steps
that we need to perform the
transition from the left well
to the right well.
So we can evaluate this time
for different parameters--
so as a function of the depth
and the width of the barrier.
So we have these experiments--
so numerical experiment points
with Monte Carlo.
And notice also the fact
that the time depends
on the width of the barrier.
It means that although
quantum Monte Carlo deals
with classical pseudo-dynamics,
it mimics correctly
quantum tunneling event,
because the time depends on
with the width of
the barrier also.
And then we can
superimpose to this point
the lines obtained with
delta to the minus 2.
And then it numerically
agrees almost perfectly
the point obtained by numerical
[INAUDIBLE] of the model.
So we numerically prove our
conjecture in this model.
Now, we can also do better.
So since we understood
where this factor
delta to the delta
square comes from,
since in a classical
computer, you
can free to do
whatever you want,
as long as we obtain
something better.
We can even define a
different Markov chain
using a different
object that should
allow the statistical weight
in the transition state.
And this is precisely--
so you can do something,
but the simplest thing is to cut
the periodic-boundary condition
in imaginary time.
And so we argue that since
now the instanton trajectory
with the open-boundary
condition,
instead of pay a
factor of delta square,
we only pay a factor
of delta, because you
have to cross only once the
barrier with our imaginary time
trajectory.
So we can also test,
numerically, this conjecture.
So now the object is this.
So it's not the ring polymer.
It's just a snake with
open-boundary condition.
Notice that this technique
is closely related
to other quantum Monte Carlo
technique [? of projecting, ?]
which are path integral
ground state, diffusion,
or repetition Monte Carlo.
But it is the first
time that it has
been employed in
quantum annealing,
because they didn't care
about auto-correlation time
of the pseudo-dynamics before.
So we can do the same
things with this object
now and measure the tunneling
time of this object.
And now we can see
that, actually, it
tunnels with the scaling, which
goes like one of the delta.
And we can also explain this
deviation for small times.
So now the question
is that, what
are we sampling with this
open-boundary condition also?
Because we are not
sampling any more
the thermal density matrix.
So it is simple to
prove that actually,
in the middle of the snake, we
are sampling from the ground
state density, whereas
in the tail of the snake,
we are sampling only from
the ground state function.
And let's say that the
correct dimensionality
is recovered by knowing
that, in principle, this
should be the mixed distribution
[INAUDIBLE] 0 times [INAUDIBLE]
should restore the
dimensionality.
But in this case,
we [INAUDIBLE],
which should correspond to
path integral ground state
technique, is only
a constant factor.
But OK, probably I
just say too much.
So we can test, also, these
things in the same potential.
I only plotted the right well.
And so we can obtain the
histogram of the position
sample in the middle.
And they numerically agree
with the [INAUDIBLE] square.
And then in the tails,
they numerically
agree only with
the wave function.
And this is why we can get
inside from the [INAUDIBLE]
point of view-- why
this object tunnels
more frequently than the
closed-path counterpart,
because we see that
the ground state
function is less localized,
compared to its square.
So it has a larger statistical
weight inside the barrier.
So this means that the tail's
more free to explore the space,
and then the transition
is driven by the tail.
So first the tail tunnel, and
then all the rest of the snake
follows.
So this is just to see that
if we understand better
the quantum Monte
Carlo pseudo-dynamics,
we can also devise, let's say,
quantum-inspired algorithm that
can obtain some speed-up,
compared to the standard things
that the people did.
Now let me just go back to
a system that is probably
more relevant to
quantum annealing, which
is ferromagnetic Ising system.
Again, this is still
effective double-well model,
because if there
is not [INAUDIBLE],
we can think about that
the left well is just
the spin that just points down.
And the ground state of
the other [INAUDIBLE]
well is the [? spin ?]
pointing up.
If we put a transverse
field and these two mix,
the new ground state is
the symmetric contribution.

And then what we
are going to study--
this is the [INAUDIBLE]
[? path integral. ?] And now,
let me just briefly
say that as long
as-- in the
[? continuous ?] space--
one quantum particle is a ring
polymer of classical particle,
here our quantum spin system
is just mapped into a classical
extended system, with
an additional dimension.
In this system, we can
perform classical Monte Carlo,
so with cluster
updates, local updates.
But this is all
classical, so the picture
that we propose
that should hold is
that now, suppose that
we start our simulation
with all this extend
lattice in the left well.
So for example, all the
replica of the system
are pointing down.
Then we'll perform
classical updates
on this [? standard ?]
system, that it
means that thermal fluctuation
in the [? standard ?]
system mimics quantum
fluctuation in the [INAUDIBLE]
system.
And then we explore the well.
Here I put the replica that
are some large [INAUDIBLE].
Then they stay in the
left well, and then I
claim that sometimes
the instanton trajectory
will be simple, which looks
like that for a spin system.
It means that some
of the replica
completely reversed
the [INAUDIBLE],
compared to the neighbor.
And then, once these
domain walls are formed,
they will just simply diffuse in
imaginary time until they will
[INAUDIBLE] in the
imaginary time.
And at the end, the system will
find itself in the other well.
So this is the
pseudo-dynamic that
should hold in quantum
Monte Carlo for this system.
And then we can still
numerically prove
that this is correct.
So now the control parameter
is simply for a chain
the size of this chain.
And then we can plot the
tunneling time experiment
with quantum Monte Carlo.
And then we can superimpose
the delta square lines,
in the case of
periodic-boundary condition,
or one of the delta lines
in case of open boundaries.
And then we see that they
numerically agree very well,
also, using this improve the
fitting function, as suggested
also the Professor Nishimori.
And then we basically prove
that for these kind of models,
we can match.
So the quantum Monte
Carlo auto-correction time
matches the one of
the real machine.
So to summarize
then, since we can
know a priori the transition
state of the quantum Monte
Carlo pseudo-dynamic,
we can also
find [INAUDIBLE] state is the
instanton in imaginary time.
Then it follows that
the correlation time
scale is delta square--
delta square minus 2.
The correlation time,
the rate is delta square.
And then also, I suggested
to see Zhang Jiang talk
tomorrow that will provide
an extension to [? finite ?]
temperatures to this picture.
And then we also proposed that a
simple modification of the path
integral algorithm with
open-boundary condition
will simply imply
quadratic speed-up,
but this is just a
classical algorithm.
So a quantum-inspired
classical algorithm
that can be seen as another
way to perform a simulated--
so to perform a
classical annealing
in a classical computer.
And then now is not
completely done,
because we are still working
on finding possible exceptions
for this method.
So if this is really a general
feature of quantum Monte Carlo,
if there are counter-examples.
In these cases, [INAUDIBLE]
suggests some models
borrowed from quantum chemistry
that may feature something
that-- some feature that will
imply that the scale will not
hold.
Basically, it is when the
tunneling is effectively
a multi-dimensional system.
So it's not completely a
one-dimensional tunneling
[INAUDIBLE] over a barrier.
And then also, it is important
to state that there are
for sure a class of problem
in which this scaling will not
hold, because all the problems
which cannot be measured
by quantum Monte Carlo can show
a possible scaling advantage.
So beyond the transverse
field, a stochastic--
beyond the transverse
field driver--
there are a class of driver
which cannot be sampled with
quantum Monte Carlo because
they have this same problem.
And clearly, for them, you
cannot define a quantum Monte
Carlo dynamics that have this
transitional state, clearly.
And then, probably I
went even too fast,
but let me just do also a
couple of lines of advertising.
And then another-- very
simply, another thing
that we are working on,
it is to extend the path
integral algorithms also to
driver Hamiltonian, which
are-- [INAUDIBLE]
Hamiltonian, which are
beyond the transverse field.
So introducing this
so-called XX coupling.
Notice that all these
things that I said before
should hold also in this
case because these are
a same problem for Hamiltonian.
The basic idea of
why we will do that
is because if we add another
operator to the driver
Hamiltonian, we can also perform
an optimization of the path,
in the path of the parameter
of the one, the two-body
[INAUDIBLE], in which you can
avoid the difficult locations
or difficult configuration
which has more gap.
So this is why we
try to do that.
And only to say that now,
the path integral construct
is much more difficult,
compared with transverse field,
because now instead of having
only two non-commuting terms,
we have a lot of
non-commuting terms
if the graph is arbitrary.
So now the path
integral construction
is much more difficult. We
have to fulfill some symmetry,
but this has been done.
And then we just apply this
algorithm to 2D random glasses.
Although this is probably
not the best things to model,
to look at, we see that
some differences compared
to transverse field exist.
And it is actually
slightly better
than the transverse field,
so this is something.
And then also, another
thing that we are looking at
is to find a way to
adapt, automatically,
the annealing
schedule-- so going
beyond the simple
linear schedule-- using
the idea of using some kind of
a specific heat of the problem.
And then we can do a different
kind of annealing function.
And then we are applying this
to a 3D random Ising glass.
And then we found a very similar
result to the 2D simulation
that we already did in the past.
And with this, I close with some
[? means ?] of [? advance. ?]
[APPLAUSE]

SPEAKER: Thank you very much
for a very interesting talk.
Yeah?
AUDIENCE: Yes.

So it seems you're using
imaginary path integrals--
imaginary time path integrals
for all these simulations.
GUGLIELMO MAZZOLA: Mm-hmm.
AUDIENCE: And I wonder, with
the real-time path integrals,
you run into the sign problem.
So is there any work that you've
done towards calculating these
with real-time path integrals?
GUGLIELMO MAZZOLA: No,
real-time path integrals
are much more
unstable, so I just
want to focus on imaginary
time path integrals
because it's the things that
people usually did in the past.
So we have to prove if the
results of the past are
[? significant ?] or not.
So I don't want to
do another thing.
But still, OK, it can be done.
But I don't think it will
be-- so I don't think it has
the same pseudo-dynamics
underlying this--
AUDIENCE: You might benefit from
my open-source real-time path
integral code, [INAUDIBLE].
GUGLIELMO MAZZOLA: Ah.

AUDIENCE: Hi.
GUGLIELMO MAZZOLA: Yeah.
AUDIENCE: So
Matthew Hastings has
some result about abstract
topological obstructions
to path integral Monte
Carlo with periodic boundary
conditions and open.
So do those apply to your--
GUGLIELMO MAZZOLA: Yes,
one other [INAUDIBLE]
that I should have
put in the last slide
is that there are also other
pathological examples, which
fall outside the class
of-- with same problem,
also the class of
multi-dimension,
that are [INAUDIBLE] testing.
But some of these
pathological models
can be avoided
using open boundary,
because with open boundary, you
can escape topological dicey
situation.
Some of the problems not, and
these are quite pathological,
which are problem in which the
wave function and its square
leaps into a different region.
But I don't know.
Probably, they can be relevant.
But it is also true
that by applying
[INAUDIBLE] will
function, like the one
that I said during the
path integral state slide,
we can simply avoid this
region, if you already
know them in advance.
So OK, it's true that this
could be a possible obstruction
for this scaling.
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about this correspondence
between the tunneling rate or
tunneling time of quantum Monte
Carlo, versus the gap.
So are there any restrictions
on the transverse field,
for example, that you have
to have, in your experience?
Because it seems like if
transverse field is 0,
the gap is 0.
But quantum Monte Carlo
will still tunnel,
because it will just
become classical algorithm.
So do you have to have
transverse field large enough
for this to be true?
GUGLIELMO MAZZOLA: Actually,
the numerical experiment
that I did is a reasonable
transverse field, in order
to see something in human time.
No?
Because these values
are such that we can
have some statistical meaning.
So these points
are obtained with
a sound statistical accuracy.
So the smallest field that
we managed to simulate
is 0.35, in units
of the coupling.
So we numerically
didn't try this thing,
but I don't believe
it should be--
I don't expect any different,
to be honest. [? Certainly, ?]
we are exactly at
0, as you suggested.
And probably, [INAUDIBLE]
field should hold this thing.
SPEAKER: Might be
the last question.
AUDIENCE: OK.
Well, I have a small
comment and a question
on that last part of your talk.
You announced a recent result
about the addition of the XX
term in a stochastic manner.
And we did something
similar several years ago,
for a small system, and by
using mean field [INAUDIBLE]
algorithm.
And our conclusion
was that that term
improves the performance
quantitatively but not
qualitatively.
It shrinks the gap.
It enhances the gap a little
bit, but not more than that.
Do you have similar results?
GUGLIELMO MAZZOLA:
[INAUDIBLE] actually,
since these are
very recent results,
I never did a very
careful study.
These are just a study
of [INAUDIBLE] so
that they could
perform what I expect.
I will not publish some very
extensive result on that.
I just see that
there are still--
there is an improvement
for larger annealing time,
but I don't know.
I didn't even probably find the
correct path in the parameter
space [? to do ?] this.
So there are a lot of things
that I have to see before.
SPEAKER: OK, thank
you very much.
And let's thank all the
speakers at this session.
