Elizabeth and I'm violet and we are team
activities so the organization in which
we do our competition which runs our
competition is called first and first
runs four different levels of
competition um junior FLL for younger
elementary school students first lego
league for older elementary school
students and middle schoolers and first
tech challenge in FIRST Robotics
Challenge for high schoolers we
participate in for a sec challenge but
previously we have participated in FLL
which is a competition with one
autonomous robot which completes
multiple challenge on a four by eight
field we complete this challenge is in
two minutes 30 so this is our robot from
when we did FLL it's trying to collect
loops which it will bring back to the
base area and this again this is all
Congress so it's using sensors to run
against walls to align itself other
various things and they're robots
completely made out like it
cameras there uh no touch sensor is
mainly so last year or FLL year we
competed in various qualifying
tournaments where over 300 FLL teams
competed and we made it to the Northern
California championships where we placed
second out of 52 and we were invited to
compete in the open european
championships held in istanbul turkey we
met a lot of really great teams from all
around the world we there was one team
from a sample who made a point of being
really hospitable to us and they showed
us around and it was really just a great
experience overall so as part of the FLL
competition we had to complete a
research project we decide to do our
research project on my gloves my legs
levitating trains so we went through
many variations to try to build a small
scale model of it a lot of engineering a
lot of iterations and eventually we came
to this final version right here which
we have here today it used to work it's
having some issues um so the basic idea
of a maglev is a copper coil with the
chart run through it and the charges can
change depending on which way it's going
when you attach it to a vehicle it will
repel like and attract to the opposite
which is shown by red and green here and
so when you add a second one and turn it
off you can keep it continuously running
by turning what them off and on as they
pass over magnets that are attached to
the track and then by reversing that you
can make it go backwards so that's how a
basic maglev train could work what we
did was we added a second track and a
third electromagnet which we need a
solenoid and we you can see how we turn
them on and off depending on where they
are on the track so that it's smoother
and a lot more powerful so here's a
video of our
I live when it worked it's being
controlled from a remote you could see
LEDs going on and off the level um so we
have north and south magnets and there's
North faith they basically wheeze
propulsion to levitate it and so we
learned a lot of electrical engineering
in the process of doing this maglev he
did all the circuitry ourselves I mean
we had our Drina platform so we could
use that but making everything else we
do ourselves and so we presented this
maglev at well the version we had at the
time at maker faire do-it-yourself
festival in 2010 and we also presented
here with our had lip and our we
presented our experiences about FLL in a
google Tech shop much like this one and
we turned around the campus and it seems
people we've also we've done some
mentoring we mentor day all-girls team
in Palo Alto they had done FLL with us
and it had been their first year and
they weren't as a bit so we mentored
them last year and they did pretty well
and hoping to mentor them again and
meanwhile while they were mentoring the
Palo Alto team they're also on a skype
call to rubber squad United which is the
sister team in Australia which I am a
member from representing here and we all
work together for a rubber Cup junior
theater which is basically an autonomous
puppet show with multiple robots and
human interaction and with this we did
very well and we won the World
Championships this year during their
time in Tasmania and Australia we also
competed in the FLL Tasmanian state
championships which we also won FTC is
different it's four teams on a 12 x 12
field paired off in two lines system is
two lions of two teams each and every
single match you have many matches
throughout the entire tournament you get
paired up with
different alliance partner and different
opponents so one of the main differences
between FLL FTC is the parts used to
construct the robot in FLL as you can
see here on the right there or left
sorry it's all made out of plastic
there's all these pieces and there's
mindstorms but you're not allowed to
modify any of the pieces you're required
to use the plastic pieces well on FTC
there's aluminum pieces that you can cut
a machine and customize to your desire
there's a lot more electrical
engineering involved with all the wires
from the motors and the controllers and
the service the programming is also
pretty different in FLL you use a
program called NX GG which is in image
based program and in FTC you mainly use
robots see which is a text based program
based off of see it's they're pretty
different but they also have similar
functions that enabled us to transition
but you can definitely it's much funner
in robot seats as violet said that you
can customize the kind of parts that we
use in FTC so we're using a lot of
different kind of metal pieces and we
use a lot of different metal machines to
work the pieces into what we needed to
make the robot that we wanted we also
did cad cad mulling over a robot so i
can show you how this robot is built up
so we have a bottom of just sheet metal
that we bent and cut then a brick which
stores all the information is basically
the microprocessor of the robot a 12
volt battery pack controllers
multiplexers so we can put different
sensors in that without actually putting
them directly into the brick then we
built our aluminum frame added luck
wheels drive
and sprockets a gyroscope to help us
turn in autonomous and then balancing
gyroscopes and accelerometers so we can
actually balance on things infrared
sensors we have an aligner to capture a
rolling goal which is one of the scoring
elements in our last challenge a baton
capture system and wireless
communication because all of the matches
are done wirelessly a-arms to bring down
the bridge or teeter-totter that we have
to balance on a front bumper so we can
see if we had anything and a baton
dispenser just dispense batons and this
is what we started with at our first
competition and later on we added a arm
with rotating paddles and a 16-2 one
gear ratio we also we had to position
the batons in the robot so we have like
a back door to our scoop to dump them
into the robot and plastic that actually
will twist the batons and align them
inside of it then we have a little
sensor so we can register when the arm
comes down and then supports and
protective sides our robot when it's all
spread out doesn't actually fit into an
18 inch limit q which you have but when
you start the match we can fold up and
we fit perfectly within 18 and 18 inch
cube so this would be our starting
position so every year the FTC challenge
changes but this year there were two
sides to support the two different
alliances and there were various scoring
elements so you could score batons into
for rolling goals and two stationary
goals but each alliance had their own
rolling goals and that
their own stationery goal and there was
the batons were containing these baton
dispensers so you could like scoop them
out and get them into your robot to
score and also in the autonomous period
which started the match just dispensing
batons just onto the mat onto the floor
got you points and so you can see our
robot doing that here hopefully all
right so our robot is a square one in
this corner over here we are dumping
five pre-loaded batons into the rolling
gold links and then we push the Roland
goal out of our way so we can go on the
bridge um so then once we're over the
mountain our I art seeker looks for the
IR beacon which is underneath the baton
dispensers so we can align ourselves and
once we have aligned ourselves we will
dispense all the batons in the dispenser
so you can see the batons falling down
and so this is all in the atop 40
seconds yes so after the 42nd and Thomas
period there's a two-minute driver
control period where teams are allowed
to control the robot using the
controllers the main wage is the biggest
way to score is at the end of this
period where you can drag the rolling
goals onto the bridge and with other
robots try to balance the more elements
on the bridge the more points you get so
here we will our robot is capturing the
roll n Bowl and dragging it onto our
bridge where our alliance partner is
waiting now this part of the challenge
was a key part for interaction between
the two alliance partners because you
really had to communicate say ok move
now the stop so we can move and try to
balance together so they're both
alliances had just balanced and it was
really exciting so this past year we
went to Colorado to compete instead of
on Northern California because she our
team was in Australia during the
California tournaments but at Colorado
we became captain of the winning
Alliance which means that we won on the
match field and we got our ticket to the
World Championships in st. Louis so it
was really quite incredible it was a
four-day competition in st. Louis with
many other teams it was held in the
giant dome where the Rams play to
accommodate the 20,000 students that
participate through the four different
challenges so between the Colorado
championships at Colorado competition in
the world competition we decided to add
an arm to our robots so that we could
scoop at ons off the ground after we
just dispense them and that added a lot
of weight and so during one of their
competitions we flipped over onto our
backs and but we also discovered that
the arm could flip us back over after we
had gone on to honor our backs and this
was really exciting for us because we
had not known that our arm had that much
power and it was really exciting because
they were worried that it would just add
a lot of weight but it was also a plus
it was great because it allowed us to
get back into the game said just being
there after 40 seconds will.i.am he has
recently become a sponsor for a FIRST
Robotics so while we were at the
competition he had the black eyed peas
held a free concert to for everyone
there which was quite cool it was
surprised to all of us hit 20 except for
they were testing the lights so we kind
of could tell um so robotics keeps all
of us really busy so some of the events
coming up in September in October are a
robotics presentation to the local
school board and abbott vascular
technology expo a powerful presentation
to fellow teams a planetary rover
simulator experience at san mateo
libraries at the Bay Area Science
Festival a maglev done
Jason and a mini maker faire teach
robotics classes meant to the Palo Alto
girls FLL team and design and build CCS
robot a lot of things to do for the
power tool presentation FTC is all about
gracious professionalism so we thought
it would be extremely useful to help
other teams with the power tools and
what power tools might um they might
find necessary or essential and not as
some productive for actually making
their robot and we gave advice on how to
use these machines and safety tips for
them as well inner power thumbs in our
power point we also showed our safety
tip violations such as hair down or
bracelet salon or dangly jewelry things
like that and for the planetary rover
simulator experience at our local
library we're going to be attaching a
webcam to the front of a robot that's
shown here and in a different part of
the room will have a computer that the
webcam is hooked up to so that kids can
drive around a robot but only being able
to see using the webcam so it'll be like
they're driving a Mars rover on Mars but
with our robot and so they'll be able to
try to like pick up batons or like
samples from the moon offer the off of
the ground and so it's just to give them
an idea of what a Mars rover would be
like and so if you want to learn
anything more about our team go teww the
one robot calm it has all our events and
our history of anything we've done so if
you want to except dead there and thank
you for listening to our presentation
you can we'll be doing a short
demonstration with this year's robot
will drive it around and then hopefully
some some of you would like to drive our
robot if you have any questions yeah so
Q&amp;amp;A period it's time for getting
questions anyone hit yeah this year
whole new one home because this year's
come the competition changes drastically
every year and so this next competition
involves a lot of different things and
this robot can do and so we're gonna
have to design a completely new one
you're going to have to start doing
pretty soon this year's competition is
themed on bull growling so there there's
a hundred racquetballs on the field
which will are in like a pain formation
on top of these crates and so you have
to knock them over and then there's also
two bowling balls on the field and the
aim is to get the balls into goals or to
stack up the crates as high as you can
so to do this you have to design a
completely different robot with
different capabilities but the good
thing about the FDC robots is that you
can take different components into
different competitions for instance
you're always going to need to be able
to drive with wheels and such yes
yeah our control yes we have joysticks
and we use bluetooth to send messages
back and forth depending on the buttons
we press and where the joysticks are
well actually we use Bluetooth former
practicing but when you're actually in
the matches in the competition we have a
Samantha module that they gave us so it
does wirelessly it they turn off and
turn off and on the robot and start
different programs from a fuel control
station any other questions yes
over on juniors so 11th graders in high
school we started our eighth grade year
with the the other level the FLL level
and we got interested because our coach
kind of invited us to be part of this
big team and it was a big team but then
it kind of narrowed it down to justice
I've actually always been interested in
robotics my dad's kind of a huge geek
and as shown me like we went to make her
for the first year it started we've
probably got every single year since and
just I had heard about they had had a
team the first year and I'm like oh this
sounds really cool I can finally be able
to build robots on my own I've always
wanted to and so I was I joined the team
a year later after they yeah and in
Australia i became interested in
robotics because my mum mum was running
a robotics team and they were
representing australia at a World
competition in Austria three years ago I
think and I became involved in helping
out and working with the robots and that
really interested me so I became sucked
into this competition and it was just a
great experience so now I'm over here
trying different sorts of robots and
diversifying what I can do with robotics
well we all have various different
things like sheer students band and we
all do mock trial like I'm in Girl
Scouts and Emmas in 4h but this does
dominate a lot of our time mm-hmm once
the season starts it really starts and
doesn't stop so I was a season it
depends how far you progress in the
levels I mean it starts in the beginning
of September and then you have about two
months till your first competition and
if you move on then you get you have a
few more months for your next
competition and then the last level is
the world competition which is held in
st. Louis and that's in April so it can
last from anywhere from November to
April but the the main part of the build
is yeah well you can always improve
between different competitions so but
you have to have something basic between
September in November yes
I'm actually teaching um two different
robotics classes went to a homeschooling
group and one to a class at my old
elementary school it's really
interesting I've only started with the
homeschoolers either about there's 26
year olds and about a four year old and
so it is it just think that what you can
teach them I've started out by teaching
them like the engineering process by
building straw bridges and you draw out
your idea and then you try to build it
and see Oh some things didn't work and
then we're going to move on to some
programming i'm going to introduce them
to NXT g do some basic stuff like that
um our robots about 2,000 again a lot of
first is a lot about fundraising so you
have to learn about budgeting and how to
find money and how to use it wisely and
so Allah that's insane building so it is
kind of expensive but it's a lot about
finding other people who will help you
out what's your problem gene budget we
kind of intend to exceed probably um two
or three thousand I'd spread the robot
for the red line and then if we end up
going to competitions then it's
traveling travels yeah what you find is
a harvest
um I mean I really like it's properly I
don't know it's all really interesting
actually it's really different for
everyone like for me it's really hard to
sit down and brainstorm all of these
ideas and like go through all these
ideas that will arm awkward and then
building a trial error a lot of it
that's really difficult to look
especially as if it were going to team
if you have an idea then the other
members know that well that probably
won't work it's really hard to be able
to calm down and just like people to
work with everyone um also when your
ideas don't work and you have to totally
scratch and start a new idea that's
really hard for me is like that jacket I
call so it's difficult to share the
robot because the builders want to build
something and the program is want to
program and you can't do both at once so
for instance i find building the actual
robot more interesting than being able
to sit down and program and then see if
it works and then if it doesn't work try
again and program and just checking to
see if everything works i find that
probably the most tedious part of the
competition that's my favorite
um I I find tech space a lot easier for
me to just read and work with I can't
read image the image because their
little icon buttons I have little wires
that go to other things and I just can't
read it at all and I just find it really
irritating and I like to just be able to
write out my program are straight um
that just because I'm I like using the
tech space I'd say that one's easier but
i'd say the NXT g is probably easier to
learn if you've never done any program
and before I'm a text eg if you want a
debug something or if something's gone
wrong you can't actually see like the
power or the timing of any movements
with the actual icon just initially you
have to click and go into it and see
what everything is so an initial glance
tech space is probably easier to go
through is where is with image space you
have to go through every single icon to
see where it's gone wrong yes
the only computer science class we have
is a thing called computer concepts for
you learned how to make excel
spreadsheets oh yeah so we find it um at
least I don't know about them but I've
decided that's kind of boring and so
I've been learning it on my own our
school really does not emphasize
computer science what so ever thought of
teaching your computer science class
based on that would be really cool
didn't know we have time for um in
Australia we I don't know with any other
schools but at my school we have a
robotics class where they actually do
make things so it like that for instance
part of the curriculum is making a 3d
printer with an Arduino based program
and I find that a lot of robotics teams
tend to come into their actual school in
mentor with the robotics classes or any
computer science classes that are
offered we're sort of actually our
school we're sort of like the only
technology or robotics or computer
science based thing our school is a big
athletic school and so our little
robotics team here you do pretty good
here ee itunes other other students in
school behind you
oh yeah the robots they actually they
don't really know who we are and if they
do they actually think we're pretty cool
we've only the school newspaper a few
times yeah and most of most of our
supporters are just our friends no was
my lucky so has you roll up and damage
at all yes yes multi actually in the
Colorado Championships we're talking
about in the finals is like three
consecutive matches and whoever one's
best two out of three and in it was
either a first or a second match one of
the robots actually drove over one of
our servo motors and completely broke it
and it just goes from match to match to
match so we actually had to like run
grab a screwdriver and just take it off
and go back on the field luckily one
thing we really take to heart is
redundancy so you make sure something
break something else will take over so
luckily that server really didn't damage
something if we had another thing that
could back it up and do it so yeah
another thing at the Colorado when we
first got there we took our robot out of
its traveling case which is that right
there and all of the axles on the wheels
workbench and so we had to take like a
good hour or two to take off all of the
wheels and replace all of the axles and
that was really scary because we didn't
know if we would have enough axles to
replace everything so and of course
everything always goes wrong in the
competition's it can't go wrong when
you're practicing at home right so
that's we've had to learn to deal with
breakages yes
um a bit I mean our batteries only can't
handle a little of their 12 volt so
they'd only handle so much but I think
we really take that into consideration
too much um but during the competition
was just boom boom boom you can replace
the battery if it was too low and we
also discovered that actually with the
battery if it got down below a certain
level even if the battery wasn't like
empty or out then it would just stop
working it wouldn't connect to the brain
and so we have to make sure that it
stayed above a certain level even if it
wasn't empty yes
um just practice in practice and our
coach had some good advice he's like oh
you should probably take this in
consideration but after doing it for a
while you learn oh we this is probably
good thing to think about especially
after doing FLL we learned kind of the
few aspects that like you need to make
sure you have sensors and not depend on
dead reckoning and you need to make sure
a few things so it's kind of you learned
by practice pretty reliable sir yeah
there are a couple of sensors of your
life touch sensors are extremely liable
gyroscopic sensors have a bit of drift
as you work with them for wildly Eyres
yes I rigan in FLL they had other
sensors like flight sensors that were
read light readings it would like shine
a light and get the readings if hang on
what color it was and that was iffy yet
we use it or FLL year but it's not
entirely reliable so like with a lot of
light sensors you have to be on careful
and so you have like two or three light
sensors just to keep the robot on track
just in case one isn't working properly
and there are also sound sensors and
sometimes they work and sometimes they
don't but it also varies from like
specific sensor to censor not just like
the type of them but if they've been
damaged if they've been used a certain
amount as well so sometimes you just
need to have a spare one on hand and see
if it can plug in and work
you can there is mainly these pieces
from a company called tech tricks and
they have all the kind of Flowery pieces
you see on our robot there from tech
tricks they sell the axles they sell the
motors they sell the servos if you're an
FTC team you get like thirty percent off
i think your love to use any Lego parts
so anything from Lego Mindstorms you can
use that's what most of a lot of our
sensors are like oh actually and then
you're allowed to use a certain amount
of other parts like we use aluminum
sheet metal which you can get anywhere
you want and PVC so other some materials
you're allowed to get everywhere
anywhere but there's only a limited
amount you can use any robot um again
the controllers are from tetrax they
sell those and we get them from there
and then we do use the Mindstorms brick
to really control our robot so mainly
Lego and tetrax there are you allowed to
use other things or use I'm pretty sure
you're not allowed to use I was just
Lego Mindstorms and tetrax and then
there are other things that come into
play but I'm not further mainland
there's also a limit I'm having you can
have you can only use eight of the DC
motors you can only use 12 of the servos
uh they don't want you just piling
loaders on so you can't serve the design
your own stuff you can use a prototyping
board we've seen teams use it I mean it
gets kind of complex if you're doing
really complex stuff they've done that
before but for the simpler robots it's
easier just not to do it it's really you
can get as complex as you want you can
get as simple as you want and all of the
all of the like tetrax metal pieces and
stuff you can machine yourself so once
you actually get the actual piece then
you can start playing around with it
refreshments yes that's the betadine so
how much exactly
um at the moment is mostly coming out of
our pocket it's kind of started doing
fundraising backwards where we spend and
then we're trying to get money because
that kind of started in our FLL year but
yeah so a lot of teams routine though
like have a certain budget and
fundraising that they keep to we can
have a bad habit of doing that yeah yep
so as the season progresses do you see a
lot of people having ideas other people
for that you like like your scoop that
you aren't that was mainly our own I
mean there's definitely with the
materials you can do these definitely
some similarity molarity and you know
you see things in our robot snail ago um
pretty cool a lot of times before the
first competition everyone he thought
they're doing a secret but then once you
go to your first competition is kind of
like back fat cats out of the bag you
can't really hide something when you're
trying to compete and then if you move
on you'll see oh that robot we saw a
competition had a good idea let's work
off of that and a lot of times you work
off like past season robots that you can
watch on YouTube a lot of the people put
the robots on YouTube and it's like oh
that was good for that thing which is
kind of similar for this year's
competition so let's look at that like
this year there's a lot of balls on the
floor and we're trying to figure out how
to pick them up and two years ago there
is competition that had a similar issue
so where the camp those robots yes as a
ladies do you find that you have any
issues or rivalries or anything with um
all guy jeans well there's definite
little bit of competition Rican guy
seems like hot we just beatin on guys in
there you know happy little dance um
there's I guess there's not like too
much for I hope I mean do I mean there's
definitely rivalries and stuff but um
not just because we're all girls I mean
we've different there's definitely been
times whether it was like I remember
once day was like a guys team they're
like ah it's just like three girls and
then we beat them and really yeah so I'm
in the competition there are a couple of
co-ed teams but we find that a lot of
the teams are more guy dominated then
there are a lot of girls so it's
interesting being an all-girl team
because there aren't very many old girl
teams it's all in FLL you know the
younger it was a lot more it was much
closer than half and a half and then now
that we're in this we know expressly we
went to the world competition we were
out dominating like there were so many
guys yeah so little girls so we're gonna
yep yeah i def is it um yeah I need the
joysticks here that's right here did you
take them
sorry if you have any questions and
check out our robots in sir sighs oh
yeah this was so this was from our FLL
year um it's all purely legoland NXT and
how much smaller this still is broken
yep no glue no no glues alive they have
a lot of really specific rules that are
really frustrating sometimes your stuff
little scraps of paper in there to make
em tiger actually we put a little icon
stickers his exceptions only this little
space we need Phil so we put the Lego I
constant look all around this home so
you have two controllers is one person
control everything I can I mostly just
control them drive so and then I control
attachments like by this what's the
maximum number of creatures I too yeah
so on the game field the infield is
about twice as big as this but on the
infield you ought to have three people
two drivers and one game coach so like
last year I would go on the field with
them and just keep an eye out on the
other robots
10 so we're rather of school yeah most
teams are like seven people oh and also
you can see one side is off to one side
is on so we also have two different
sides so that's how long we've that arm
to score alright alright like that
answer yea go general the servo problem
it's good in between two like numbers
i'm showing two numbers so it'll just
dance move a little bit it is just fine
but we have the fine walk on the field
because you can't really be who they
have to stand in one spot going on back
up yeah so is the challenge because
you're stuck to one spot saying can't
like run around the field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
