reasons security reasons we have to
transform our energy system to something
is different and this is a very very
complex system that will take lots of
time and a lot of capital you're right
what's exciting about what we have this
afternoon is the fact that we have the
leading institutions that are here to
lead the process of innovation in this
industry the United States is not going
to stay on top based on resources based
on low-cost labor where you stand top
based on our ability to innovate and
create new ideas creating businesses and
if you look at the last 20 years what's
happened here in the Bay Area it's been
driven by the universities is a
underpinning of that process and I think
the same thing is going to happen in
energy and it's great to see that these
universities really embrace that deal of
the world so that's what we're inside so
I'm Lynn or I'm the director of Precourt
Institute for energy of Stanford
University and it reflects the
activities have been going on going on
in Stanford over the last seven or eight
years that it really tried to Spoelstra
what we do in the energy space and it's
really based on the idea that that
energy is absolutely fundamental to the
way modern
function that it needs to be accessible
and secure and and sustainable and
cost-effective and and so we have a very
big energy system now to take a huge
effort to change that we need to bring
the best talent we can to work there on
that set of issues now I know it my
institution and not be willing to bet
good money that it's also true at UC
Berkeley and MIT that our students are
really interested in this set of ideas
there's there's no shortage of energy
resource in the world and got the Sun
but we but we have to have ways to
convert that into the services that we
all need to take advantage of in a way
that's that we can build a huge energy
system to go with that so that takes
talented people working on the
fundamentals of the energy conversions
from sunlight to electricity better
batteries on the more efficient use of
energy throughout the whole system and
on the economics and policy regulatory
structures that make all that happen so
we created an energy institute in an
attempt to work across that spectrum to
build on a bunch of good work that we
have that's in the dis
it also works on the interdisciplinary
side as well and it really comes back to
to making sure that we can put our
students to work on something
so I'm Dan kamon and I'm a professor at
UC Berkeley where I direct something
called the renewal improper energy lab
just about half focused on developing
country issues and how focused on
developing country situations and then
also our transportation sustainability
research center where we do some basic
research but also a lot of practical
projects with fleet of fuel cell
vehicles of lido plug-in hybrids the
fleet of electric scooters etc so what
we do is we try to have some deep
research programs like Lynn mentioned in
a number of topical areas but also to
make sure that there is enough cortical
connective tissue so that we can be
interdisciplinary brother conscience and
that's really what's neat about Berkeley
there has been efforts like my home
department the energy resources group
for decades now but there's now this
whole set of things in every university
has have gotten with the energy game has
figured out different ways to put
together but we have students come
coming out of classroom was piling out
yo factor of ten increase in enrollment
many hitters in classes there's lots
going on in this I also serve as the
director of the policy chapter of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
change's renewable energy report which
is I'm going together right now just in
time we hope for Copenhagen and in that
role like at the other side of it which
is it which is so what would lid mention
to begin with and that is we need to not
only innovate but we need critically a
scale up and we need to scale up
dramatically we've unfortunately
frittered away a lot of very good years
by not acting and so we need to scale up
and get it right really without you know
without missing but not missing the
pitch we need to get a price on carbon
we need to find ways to develop the
markets as well as the technologies or
low carbon and energy efficiency and
really
critically energy efficiency solutions
and we have a lot of units around campus
based on those so this IPCC chapter is
actually going to the first time there
is a internationally accredited effort
not just an individual researcher effort
that devises zero carbon scenarios for
2013-2014 so that's really trying to put
all this neat brainpower interesting
innovation stanford's on the very law
has gotten a very large investment in
clean energy efforts berkeley received a
half a billion dollar one from BP
there's a number of these of big efforts
that need us to think about how they fit
into the wider economy and how these
things can be profitable as early as
possible with the least carbon solutions
being the ones that are benefited the
most as we transition from the fossil to
hopefully the fossil you will freak or
fossil fuel with managed missions
economy so our Institute's Berkeley have
a whole bunch of both I on that on the
economic pieces on the technology and
science it's fun to kind of sit right in
there with that I'm pretty monies from
MIT when I direct the energy initiative
we're finishing the university there
first if the
and had many of my statements that would
certainly be common with those when Dan
let me add a couple of additional points
one is I think that it's it's
interesting to remember that the energy
industry context the energy industry is
very very massive capital intensive its
industry that has I would say
historically valued reliability and a
little cost over innovation and now as
has been stated we face our the need for
an unprecedented piece of change of
energy system and that invented many
ways to find the innovation challenge as
one that involves technology innovation
policy innovation and business model
innovation all having to come together
to affect the kind of the kind of change
that's that's been discussed and so
right off the bat the need for all those
forms of an innovation system
characterizes certainly what we are
committed MIT
I believe as well what's happening at
the other university so all the schools
involved science engineering
architecture planning management
humanities huge numbers of faculty
students we have about twenty percent of
our faculty that mighty example engaged
in our
energy initiative and this this is what
it will take to accomplish the job the i
also would emphasize that the task at
hand involves both innovating around
what you might call today's technologies
advanced coal conversion with carbon
capture advanced nuclear systems as well
as focusing on the transformational
technologies that today do not have
large market shares for example certain
MIT solar energy is our is our flagship
flagship program I'll also make last
comment relevant to perhaps part of my
history and the next day to dad right
this history of having certain
government and note that also from our
University perspective the role of
government will be very very important
going forward and i would say three and
three areas one is the government must
subsets conditioned the marketplace for
this low carbon future and standard
pricing carbon is the leading example of
how the government must issue the
marketplace but secondly the government
needs to play a new kind of role in
advancing technology our D&amp;amp;D research
development and demonstration and I
believe this year has been very
encouraging that point of view as we've
seen the property of energy new programs
are being as one of the ones that
recently announced for example but with
one caution I also want to add while
these new programs have given Norma's
boost to new science new technology in
hit energy new pushes to startup
companies commercialization universities
getting engaged in new ways in the
energy innovation business one caution
is that much of this has been funded
with the stimulus package and so we're
going to have to see what happens after
these next two years because what we
need is not a drop when a further
increase in our D&amp;amp;D funding commensurate
the task at hand
a third role of government is to provide
in some sense the conditions for
innovation some of those involved the
ability to marshal financial resources
but also involves the ability to harness
and Marshall human resources that's
where universities have a have any
special role and once again i would say
government has done a good job in many
ways in helping us to have our students
engage but there are other issues
including things like the classic
problems of these in the cetera that
also come into the whole human resource
equation so it's eventually time our
universities are extremely active
engaged but the government is going to
that to continue and in fact Rohit's
role for not only us but for the whole
innovation system to prosper over this
next critical decade
thanks Ernie I'm I'm Janet Ryker this is
Dan cannon on generator and from google
write direct climate and energy
initiatives Google's in this energy
space for variety of reasons one we're a
fairly significant user of energy at our
data center secondly quite interested in
the engineering aspect of energy so if n
engineers working on products that help
people manage energy use in their homes
for example also have made a series of
investments in energy technology
companies and also working quite hard in
Washington on the energy policy from the
focus today is energy innovation and
energy innovation to me means a real
pipeline that starts with basic research
that moves to applied research that goes
from there to demonstration projects
from there to the scale-up sedan Kevin
talked about and from there to full
commercial deployment it's a long
pipeline and to be very honest we don't
do a very good job in this country of
moving technologies through this
pipeline we're on again off again at
several steps and we haven't put in
place what it's really going to take to
move technologies from early conception
all the way control deployment and if we
don't succeed at that number one I don't
think we're going to solve the climate
crisis number two are not going to gain
the economic and security benefits that
are there for the taking when it comes
to
and the literally trillions of dollars
they're going to have to be spent in the
US and worldwide to refill our current
energy infrastructures one of the main
things we're going to talk about today
as this session is in fact what it will
take to move through this energy
innovation pipeline and azureus said and
others have sensitive first it's it's
dramatically increasing our dnd spending
we don't spend enough in the federal
government we don't spend enough in the
private sector moving clean energy
technologies forward secondly even
having succeeded our DMV there's that
third D deployment and we also don't do
a good job on providing what it takes to
get projects built at large scale
massive megawatts massive gallons of
output and we've really got to put
things in place to do that you're going
to hear a little bit about for example
15 energy deployment administration
which is in both the Senate and the
House bills right now
that would be a strong mechanism in
combination with radically increased R&amp;amp;D
spending the 2 and 15 billion dollars a
year on the federal side those two
things would be very very helpful we
also need to build a smarter and bigger
electricity grid if we're really going
to deploy technologies in a serious way
we have a dumb grid and we don't have a
grid that is extensive enough to harness
the renewable energy technologies that
people are so excited about and lastly
before thing I think is the critical
role that Ben federal standards and
incentives play the states have done a
good job of putting renewable portfolio
standards in place incentivizing
efficiency but unless this happens at
the federal level we're really not going
to drive these kinds of technologies and
the way we need to one quick example is
solar thermal technology the big mirrors
in the desert it is in fact the federal
government that got those early
demonstration projects good it is in
fact renewable portfolio standards
adopted by various states that are
pushing that forward and it late it is
in fact federal help with financing that
are finally getting commercial projects
built in this country so those policies
are coming together we do have some
examples
need a lot for different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
