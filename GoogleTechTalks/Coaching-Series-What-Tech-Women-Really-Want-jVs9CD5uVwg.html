the information that was distributed my
talk title was what tech women really
want and then I realized that them
really I'm trying to parody the movie
what women want with the title here so
it's not what we really want it's what
we just want just plain so what tech
women want is the focus of my talk today
and I already mentioned the movie
analogy you know with the the Paramount
Pictures movie of what women want and so
this just to get it out of way this is
nothing about dating or how to put on
makeup or anything or how to get a date
this is really more about understanding
the challenges that women face and being
able to support ourselves and for those
of us in the audience who are male
supporting our female co-workers and
really understanding what kinds of
challenges they face that we may not
face ourselves so we're really focusing
on understanding the challenges that
specifically challenges that I've
observed as a coach I coached a lot of
technical women and I've seen some
patterns and so that's my focus today
and I've given this talk several times
before and the last time I gave it was
back in September and the audience was a
group of IT coaches so coaches who do
the same work that I do and they agreed
with what I was saying in my talk but
they said you know what the point you're
making applied to people in general
maybe not everybody faces the same
challenges but men and women both face
these challenges that you're talking
about maybe women more than men but this
could still be useful for anyone to hear
so just keep that in mind and what we
talked about today you might be able to
find helpful for yourself but you also
may know others or start recognizing
other people who have the challenges
that we talked about today so not
everybody is going through the same
thing obviously so before we dive in any
further I just wanted to give you a
little
ground about me what I do what coaching
is I am a technical person i was i'm a
recovering geek you might call me I have
a master's in computer science from
Princeton I had an NSF fellowship while
I was there which I walked away from
after a year I left graduate school to
teach full time at the college level I
taught computer science classes for
three semesters and realized that
teaching was not my calling so who is
the valuable experience about where I
didn't want to go and also meant I
didn't want to go through back to grad
school and get my my doctorate I went to
cnet I was a senior systems engineer
they're back I started back before they
went public and I was also i moved from
there to I've village where I managed
their web development staff I wish that
at I village for about three years as
well I left there for consulting work
and then ultimately came into coaching
which really ties together what I
enjoyed most about teaching and managing
was it really allows me to focus on in
one-on-one with people helping them
through whatever they're struggling with
and that's really what I enjoyed most
about teaching and managing and so I
feel lucky that I've been able to focus
on that as a coach I am I went to NYU
was actually part of their first
graduating class from their coaching
certificate program about three years
ago and I recently was certified by the
international coaching Federation as an
ACC coach at what the a is it's like
associate coach I focus on coaching
emerging leaders so a lot of coaches
they really want to just focus on the
executives vice president and above the
cio CTO well i have coach to CTO I
really prefer and usually focus on
coaching staff senior staff managers and
directors so were the everyday folks
because when I became manager there was
very little support in transitioning
from staff to management and I had a
coach and I found it really valuable
especially you know when my manager was
too busy for me right so you know I just
see that a coach at that level is really
really valuable in helping you get your
changes and challenges so at some of my
clients are johnson and johnson and they
have a technology manager leadership
development program and smith college
has an executive education program which
is for women who are transitioning into
management and women scientists and
engineers I've been a speaker in
different venues this is maybe the fifth
or sixth time I've given this talk or a
version of this talk I also write
articles for I Triple E I I brought my
first real magazine article I Triple E
has a new women in engineering magazine
and I actually have a two page article
and mentoring in it and this just came
out says winter I think it came out late
december early january
so what's coaching a lot of people
aren't really familiar with what
coaching is let me go over that really
briefly seventy percent of senior
executives do have a coach it's
considered a perk it's not considered
something where you know you're not
performing well so you need a coach to
help you so that you can fix whatever
your problems are so you don't get fired
it's not like that most of the time and
that would really be you know not the
kind of coaching I would want to do
anyway what coaching is usually for is
is development leadership development
developing your soft skills technically
or typically for technical people they
come in with very strong technical
skills but now suddenly they need to
learn how to influence people or deal
with conflict or manage upwards or speak
up in meetings those kinds of things so
even though I have a technical
background and I understand the world
that you guys are in to some degree a
lot of what I focus on with people is
not technical a coaching is usually done
one-on-one there is some talk about some
doing some group coaching but what the
new program is that's being rolled out
now is one-on-one meetings with the
coach and the employee and those
meetings are confidential I think that's
really the key difference between what
you can do with the coach and what you
can do with your manager because what
you said your coach is not going to
suddenly show up on your performance
review or be an issue of concern for
your manager unless you let them know
that sorry the truck elevator is moving
okay so when I have been coaching people
things have come up during coaching
sessions that they probably would not
want to talk to their manager about or
maybe it's even about their manager or
how to deal with their management um
coaching is about helping identify where
you want to go how to get there what
obstacles are in the way brainstorming
about how to get there questioning
assumptions about things that are in
your way or understanding the dynamics
of the environment that you live in
which some people in the coaching world
call systems I really take a systems
approach because you're not a person in
isolation who can control things
independently you really have a lot of
interacting
dependencies and group behaviors and
things that you have to deal with
coaching is not consulting it's not
therapy it's not counseling if it starts
going towards a direction of therapy a
good coach that say okay I have to stop
here and maybe you have to go talk to
somebody else but coaching you know for
me it's focused on what you can do to be
more productive or work towards your
career professional goals and really
focused on work and sometimes that that
leads into also what's going on
personally but that's not really the
focus the focus is is your development
in the workplace and some people think
coaching is not advice there's some in
the ICF guidelines you're not supposed
to be giving advice when you're coaching
it's really more about drawing out your
thinking and helping facilitate your
thinking rather than saying well here's
what I would do if I were you because
I'm not you and you have your own way of
doing things and facilitating your
thinking is my goal it's not like I want
every time my client is struggling with
something that they need to come come
come ask their coach what should i do
and then the coach gives advice you
really want to learn a process of
questioning and growing and learning
that you can take with you I know as new
learning alright any questions so far
okay so getting back to the talk the
meat of the talk what tech women want
I'm going to talk about patterns that
I've observed five patterns though I
will be talking about and then depending
on how much time we have at the end of
the talk I'm going to share some best
advice that I've collected from women
engineers around the country both on the
sisters mailing list and also at Smith
College the executive education program
and Association for women in computing
meeting but I went to have collected
advice from 19 engineers advice that
they thought was the best career advice
they had ever gotten and wanted to pass
on to other people so I've actually
written an article about that that's not
published yet but it has the stories and
behind the stories are really
interesting about how they got their
advice and how it was useful to them so
you know if I have to shortchange that
piece or you're more interested in the
details send me an email and i can send
you the article because i don't have it
up on my website yet okay all right so
these are the five areas that i'm going
to talk about that i have observed
technical women struggling with you know
not just one and and some of them are
things that I struggled with myself and
didn't even realize that it was a more
general issue until I talked to other
women who were having the same issues
and these are things that I saw as a
coach and not as a manager I spent five
years as a manager and I thought I was
pretty good at it but there were things
that came up and coaching that I know no
employee would have ever said to me and
so it was news to me that you know some
of the things that I had struggled with
as an employee were similar to what
other people were struggling with
because we just never talked about it so
the first area is the impostor syndrome
or the imposter phenomenon and it came
out it was coined in the 70s there's a
book about it but the person I saw dr.
Valerie young give a talk about this a
few years back and it really spoke to me
basically the imposter phenomenon is
that you feel like you're a fake to some
degree that's that somehow there was
some mistake made they for some reason
they you know you ace the interview you
got the job at Google and now they think
you're so smart but really you don't
think you're so smart and someday
somebody else is going to figure it out
and you're going to get fired or not yes
some lesser degree of that sort of
feeling of oh my gosh I don't know if I
can really do this and it turns out that
seventy percent of people feel this way
at one time or another and that women
tend to feel it more than men
and when I gave this talk back last
summer up at Smith they had a room full
of 80 women and I asked them how many of
you have felt this way and almost
everybody raised their hand and there
was this collective gasp because people
said oh my gosh I put my hand up and I
thought nobody else was going to put
their hand up and everybody did and I
we've asked here but yeah I don't know
how statistically valid that would be
with the group we have here but and it
may be that you know the culture here at
Google the criteria for being hired here
maybe you don't feel that way but
certainly in that group that I saw last
year it was definitely an issue for
people okay so why did I see this also
with my clients why does it so come and
well it turns out that one of the big
risk factors for feeling this way if
you're in a job that is a typical for
your gender so being an engineer at
Google if you feel that you're really in
a minority here which I believe I don't
know what the statistics are I know
Google works very hard to recruit women
but if you're in a job a typical for
your gender you're more likely than
other people to feel this way at times
and then I've worked with people who
have three or four of these criteria and
there's no wonder they feel this way
okay so dr. Jung has a website impostor
syndrome com I believe org I forget and
she gives a whole bunch of ways to get
over this feeling of imposter syndrome
and so I'm not going to go into detail
on them and you can look them up on our
website if you're interested but this
first one here separating feeling from
fact seems to be one that people really
struggle with a lot of something happens
and you get worried about it and you you
maybe blow something out of proportion
error and you put read too much into
something that was just an innocent
comment or a mistake and
it gets you know you can have emotional
ties to things even buttons get pushed
so would that reminded me of is this
thing called a q-tip story that I heard
a few years back and it goes like this
there's a senior woman in the Coast
Guard goes to the coast guard academy
graduation and she takes the women aside
and she gives them all a q-tip and she
says when something happens out there
that really bugs you the guy says
something you know offensive to you or
that you are offended by just think of
this q-tip and quit taking it personally
QT IP quit take any of it personally the
job is rough it's part of the culture
and most of the time is something
offends you it's not personal it's part
of the job or it's as part of the way
the organization works and it feels
better not to think oh that guy doesn't
like me it's not personal it's just part
of the job that he would have said that
to anybody hey so other things are being
optimistic trying to find new ways of
doing things rewarding yourself when you
do things well okay now when i gave the
previous slide and talks before people
said well you know q-tip sounds like a
good idea but how do you really do it i
mean how do you really stop things from
eating away at you if something's
bothering you and so I came up with this
slide it's really just a series of
questions that you can ask yourself to
help determine how valid or how useful
whatever incident occurred is to you so
I have an example that I like to give
with this when i first started
programming this was before she met at a
company's name I won't mention my
manager was kind of a character and I
had my Master's I taught computer
science and he was self-taught I came in
to work for him and he said well you
know I don't care if you have your
masters it doesn't mean you can program
I can teach a monkey to program I'm that
good of a manager and I thought she did
that guy just call me a monkey you know
and I
should I be offended is this guy really
liked writing me off and so you know I
wasn't sure how to think about this so
you know if I take that scenario and go
through these questions well does he
really know me and my skill set well you
can't hit just hired me I'd only been
there a couple weeks he didn't really
know you hadn't seen me succeed on the
job or accomplished much yet um where's
this a one time occurrence he kept it
was like it was a pet phrase of his he
you know he did he was I would say no it
wasn't a one-time occurrence so there
could have been an issue there um does
the person do this with others like you
what turns out i found out for my
co-workers he's like this to anybody
who's knew that you don't get the skies
respect until you prove yourself and
once you've proved yourself then he
stops with the comments like that so my
coworkers really shed some light on that
i didn't even have to go to them they
came to me because they knew that this
guy was the pain and could get you
feeling down and though so that was
really great that my coworkers step
forward and supported me on that so that
really held to me a q-tip to know that
you know he's you know maybe he said
something that's a little jerky maybe he
can be a jerk at times but that's just
the way he is and he says this to
everybody and it will go away over time
that was really reassuring could I talk
to him about it that would have been
really tough to like confront him and I
didn't know him very well but I guess if
it had continued to be a problem that
would have been a next step and so we'll
talk a little bit more about that and
then just what what from that experience
was useful to me that I could take from
that okay well this guy's kind of proud
this guy's kind of arrogant maybe that's
helpful for me to know as I'm
interacting with him what his style is
what's going to what he's going to be
able to hear from me or what's going to
work well for me and interacting with
him okay alright so picking up a little
more on you know should I have talked to
him about it or how would I have done
that
you know I could have you know let it
get to me brooded over it whatever and
tried to adjust so that he didn't make
comments like that anymore and that's
the kind of situation where I've spent a
lot of time in coaching with people
where there are situations like that and
they don't know what to do about it and
they don't want to say anything to draw
attention to it they just want it to go
away and get better and they're not sure
what to do so you know say someone keeps
interrupting them in meetings that
happens a lot especially if it's your
manager and your managers interrupting
you winning how do you handle that a lot
of the times people don't have enough
information about why the person is
doing what they're doing why things are
happening the way they are happening and
it's easy for us to assume the worst you
know that it's because you know he's
interrupting me because he doesn't think
that my input is valuable or you can
really get down on yourself about that
then you try to adjust how you're
operating so that things turned out
better and but they keep happening and
there's a lot of emotional energy can be
wasted by people in situations like this
and I have a an example that this kind
of situation reminds me of when I was in
computer camp in high school programming
on Commodore 64's my gray hair and you
see it there was a girl at camp who had
this game where she pretended she had a
pot like she was doing a witch's brew
and she had a cauldron and she would say
okay I'm throwing in a flower and leaf a
pencil and I see and I see Ashley or
she'd throw in you know it was some
random things and stir it and she'd say
somebody's name and so the game was to
figure out what algorithm she used to
say that person's name so to figure out
what she was doing and so I SAT there
and I watched to observe this very
quietly trying to figure it out and I
noticed after you know she'd done it
like ten times she was seeing the names
of everybody there
except for me she never said my name and
I didn't know why I thought maybe
shouldn't like me maybe I you know I was
a geek among geeks and she was just
trying to leave me out or something I
don't know I was in high school but it
turned out that the rule was she would
say the name of the person who spoke
last so I was sitting there quietly
trying not to interfere but observing
and by my own you know in action I
caused her never to say my name and then
I felt bad and it turned out that i
didn't know it but i didn't know the
rules of the game and I was getting down
on myself but it turns out that it was
always within my control if I had
participated more fully that she would
have called my name so it's kind of
ironic so you know that seems symbolic
to me of what this kind of over-analysis
situation can be I didn't have enough
data I made some assumptions I got down
on myself about something that really
could have been different if I had acted
differently it was just I didn't know
the rules right in this case that was
the point that you didn't know the rule
alright so there's a standard way of
approaching people so in this case I
could have if it was a real life
situation I could have said well it made
me feel bad when you didn't ever say my
name why is that and whatever she could
have explained the rule to me I'm
eventually but a friend of mine calls us
the quantum physics response when you do
X I feel why is the response to cash let
me back up a little bit save somebody's
interrupting you a lot in meetings and
you will need to talk to that person
because they're getting in your way you
can't just q-tip you have to actually
confront the person you would go up to
them and you would say well when you
interrupt me in meetings I feel like
you're not valuing my input I like okay
and the idea is that you're observing
something that happened you know I
notice
that you interrupted me three times
during this meeting or so on you're
observing what happened factually and
then you're stating what your reaction
is and by doing that the reason that my
friend calls the Siq wantam physics
response is you're observing it and you
may actually change that person's
behavior in the future just by having
said that statement regardless of where
it go is that conversation goes by
observing it you may change the dynamic
because you're shedding light on what
your experience is that they might not
have been thinking about so by observing
it you're changing it but you want to
give them an out you want to say well I
know you're really excited about this
project you know maybe just didn't
realize what you were doing but you know
this bothers me so you're not coming up
to them and saying you're such a jerk
why do you always interrupt man meetings
you're going to get their backs up right
you don't want to confront people that
way when you give them a way to get out
of the situation gracefully yet still
know what your perspective is you can
ask them to clarify you know was that
why or was there some other reason why
you kept interrupting me and you'll ask
them and maybe there was some other
reason that would make sense to you
maybe you know they were in a Russian
one and make sure the point got in
quickly or something I mean there could
have been something else going on it's
possible and talk about next time so
next time you're in a meeting and the
person interrupts you and you're going
to try not to interrupt you hopefully
but and they interrupt you how are you
going to handle it are you going to
agree that you're going to kick them
under the table or no give them a sign
or say no please let me finish my point
and then he's got to listen at that
point you know to how however you agree
to handle it in the future but it's you
really should try to look for well you
know this is a pattern it's hard to
break a pattern how are we going to
break it and if it continues then you
may have to start documenting it or
or escalating it in some way but this is
just a standard way for people to have
those hard conversations but starting
off with a very factual calm approach to
it that people are open to all right so
those are my first two observations of
challenges that my clients have faced
the third one is perhaps the most
obvious sometimes the women feel
isolated especially if there are the
only woman in a group in their work
group they may feel that there's no one
there who can do I don't know you chat
with in the bathroom or whatever you
know obviously you could feel alone but
in addition to feeling alone a lot of
women also feel like an out like
outsiders like not only are they by
themselves without close friends in the
group but or be else's close friends
without you and you're being left out a
lot of times they won't ask for help it
won't reach out to these people they
feel separate from them like they can't
connect with those people in a
meaningful way or can't show any
vulnerability by asking for help and
also often women yeah I as a working mom
I was always pushed for time I was work
work work work I didn't want to make the
time to reach out and socialize with
people and build relationships with
people because I had to run home and
make dinner for my kids or whatever so
you know part of that feeling
comfortable reaching out has to do with
valuing the relationships that you have
with your coworkers and the informal
time getting to know them oh so some
other reasons why this happens sometimes
we just want to prove ourselves we don't
ask them for help and you want to prove
you know as a woman I can do this I can
meet this challenge and I'm going to do
it you know myself independently
and so that contributes to a feeling of
isolation we don't want to bother others
challenge the status quo the culture
that's already there I wish to expose
any vulnerability oh I didn't really
know python that well but I don't want
them to know that because then they'll
pick on me about it or something and
which really underneath that is not
trusting your co-workers to show
vulnerability to them and in the
expectation that they will help you
rather than criticize you for and
there's also this intersection of you
know where women and we're techies
techies you know stereotypically tend to
be loners or work well in isolation and
probably that's worked well for you in
the past in school you can put you know
little smart people here you probably
were able to get your projects done
without reaching out to your coworker or
your your classmates to get your work
done so why change now why start
reaching out now ok so i think at Google
you're pretty good with this in terms of
the culture the teamwork and the team
based projects that a lot of how you get
things done around here is because you
know people you know the right people to
go to or you find out in it your success
depends a lot on how strong your network
is or how much influence you have with
people so I think at Google compared to
other places you're probably pretty good
as far as reaching out and not feeling
isolated compared to other places but it
really another thing that comes down to
for me is really making the time
realizing that your work is not just
staring at the screen your work is also
reaching out to people getting to know
them trusting them asking them for help
you know there's also the value of
networking within the company or outside
in other groups and mentoring and
coaching can also help all of those
things can help you feel comfortable
reaching out to people
I
so that was my third point my fourth
point is a lot of the women that I've
coached are very humble humble to the
point of almost doubting their abilities
sometimes and they have this frustration
of I know I'm good enough to do this
work but why aren't they giving it to me
why did I not get on that project why am
I not being given the the kind of work
that I want to get do they not realize
that I can do it well is that their
fault in part of what our jobs it r is
letting people know what we're capable
of and that's something that's harder
for women to do I think they don't want
to feel like they're bragging okay so it
reminded me of this quote from a book
called leading geeks by Paul Glennon
which is a book about tech culture
trying to explain the tech organization
culture to like a business person who's
trying to figure out how to work with
techies and he's he characterizes a lot
of tech organization cultures as having
this weird geek dominance dynamic where
the way that people demonstrate their
skills is through butting heads about
technical issues and sort of a
one-upsmanship approach of well you know
I know how to design it better i know
this language better i can i can make
mine faster whatever and and it can
really get nasty sometimes but it's not
personal it's this a cultural way of
establishing what you know that you know
people from other organizations might
look at and say why are they why are
they acting this way now should women be
doing this too and women are reluctant
to butt heads as much as man do so is
this the model that we should be
shooting for to feel more comfortable
with this kind of behavior
so Jim Collins says no that's not really
the way to go Jim Collins wrote the book
good to great he also had an article
about level 5 leadership in the Harvard
Business Review a few years back and
level 5 leadership is when he considers
to be the ultimate form of leadership
it's not just you know a charismatic
leader able to leave the troops in the
future but a level 5 liter has different
qualities so he goes into a lot of
detail about those qualities and one of
them is personal humility he did a study
of many companies that had succeeded in
their industry where their peers had
failed and he was trying to figure out
why they succeeded and it was because of
this level five leadership that he
identified when a characteristics of
that leadership was personal humility
which is he which surprised him he
thought okay you know the jack welch's
of the world the ones with all the that
charisma and belief in their own
abilities are the most successful and he
he said no a lot of the best leaders
really are very humble about their own
abilities maybe there's some value in
that and not bragging and we're not
beating heads with people to establish
your dominance over them so just along
the lines of personal humility the way
he describes it is that it's kind of two
sides to it you're modest and willful so
there's a strength there's a backbone
behind this humility humble and fearless
not boastful but quietly determined so
you know the idea that he comes up with
us you're balancing something you know
knowing that you're good but not
bragging about yourself it's still
pushing for what you want and that's
that's an art to find that balance
another thing he talks about is being
ambitious for the company fighting for
things for the better the company rather
than for yourself and he has this
wonderful image of looking out the
window and not the mirror he said
five leaders when they when their
organization succeeds at something they
look out the window and say oh well the
conditions were right for it there was
something out there that you know helped
us get here you know they don't they're
not just patting themselves on the back
and when there's a problem they look in
the mirror they say okay what could we
have done differently why did this
happen to us whereas a lot of people
tend to take the easier route of you
know if something goes bad look out the
window and blame the conditions you know
the recession or the bubble burst or
whatever and then when things go well
look in the mirror and say how wonderful
you know and bright we are patting
themselves on the back so it's just a
different way of thinking about that
humility so I think you know our
challenge is to try and figure out how
we can demonstrate that personal
humility but at the same time
communicate our strengths but trying to
find a balance there where we're not
boastful but we are willing to
communicate what we've accomplished and
get the respect and acknowledgement from
others that we are as capable as we are
kind of time back into that impostor
syndrome so there a couple ways that you
can do this in practice one way that
I've heard of is every day someone one
of the women who gave advice one of the
engineers said that every day her team
would have a quick 10-minute stand-up
meeting where everybody said what they
did yesterday and what they were
planning on doing today and so that way
in a very informal well in a very short
time commitment you can communicate your
skills your accomplishments and
everybody in the team will hear and and
everyone speaking up so it's not like
it's just the people who feel like
speaking up in the meeting everybody has
to contribute to that process talking
informally at the watercooler hey you
know I just launched this project I'm
really proud of it i think it's going
really well it was a lot of hard work
and it's really just you're proud of
your accomplishments for the company's
sake not that you're bragging
if you don't show respect for yourself
then that you're not going to be able to
do that kind of thing if you're if
you're not if you don't have the
confidence in yourself how can you
inspire others to have the confidence in
you taking the time to build
relationships people will get to know
you better and know your learn about
what you're able to do finding a way to
not brag this key so it doesn't feel
like bragging to you and one thing you
can do is also look at your resume if
you're doubting yourself or you feel
that people don't know what you're
capable of sometimes it's helpful just
to look back at your resume I know that
Google has your google resumes available
to other people so if people are busy
and you're new to a team and you want to
make sure they know what you're capable
of it you know in Google it's very easy
to point them to your resume but not a
lot of companies have something that
organized so you're very lucky but one
thing I in my article in the women in
engineering article that I mentioned
earlier I interviewed a CIO at Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson and she talked about mentoring
and one of the things she does as part
of her mentoring is go through the
person's resume with them and rework it
and really focus on their
accomplishments and the impact that they
have rather than just describing
technical details you know take it a
step further and really highlight you
know what was that thing that you did
that what was the real accomplishment
there what was the hard part and and
what impact did that work have on the
company and the company's success and
she said that when she does that with
people they come out of the process
feeling much more proud of themselves
than they did earlier and having a
different view of themselves as a
successful person at the company so she
finds that to be very valuable exercise
okay
so the next next observation is my
favorite one I call it the accommodator
and I see this with almost everybody I
coach every woman so we tend to want to
avoid conflict and when somebody makes a
request of us we want to help them we
want to say yes we want to do what
they're asking of us and also if we need
something and somebody can't help us we
might be more willing than than men are
in general to accept a no and not push
harder to get that person to help us or
find a way to make it happen we might
just take it on ourselves and end up
being overworked and frazzled and also
there's been a lot of research around
negotiation and women being reluctant to
negotiate and that's part of the
conflict avoidance so it's it's very
easy for women to become overwhelmed
with with what's on our plate and of
course men tend to but there are some
aspects of that that are more prevalent
in women so one of the things actually
one of my clients told me about was how
to prioritize your tasks and not just
putting a list you know i'll give you a
one two three ranking or whatever to
help you figure out what you should be
doing and what you should say no to she
had gotten from Jon Bentley who at the
time was at Bell Labs I believe he said
abaya now this Venn diagram where what
you really want to be doing in terms of
prioritizing your workers priority on
the things that are in the intersections
in this diagram and so I don't know if
you can see it's three circles one
represents skill one represent what
you're interested in and one represents
the business needs so if somebody is
asking you to do something that you're
not interested in doing but there's a
business need for it maybe you should
consider doing it but ideally
you want to find something that's an
intersection of all three of those
something where you have the skill and
the interest and the business need and
then if you can't get that kind of work
you at least try to find something that
has is in the intersection of two of the
circles if it's only in one of the
circles and not in the intersection you
could probably make a good argument why
you're not the person for the job you
okay other things you can do our set
limits say you know I really find that
when I'm on more than two projects
things just fall through the cracks i
really can't take on a third project or
you know i really try to just go to only
two conferences a year please don't make
me go to this third conference or this
training you know put some limits on
what works for you by looking at you
know your your history and what's been
successful delegating is also another
one I know it's hard especially for your
transitioning from an engineer to a tech
lead role or management role to give up
the need to do it all yourself to
actually give it away and trust somebody
else to do it but part of becoming a
leader is learning how and when is
better to let somebody else help you out
and get it done rather than doing it all
yourself or feeling that you have to do
it all yourself and finally look for
opportunities to negotiate if somebody
wants you to get on to a project say
well okay I really would like to help
you out there and get on that project
with you but I've got these other things
that are getting in the way maybe you
can help me take some of those off of my
plate or find somebody else to it and
and see if you can negotiate something
that will work for everybody rather than
taking on something that you feel is you
know an undue burden on yourself
okay so here are the statistics eight or
nine times more likely and there is a
great quote from another Harvard
Business Review article by one of the
authors of nice girls don't ask it said
women don't often get what they want or
often don't get what they want and
deserve because they don't ask for it so
that was the not seeing they are not
taking the opportunity to negotiate or
not seeing the possibility of
negotiating I know why do we tend not to
negotiate we see it as the form of
conflict that we want to avoid if we ask
for something for ourselves we may
damage the relationship with the person
where you're asking it up so the
argument goes well I don't want to ask
them for money for more money for my
salary because I want to start off on a
good footing with people I don't want
them to think it's just about the money
whereas the guys would say well you know
they're going to expect me to negotiate
for my salary isn't that part of the
whole process and you know I owe it to
myself to do it and if I get a higher
salary great if I don't no harm no foul
it's just part of the hiring game so two
different ways to thinking about the
same situation it turns out that what
they teach in business school is not to
see negotiation as a conflict anyway but
to see it as a collaborative effort
where two sides are working together and
that tends to be more of how women when
they do negotiate and how they approach
it and there was a study of 300 women
executives asking them well how do you
negotiate how do you perform a
successful negotiation and the answer
they came up with turnout was valuable
for everyone not just women or or you
know not excluding men and what
successful female executives did in
general which is what's called shadow
negotiation if you have something you
really want to push through the way to
do it is to meet with people
individually do a lot of prep work in
advance so that you can familiarize
people with your ideas and your
rationales you have an opportunity to
hear what their objections are what
their concerns are and so you're kind of
building
your case to the point where when you
get to the actual negotiation table the
you're really familiar with what they
want and they know what you want other
things that can help is sometimes we
feel more comfortable negotiating on the
behalf of others and not just for
ourselves it seems less selfish that way
and it can also be like a mama bear
fighting for her cubs you know to get
more you know bonus money or whatever
and also be aware of ambiguity a lot of
the space where men will negotiate and
women won't is when you're not really
sure what the rules are and so the men
will push the rules and see if they can
get something and you just try where the
women will say well I didn't know I
could do that I didn't know how the
hiring process worked okay so what can a
manager do to help with this situation
first of all don't just give when asked
because then they'll tend to give more
to men because men will tend to ask more
also let women know what is negotiable
try to remove that ambiguity and say
look we kind of expect you to start
bucking for promotion or to start you
know pushing trying to negotiate for
different harder projects and so on and
once women realized that that's okay to
do that they'll go ahead and do it is
they'll realize that it's not going to
threaten the relationship it's actually
okay ok so now I'm at the part where I
was going to talk about advice I know
it's slightly after five so I'm just
going to run through it real quick and
if you are interested in hearing more
about the stories please feel free to
send me an email so what I found
reassuring about this whole advice
process that I went through with the
people as I mentioned at the beginning
my talk was that a lot of advice fell
into those five categories of
observation that I had talked about
earlier here and and so it was really
reassuring to me and it serves as a good
recap for what we've talked about here
today okay so as far as the imposter
phenomenon
karen luck said the best advice she got
was you know more than they do which is
one of them one of her professors said
to her when she was about to drop out of
her engineering program and she realized
that there was just a lot of bravado by
the guys about how easy it was and it
was really hard for everyone and she was
doing well and be true to yourself you
know another good piece of advice as far
as overanalyzing don't compare your
insides to someone else's outsides you
know your internal motivation you don't
know other people's internal motivations
and if you start trying to spin in your
head around why something happened
you're you may not be able to figure out
without talking to them sometimes face
to face is very helpful and sure Google
knows that with the VCS and everything
but sometimes we get caught in email
cycles and you could really build a
relationship better by stopping by in
person don't be afraid to ask for help
that's a big one they used to call me
question lady I would annoy people
because I kept asking I kept wanting to
learn and it's a sign of intelligence
they say not to compliment myself here
but I love this one make sure people
know the value of your work so instead
of thinking about it was speaking up and
bragging about your accomplishments
think of it as part of your job is to
show your value and you know in addition
to giving value to the company and be
your own cheerleader because nobody else
will your manager might occasionally
your tech lead might occasionally but
it's really not first and foremost on
their minds it's your responsibility
primarily i love this if you want
something ask for it don't be a sleeping
beauty speak up don't wait for it to
come to you okay now my last couple of
slides it lists some of the resources
that I've mentioned that I found
valuable in coaching I also have a list
of resources up on my website a lot of
these are on there
the women don't ask negotiation in the
gender divide is a book all about women
and negotiation okay and i have a
website feel free to look it up and find
out more about me what would i do why
working with a coach is valuable and how
the coaching process works any questions
we went out in California thanks for
sticking with me through it and enjoy
