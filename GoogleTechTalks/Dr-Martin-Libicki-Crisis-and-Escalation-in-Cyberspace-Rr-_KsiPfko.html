watching this hawk on google's youtube
channel my name is krista faye and on a
member of the toxic google team here in
Google's Los Angeles office we are very
pleased to welcome dr. Martin Lavinia
senior management scientists from the
RAND Corporation dr. Levin Keys research
focuses on the impacts of information
technology on domestic and national
security the topic he has published
extensively on over the years the title
of today's talk is crisis and escalation
in cyberspace please join me in
welcoming dr. libecki thank you oh thank
you for inviting me well I guess that's
a title of the talk actually what this
is is a title of a monograph that ranch
to be producing in the next month or two
if you want to really think of the title
of the talk it's going to be closer to
something like why cyberwar really isn't
war and I kind of want to start with
basic history pretty much as soon as
people learn to walk on two legs rather
than four people learn to make war on
each other and you had the origin of
armies we had sort of mastered the
ground medium and when people learn to
get onto little dugout canoes and even
better put up sales and rose and oars
and galleys people had mastered the
naval medium and thus we had naval
warfare it wasn't until 1903 when the
wright brothers could master
heavier-than-air flight that we had
mastered the air domain and thus we had
air forces and of course until we put
things in orbit we couldn't even start
thinking about space warfare well there
are a lot of people where I work
particularly across the street from
where I work which happens to be the
Pentagon what you're thinking about
cyberspace as a new domain of warfare
here I suppose my voice should get
really deep but it's something very
curious about cyberspace yes you
couldn't have cyber war until you
actually had a cyberspace but the reason
we have cyber war is because we haven't
mastered the medium what do I mean by
that generally speaking if you've got a
computer it's supposed to do what you
think the computer is supposed to do
right it's supposed to be under your
control not on the control of some
random guy 10,000 miles away
cave somewhere but it doesn't always
work out that way it turns out that
sometimes our systems under the controls
of people who don't really mean to do is
very any good and for the most part we
can go into exceptions you know in
questions for the most part people have
that kind of control over your machine
because of errors in the construction of
software or errors in the construction
of the relationship between hardware and
software in other words the reason we
have cyber war is not because we've
mastered the medium of cyberspace it's
because we haven't mastered the medium
of cyberspace and within these mistakes
is you have the potential for all sorts
of nasty things to take place okay this
is particularly true if you talk about
cyber war in terms of malware and most
of what people are talking about if it's
talking about the so-called advanced
persistent threat if you're talking
about things such as Stuxnet if you're
talking about the attack on a ram CO and
Rask acid Secretary of Defense Panetta
mentioned last month it's in terms of
malware in other words code that is
inserted into your computer that allows
the bad guy to make your computer do
certain things presumably that you don't
want done now not all of security issues
are malware if you had a world in which
you had no malware you would still have
security issues but as I say anymore I
guess military context if you could get
rid of malware you could turn cyber war
into a from a four-star issue into about
a 1 or 2 star issue in other words it
would become the province of security
professionals who could tell you all
sorts of interesting ways that people
could do things to your computer but you
wouldn't read about it so much in the LA
Times or The Washington Post or whatever
and then in many respects is a
definition of cyber war let me just make
a little statement about the
relationship between three things one is
when you have a system or software it's
what the design manual says it's going
to do right that's how that's how the
people who built it think it's going to
behave
and then the next part is what you think
the computer is going to do but there's
a third part and that's what the code
says the computer is going to do and I'm
sure you guys know this better than I'm
going to ever know this if there's ever
an argument between the design spec in
the code the code is always correct it
is always a better predictor what the
machine is going to do then the design
spec now as computer professionals I'm
sure you folks try to make the code
resemble the design spec as well as you
can but as computer professionals you
also know that systems are extremely
complex and they're getting more complex
with every given day and that means that
the task of making the code look like
the spec is a very very difficult one
and it shows no systematic signs of
getting any easier and if the crack
between those two is only to be speaking
metaphorically a bitstream wide that
leaves enough room for the hacker the
bad guys so to speak to get into the
system but I want to mention something
else and that is architecture we have we
have an architecture for pcs which is
now about 35 years old from the ancient
CPM machines from the ancient apple
machines I got my first personal
computer in 1983 in those days you
approached personal computers with a
screwdriver literally I actually had to
assemble my computer from from parts cos
x turns out because of IBM strange
pricing it was a lot cheaper that way
but the point I want to make is that the
pc the computer in general was meant to
be almost infinitely manipulable by the
user that in fact the original owners of
pcs back in the late 70s and early 80s
were hobbyists they said oh this is
interesting let's see what it will do
just like they were sort of the
descendants of the folks that had
racecars in the 1950s and 60s and that's
all good and that was lots of fun but
when you have a system that is open to
that kind of manipulation and you
connected to a network
then all of a sudden you have effects
that are much more serious than I can
make a mistake with my computer okay
with the architectural feature of the pc
that allows it to be subject to malware
is essentially the notion that you can
have programs to it and you can add if
this is a Microsoft machine you can add
programs to the register and the
computer will actually run the programs
that are in the register in that order
or in some sort of order when you boot
up the machine now it's also possible to
envision by the way a computer that
cannot have malware in it and that is to
say by putting four ninety percent of
all computer users and I don't think any
of you folks are in the ninety percent
it's sufficient if I give you a pc or an
apple equivalent that's got office
automation tools and a web browser and I
can put it all in hardware and give it
to you and I say here's three years with
a computer now when you're done at the
end of three years of course it will be
three years out of date now you're
actually talking to somebody who still
has windows office 97 running and it's
computer upstairs and that's about a 15
year old program it probably has a few
bugs in it but all I'm suggesting is
that the computer does not have the
architecture to accept new good programs
it also will not have the architecture
to accept new bad programs I am not
advocating this as a way to build
computers I am saying the ability of the
trade-off is still there okay so that's
the basic factors that you proud you
folks probably know better than I do now
let's take a look at what happens when
something bad happens is your computer
well it turns out in Washington DC we're
like the seven blind men with the
elephant and everybody takes a look at
the problem of computer insecurity from
their own lens if you work for DoD it's
a cyberwar problem if you work for the
FBI it's a cyber crime problem if you
work for the intelligence community it's
a sort of it's an opposite problem
operational security problem but of
course if you work for the other end of
the intelligence community it's an op
SEC opportunity that's kind of like what
intelligence does and now i'm going to
pick on my good friends at DHS because
if you work at the HS it's a cyber
terrorism problem
now it's also a perimeter control
problem and that leads to some very
interesting implications for our DHS
spends its money now take a look at DHS
this is not a Washington Krauts I don't
expect you actually know the answer what
are the four largest components of DHS
one of them is immigrations and Customs
Enforcement closer related is border and
customs border bc borders something
patrol right what are their main
functions to guard the perimeter of the
United States against things that we
don't want in the United States then the
number three is the coast guard well as
a word guard in it what is the function
of the Coast Guard apart from pulling
pulling drunken fishermen out of the
water and that's the guard the coastline
of the United States they're the last
line so to speak of maritime defense and
then finally you have the Transportation
Security Administration see okay now
ninety percent of what they do is to
guard a perimeter the perimeter between
you and the the gate so to speak to
airline gates given that it's in their
history given that in the constant
construction is it any wonder the DHS
thinks of cyber security as a perimeter
control problem rather than is say and
engine by the way if you guys have
watched waiting for the slide to change
it doesn't change until about 30 minutes
in okay I want to relieve some tension
you may have okay guys were wondering
one thing I got to go to the next slide
DHS has a cyber security budget of about
a half a billion dollars roughly
three-quarters of that money is spent
constructing a giant firewall around the
civilian government or what I can call
for short the gov domain which
interestingly leads to an irony they
spend three quarters at our budget
protecting the two percent of their
country that's in the dot gov domain
leaving one quart of their budget to
protect the ninety-eight percent of the
country that's outside the gov domain
and sometimes you want to remind these
guys at DHS takami may actually work for
the taxpayers but now
it may not be where we want to go okay
let me talk a little bit about terrorism
here also because it also gives if you
fallen in the debates in Washington you
know that a lot of people are
enthusiastic about the notion of
information sharing we're going to do
information sharing and we're going to
put a big dent in North cyber security
problem okay how many of you have played
the game of Clue right what's the game
of clue about you know mr. green with a
pipe wrench in the ballroom right in a
terrorism if I've got information
advanced information I want to know
who's coming at me I want to know where
they're planning to attack and I want to
know how they're planning to attack but
frankly I don't care that much about how
because except for extraordinary events
such as 911 it's going to be a gun a
pipe in our car bomb or something you
know something like that right so let's
take this same model and talk about
information sharing and cybersecurity
and so you have the same priorities you
want to know who's attacking you want to
know where they're going to attack and
you want to know how they're going to
attack and then you think about this for
a minute and said well you know I don't
really want need to know who's attacking
because that's not going to change
anything and it'd be nice to know who
they're going to attack but in fact they
could change their minds in almost
instantly what I do want to know is how
they're going to attack specifically
what software vulnerabilities are they
going to take advantage of because
that's how gay you get in that's the
interesting stuff right remember good
software they're not supposed to get in
but somehow they do problem here and
then you think about this for another
minute it's let's say I'm a chemical
producer right and the whole notion of
information sharing is I get together
with other Mike my other chemical
producer friends and I say have the
hackers been at you lately yes no maybe
so they try to do this I've had problems
with that and then you go off and have
coffee or tea or whatever whatever it is
you drink that's not the information
sharing I'm interested in I want someone
to go to the guy who's got the software
with the vulnerability let the bad guy
in or who let the bad you know who left
there are other vulnerabilities having
to do with the spreading through the
network and i want to say you've got a
vulnerability here i want you guys to
work on a fix and having put worked on a
fix I want you guys to proliferate the
fix
and I want the problem fixed as a
chemical manufacturer exactly how that
problem is fixed it's kind of really
secondary for me but all of a sudden if
you're taking a look at that model
you're taking a look at a different
notion of information sharing and then
you're asking the question not too how
do peers put information together but
what is the mechanism by which we inform
the identification of vulnerabilities so
that we can get a fix on their
vulnerabilities much much different
problem but it doesn't really fit into
the terrorist mold because that's on how
you think about terrorism which is kind
of kind of comes to the same thing that
I want to kind of reiterate it's
different this is not a form of warfare
a form of crime a form of intelligence
collection although actually comes
closest their form of terrorism that
just happens to take place in another
domain it's got its own rules here ok
now another thing that I think about
when I think about cyber terrorism is he
I don't know you've heard of this the
cyber 911 the bad guys coming into our
system and wreaking all sorts of
mischief and the more I thought about it
I mean I I say well I don't know how
like this 911 is maybe more likely it
may be less likely on September 10th
2001 not many people predicted the 911
that was going to take place even those
it turns out there was a precedent but
now let's look at 911 for a minute 911
killed about 3,000 folks that about 100
million bucks worth of damage and then
the United States government reacted to
911 and we established DHS and a lot of
other security controls and we went to
two wars as a result of which six
thousand Americans died ten to 20,000
was severely wounded we paid about a
trillion dollars in war and about
another half a trillion dollars and
other associated expenses so you're
thinking minute for a minute and said
you know 9-12 was a lot more expensive
and dangerous the 911 was so I've got me
to thinking about the question what
would a 912 look like in cyberspace and
the answer wasn't a particular good one
this is why I love to come outside of
Washington because they get a little
crazy inside the beltway here okay one
thing we're going to
do is retaliate against the guy who did
it and in fact the more the damage the
faster is going to be the retaliation
well anybody who's worked in cyber
forensics can tell you it's not one of
the things that's instant okay sometimes
it takes a lot of work if the guy
doesn't really want retaliation they're
interesting ways of making it look like
somebody else but if you've got a
political pressure to retaliate you may
say you know I'd love to have the
complete picture but I've got to go why
now who cares I've got to go on what I
got right and so you end up retaliating
without necessarily knowing why the
attack took place and without a hundred
percent confidence that you know who
carried out the attack and if you've
ever played strategy games you know that
the word worse than having one enemy is
having two enemies by basically by
retaliating somebody who didn't do it
you may end up with two enemies
something else to worry about is a trade
war people talk about cyber attack as if
it's one level below kinetic conflict
but in fact when you think about all our
trade relationships with the world you
realize that but that the the odds of a
trade conflict are in fact much greater
as a result of a cyber war and as a
result of getting excited about a cyber
war oh we can't let any of these
products because we don't trust up well
then we can't let any of these products
from you because we don't trust these
right you may have read about a month or
so ago there was a congressional report
on huawei and how we couldn't trust the
stuff that coming in from Huawei right
only if you looked at the report all you
could tell was that Huawei wasn't
enthusiastic about answers answering
congressional inquiries oh okay but the
good stuff was supposed to be in the
classified appendix which i haven't seen
by the way but Reuters did and it told
us is no good stuff over there either
but someone we don't trust them well so
the Chinese province who declared that
they're not going to buy cisco either
these sorts of things can get out of
hand okay let's talk about some other
reactions how many of you familiar with
the term of active defense that's one of
those euphemisms for we're going to get
you before you get us right there's a
some very bright people who sit at Fort
Meade who love this active
defense stuff and you kind of have to
worry if in fact your active defense is
going to do what they think they do
remember there was a rocky weapons of
mass destruction and I don't have to say
very much more to know that even the
best of intelligence can sometimes get
things wrong okay another thing that
there's going to be a lot of pressure to
after at cyber 911 is a national
firewall across the United States now a
national firewall would be an enormous
undertaking which some people by the way
are glad to take taxpayer money to do
but that essentially means that some
computer is going to read every email
that you write that happens to go
outside the country now it turns out
that probably more emails and then one
would think go outside the country
because of all sorts of routing issues
but that's neither here nor there that's
a lot of emails to be read okay well if
we're going to have a national firewall
then the one thing we can't afford to
have is encryption right because the
encryption defeats a firewall because
you can't read the stuff that's going
through it which means you can't have
open wat and you need hard
authentication because we have to know
where everything is coming from which
means we all need good cyber IDs which
means we can't have open Wi-Fi which
means we can't have tour you're all
familiar with what Torres right it's
good good crowd right and it means you
can't have things like PGP well that's a
lot to pay for not having a cyberattack
if you thought a national firewall would
work which by the way it may not for a
whole lots of other reasons and then
this is whole notion of well it could
have attacked could have come from a bad
website so we want the ability to take a
look at everything that's on a website
even before it's posted and I probably
don't even have a good enough
imagination to imagine all the things
that people who don't understand the
internet are going to want to put on the
Internet so that's why I worry about us
at cyber 911 not for what it will do but
for how it will motivate the people who
are going to react to it to do things as
a result of a 911 okay let me switch a
little bit from the subject of cyber war
and get into sort of the nuclear
strategy for a little bit because it
illustrates a question up
out whether the existence of cyber war
the existence of cyber security is going
to be a destabilizing factor I do this
by the way worked at ran that made its
reputation on this whole nuclear
business and five-year have you any of
you ever been in Santa Monica City Hall
this is really nice sculpture here
called chain reaction there's a town
that does not like it's leading employer
quite so much at any rate one of the
things that people worried about is if
somebody was asked to do a study on
worship bomber bases be in Europe it
turns out that it's probably the many
ways the most famous study that ran had
ever done and it was based on the
principle that if you're within range if
the enemy's within range chances are so
are you so if you put your planes too
close to the Soviet Union there's a
possibility the Soviet Union can wipe
out your entire nuclear force in which
case all that deterrence you thought you
have would come to nothing so the whole
notion of a second strike and
instability that the guy who goes first
in nuclear weapon has his existential
edge over the other guy and the nuclear
community has been spending in our
decades and decades working on the
problem and if you guys are interested
in nuclear strategy I can answer more
questions about that but let me say a
lot of people worried about that in
cyberspace as well they're worried that
because offense is dominant over defense
that in fact the first strike could be
disabling and if a first strike is
disabling then you've got the incentives
to go first and in a world in which the
incentives to go first to go on the
offense is a world in which you have a
great deal of instability well let's
step back for a minute how unstable is
all the cyber we're going to be well
first thing I have to mention is we
still have nuclear weapons and nuclear
weapons can still Trump cyber weapons in
fact if I had to make a chart I started
to make a seriousness chart like this Oh
nuclear war here a large conventional
war here hurricanes we had a little
something called sandy a few weeks ago
nice and breezy over in Washington
fortunately not my
damage and then finally have a cyber
attack which may or may not come close
to Sandy so those those nuclear weapons
are still useful to have in your pocket
if you're worried about anything else
now well what about a cyberattack under
nuclear infrastructure I can't rule it
out how many of you seen have seen the
movie wargames right that was based on
the presumption that there's a modem
bank on the side of the command and
control computers for Stratcom I kind of
rather doubt it and in fact the folks
who run strat comm actually the folks
who run our ICBM force have gone
publicly and saying it can happen um are
they right I think they actually are at
least I'd like to think that they're
right and part of the reason they might
be right is because this is one of those
things or you don't really want to get
all happy about networking yes it is
true if I cannot dial in a nuclear
attack from home I've actually have to
get dressed to come to the offices start
a nuclear war but I consider this a very
small inconvenience given everything
that's at stake right and into turns out
if you actually look at nuclear the
Arsenal it's fairly primitive and it's
primitive they have managed to be do
they have managed to ignore this siren
siren call of networking for a lot of
this stuff and that's a good thing and
by the way it's also a good thing if the
other side also ignores the siren call
of networking because we really don't
want anything funny to happen than their
nuclear weapons because those are the
ones are actually pointed at us so as a
level some horde of a some sort of
assurance okay now the other thing you
have to understand about cyber war is
this is one of those forms of warfare
where you can't really disarm the other
side by a cyber attack not very well at
least consider what are the four and a
half key components of a cyber war the
hacker the information that a hacker
knows or has access to a computer and
network connection right of those four
yeah you can knock somebody off the
network but I mean you're not going to
knock them off every single network in
the world because there's billions of
connections and yes there are ways in
theory that you can screw up with this
computer but water computers cost now at
299
ninety-nine at best buy not exactly very
hard to replace it's the whole notion
that you can cripple a country cyber
attack capability with your own cyber
attack capability that doesn't really
hold a great deal of water which means
by the way that there are a lot of
things you don't necessarily have to
worry about in cyberspace you hear a lot
of talk in Washington about a cyber arms
race right um but it's a big difference
in nuclear war in nuclear war nobody
thought that defenses were going to work
at the time in fact we still don't have
reasonably good defenses the kind of 50
50 ish is the stuff i've read so that
means it's like i got a thousand nukes
the Soviets have a thousand they have
two thousand oaks so I got to get my two
thousand oaks and and it would go on and
on and on like that right but in cyber
war it's not offense vs. offense its
offense vs. defense and in fact you
really don't know what kind of offensive
capabilities the other guy has if he's
got any good tradecraft at all so you
don't really have the basis for an arms
race people in nuclear business talk
about the the cycle between alert and
warning that if you raise if you react
in ways that anticipate a nuclear attack
the other guy is going to think that
you're preparing for a nuclear attack
you're not just anticipating in nuclear
attack and he's going to raise his alert
level on his offensive forces which
means you raise your alert level and
before you know it everybody is on a
hair-trigger alert alert and people
worried about that sort of stuff but now
here's my question I'm country ah
anybody here from org y or paraguay i
usually like to pick on those because i
can find nobody in my audience from that
okay you're an org way and you're
worried about a cyber attack from
Paraguay right and you notice Paraguay
cyber defenses are getting better what
do you conclude from this well yes
paraguay could be starting a an
unanswerable first strike on org why or
they finally got money in the cyber
security budget for paraguay or they
fire their Chiefs information systems
officer and hired a new one or there's
no opportunities here or a product came
in or really clever salesman walked out
the door when you look at all the
reasons that people acquire cyber
defenses
whoops going to stay past this line when
you look at all the reasons that people
acquire cyber defenses the fact that
they're going to war isn't prominent
among them okay so a cold look at what
you can and cannot do a cyberwar
suggests it's not all that in stable and
environment however crises are not
caused by what is true crisis are caused
by what is perceived to be true and in
cyberspace and in cyber war the
difference between perception and
reality is very big you have a nuclear
explosion you have what's called the
blinding flash of the obvious not give
me any mistake on what happened in
cyberspace you're going to have a great
deal of doubt and ambiguity people might
object because the level of
cyber-espionage teach you that you're
doing which was it acceptable at one day
is no long except tubulin another day
they may misinterpret defenses even
though they shouldn't okay they may have
too much concert confidence and
attribution in other words oh yeah i
think somebody did it and they go ahead
and strike back when it turns out they
really don't have much more of an
educated guess on the other hand you
could have instability if people have
too little confidence in your
attribution and they think they can
strike with impunity and so on and so
forth okay the important point to
remember here is that the distinction
between what is and what is perceived to
be it's particularly wide in this field
particularly when you think about how
much ignorance there is in this topic
it's almost kind of scary because there
are a lot of bright people who know a
lot of secrets in Washington who not
only don't reveal the secrets very much
but are talking to an audience that
wouldn't understand them even if they do
reveal to them the late Sen Ted Ted
Stevens referred to the Internet is what
a pile of tubes I don't think he's all
that a typical in terms of understanding
of cyberspace and when it comes to cyber
conflict there's even more to be
misinterpreting about let me switch a
little bit into questions of crisis in
crisis escalation okay this is the thing
that nuclear theorists talked about all
the time her
conferences wrote a book she was a first
book I ever bought about a half a
century go on escalation in nuclear
conflict okay but when you think about
escalation in a cyber context and how do
we keep a cyber conflict contained it
turns out it's very very difficult to
everybody to agree on all the same red
lines or in this case orange lines and
blue lines right let me give you a
scenario let's say we have a cyber
conflict with another large country not
to name any names right and we're
interested in crippling their ability to
conduct naval operations so we hack into
their afloat naval supply facility we
just want to mess up your logistics a
little bit you know I mean we're ready
shooting each other so I guess it's no
big deal and they say well we want to do
the same thing as far as we're concerned
attacks on military support well you've
introduced that into play so that's fair
game so they attacked WOM you know they
attack WOM sport which is in Asia right
and they say hold it that's an
escalation because you've gone from
attacks in the field to attacks on the
homeland and so we're going to look at a
target support at are up we're going to
attack it a port in your home country
and and the other guy says wow you've
just switched on attacks on military
support to attacks on civilian
infrastructure so we're going to attack
your coal-fired power plant and we say
hold it you've just escalated from
attacks on the homeland to attacks on
industrial safety well you folks can
illiterate and you can sort of basically
read the chart up here what's the
problem here the problem here is that
not one person in this confrontation
thought they cross the red line because
of them they didn't but according to the
other person they did so while each
person was reacting in what they thought
was under the knee thigh red lines it
turns out they escalate all the way up
to the top it turns out that's a tricky
little thing in cyberspace because that
requires a lot of nuance in terms of
where you think the red lines are the
other guy thinks that the red lines are
you know next month I'm going to be
sitting down with my counterparts from
the People's Republic of China and what
are called track 1.5 negotiations I can
assure you we're not even close to being
able in the go shade about that we're
not even close to being able to
basically discuss what is information
warfare because we have one definition
which is closer to you muck with my
machines and they have another
definition which is you put subversive
material into my country via oh this is
google youtube right Oh between the two
perspectives it's really hard to get the
first base and this is like fifth base
or sixth base in terms of nuances so I
don't have a great deal of confidence
here and what they call escalation
control and management okay to protect
that's another interesting notion in
cyberspace right you did this I didn't
like this I'm going to do that to you
and then you're going to learn that the
impact of your carrying out an attack is
in fact that you get an attack back tit
for tat right now tit for tat works
badly or well enough when you know what
happened but I would argue that with in
cyberspace there's a disjunction between
four things among four things what I
hope to do by attacking your system what
I think I've done by attacking your
system what you think you've that I've
done by attacking your system and then
finally what I really did by attacking
your system now some of this I can
understand you know it's a military
problem of battle damage assessment
right but it would seem obvious that at
least the perceived effects of the
attack are the same as the actual
effects of the attack right I mean the
guy that's got the stuff that's been
broken nose it's been broken well not
necessarily so you remember the Stuxnet
attack that attack was carried out
essentially from what I believe and read
in the papers and other things in late
two thousand nine the Iranians did not
realize they had a malware problem until
2010 and my hunch jun 2010 and my
hunches they didn't know that they had a
problem at Natanz until they read about
in the New York Times which would have
been late-september 2010 right
so these guys had gotten an attack but
because it was a corruption attack and
not a disruption attack they didn't have
they didn't have the insight as to what
was going on in their own system and it
was only because the attack spread to
some place well outside that the reactor
that in fact the chain of clues was
discovered so here's a tit-for-tat right
you start off with the intended effects
of the attack that is what's in the head
of the guy who was doing the attack the
guy you want to try to influence with
the tit-for-tat policy and then you get
to the actual effects of the attack
which may be different right and then
you get to the perceived effects of the
attack which may be different yet and
then I say well what's appropriate in
terms of what I want to create as an
effect going back which may be a
miscalculation because you're going to
say well what are that what were the
nature of equivalences particularly i
want to strike back in a proportional
manner and then i have the same air and
misperception and miscalculation going
around the other way so that by the time
the guy who's carrot decide to carry out
an attack has in turn been affected by
the attack you've got six forms of air
going around and you have end up having
a potentially a very very impress I smek
anism well a lot of other topics I could
cover but I'm kind of running out of
bandwidth here or at least energy or at
least oxygen but the bottom line i sort
of want to come to is the same I think
Washington is an error when they think
of cyber insecurity and conflict in
cyberspace as just one more thing that
they're familiar with that they just
take out the word physical and kinetic
and put in the word virtual and cyber
and they understand what they're talking
about and I want to basically say is you
have to understand this on first
principles and then when you understand
on principles you can walk through a lot
of the strategic and the policy issues
what you do so having a firm grasp of
what's actually going on in the machine
and not what it looks like it's going on
in the machine so that that concludes
and I'll take any questions
unless i reduced you all to stunned
silence well I guess I'll start with one
on sort of the policy side is you're
talking about this information sharing
mmm people so recently there's been mmm
this move to get some legislation to
make that mm-hm you have some tape on
that it's a good idea is that this guy
did what is the expression from Douglas
Adams books mostly harmless information
is good stuff okay there are some issues
having to do with how you write the
legislation in such a way that you don't
violate privacy privacy the Center for
Democracy and technology and a few other
groups in Washington I think I've been
working the issue I think and I'm not
that up on the current debate that
they're satisfied that the legislation
has been written carefully part of the
problem writing legislation is a
tendency to tack on notwithstanding any
other law dot dot dot which means they
just run roughshod over everything
that's ever happened before people get
nervous about this I think it sort of
been worked out but the question is not
whether that's a good thing or a bad
thing the question is is it going to do
enough good to be even worth while
bringing up in front of Congress and as
you can probably tell I am NOT
optimistic about how good information
sharing is that doesn't mean I'm against
it you can be for things that just don't
do very much good as long as they don't
do that if they do even less harm sure
information sharing about exploits huh
so first things like if someone is using
an exploit against us right we
necessarily want to share it because we
can catalog that
use it against you know it's also a
valuable weapon or ah now you have
touched a very interesting nerve okay as
I should talk about this one of my
colleagues who used to work at the
puzzle palace out in Maryland if I had
to make a plea a plea for what the money
should be used for I would say it would
be well spent and i think i have
actually actually said that in the talk
looking for vulnerabilities now there
are many ways you can look for
vulnerabilities you can hire people to
do that you do all sorts of things but
the current way is we pay something to
look for it we create a market in
vulnerabilities in fact Google does that
what bug bounties that's right right but
you know how we spend 60 billion dollars
a year on cybersecurity how much we
spend on bug bounties how many orders of
magnitude less think maybe four or five
I got two zeros you can see what i mean
by that there's a lot more money that
could be spent profitably it turns out
that there is a bug a malware market and
it's from what i understand it goes from
the bug hunter to somebody in the
defense world to need i say more so if
you've got one party that says I want
vulnerability so I can exploit them and
you got another party says I want
vulnerabilities I can fix them what do
you get when they're both in the market
a bidding war now if it turns out that
the US taxpayer is financing both ends
of the bidding war then we have what we
call implementation issues on the other
hand you want these guys that's afford
to do their job and you do want these
guys that you know DHS they were the
ones running it to do their job it's
just kind of unfortunate that they don't
necessarily see eye to eye because
they're not supposed to ah so you're we
were talking about the computers you can
install software on yes I'm wondering if
some
the things within these netbooks and the
cloud computing where the software is
basically not on your machine mm-hmm so
presumably what would help trusted
location that is a step in the direction
of what you were thinking well I mean
general Alexander wants he wants to get
the federal government to the cloud but
what he really wants is a much thinner
client you know I do remember the days
of the terminals with the acoustic
couplers that made me happy exactly
where we want to go but something like
that maybe the trade-off you know like a
lot of things what the trade-off you
make depends on what you have at stake
if you there are the trade-offs you want
to make for you know mon ha sitting in
Vacaville California who don't really
care if they have a virus on it because
all you're going to have the worst thing
you're going to have is you know DDoS
attack because they're a part of a
botnet and maybe that's not a major
problem on the other hand if i'm running
a nuclear power plant i want to make
another trade off entirely sometimes we
tend to forget in Washington the
different folks have different
requirements and that you protect some
some information its particular you know
I give you an example there's been a
report recently that 80 the advanced
persistent threats been all over
coca-cola right I'm willing to bet you
they didn't get cokes secret formula
because I'm willing to bet you they
didn't put on their internet I'd like to
think some guys that they keep in a safe
somewhere in atlanta right because
they've segregated information that they
need to protect from the information i
need to circulate was it turns out the
information he needs to circulate was
also about their purchase of an overseas
company was that a good idea was that it
useful trade off you know when they've
been better off I can't make that
decision but that's a decision that
people have to make what do you protect
what do you not protect or to give you a
bumper sticker in securities the price
we pay for convenience inconvenience is
the price we pay for security okay I can
say you've been a kind audience
