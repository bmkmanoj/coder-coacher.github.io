address President Bush spoke of America
being addicted to oil okay
many many scientists and researchers
before him have been saying similar
things that are burning of oil threatens
our national security and thankfully
we've now moved from arguing about
whether there is a problem to talk about
how to fix the problems the elephant in
the room is negative power opponents say
that you can supply us with hundreds or
thousands of years of carbon free
domestically produced power and
detractors point out that the way
stadium cost issues of existing power
plants are a big problem so many of
these points depend on the particular
characteristics of the pressurized water
reactors that are in use today but
pressurized water reactors aren't the
only kind of reactor possible back in
1950s before the first man gone into
space
researchers at Oak Ridge National Labs
built one and later a second molten salt
reactor these reactors are very
different from and someone say much more
promising than we pressurized water
reactors that were later commercialized
the workers other kids were very excited
about their work and just after orders
for the second generation of commercial
pressurized water reactors began to
start work on the molten salt reactor it
was canceled asked what our speaker
today dr. David look like started
working on nuclear fusion in the 1980s
his work on fusion led to an interest in
molten salts and that led to the story
of the molten salt reactor since then
he's changed his focus to redeveloping
the molten salt reactor and he'll
discuss it he'll be discussing what
happened four decades ago a white molten
salt reactor designs today take Karen
okay I have a lot to talk to you about
today I'm gonna go fairly fast but
hopefully give you a lot of information
piqued your interest to learn more so to
speak I am with the physics department
at Carleton University up in Ottawa
but I've also started a company in
Ottawa Valley Research Associates to try
to expand some of the things I've been
working on in filing patents etc first
questions can nuclear
can nuclear help solve our climate
change problems energy problems etc the
nuclear industry presently would be more
than happy with building about 400
reactors over the next 30 years or so
that's about all they could really
handle realistically that merely keeps
the status quo of sort of replacing
reactors that are shutting down the ones
that are 60 70 years old kind of thing
we need thousands of large reactors to
truly make a difference
so is there a way existing or next
generation there is a lot of designs out
there people have been trying to promote
for for decades now can can these other
designs realistically accomplish this
now when you're thinking about reactor
designs it's important to quantify all
the priorities and I can sort of list
seven here overall power costs
definitely of course and that should be
broken into capital cost which is often
quite expensive and then your fuel plus
operating maintenance is usually a lot
more reasonable overall safety
definitely job one so to speak we have
to do as much possible in that area
resource utilization is an area that
there's dramatic difference in different
reactor designs and you have to break
that into two categories as well the
quantity and quality of the starting
load how much fissile material you need
to start your reactor and what types can
you use can you use low enriched uranium
can you use and fuel some reactors can
use plutonium for in spent fuel but not
all the other nasty actinides all
shouldn't be showing the molten salt
reactors or liquid fluoride reactors as
they're also known can use those and
then there's also the annual or
requirements proliferation resistance
extremely important concept and that as
well as important to break into sort of
two areas subversion to a state program
is a country perhaps gonna take over the
technology and use it in nefarious ways
so to speak and then also more of an
individual thing or theft and war
terrorist takeover and terrorists steal
significant quantities of material then
there's also long-term radio long-term
waste worried Otaka city that's a very
important concept and there can be very
big differences in different reactors
how much iron D is required for our new
design or getting a design up to code
and then what is the capability for
rapid deployment we need a lot of
reactors what can we do for that
so the existing reactors light water
reactors pressurized water reactors
boiling water reactors and can dues over
all costs they're very high but arguably
competitive with coal the safety is good
through expensive engineered sort of
defense-in-depth
resource utilization utilization is
modest for start-up they're not too hard
to startup but they're very poor
annually and you need a lot of uranium
to go to the ground to support these
proliferation resistance is good through
all the safety the International
safeguards we've we've set up long term
waste very poor especially the ones
through cycle which is the most economic
and widely used very very poor sending a
lot of radio toxicity to waste even if
they do use what's called plutonium
recycle that doesn't really improve
things dramatically R&amp;amp;D that's one area
they benefit there's very little that is
required capability for rapid deployment
it's just not there even on labor alone
we just couldn't get too many build
programs going to really really get
enough what we need
what about gas cooled pepper will react
pebble bed reactors this is an area that
has seen more advance in recent years
and it is an interesting system there is
cost savings possible but there's no
real great reduction in overall
complexity they require a massive
pressure vessel and and that really
limits the the size of the core and the
power so almost the same size pressure
vessel is a pressurized water reactor
for maybe a quarter the power or even
less than that the radio rad waste
production is very similar to similar to
light water reactors and also you've got
radioactive graphite it's not too
horrible of stuff but you've got that as
an added bonus the reprocessing of fuel
in this design is extremely difficult
and that's part of the reason they say
they're more proliferation resistance
but that means the uranium utilization
is even worse oh look from a co safety
oh look they are excellent in decay heat
management they can get rid of decay
heat quite readily
but that's only sort of half the
equation in reactor safety the other
half is criticality events etc and
they're quite good on this as any
reactor is by
engineered systems but that is still a
possible issue I have an Asterix here
and I've got some little extra comments
down below that was more for people
reading the slides later here and one of
the asterisks here is that the reverse
is true for accelerated driven systems
where you're keeping things subcritical
by supplying neutrons from accelerator
yes we can instantly shut that down it
helps a lot in criticality but it does
nothing for you in helping in decay heat
management what about the other gen
generation four reactors generation four
just briefly here was a program set up
in the around 2002 a worldwide program
to try to investigate what are the
reactors we should be working towards in
the long term pebble bed reactors was
one of those another is supercritical
water its operating water at a much
higher temperature than they're using
now it really only gives you modest
improvements gets the thermal efficiency
up a bit
but extremely challenging corrosion
issues to solve their sodium cool fast
breeder reactors they've been around for
a long time a few smaller ones or
demonstrations built in general most
would agree they're they're more costly
and higher safety concerns we can make
pretty much any reactor safe to the
public as long as we have a nice
containment vessel around it but many
would argue not all but many would argue
that more likely to have accidents with
these type reactors they need a massive
amount of fissile material start 12 tons
of fissile material plutonium etc just
to start these up and the doubling time
doubling time is how long it takes if
you breed fuel meaning you're burning
making more than you're consuming it
would take 40 years on these designs to
make enough for the next plant so to
speak lead cool fast breeder reactors
there's there's some possible savings
there they save an intermediate loop etc
but they you require even more fissile
material so I've an asterisks down here
that with that like the entire plutonium
supply of the US weapons program spent
fuel etc it would only be enough for 30
or 40 reactors so it really limits how
fast we can develop these gas cooled
fast breeders that's another that's one
of the other Gen 4 reactors that has a
lot of the similar issues here
now what about thorium we keep hearing
but that thorium is more and more
the news more and more in the
conversation of the nuclear industry
thorium is fertile on its own but it can
produce a fizzle element uranium 233
which is a really good nuclear fuel it
has numerous or advantages works well in
any spectrum we don't have to have too
fast a spectrum or we don't slow the
neutrons down like the uranium plutonium
cycle however any use in solid fuels
ittsan involves very difficult fuel
processing okay there's a lot of
inherent radioactivity and in things
it's very difficult to reprocess but
what about fluid fuels and what about
the generation for reactor that was made
for thorium and that is the liquid
fluoride reactor it's over 50 years old
but it's never really looked any better
and historically this is this is called
a molten salt reactor I'll probably be
switching a bit between terms here the
older term is molten salt reactor but
liquid fluoride or liquid for fluoride
thorium reactor or a lifter is a term
that's becoming more used so liquid
fluoride molten salt overview what did
the original program at Oakridge end up
with and what factors guy design how to
design evolve why was it cut off what's
happened since then and do new
priorities and new ideas do they change
they look up things so looking at the
what's called a traditional molten salt
breeder reactor this is a figure right
out of Rado - the generation 4 program
molten salt flows molten salt contains
the fuel itself and the the fizzle in
the fertile material flows through a
critical core that has graphite logs
here that flows between the logs in and
out of that core and it's only critical
inside the core so heat is generated in
here but that hot fluid comes out and
goes through an intermediate heat
exchanger that secondary coolant salt
then dries either a gas cycle or a steam
cycle originally it was a steam cycle
but we we feel that a gas Brayton cycle
would get would be much more useful now
we show control rods here but I'll talk
a little bit later you don't really need
control rods in these type of reactors
we can we can process out fission
products okay
to be able to be a breeder or as I'll
say in a few minutes about a break-even
breeder
we can also dump these salts to
emergency dump tanks very easily either
by valves
well by valves if we lowish and if we do
nothing else we have what's called
freeze plugs that will melt if the salt
starts to get hotter than we want and
drain to the tanks that are set up to
deal with the decay heat when you shut a
reactor down that doesn't turn off all
the power there's so much radioactivity
going on that there's a lot of power
being generated and we have to deal with
that that was a Three Mile Island event
they didn't have the reactor was shut
down but they had to deal with that
decay heat so the general attributes of
this sort of traditional design it's
called a molten salt you have a salt
that sort of dissolves or there's a
mixture of the in this case the the
fertile thorium fluoride and uranium
fluoride makes Nina carrier salt it's
lithium fluoride and brilliant for it
and that lithium has to be isotopic and
a riched which makes it a little
expensive but not not too bad it has a
nice high outlet temperature of 700
degrees so we have a nice high thermal
efficiency Oakridge work was over 44% on
the steam Rankine cycle if we switch to
a gas Brayton cycle like a helium or
even supercritical carbon dioxide we can
get up to the high forties the fission
products in this case were removed on a
20 day cycle some were moved a little
quicker so I'm a little slower and I'll
talk in a minute about how a lot of them
come out automatically
now protactinium here protactinium is
sort of the intermediate between thorium
and uranium-233 thorium becomes
protactinium-233 and that will decay to
the thing we want your enum 233 in a
twenty seven day half-life we we often
need to remove that or in this case we
need to remove that for this design
which is a bit of a problem here you
want to take it out of the neutron flux
so it doesn't take another Neutron and
not get to what you want and I'll talk
more about that a little bit later it
has a very low fissile inventory we
talked before about like 12 tons 20
tonnes this is only a ton and a half or
1500 kilograms for a for a typical
gigawatt or a thousand megawatt size
plant has a breeding ratio of 1.0 six
which is modest compared to the fast
breeder reactor but you don't need to
breed much fuel to start your next
reactor so that means that the fuel you
burn in a year which is about 800 to a
thousand kilograms you sort of end up
with 6 percent more than that at the end
of the year that gave a 20 year doubling
time which back when it was in
competition with fast breeder reactors
was not as good as the fast breeders but
the we had to change the fast breeders
later for safety reasons and there are
nowhere near as good as 20 years anymore
general benefits any molten salt design
volatile fission products gaseous
fission products things that want to
come out of the salt will come out as
we're operating and we simply collect
them the most important thing is xenon
it's a it's a gas that really just loves
to absorb neutrons we really want to get
rid of that it's quite radioactive so we
can remove that it just comes out of the
salt we assist that by bubbling helium
through the gas so if everything that
wants to come out of the salt we take
out continuously and store safely off
planet or away from the reactor if there
is any kind of major spill etc it just
solidifies there's really nothing that
wants to come out of there so it's
really hard to imagine ways that we can
really spread any radioactivity around
the salts have a very high boiling point
and we operate them at low pressure
there's no pressure vessels here
whatsoever it's just a big tank
basically any temperature increase
instantly lowers the reactivity that's a
very good safety feature the fuel salts
at the lowest pressure of the circuit
that's sort of the reverse of a
pressurized water reactor where every
stage things are trying to get to the
outside world whereas in this the the
radioactive salts are at the lowest
pressure of the circuit we don't need
control rods or burnable poisons etc
there's almost no excess reactivity
there's no danger of accidentally
pulling out control rods there's none in
there to begin with and we have that
simple freeze plug that melts upon
overheating and it just drains things so
lots of inherent safety features here so
the general benefits inherent passive
safety low fissile inventory very high
thermal efficiency and they're ideal for
light water reactor TR U is transionic
waste we can get rid of than the more
the aspects of those which I'll show in
just a second
they're a perfect system for that it's
it's very hard to get rid of those
transient equates in other designs and
when we have the ability use the clothes
thorium cycle just very briefly thorium
becomes u-233 and u-233 when it
fission's can give a little bit more
than two neutrons per fission and if we
don't waste too many of those neutrons
one of those neutrons or at least one
can go to making another u-233
and if if exactly one goes we sort of
break even and we're bringing work
creating as much fuel as we're burning
so to speak thorium is dirt cheap
it's very extremely plentiful so if we
can close the cycle here we get down to
about 800 kilograms a year that's maybe
like 40 $50,000 worth of thorium for a
plant that's going to be generating
revenues of maybe 500 million dollars a
year worth of electricity so it's just a
drop in the bucket the transionic waste
in general are produced at a much lower
rate and it's much easier for us to just
keep keep burning those off within the
reactor so we get a much much lower
long-term radiotoxicity
that's what I want to talk about for a
minute now here this graph is from a
researcher in France that shows the
radio toxicity and radiotoxicity is a
little different than reading just
radioactivity because when we worry if
we're putting things away if they get
into the groundwater some fourth of the
radiation are a lot worse if you ingest
them compared to if they're just sort of
sitting around or you get them on your
clothes etc so radio toxicity is the
important thing what this shows this
dashed line here is showing the fission
products itself and the vast majority of
these have pretty short half-lives this
is a logarithmic scale on both sides so
going up by a factor of 10 every time
here and in time or going up by a factor
of 10 every time so over the first few
hundred years those fission products
drop off dramatically initially they're
the most radio toxic part of the waste
but after 500 years or so they're quite
low now this level right about up here
10 to the 6 or so that's the the radio
toxicity of the the uranium you'd need
to fire up a pressurized water reactor
so if we can get lower than that that's
a good benchmark to gain 4 but the
pressurized water reactor what's really
radio toxic is the higher
actinides things above uranium neptunium
plutonium especially and marissa see'em
curium etc those a pressurized water
reactor we'll be throwing away like two
three four hundred kilograms of those
per year not is what's so long-term
radioactive radioactive this green line
is showing what we can get with a molten
salt reactor or liquid fluoride we're
not producing much we only have maybe 10
20 kilograms in the salt at any time so
we when we reprocess we put that back in
now anytime you sort of process things
you have to assume that you might lose a
tiny bit and point one percent loss is a
very conventional rule of thumb for
losing losing things to waste okay but
since we're only processing kilograms
per year we get a very low Radio low low
radio toxicity whereas a fast breeder
reactor even with the same loss rate
they're processing
tons sort of thing per year they will
not be that great now they hope that
they can do even better than 0.1 in
practice especially sort of the more
famous integral fast reactor they've
probably never really done much better
than one percent they hope they can do a
lot better than that but they're they're
starting with a lot more radioactive
radio toxic actinide wastes to begin
with so it just shows that app with a
molten salt reactor that we put the
plutonium etc back in the reactor to
keep burning off we're turning the waste
problem into more of a 500-year problem
then really a million year problem and
we can engineer things that are going to
be not leaking for five hundred years
quite or easily as opposed to trusting
that we can do that for millions years
now proliferation resistance that's a
very important question and a lot of
people are going to have different
opinions on this but it's an extremely
important one to talk about now on the
pure thorium to u-233 cycle there is a
lot of proliferation resistance built in
here already there's always gonna be a
lot of an isotope called uranium 232
it's got a moderately long half-life so
it's gonna stick around but it gives you
a really strong gamma ray from one of
its daughter products that's really hard
to shield it really makes it very easy
if someone's trying to smuggle it around
very easy to detect you can't really
seal that out it's such a high-energy
gamma ray makes it listed use
really difficult and highly detectable
there's been never any national program
based on making weapons out of u-233
even though it yes it technically is
possible and it would also be extremely
hard to imagine how you could steal from
reactors that the salts never less than
say 500 degrees Celsius kind of thing
caller you might mine crooks or corn
kirk sorensen
also made a great suggestion here that
if you're using the pure cycle in a
molten salt reactor liquid fluoride
reactor we can instantly denature that
okay.you uranium 235 or 233 they're both
materials that can be used in a weapon
but if they're mixed with enough uranium
238 natural sort of uranium they can't
be made into a weapon so we could keep
uranium 238 as a fluoride sort of been
standby and if anything goes wrong
inspectors lose contact with a reactor
that can very quickly be dumped into the
salt makes it useless for weapons and
you can't really start up the reactor
again now protect any removal can lead
to clean uranium 233 so if we can we
really should try to avoid this because
if it's if it's becoming u-233 just from
this storage of protactinium it doesn't
have this u-232 or very very little of
it so that's an important point there's
only very small amounts of plutonium in
this cycle and it's extremely poor
quality you could really never use a
what make a weapon out of it now we can
also denature these cycles and that
means we run them with enough u-238 we
still want to be majority relying on the
thorium part of things we put in enough
u-238 so that any uranium that you can
take out you couldn't really use to make
a weapon because the the pewter cycle
does represent what people call highly
enriched uranium for a lot of people as
soon as you say that word to them it's a
no-go so running the denatured cycle
includes having enough 238 and it does
mean there's more plutonium present
because that u-238 can start becoming
plutonium by absorbing neutrons but it's
still a very poor quality and plutonium
is a lot more difficult to remove from
the salts than uranium is and in many
designs that
affect your conversion ratio conversion
ratio and breeding ratio of sort of the
same things it's how much per fission
you're sort of making more fuel so
looking at the quality produce plutonium
weapons-grade is almost all pu-239
reactor grade is only about sixty
percent that and one of the more the
basic things that really gives you a lot
of protection here is pu-238
generates a massive amount of heat
because it's got a fairly short
half-life in a reactor eight is one
point three percent it would make it
very very difficult but not impossible
to make a weapon out of reactor grade
for a denatured molten salt cycle this
is what's from what we call a
thirty-year once-through converter
design which I'll talk a lot more about
later it has massive amounts of this PDU
238 so and a lot less 239 etc
technically it would be still something
that would need to be guarded but
probably next to impossible anyway make
a weapon on the pure cycle you do have
the 233 but the plutonium is basically
absolutely worthless it's almost all 238
the thing would probably melt if you try
to put enough together to to make a
weapon now some problems specific in the
molten salt the single fluid where you
mix the thorium and uranium in the same
fluid graphite moderated design they had
a fairly high power density and graphite
has a limited density depending on your
power power output or power density sort
of sorry so it has a lifetime of four
years we have to replace that graphite
every four years the fuel processes
processing is hindered by the chemical
similarity of thorium and the most
important rare earth fission products to
remove which are the rare earth fission
products and there was also a problem
with the temperature reactivity
coefficient that was sort of recently
discovered quite simple to work around
and no problem with some of the ideas
I'm gonna talk to you about today and
protect him tinium separation it does
add that unique proliferation concern
which we'd like to get rid of if
possible so design basics to fluid
versus single fluid single fluid is sort
of what we call a traditional but for
most of the Oakridge program they were
trying to do what's called - fluid
design where you have a separate fuel
salt that contains the uranium 233 maybe
a little bit of thorium but by
definition the two-fluid has none
and then a blanket salt that contains
the thorium and that's sort of gonna
catch the neutrons and convert the fuel
for you the advantage of that is when
there's no thorium in the fuel salt and
makes it much much easier to process for
the fission products pa removal is not
really necessary and all there's an
asterisks here I'll basically quickly
describe at how many neutrons you lose
to protecting them is based on your sort
of power density okay your Neutron flux
the thorium though is sitting in a much
lower neutron flux or we can just have a
lot more of this blanket salt and
effectively it dilutes it so we lose a
lot less and there is really no need for
any protactinium separation and it's a
pretty complex thing to do
it has a very strongly negative
temperature and void coefficient for the
fuel salt was also very good now there's
also converted designs or what we'd call
once-through designs where we're
basically just having a mix of low
enriched uranium so uranium that can't
be used to make a weapon and thorium and
the single fluid there's no need for any
processing of the fuel salt whatsoever
for the entire life of the plant we're
not able to break even we have to dig up
out of the ground some more uranium
every year but a much much much less
than other conventional type reactors
which is basically on design basics here
choice of Neutron spectrum a harder
spectrum a faster spectrum because we
can modify this as almost as much as we
like the losses to fission products will
drop so we can maybe leave them in a lot
longer prompt Neutron lifetime is
shorter and that's a bit of an issue and
control etc and it typically requires a
higher Fasano more fissile material to
start these up softer spectrum is
basically the reverse we can get that
physical inventory really low the losses
to the fission products though are going
to be higher so we might need to remove
them quicker we can't really have any
extra structural material most designs
don't have any at all it's just graphite
and the salts and graphite is very good
with Neutron absorption and the proper
to Neutron lifetime is is much increased
so things can sort of happen slower here
for fuel processing basics fluoride
volatility it's a process that removes
uranium from the salt it's a very simple
process fission product removal it's
essential if we want to have a breeder
or breakeven design
but we even for break-even we can go to
several years some French studies have
gone up to studies showing up to 20
years with before removing fission
products protactinium removal and holdup
it's essential for single food designs
they wish to break even but not freely
for others flora de ville Tilly just
very quickly we simply bubble through
fluorine gas through the carrier salt
and it converts uf4 which is a solid
well it's dissolved in the salt to
gaseous uf6 that we can convert back
later okay it's an old process that
we've known about since the 50s fission
product removal sort of historically
here in the early part of the program
from 50s to early 60s they didn't really
have any one method that they thought
was gonna be great they proposed in very
many but none none yet proven to be
practical
the practical there was a big
breakthrough in 1964 called vacuum
distillation it's a very simple system
you just take every day take a little
bit of the salt away put it in a
basically a still the fission products
itself give enough heat to keep it
really hot and the carrier salt will
evaporate away now before you put it
there you take any uranium out then
evaporate out the carrier salt recombine
those the the fissile u-233 and the
carrier salt put them back in the court
and that gets rid of most of your
fission products and especially your
rare earth finishing products the
problem with that is if there's thorium
in that salt it's gonna stay with the
vision products so it's really it was
really only viewed for a to fluid design
later though in 1968 they developed
something called liquid bismuth
reductive extraction I won't get into
details of this but it does have the
ability to process the four fission
products with thorium and the salt but
thorium is so chemically similar to the
rare earth fission products really makes
the process very delicate and they
really have to do things that many
stages etc to do things problem but
properly so it's a complex and costly
system but it does work for single fluid
designs so fuel processing summary here
for to fluid design we've got all kinds
of choices we can use vacuum
distillation we can use something called
salt replacement I won't get into we can
use the liquid bismuth extraction much
more simplified one stage because we're
not worried about that thorium and we
can skip protecting and removal
altogether because it's in that lower
Neutron flux blanket for single fluid
designs you're sort of stuck with that
one
and it's really hard not to get into
that protactinium removal if we have
converter designs though basically we'll
call burner designs we've got no fuel
processing whatsoever just simple
chemistry control now looking at the
evolution here it's crucial to remember
that they have very different design
priorities in the early days long term
radioactive waste proliferation
resistance wasn't really part of their
mandate they didn't have too much
concerns there they really thought back
in the 50s and 60s early 60 that we have
very little uranium in the world we're
gonna run out quick so we have to get
these really reactors going and breed
enough fuel to expand the fleet they
thought they'd have thousands of our
actors worldwide by now that means short
doubling time how long it takes to breed
enough fuel for your next reactor that
was a very top priority and we were
incompetent the molten salt reactor
program was in competition with
sodium-cooled frost breeders and back
then they thought they had a really good
doubling time they don't know anymore
for safety reasons so looking at the
program the strange beginning of this
was an aircraft reactor they didn't make
anything that flew like this but just as
the Navy was sort of the birth of the
light water reactor the pressurized
water reactor that was the best thing
that fit in a submarine they thought
that a molten salt reactor would be a
great way to have a bomber that would be
able to fly around for months on end
replacing a reactor for the heat of
combustion so you don't have any jet
fuel onboard extremely challenging
project to say the least it did lead to
a very interesting test reactor built in
the in the 50s a very high temperature
operation 860 degrees it had beryllium
oxide as a moderator sort of canned in
in material here it had a different
carrier salts sodium zirconium fluoride
it pointed the way to possible power
reactors though even if the idea was
probably quite far-fetched in my view at
least now what I call the rise and fall
of the two-fluid reactor two-fluid was
the focus for most of Oakridge program
and in the late 50s they looked at what
we call homogeneous designs no graphite
or anything just the salt itself they
looked at both converter designs and
breeder designs now the carrier salt
does provide a significant amount of
moderation slowing those neutrons down
so we can actually play around with the
the spectrum quite quite readily and all
these studies were spherical geometry
and they always had a wall hostel oy oy
n haven't mentioned hostel yet it's a
high nickel alloy that works really
really well with these molten salts that
has good corrosion behavior etc it's
always been in the plan to use these
metals like for heat exchangers for the
vessels etc he would have a vessel wall
and let me just show you a picture here
so the very simple design they were
looking at in the 50s just an inner fuel
salt here which was either just uranium
233 in the fuel salt or more likely some
thorium as well and surrounded by a
blanket salt very ingenious simple
design this wall though will be in an
intense neutron flux and we know now
that it probably wouldn't have to too
long a lifetime maybe we can improve the
alloy so it would but it's nonetheless a
very very nice little design but in the
early sixties though they proved that we
could use graphite with new systems and
that can lower the PFAs aural inventory
and so there was a switch in focus okay
we're gonna go to graphite moderation
but we still want that to fluid design
because it's so much easier on
processing the fission products now the
simplest way you might imagine building
this is a central core that just has the
fuel salt surrounded by a core that has
the blanket salt the problem with that
though is the critical radius of that
inner core would just be too small it
would be on the order of about a meter
with the concentrations of fissile that
we would put on these salts it's just
too small not enough volume to have a
power producing volume so Oak Ridges
solution was well we're gonna have to
mix these salts not together but have
two salts in the core separated by
plumbing graphite plumbing
now that inter mixing of fuel and
blanket salts done by graphite plumbing
it does give you the ability I have
large core diameters and adequate power
production but that graphite when it's
under Neutron aeration radiation first
shrinks a little bit and then starts
expanding and that's changing the ratio
of the blanket salt and the fuel so it's
just giving all kinds of problems and
that plumbing was so complicated as well
any sort of one crack we'd basically
mean replacing the whole core a very
hard problem this just sort of quickly
shows some of the
Engineering specs of showing this fuel
salt moving up and down a tube here and
blanket salt sort of getting in between
the cracks of these tubes very difficult
now also in the 1960s they had the
molten salt reactor experiment a very
successful test reactor small power
eight megawatts thermal he was chosen
basu single fluid for simplicity they
never really even put any thorium in
these reactors they just wanted to test
principles here graphite moderation ran
in the early 60s very successful
operation they would switch around
different fuels you to 33 to 35 and
plutonium that found some issues with
that hastelloy that high nickel alloy
metal one with a certain fission product
that was sort of getting into the grain
boundaries and another with neutrons can
make helium inside the metal and that
helium gets to grain boundaries and
gives you problems but later on they
work with alloys and not 100% but mostly
resolve those issues later and we could
definitely do more now now in 1968 what
I call the start of the single fluid
area that new extraction method even
though they knew it was going to be
quite complex and quite quite expensive
not as expensive as solid fuel
processing it works with thorium and the
salt the two-fluid concept was abandoned
and that plumbing problem was left
unsolved and then pretty soon after that
major funding for the molten salt
breeder reactor program was cancelled
and the are the extremely limited Intel
quite recently and this too fluid
concept largely forgotten now why was
the program canceled this was obviously
going to be speculation there's a lot of
reasons here first I wondered Oakridge
do right they first off they look to go
to the thorium uranium cycle instead of
uranium plutonium that's the fast
breeder cycle there's no need for a fast
spectrum the lot less radiotoxicity
except there are a lot more resources of
thorium they brought all the top mines
together in one place fast breeders a
lot of the other designs were working
sort of piecemeal some at Argonne some
other places everyone was together in
Oakridge working to this there's really
in for reinforces all the efforts and
they kept reactor safety at the
forefront there's an inherent safety
features of these as opposed to
engineering safety and Oakridge they had
a lot of voices in the early safety
about we have to really be worried about
events the low probability
what did Oakridge do wrong well it turns
out it's a lot of the same things they
decided to focus on
thorium cycle but in the 50s to the 70s
production of plutonium for the military
was a top priority for the government as
well and by extension the Atomic Energy
Control which controlled reactor
development they brought all the top
minds together in the same place that
meant that all around the country
elsewhere are gone everywhere else there
really knew very very little of a molten
salt program and government relies on
the opinions of experts from around the
world around the country reactors safety
kept at the forefront Alvin Weinberg was
the the director at Oakridge the
inventor the pressurizer out of reactor
actually and he really caused well
raised the ire of ACS infamous Milton
Shah by raising safety concerns about
pressurized radda radda reactors and
soon after that he was fired as director
and the program canceled so not
necessarily that those two are directly
related but most people feel it is
what's happened since then well in the
late 70s Oakridge still kept things
going with almost no funding so not
really any good engineering work being
done things being built etc they started
to focus more on denature designs where
you'd have u-238 in there either
converters or breakeven they showed even
surprised themselves that you could
break even with a design that had u-238
present so the uranium was useless for
weapons there's been little funding but
there's a many been many vocal advocates
worldwide but without getting much
funding doing things on their own until
it was chosen one of the six generation
four reactors back in 2002 that's really
sparked a lot of interest and probably
the biggest work being done and for the
last five years at least has been in
France as a large group they're really
doing great work on modeling chemistry
etc they found a reactivity problem with
the early 70s design I'll just briefly
explaining that you do get the
temperature coefficient is the needed
negative term instantly but as the
graphite sort of lags behind and warms
up in temperature if the the reactor is
starting to get hotter the graphite
eventually brings that coefficient to be
positive which is a problem we need to
fix and what I'm going to talk about in
the future we definitely can fix that
they look to decrease the processing
needs they realize how difficult that
liquid bismuth extraction is by allowing
their
the breeding ratio to drop down to
break-even and they have moved towards a
harder spectrum that doesn't have
graphite in the in the core itself
they've also added a blanket salt around
just radially around there's been more
us-based efforts but a lot of the focus
has changed from molten salt reactors to
what they call molten salt cooled
reactors traditional solid fuel reactors
based on the tri sole fuel that's where
you have the fuel inside little little
tiny beads that are inside pebbles or
inside prismatic fuel elements but using
molten salts without any fuel in them
but as clean carrier salts and a lot of
those people hope that that effort can
lead to lead to pretty good reactors now
and then eventually to more ideal molten
salt fueled reactors but it has sort of
taken away some of the interest here and
in those designs the real big challenge
is making sure that you don't have
what's called a positive coefficient
they they can do that but it's a really
hard really big challenge there's also
been much work worldwide on using these
systems to get rid of transionic waste
take away that plutonium and neptunium
etc from light water reactors spent fuel
and burn it up in these reactors now the
French design just very quickly this is
what they've evolved to it's just a very
simple core of a fuel salt here
surrounded by a radial blanket some of
the engineering details they haven't
gone into too much of how they're gonna
have a barrier and things like that a
reflector on top and bottom you can't
have just pure graphite here would give
too big of a power spike so I think
they're still working on what kind of
material that's going to be the
reflector very simple design it would be
quite difficult to try to build in a
axial reflector as well so that really
because it's not a completely
encompassing blanket that really does
limit their potential a great deal a lot
of good Russian work and they're working
mainly on a system that just burns trans
dynamic waste so there's no thorium
uranium or anything in that reactor
they're just keep feeding in waste
transfer annex from spent fuel and it's
just a simple big tank of salt we
protect the outer vessel that out of us
well we don't want it to see too many
neutrons so they'll put like a graphite
reflector here and even some some steel
to
how many neutrons get to that outer
vessel and they've been doing great work
updating priorities if we're trying to
look ahead to what we should be doing
what we could be doing physical material
for starting up mainly because it's they
need so little and we can use a lot of
different types we can use transionic
wastes whereas light water reactors they
can't put everything in only plutonium
and they can't just run on plutonium
either they need uranium there as well
so it's not we don't really need to
breed fuel proliferation resistance and
long term waste reduction that's a much
higher priority now and we should really
try to minimize the need for fuel
processing and its complexity ideally
remove it all together if we if we can
but there's no two experts or two
nations they're really going to agree on
ranking all these different priorities
and how different reactors fit into
those priorities so it's probably very
good if we go forward our multiple
versions there's a lot of flexibility in
these designs and keeping in mind a few
design concepts here kiss keep it simple
stupid
a lot of people trying to think of new
designs idea people are often drawn to
very complex solutions but any new
improvement in the nuclear field can be
monumentally expensive so we really have
to choose our battles make sure any
changes we're making our relevant needed
and easy to verify off-the-shelf where
possible there's a lot of good examples
to this it there is a lot of advantages
to go into a gas cycle to get the final
energy out of these but there's a lot of
R&amp;amp;D involved in trying to match a gas
turbine to what your reactor is so a lot
of people are still saying well we'll
just still stick to the steam cycle so
there's a lot of cases like that another
aspect is we have a certain temperature
we can reefs which the with the metals
that we work with about 700 degrees
Celsius if we stick to that we sort of
know our limitations there is some
advantages of going higher but then it
opens up all this these things we'd have
to verify etc and also an expression
hopefully most you understand rice bowl
breaking whenever you're talking about a
brand new idea you're going against
people that it's affecting their
livelihood breaking their rice bowl
you've got to keep that in mind and be
aware of that and minimize if possible a
good example is if we're going to the
pure thorium cycle we're basically
removing
rhenium from the industry and that's a
pretty established industry just to keep
that in mind but maybe if we can do just
as good with the uranium keep that in
mind and also remember that there's a
lot of existing corporate corporate
players etc that have models in place
we're going to be going against those or
maybe we should bring bringing in those
players because they're not doing too
well with their designs so some new
ideas for your consideration that I've
been working on and patenting etc one is
reviving the two-fluid concept that's
the main thing I want to talk to both I
know there is what I call a barrier-free
design and a possible fuel processing
free designs not as important an aspect
or a little bit more of theoretical but
something I haven't sort of made public
yet so it's sort of public disclosure
here and then simplified converter
design starting with a what with what
Oakridge came up with and trying to
expand on that so getting into the
two-fluid ideas first restating the two
food plumbing problem a sphere within
sphere like fuel salt with graphite or
without surrounded by blanket salt
that's the simplest approach but that if
there's no Ithorian that inner fuel salt
the critical radius is just too small it
makes your reactor too small not enough
volume to get enough power so it's too
small for power plants the standard
conclusions well we have to find some
way to interlace those two fluids so
what's my solution that I've come up
with first starting with a hint you can
ignore the math here but what's called a
buckling ratio just shows that if you
have different geometries so if you have
a sphere or cylinder cylinder long or
short etc slab geometry if you have the
same materials in place you'll have
different critical radius and it turns
out that if you have the same materials
on a sphere compared to a long cylinder
the long cylinder its diameter will be
about 77% of the critical radius of a
sphere but the thing with a cylinder a
long cylinder we can get as much power
producing volume as we want so the just
showing things very generalized here is
what I'm looking at is elongated
cylindrical geometry okay our core is
the necessary pretty small diameter a
boat one meter so this can be as simple
as just a pipe carrying the fuel salt or
it might have graphite elements here in
here as well if we choose to do that
surrounded by a blanket salt so about
half the neutrons actually a little more
than half of
neutrons will leak out of there into the
blanket salt be converted into uranium
233 which we can quite easily transfer
into the fuel salt okay at the end we
can crimp down this inner pipe that
makes it sort of subcritical here okay
and any neutrons
any last neutrons that are emitted can
still get out into this blanket so in
this very very simple design we can now
have almost no Neutron leakage and that
fully encompassing blanket is really
important for allowing you to do all
kinds of useful design changes here you
know the new concepts advantages we can
use the simple to fluid fuel processing
without that plumbing problem that
plagued Oakridge for so long it has very
strongly negative fuel salt coefficients
where which are great and all courage
always like those the blanket salt
should also be slightly negative and Oak
Ridges design actually had a blanket
salt coefficient was slightly positive
because if it heated up it was some of
it was leaving the core in this case
there's none in the core itself just
around and it acts as a bit as a
reflector so when that gets less dense
less neutrons would be reflected back
and it can slow things down as well
very simple designs to build to
transport etc ease of modeling and
prototyping these are so simple we can
probably model them in two dimensions is
almost and very low Fazal inventory the
two-fluid design of Oakridge will
already was lower it was about seven
hundred kilograms but they were wasting
a lot in sort of what we call plenum
spaces at the top and bottom we could
easily get this down to about 400
kilograms per gigawatt electrical or
even lower so showing a cross-section of
graphite free meaning we don't have any
salt in moderator it's basically just a
pipe within a pipe and sometimes the
people have used the term tube within
shell which is a heat exchanger term now
we do need a barrier between the two
like Oakridge often had that could be
Hastelloy perhaps molybdenum is a great
material neutronic lee and for radiation
damage but really hard to work with
or maybe just simple carbon composites
or silicon carbide etc a lot of choices
here just to show some numbers and i can
sort of back these up i do a lot of data
mining okay taking studies that we're
done by Oakridge or the French or the
Russians etc or Japanese are doing a law
checks etc in their studies Oakridge
studies for 122 centimeter diameter
sphere with 0.16 percent physical
concentration that one should be able to
breach break-even long-term if we extend
that to long cylinder geometry that
shrinks down a bit to just under a meter
in diameter and if you put in the basic
power densities actually these are quite
conservative numbers 200 kilowatts per
liter fairly slow salt speed 2 meters
per second
typical inlet note that pressures a 6.6
meter long core that gives you over 400
megawatts electrical just there now we
there's also other ways that give you
larger diameters and that would be for
the same length more power
now other variations if we allow that
concentration to rise a little bit we
have we end up with more excess neutrons
to deal with so we can start thinking
well we could put a metal barrier in
there and molybdenum or even stainless
steel we can start thinking about
alternate carrier salts that are a
little less expensive etc and it gives
us even greater simplification of
sufficient product processing because we
can leave them in a lot longer we have
more spare neutrons and just like the
French work has shown going to 20 years
or beyond that from moving fission
products this just quickly shows another
variation that's part of my patent that
we might have sort of a Calandra
arrangement where you have a central
tube that's easily removable gives you a
gap in between as well that you can
really quickly detect any kind of leak
i'll also quickly mention we always just
like Oak Ridge always proposed you run
your blanket salt at a little bit of
higher pressure so if there's any crack
or leak just blanket salt goes inwards
and it just shuts down your reaction the
critical issue though is this core
blanket barrier this barrier between the
two and that's something we'd have to
verify but we benefit from the fact that
there's a lot of work in the fusion
field and has a lot more funding using
these same salts as a coolant and they
have that first wall that is the most
hostile environment you can possibly
imagine so they've been looking at a lot
of materials with both the salts and a
high Neutron flux molybdenum silicon
carbide composites or even just simple
carbon composites their leading
candidates
one important thing to mention is they
have to have systems that are completely
impermeable we do not care if gasses
leak through these because both the
blanket and fuel are making a little bit
of xenon etc so we don't need
impermeable as long as there's not like
what's really thinking through now
hastelloy in and stainless steel are
shown to be possible if we lower the
temperatures a bit and that's not really
too big of an issue it is a bit hard to
make sure we have the salts that have a
low enough melting point but if you
lower the temperature a bit we can
really start to consider using stainless
steels or the hostel boy in and ease of
retyping means well even if your barrier
doesn't last forever it's not gonna be
that expensive to two weeks to fix and
just quickly this is just showing some
work from steve's inkle at oak ridge
that's looking at different materials in
the fusion field where you have that
very intense radioactive field a lot of
materials have sort of a window of
operation and you can see how stainless
steels 316 stainless steel here it's
only really verified up to about 550
degrees so if we lower operating
temperatures a bit we might consider
using those silicon carbide or sort of
in an ideal region as well so we can
have a lot of choices now graphite cores
hiding graphite in there has some
advantage it's gonna lower the it's
going it's gonna have a similar diameter
actually but it does lower the power
density because it's not all salt it's
only about 10 to 15 percent of salt in
and but I just want to show an
embodiment an idea that has no real
barrier material in a neutron flux
because that's what we we know the
metals couldn't survive outside in
contact with the salts but it's the new
Neutron flux so one of the ideas I've
been looking at is is having a simple
system here where it's our typical sort
of hexagons of graphite with central
fuel channels here and this is just sort
of a graphite sleeve something to hold
all those hexagons together here and
surround it as usual by a blanket salt
but how do we get to the outside world
that's where things are a little a
little more interesting what we do here
is if those graphite elements are say 15
20 centimeters wide we constrict those
down so now flu blanket salt can get
between those pipes okay and that
basically kills criticality and there's
it'll absorb all those neutrons so where
we contact from graph
to hastelloy which Oakridge looked at
this before brazing to the tubes that's
done outside the flux okay so it does
you might be saying well that's back to
the plumbing problems but we have no
blanket salt between those pipes so we
don't care if they're expanding and
contracting it's not really going to
change the overall criticality of things
or the overall ratio of things so just
one of the suggestions here now moving
on beyond this to fluid if the barrier
does prove a possible possible stumbling
block what other options do we have and
still try to break even here and looking
at a barrier-free fuel processing free
so can we run break even without a
barrier and even though fuel processing
now harder spectrum does allow you to
leave fission products in a lot longer
so well maybe we can get up to the 20 30
40 year range now excuse me as well the
other thing we have to keep in mind is
that other outer vessel has to be
protect against a high Neutron flux and
a common solution if we're talking about
a tank of salt idea here is putting a
graphite reflector okay that sort of
protects things but it's a very
surprising result that can actually
start to increase the neutron leakage
because what happens is you get sort of
a much bigger increase in power at the
outer edge and I'll just show you a
quick
oops quick graph here showing the power
density with or without a reflector if
you don't have a reflector the power
density at your outer edge is really low
so hopefully the graphite could last
them very long time but soon as you put
the graphite in there
it reflects back the neutrons it
flattens out this power density which is
great for if you have graphite in the
core we don't care about this if it's
just a fewer salt but that makes a lot
of power so we have to thicker graphite
and you end up losing a lot of neutrons
just in there so what have I come up
with
it's the idea we have a very simple sort
of tank of salt here we have a graphite
liner but in that graphite liner we
embed a lot of thorium very simply we
don't have to use the complex solid fuel
methods here just thorium carbide or
even thorium itself in the graphite and
that thorium is going to absorb a lot of
neutrons and basically
it's not a reflector anymore it's
absorbing those neutrons now just like
the Russian work has shown with graphite
reflectors in Oakridge as well we
usually put a little bit of cooling
channels in that graphite just to keep
it cooler temperatures but in that
design what I sort of call a line or
equal to blanket the core salt is a
single fluid potentially danishes with
u-238 especially in the heart of
spectrum 238 doesn't hurt you as much so
in the early years the operation the
liner is almost completely absorbing
that means all you're losing neutrons
but we don't have very many fission
products yes so yet so the neutron
budget should still be fine
now as fissile u-233 and or plutonium
start to build up in that blanket it's
gonna start making more fission's there
which will increase the power a bit and
also start reflecting back more neutrons
which is what we need because we're
having more fission products to absorb
neutrons in the salt so ideally we could
make this liner that's permanent we
don't have to replace that or at least
some glass a 20-30 years and have a
midlife refurbishment here and also
hopefully without any fuel processing
whatsoever
now it's this is a very early stage
requires a lot of modeling it's quite
speculative the graphite lifetime and
the ability to get rid of food
processing definitely goes up with the
core diameter if you make this
absolutely enormous it will definitely
work because the the flux at the wall
goes down with power density so if you
have a really big one that's low power
density but the question is what
diameter you would be needed to give you
the full 30 years or more in the
graphite and be able to forego a fission
product processing if it's too large
that just might mean too much fazham
material needed we needed to start these
up the third thing I want to talk to you
the final thing I want to talk to you is
what call converting reactors or
denature and molten salt reactors the
starting premise of this is of Oak
Ridges what they called a 30-year one
through design and this is from report
called or and LTM 770 207 and I really
should mention there's a massive amount
of data out there for people to learn on
their own through the Oakridge library
or also through the website thorium
energy that has dozens and dozens if not
hundreds of different documents
available for people to download
discussion groups you can train yourself
talk to other people learn things
contribute etcetera very important but
getting back to this work it was a
thousand mega water output it was
started up on low enriched uranium so as
long as you're less than 20% u-235 with
thorium no salt processing whatsoever
just some simple chemistry control it
wasn't a breeder but you just add small
amounts low-enriched uranium annually
low power density so the graphite would
last full 30 years similar startup is on
inventory to a to a light water reactor
and average the conversion ratio which
is sort of the other term for breeding
ratio we use conversion when it's less
than 10.8 now looking at the lifetime
needs and only needed about 1800 tons of
uranium lifetime
that's less than a third of what a light
water reactor would need and much better
than even a can do which has advantages
over light water reactor and at the end
of the 30 years it's very simple to
remove that uranium so we just remove
that uranium and recycle maybe in the
next reactor that lifetime Wardrop down
to a thousand tons which is getting
really really good here the transfer
annex Oakridge didn't really have to too
much concern back then we really should
recycle those it's heart they're harder
to remove but we can do this one time
only bring as many inspectors as we want
in bring the equipment in for three six
months process out all those trans your
annex put them in the next core as well
and if we do that and assume this the
typical 0.1 percent losses you're only
talking losing a kilogram of trans or
annex to waste in 30 years and that's as
good or even better than the the pure
cycle where we're processing every few
months six months or a couple of years
kind of thing so it's a very exciting
design what are some suggested
improvements looking at not modern
technology or modern priorities we might
look at graphite pebbles a pebble bed
where the pebbles are just graphite very
very simple and cheap that removes the
need for what's called flux flattening
you don't want any part of the reactor
to high power or the graphite doesn't
last long pebbles can be moved and out
so we can go to higher power densities
what we like because we can move those
pebbles in and out very simply and we
can even put some pyrolytic coatings on
the graphite quite simply for increased
safety higher power densities smaller
cores we can make let's say we make the
core half the size well the graphite is
going to only last fifteen years but
your you're using the same over the long
period same amount of graphite so that
really lowers your starting fissile
inventory and you're starting capital
costs just at the cost of adding or
replacing every 15 years to there's
advantages of using elongated
cylindrical geometry it eases
fabrication than dealing with what's
called axial plenums and there is tricks
to the delimit Neutron leakage that
Oakridge came up with in these single
fluid designs going to graphite free
getting rid of the graphite going to
just a simple tank of salt here you can
retain if we want a softer spectrum we
just go to lower fissile concentration
let that salt itself moderate the
neutrons so we can do a lot of things in
that design what's also quite exciting
for me is looking at alternate carrier
salts the traditional carrier salt
called Flibe florium while based on
Florian lithium and beryllium etc
there's problems with that the beryllium
is a bit toxic it produces tritium which
is really a pain to deal with not
impossible but we have to catch that
treaty and make sure it doesn't get out
because tritium can sort of move through
metal walls if they're hot enough etc so
we can switch to perhaps sodium
beryllium fluoride it was always sort of
Oakridge is second choice here much much
of a very low cost low melting point so
we might be able to lower the melting
point enough we can start thinking about
using stainless steel throat nickel
alloys are fairly expensive so if we
could go with simple stainless steels I
might stay of a lot of money etc another
one there's not as well known as sodium
and rubidium fluoride along with uranium
and thorium of course it's really low
cost and no tritium production at all
beryllium and lithium are the things
that can make tritium for you if we get
rid of those that can really simplify
things a lot of people have been telling
me though with the the gas cycle we have
a lot less to worry about with the with
the tritium leakage etc and then
probably the very the most exciting is
just sodium fluoride dirt-cheap
it does have a bit of a higher melting
point though so we were sort of pushing
the limits here but a lot of advantages
there and surprisingly when you really
look at the numbers and a lot there's
been a lot of different studies on this
you don't really lose all that many more
neutrons even though lithium and
beryllium are considered to be really ex
sodium not so much you really only maybe
double or maybe triple how many neutrons
you're losing to the alternate carrier
salts and sort of looking at at this
graph wise here if you look at how much
uranium is used for a light water
reactor or even when you add in uranium
and plutonium recycle things are not
that much better for the for the light
water reactor I've thrown a sodium cool
fast breeder reactor here they don't
really start up on uranium but that's
sort of how many tons you'd need just to
start up if you were taking that out of
uranium-235 the converted reactor only
1800 tons or a thousand tons if we do
just one uranium recycle and if we allow
the carrier salts to even if there are
alternate salts that with triple the
losses we're still only rising things a
little bit and that's where it's most
impressive so you only annually needing
about 35 tonnes of uranium a year or
maybe 47 tons if we have an alternate
carrier salt now typically the pricier
rhenium fluctuates a lot but 50 killer
dollars per kilogram is a rough rough
guide here so for the converting
reactions this is only a million and a
half a year really a drop in the bucket
of overall only going up to 2 million
dollars a year for that for alternate
salts and even if you imagine a
hundredfold increase in the price of
uranium you're still only talking 150
million dollars a year for fuel which is
only 2 cents a kilowatt-hour so we could
imagine while all these potential
resources of uranium if we allow the
price to rise that up that much so this
does really get down to the argument of
Peak uranium just like Peak Oil people
think well maybe we're actually running
out of uranium especially if we try to
get the designs that that are a lot more
reactors using this and it also the
sustainability of uranium mining uranium
mining which a lot of people don't think
is the nicest thing in the world but as
shown though we can even with an
enormous price increase there's a little
effect on the fuel cost with a denatured
molten salt converter reactor and we can
also view that as a first step we can
add fuel process can later if you're a
Neum does prove to be scarce or we don't
like the uranium mining so some
conclusions here molten salt designs
have inherent safety features that
favour overall cost waste reduction low
cost
and Rapid Deployment they also have
great flexibility to match different
priorities and mainly on proliferation
concerns we can change these in ways
that make them just absolutely so much
better than anything out there now so
they can change the meet priorities we
can run these on my new two ounces of
thorium or more modest amounts of
uranium but at the advantage of utmost
in simplicity now what weight forward it
is very difficult to attract corporate
interest on designs like this was back
in the 70s will be now corporations
would have no lucrative fuel fabrication
contracts that they can sort of plan on
making money on for years on end
starting any kind of new design or
something that hasn't been built
commercial size yet it's sort of a
minimum maybe about a 15 year return on
investment which is a hard sell to
shareholders and the existing nuclear
players have sort of their choices in
place but as I said before they're not
doing too well with those so maybe we
can sort of change some of their minds
oops
other corporate paper other corporate
players Big Oil they're making massive
profits but they're more and more
agreeing with people about the concept
of peak oil maybe we are going to within
30 within 50 within a hundred years run
out of this maybe at the price of some
of their profits now they can be still
be the big players in the energy field
by investing in these concept now also
the chemical giants a majority that work
on these is chemical in nature there are
more chemical plants than nuclear so
they would have an ideal sort of skill
set for fitting in this individuals with
deep pockets the people like gates and
Branson nylons and buffets etc they're
looking for ways to invest in the future
what better way than something like this
we need to get the ball rolling and that
that's really the difficult part now I
really think international cooperation
here is key to spread the cost and also
spread the rewards the e term all ITER
was the international thermonuclear
experimental reactor really showed a way
for different countries to work together
on something that was expensive but very
important so maybe that is a rough guide
with a lot more corporate involvement
this is quite speculative of course
though and there's likely no one
designed that's going to prove be best
for everyone or all
nations are all utilities so it's really
best to move forward on all different
several different designs and even
things like molten called salt cooled
reactors a lot of their potential
research and development is going to be
applicable to everyone and there's
nothing like competition to the yield of
the best results
so what's needed in the short term a lot
of things a lot of neutronic modeling a
lot is being done but we need a lot more
done a lot of fuel chemistry work and
corrosion studies on various carrier
salts and the materials for heat
exchangers etc and potential materials
for a barrier there's a lot of non
nuclear component testing that we can do
today pumps valves heat exchangers etc
and all these things just need minor
levels of funding to get going we need
sort of the expression of dime one to
get going and then maybe a little buy a
lot more easier for people to get
funding researchers around the world
would love to work on these more people
I talked to they would love to work on
it but there's just no real funding
stream available now we need to get that
going and that really is the hardest
part of all and that's that's what I
like to talk about today so open for any
questions now
well it depends on your rate Oakridge
often had like all these timeframes well
if we want to get this out in 30 years
they're always quite conservative
they're not spending that much money
like over 30 years spending only a
billion or two that was those numbers
are bit dated it boils down to manpower
and money the the more we can get in the
faster things can go depends on the
complication level we're looking at if
we're looking to build really simple
converter designs they're basically
identical to what Oakridge built as a
test reactor so we could maybe save a
lot of time in there you need just a
little bit of money to get things going
to really get a good program going tens
of millions or hundreds of millions a
year to really move at a fast pace
all right well I hope you wish to learn
more on your own there's lots of
information out there for you too okay
