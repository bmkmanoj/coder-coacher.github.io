special tech talk which paul colligan is
giving us today paul is a very
well-known author blogger whatever you
call him he is basically a podcasting
streaming monetization expert in the
industry he talks at every major
conference and I have an opportunity to
meet him at one of the conference's and
he's been a good friend since and he
took the offer of coming here and
talking about monetizing podcasting and
streaming online talk to our group and
he's a fantastic person and he will tell
you a lot more tricks than I can and
he's a great speaker by the way I've
heard any speaking at many conferences
so please join me in welcoming Paul
Colligan thousand seven when plugged the
cable television or he didn't experiment
my house for an entire year the only
media that was going to come into my
house was going to becoming a over the
internet and be legally there's that
second part that makes a little bit more
complicated and the idea was to see at
the time xbox was doing television shows
at the time the apple TV hadn't been
produced yet but we know it was coming I
would not have done this experiment had
I not known the Apple TV product was
coming bought a good I HD with a VGA
Jack for an old laptop that would stream
stuff over the Internet and so for an
entire year the family would enjoy only
what the internet could provide again
legally I blogged about it the year of
living digitally of course January first
I employed the cable my wife says how
about that rose parade on the extreme
and that yet and why would watch the
Rose Parade so thank you YouTube we were
able to get some highlights off of
youtube and watch them on the television
sentence that was good the things that
we're interesting the two biggest
surprise of the year of living digitally
I mean I did it honestly to write off
all my toys it was totally for the sake
of just buying a lot of stuff that i
could write off as an experiment but at
the end of the year what happened was
really interesting i end up saving money
extended cable plus your monthly tivo
bill there's a lot of cash and when I
just bought the shows i wanted i ended
up spending less at the end of the year
that i thought i would have no
commercials no interruptions i was
completely and totally in charge of my
media absolutely loved it that was big
surprise number one big surprise number
two was we didn't even realize the year
was over until about februari of this
year my wife goes we gonna get cable
back i said well do you want it
she said no not really I mean in case
there's an emergency or something should
we get like an antenna you know and so
we bought it over the air antenna for
thirty bucks at compusa right before
they went out of business and and we're
done we haven't gone back it's been
really really interesting now the funny
thing was might the best man at my
wedding I was telling him about this
grand experiment like Aaron yes I'm
going in completely totally high-tech no
television now all media that comes into
my house comes over the Internet this is
what we're doing that what do you mean
you don't even have a you know you
should like a 486 or something said no
no no Netflix dude we order everything
over Netflix see he was doing that
himself he was getting all the
television they just they just watched
it when I wanted to on demand so the
technology was driving geeks like me to
an on-demand world a buddy of mine who
just didn't want to pay for cable and
liked again doing stuff when he wanted
to you know drove him away from it the
world's changing and that was last year
so who am i I'm a new media enthusiast
who brought props already the popcorn
our box you guys are having a lot of fun
with that I'll show you some more and I
want to I want to pass them around I'm
the CEO of calgon com Inc t IM DJ this
is my day job the stuff i'm gonna be
talking about here is not theory you
know a lot of people one day we're going
to have this one day were going to have
this everything you're seeing we have
today i paid the bills doing this stuff
and i enjoy it I'm a full-time new media
maker and trainer I blog I podcast I do
video ebooks the whole nine yards
everything I do gets to delivered
digitally you know occasionally somebody
will print something or burn it to a DVD
personally you know I'm kind of sick of
that and I think the less dead trees and
mounds of plastic we ship out you know
we can but it's there I wrote the
business podcasting Bible had a lot of
fun with that the whole concept was a
book about podcasting that never
mentioned the technology the entire
purpose of the book was the type of
thing that the geek would pick up say
yeah this is right had to the CEO and
the CEO would start to get a vision for
what's going on that was how he wrote it
and the reviews have been interesting
I'm putting all the links and everything
I talked about up at Paul Colligan calm
/ google will also have eventually the
YouTube stream and what not there
because we're gonna hit a lot of
websites so the outline for today I'm
going to talk about a new media friday
i'm going to talk about what i did on
friday and how it was entirely new media
experience i've even realize it as i was
prepped
these slides together I'm going to tell
you the secret of the podcast revolution
I'll give you a clue over there's Tim
bourquin who runs the New Media Expo
which a couple of years ago was the
podcast Expo it's now the New Media Expo
if that gives you a hint to what the
secret of the podcast revolution is
we're gonna talk about the technology
it's here I bought props I'll let you
guys play with it your engineers you
like that kind of thing the numbers are
here this isn't a case of one day we're
going to be at X it is a case of we are
here now and so we're gonna take this
seriously and i'm going to take QA from
a really intelligent audience so you
guys ready bluecrest ready sure all
right new media Friday so I was wearing
a lot of errands on Friday because it's
a crazy week i'm here and i'm in vegas
at the end of week on something else so
friday was my drive around in the car
day friday was the day where I forgot to
sync the stuff that I needed to listen
to so my iphone this iphone here plugged
into an eye one of the docs power i was
streaming podcasts over the slowest data
network on the planet the slowest data
network known to man i was streaming
podcast content because i hadn't taken
the moment to sync it and once i got
home i put it to the better speakers and
whatnot but about three quarters of what
i got was streamed over edge through
this device caught the new podcast
brothers caught a couple of different
shows and stuff that I needed to listen
to so I was streaming entirely myself
now I have a bunch of students who I
teach new media to and will be talk
about that a little bit later but this
is a device this is called the PO dias
this from a company called Kaz go calm
and what the podia siz is the podia sit
cat 5 cable you plug it into a computer
system each device is completely
differently recognized I can send media
content to that device whatever you hook
up to it there's a USB port for a
regular USB player it also has an ipod
dock and the fun thing about the podiums
device is like a answering machine you
come home and if there's a flashing red
light that means there's content waiting
for you you put in your ipod it gives it
puts a new content on your ipod it
charges the ipod for you no sinking no
nothing this was started by a couple of
guys who actually wanted to let their
moms get chinese television here in the
states and as a fascinating concept i
built some content
I'm a new media trainer for some of my
students and I shot it to their podias
boxes some got it on their podias
devices some got it on their ipod some
got it on their iphones all through a
managed RSS system which what we talked
about a minute but entirely new media
training I didn't ship CDs I didn't run
to kinkos and print off and mail a bunch
of stuff everything was did you know
delivered digitally and some people
without even the help of a computer that
night my wife and I we watched Ken Burns
Brooklyn Bridge documentary who's seen
that it's great ken burns just amazing
the Brooklyn Bridge is just amazing
accomplishment in and it was streamed
entirely view the netflix on demand
service through an old laptop you know
to our televisions that note was an HD
but i was able to pick the movie I want
to and I didn't have to drive over to
blockbuster now the funny thing was well
we were watching Brooklyn Bridge I just
got the kindle I don't you guys seen the
kindle yet but while this was happening
my eight-year-old daughter was reading a
ramona the pest book on the kindle you
know again no dead trees and the one
thing that didn't happen friday night
and this is room who depreciated friday
night we did not watch battlestar
galactica which in any good fan should
but the fact matter was I don't have
sci-fi channel anymore really that's
only reason I need it and the next day
it would be available on amazon unbox
for a buck 99 commercial free you know
stream to my television set so the
entire decision was made yes i'm a big
fan and i would like to watch that night
we're coming near the mid-season finale
and all those geeky things but the fact
matter was having it the next day when I
wanted to on my terms it was funny you
know for a long time i tivo'd it you
know and you got the 32nd skip but still
that that break the 32nd skip that
realization now it's like a movie to me
it flows all the way through and i give
it the next day a lot of times when i
tivo'd it i would just watch the next
day anyway so friday was entirely new
media delivery for me and it was just
something i realized as I was putting
together these slides really makes for a
very cool slide but I didn't realize
this until Saturday when I did the
slides so the secret of the podcast
revolution podcasting is amazing I've
made good money in podcasting a big fan
of podcasting the majority of my content
gets delivered by podcast but the fact
matter is is podcasting is merely a
single channel for new media delivery
that is a great channel is a robust
channel
is a strong channel is the channel lets
us do a lot of things but it is one
channel for new media delivery and what
has happened is a lot of people have
embraced podcasting as if it were the
end all end all the things it's not it's
a single channel for delivery if you're
not streaming the content you're missing
it if you're not making it available on
plastic discs for people who want the
plastic discs you're missing it if you
don't do live events that people can
come doing a 10 because some people you
know you got to do the face to face
thing you're missing it now it been made
people excited because there's no
license there's no special tech remember
in the old days when you paid a lot of
money to real media or heaven forbid you
know the Microsoft streaming solutions
if you will put solutions unquote on
that one you know we used to have to pay
a lot of cash to get media out over the
internet we don't have to anymore that
made exciting we leverage the sexiest
tech on the planet I mean no nothing
nothing ever will be what the ipod is to
us you know a hard drive strapped to our
hip that we can listen to what we want
when we want where we want you know in
to build technology that works with that
you gotta wonder the day Steve Jobs woke
up and said there's a whole revolution
going on they're using my product also
have to do is embrace and make a lot
more money it kicked us in the pants we
realized that if there's no tech to pay
for the streaming anymore if there's no
licensing fees that we have to pay if we
can do this really really really cheap
what does that mean the media production
what does that mean to content
distribution what does that mean to
creators and makers and that kind of
stuff and and we need that kick in the
pants again honestly I think the
podcasting space has got a little bit
you know we're wondering you know people
have said you get the average podcast
for the room and they go well the what
podcasting needs is for more people to
understand what RSS is no it's not what
podcasting needs the podcasting needs is
delivery without the audience having to
know what RSS is then open up the new
Apple TV box you know plugs into the
wall plugs into the internet you don't
need a computer for it at all in the new
revision and the only place the word
subscribe is is on the YouTube channel
the word subscribe is nowhere in the
podcast area they've converted
podcasting to completely totally on
demand and at that point
comes streaming media streaming content
so the secret the podcast revolution was
it is a single channel for media
delivery mastery of the new media
revolution is that we master all of
these channels and you don't just have a
podcast strategy of a podcast strategy
you have a streaming strategy you have a
physical delivery strategy you have
things like the podias box you know
where you can do things remotely on
control you got to have control this
stuff you know we put out a podcast the
entire world gets the same thing at the
same time what if I want to give you
something different than you and use
something different than you so the
podcasting revolution in cape this in
the pants that gave us one channel it
made us not worry so much about the
licensing and the technology but we need
to go to phase two so the technology is
here we're gonna talk about flip cameras
and field interview kits we're going to
talk about Kindles and iPhones are going
to talk about the streamers which I
here's a big deal in this group or talk
about e-learning the potty is the
popcorn hours it's our about I you'll
pay pal and premium cast calm and I
think you guys will see that it's it's
here it's arrived and then will I will
take some questions accordingly flip
cameras and field interview kids you
guys seen the flip camera this thing is
absolutely amazing now do you know the
origin of this thing this started
somebody said you know it would be great
if we had these you know people have the
disposable cameras what if we had
disposable video cameras and then
somebody could take like 30 minutes of
video taken into the local drugstore
drugstore burns a DVD well the thing was
the hackers got to hold of these things
you know and they were just keeping them
and they were you know streaming the
stuff out via USB so they took the
internal stuff it's just a normal Jack
so you turn the thing on if you have
batteries there we go and you record now
all the buttons you ready for all the
buttons record on everybody and record
off sit that's the entirety the
directions now if you want to delete it
you can go through and view the stuff
you can delete things and then when you
want to pull this stuff off plane to USB
port Tim's got a more recent version of
it just flash that around it's ntsc
quality it's an hour full video you can
take the clips as you want my five year
old makes adventures of barbie movies on
this thing okay and
she edits and they daddy can we make a
DVD and send it to Papa you know grandpa
down in Santa Barbara you bet we can so
we have now got the ability for ntsc
quality that my five-year-old can run
this thing retail a hundred and fifty
bucks if she drops this fine not a big
deal you know depaul do you want to
protect the consumer protection plan on
this hundred fifty dollar throat way
product no i don't and so we've got this
thing is that makes video very very very
easy to do well Paul don't we have that
on phones yes we have that on the
smartphones of the geeks carry you know
Paul don't we have it on the digital
cameras yeah the digital cameras do it
but it's a little bit different of a
chipset the ability to just grab these
clips and by the way they have editing
software on this thing Mac PC uploads on
the new version they just had new
version came out it's it's slimmer I
think it holds two hours of it now yes
it's not HD but it's one hundred and
fifty dollars Tim Tim brought a complete
and total portable recording unit this
is what he does he's a podcaster I
wanted to get some highlights of this
event because it's going to take a
couple of weeks to get the youtube thing
out and I want to go home and brag that
I spoke at Google so you know Tim's been
recording some stuff with a complete and
total portable recording unit under a
thousand bucks for this thing that he
put together it's absolutely amazing so
we have field interview capabilities
right now if you go to the New Media
Expo in August which I highly recommend
you're going to see a lot of people
running around with you know actually
they won't have this out x2 they might
just to show it off because that's what
they do but I'm you see everybody
filming everybody else very very easy to
do you're going to see people with their
you know their mics and their Mike flags
and their portable recorders and that
kind of stuff this thing here from at
all this is a gorgeous mediarecorder and
this has you play an external mic into
it low cuts microphone gains the whole
nine yards a great roland this is
rolling the synthesizer guys you know
this is a great thing often you can plug
the external mic into that and if i
don't trust the people who are recording
it i will actually take a secondary mike
and just give this my pocket then i get
a recording the event it has mic gain on
it i tend to get if it's a different
crowd i tend to get loud and shout and
scream that kind of stuff this thing
does the levels for me automatically
absolutely amazing what we can do now
we can take this stuff on the road with
us it's just it's just nothing stopping
us Kindles and iPhones my eight-year-old
and we got the kindle on Friday my 8
year old says what about my books she's
in a Ramona kick right now you know we
order Ramona we download Ramona she
finished Ramona's world by Saturday
morning a couple of hundred pages we uh
and then I said we're gonna stop buying
books because the rate you read books
daddy could go broke so we went in the
public domain grab black beauty she's
about halfway through that now and we've
got on-demand content and you know I
told my wife it's funny I mean tech
flows in and out of the house obviously
you can you can tell what type person I
am and she always know where you hype
this up you hide that up Kimmel shows
obviously well that's that's a nice
screen you know my father came over and
he's you know wow that's a nice screen
and so we've got now not just on demand
audio on demand video but really frosted
purposes we have on demand print it's
very green in nature and if you realize
that but that thing has a built-in web
browser it has an e video connection you
can it's actually amazing what you can
do funny thing is is the number one top
selling book in the kindle book store
you bet i wanna take a guess obvious you
can see my slide you know it's not an
rice it's not Tom Clancy you know it's
not the wizard boy okay somebody wrote a
tutorial on how to use the kindle to do
really really cool things they're
selling it inside of the amazon store
that's the number one product inside the
amazon storage so a new media maker has
already gone into the kindle store and
is selling content him self now granted
it's only 99 cents it's a brilliant
marketing move for him but it's the
number one product in the store right
now i was streaming audio friday on the
edge network which I much must emphasize
is the slowest did a network on the
planet okay and if I was streaming audio
over that guy named Steve I don't know
if you've heard of him we made an
announcement yesterday about a phone
that's supposed to speed things up you
know if I was streaming to over the
world's slowest network yesterday we got
one megabit coming very very soon july
eleventh I here
what is that going to do for the
streaming content over the phone where
in the car I mean this whole idea of a
podia Spock's you know where you have to
dock your iPod or what we'll talk about
the popcorn hour in a minute this
stuff's coming fast the tech is here by
the way pretty much everything I showed
you the most expensive thing in the room
is that I'm at all I'm everything else
here is under 200 bucks so the tech is
here to do this stuff I bought a
six-hundred-dollar three-chip high-def
inition camera and it tastes gorgeous
gorgeous stuff and unfortunately words
got out amongst you know my church in my
daughter's ballet group that somebody
has the high definition cameras it gets
guess who gets to film everything but
the fact matters this stuff is available
it's here so the live streamers my
three-year-old yes sir to quit calm
quick calm and fortunate I couldn't get
to work with the network here but take a
look at it cute qik.com you can take one
of the n mine nokia phones and you can
open it up you could take the camera and
you can stream live video about half of
640 x 480 which math is 320 by whatever
but you know but it's a quick stream you
could take this thing on the road you
can go to live event and not only can i
do an interview with you but the events
live anybody who's watched me that live
can send questions via text at the
website that stuff streams up so i can
go 0 so until wants to know x so and so
on sterno act so once wants to know x a
live broadcasting studio in the same
phone that you brought with you this is
a two year old demo phone okay imagine
what's going to happen with this new you
know 3g ipod and whatnot quick calm
absolutely amazing my three-year-old
daughter she's four now actually sees
five now what did I put three it's been
a long it's been a long year everybody
she's five now she uses this thing she
takes videos with him she uses the quick
camp she uses the microphone she's not
quite reading the kindle she did ask if
there's any dr. Seuss on the Kindle and
I had to say no at this point the the
Susa stayed I guess does not believe in
digital print yet ustream.com I know if
you're familiar I'm sorry ustream TV I
don't know if you're familiar with them
but your stream TV lets anybody with
their webcam set up a television show
and there are shows right now if you go
to use stream
TV now unfortunately the majority of
them are you know 16 to 20 year old
girls or geeks typing at their computer
and it's kind of disturbing at times if
you think about it but the technology of
ustream means anybody can broadcast
stuff they did the Mars landing on
ustream TV Hillary's speech ustream TV
I'm really interesting stuff any laptop
with a webcam can stream what about the
driver is what about the technology we
figured it out it's done it's all done
with the adobe flash it's a gorgeous
little product modulus mogul is calm you
could do multiple cameras and multiple
locations all for the same place and
that can get streamed at a flash player
that gets trained at multiple sites let
me give you an example of this I was an
event as event a group called stompernet
I was out in Atlanta and we took the
modulus technology we put it on my blog
at Paul Colligan calm / live we put it
at six other blogs just to show off the
experiment and then from the stage at
the stompernet event I interviewed
somebody in Portland who is doing
something very very cool that had to do
with the event and we are broadcasting
it live to six different blocks all
using the modular system absolutely
fabulous stop it's there it's now it's
today all these systems quick you scream
and we'll get us all of them archive the
stuff so if you can't attend live yes
it's scary there are people sitting
around waiting for a tweet to come that
Jason Calacanis has met somebody to talk
to on the street but the fact that
matter is and this is that multiple
channel things some people consume live
some people love that stuff but some
people want the archive well all this
stuff takes the archive all this stuff
tapes the recording keeps in the
background and the video quality is
pretty good no it's not HD yet give them
a couple of weeks so the live streamers
are there the technology is ready and
it's away people are delivering content
so elearning putty us and popcorn hours
so I have a thing I told you I make my
revenue stream from selling content I
have a group of students called Paul's
new media inner circle and basically
everything I do I basically have this
code with with the group everything I do
gets record and gets set to them now
something like this it's live event I'm
going to send them to you know youtube
com they've used it before but the fact
that matter is if I do a closed event or
something the deal that I'm able to peep
I get to record the event and if I
cannot record the event I will for this
group of people I will do a secondary
recording of it for them so everything I
do over the course the year they get
sent to them directly now right now it
gets sent for those who want it to the
potty is device which the podias being
shot around the room and again that will
run the ipod's that will power up the
ipod's that will sync content with the
ipad so not only will it put and I'll do
many of the USB based devices as well
not only can I put content and only can
I say Frank gets this piece of content
but I can tell the Frank is downloaded
the content very very cool and so I am
delivering this stuff to their devices
and the great thing is I got one guy in
an iPod I got one guy in a creative zen
I got one guy on a 16 gig USB stick I
don't care how it gets delivered I just
know that the content is getting
delivered to them I going through one
system premium cast calm which I own
we'll be talking about that in a minute
I go to the system i distribute the
stuff via RSS and some people actually
got one guy who gets it on a microsoft
zune believe it or not but hey i don't
care it gets sent to one place this
party's device is nice to the popcorn
hour who's got this area so this device
I just got this on friday so I've not
been able to play with this yet this is
a phenomenal device a price point the
goal is to be a hundred and fifty
dollars and what this is is full
component out full audio out full hdmi
so you've got great connectivity you can
do full HD it has you notice the front
USB for USB connectivity so instead of
buying a tebow that only has 40 gig on
under whatnot you can actually use
whatever hard drive you one including
memory sticks is a bittorrent client
built into it and each of these devices
are machine accessible each have their
own number so I can use the cows go comm
system the same system i'm using to
shoot stuff to podium and i can send
content directly to this box which gets
hooked up to somebody's television set
by the way you know that's just the
chipset you can put hard driving this
bad boy and then you don't win the one
terabyte hard drives go on 100 bucks
throw on one terabyte hard drive full
bittorrent client built-in i mentioned
that but the fact that matter is now
instead of sending my new media inner
circle content through cows go to the
podium devices these other things i can
actually send it right to their
television set
have an email trigger go out this is by
the way you know the latest training on
X is on your television set you know
recorded with you know $150 camera or a
screen setup or whatever it is that I
did I want somebody else put that back
together on that the the intended price
can be about a hundred and fifty dollars
my heck is about a hundred and sixty
right now but the goal is to make it
really really cheap and it's a great
little device somebody said they had one
or they just bought one what do you like
it okay yeah yeah I got it getting ready
you know I like to bring props to events
like this so you know I learn to got it
and I want to play with it but I had to
leave so I'm looking forward to going
home and playing with it but it's a it's
a great device and hooking into it
through these systems makes for really
really really interesting stuff the I
you'll pay pal premium cast calm so I
old TV who has ever seen around
Christmas time the silly little videos
of a fireplace with the log burning
whoever's thought well that's just silly
I wanted to take it to the next level if
that's silly let's go you know let's go
high def silly shall we so we got a 1.3
gigabyte HD file of a absolutely
gorgeous fireplace we got custom music
written for this and we were going to
sell it for charity at a 57 and a
ten-dollar point now it's been selling a
lot we got picked up a lot of places we
actually got mentioned in the fake steve
jobs blog it's one of our proudest
moments New York Times had a screenshot
a bunch of great stuff at five seven and
ten bucks the price point for different
versions we had an ipod version we had
an iphone version we had a zune version
we had with music without music you know
we had all your choices we actually sold
one yesterday a receipt came through
it's like Christmas and June really for
these people and the way it worked was I
you'll dot TV it was the fireplace in
your pocket was the way that we did that
together and we use the premium cast
system I own premium cast premium cast
is you know podcasting is one RSS feed
for the world every day it's the same
exact RSS feed well it's ridiculous you
can't do any tracking that way you can't
do any management that we can't do any
sales that way so premium cast is a
system lets you do individualized RSS
feeds all from a central database
you can you know people can get
sequential content people can get you
know paid for content lock it up
somebody stops paying you know you turn
off their feed kind of thing so we took
I you'll we took paypal as a payment
mechanism when took premium cast calm
and we sold this thing for charity and I
will lean towards the camera here you
can I you know you get the idea we sold
thousands of this okay we sold thousands
of this and this was a 1.3 gigabyte
download so it's a type of thing where
I'm only the truest of the geese could
pick up this thing we bought ten percent
of a school in Nepal we paid for a
couple of cows we bought books and inner
cities we did a bunch of really really
cool things as a result of this we also
delivered terabytes of bandwidth that
people purchased and paid for thousands
and that was the real geek unit this
year we have a physical product that you
be able to buy via DVD I'll be done
obviously we get the download options as
well but that DVD process going to
happen on demand again the options will
be to go to charity what's funny is if
you go out to I old TV there are a
number of people and again all the links
or paul colligan com / google we go out
to I you'll TV a number of well-known
podcasters video podcasters one guy
actually spent probably ten times more
on his video response to I you'll do we
actually spent on aisle I'm he has
himself waiting out by the bus he hasn't
so important of a fire-eating mincemeat
pie and a glass of port it's absolutely
hilarious we have one guy who got in
front of a like a 60 inch plasma
television set he called it the I you'll
inferno slate.com and their video thing
they did the definitive history of the I
Yule Log they listed that and so we got
a lot of press it was a lot of fun and
we actually did some good with it so I'm
happy about that as well so if a guy in
Texas can take an HD camera and film his
mother's fireplace attaching custom
music to a piano bar owner in Tennessee
with funding by paypal using assistant
from a guy out in Portland and thousands
can be sold we could be by
parts of schools you know we've got a
hundred and fifty dollar cameras that
are click and sindh if we can stream
from a phone or a television set or
stream from a phone or a computer if we
got $150 box so we can put a terabyte
hard drive on individually address and
content to it the text here it's not
we're not at a point of one day no we're
here okay and so why hasn't this
revolution caught on yet you know I mean
if it's not the tack it has to be the
numbers right maybe the numbers aren't
here to support it you guys won't see
some numbers I'm not gonna go the next
slide you guys might see some numbers
yeah there we go and the crowd went wild
so we're gonna talk about the Edison
report Edison arbitron report this is my
favorite report you know it's always
funny you know you follow you monitor
this stuff and you know everybody comes
to these things with their own
prejudices and their own reasons for
these reports the Edison arbitron report
is is my favorite I think they're very
realistic a lot of podcasters really
don't like this report at all because I
think it tells the truth but some really
good things came out of the Edison
arbitron report there's some additional
internet TV reports we're talk about
three podcasts geek brief TV the seventh
son and grammar girl grammar girl is a
story of a fascinating story we'll talk
about stompernet smarts a multi-million
dollar launch of a product sold entirely
by video online and we're to talk about
what Oprah has done to our space because
Oprah has done some really really
interesting things to our space and
nothing says numbers like Oprah so the
Edison report podcast consumers now what
it did was it took it took the general
public and then it's with the podcast
consumers and did them side by side so
this is podcast consumer information but
people who are willing to consume
podcast content okay they are
comfortable watching television through
non-traditional means you know people
keep saying well people aren't going to
watch Sullivan anything other than
television no no podcast consumers are
interested in watching this stuff to
non-traditional means now the funny
thing is again we go back to my Luddite
best man who still has a 46 in his house
the fact the matter is you know the guy
watches Battlestar Galactica and 24 and
all the good shows on netflix DVD he
good
stuff differently anyway you know the
one channel concept it's over it's gone
it's dead so you found out the
podcasters very willing to do that we
found out that more than one in five
Americans has watched or listened to
downloadable media okay more than twenty
percent of Americans has watched or
listened to downloadable media this is
edison arbitron read the numbers so once
it got to define it was really funny you
know they asked how many of you have
consumed podcast content Baird anybody
said anything then they define what
podcast content was and oh yeah I did
that and so about twenty percent of us
have done that really interesting stuff
I've got a link to it they have a very
specific definition for it and if you go
to paul call going to come / google
that'll take you out there and you can
see how they defined it a very good
definition that's the one that i'm using
now so i just you know it's it's long
and wordy and no fun of her presentation
like this no no it was down in that
presentation it was downloaded content
so it was not streaming it was actually
downloaded content to a device now maybe
a lot of people tend to watch podcast
content on their computer it's got some
stats on that it's like still like
eighty-two percent or something so at
times that's a progressive download
which is a stream and so but it was
actually downloadable content so YouTube
would not be included in that and I'm
some of the other things any of the
questions on that one because it's
important one yes forty-seven percent
yeah I'm sorry the question was I'm us
only what was that us only numbers yes
and then the other question was how is
podcasting defined and it was actually
physically the downloading of the
product now a progressive download was
there when I speak of the iphone earlier
and the streaming diverging from the
iphone i mean technically that was a
progressive download as well the mp3
format the mp4 format makes progressive
downloading which is streaming like i
don't know if you guys have a technical
term for it internally and i will now
remember to repeat all questions because
we're not just in this room forty-seven
percent of podcast consumers have
purchased something online there's this
whole mantra in this space that they're
not willing to buy content okay
forty-seven percent of podcast consumers
have purchased content online about one
out of every two
people are willing to buy the content
eighty-two percent of them have
purchased something online that's a good
metric if you compare that to the other
sits compared to the report it's fully
downloadable great pretty little
graphics and if you think about that
that's very very impressive the money is
there and the people who are consuming
this stuff and it goes with Paul's just
one channel meme the idea of having your
podcast only available via podcast is
ridiculous the idea of having your
stream only available as stream is
ridiculous HBO recently they have a show
called in treatment and it's an
interesting 30 minute show it's
basically reenactments of moments with
the shrink and basically it's different
people going through the treatment
process it's fascinating drama they
released the first 16 episodes as a
podcast for free no commercials no
nothing because they knew that people
would get hipped after about the 16
channels so if they're willing to
purchase content they're going to
purchase something give them stuff this
way now should HBO cut the cable and
start deliver it you know stop
delivering things to the televisions of
America no but expanding out to this
channel makes a heck of a lot of sense
and this is part of the marketing
message you know we try to get people
it's just yes there are people who
aren't ready for this stuff yet but
those who are it's green it's cheap it's
fast it's profitable it's to an audience
that's willing to spend money I mean
it's ideal on many many levels in many
many ways that's the Edison report
definitely linked through to that one
some additional reports I just went
backwards in time just a little bit of
find out what's happening LA Times I
mean Hollywood okay they're becoming
just the lowest numbers on the
multi-channel dial rather than the last
outputs of mass culture talking about
television you know may 26 le x is going
television ain't what it used to be it
doesn't have the power that used to have
and you know if that was coming out of
any place other than lala land you know
might not be quite as interesting but
that it comes from here very very
important stuff you guys might have read
it might have it up in the break room
ABI research a day later the numbers of
viewer who access video via the web
quadruple in the next couple of years
reaching at least 1 billion 2013 okay
that's a fourth of the planet video
online very very soon I if so so I'd
never heard of but it was an interesting
quote among the fifty percent of
Americans 12 plus scoom of ever streamed
or downloaded digital files went out of
every five hours spent watching movies
and TV shows is done on a PC so anybody
who consumes this stuff anybody who has
started this process is now taking
twenty percent minimum of their content
in front of a pc this idea that
television is the only place we're going
to watch video is going away this idea
that the stereo there's the only place
we're gonna listen to me and obviously
the ipod really radically changed our
views of music but it's not just the
music it's the content it's the training
it's a really big world out there and
there's some really fascinating stuff
and to be able to move out of just one
delivery mechanism is there one of the
things going to do with I you'll in a
last year everything was digital
download we had a great time with it
this you're going to put it on DVD why
because some people will not contend low
to 1.3 gigabyte file obviously and so to
give them that plastic disk option is
going to bring in no considerably bigger
revenue streams so internet TV reports
it's there it's it's it's there the
numbers are there geek brief TV and you
may know geet brief cali I'm surprised I
called them what's your average these
days about 350,000 downloads per episode
okay four shows a week they're doing
more than a lot of cable stations are
doing husband-and-wife team out of an
apartment in Dallas or someplace in
Texas though than ones I did the igo
project with 30 months ago neither one
of them owned a video camera many
episodes have passed the million-dollar
the million-dollar yeah they wish the
million download mark okay million
downloads cable operators dreams
television shows dreams many episodes
they've done and just surprising when
certain tax certain things happen
they're getting ready for the big trip
they're going
to outfit an old bus and they're going
to take the technology with him on the
road they're going to do all 50 states
obviously Hawaii will not get the bus
but they will take it up to Alaska and
they're going to new media streaming
from the road they got a contract
ustream TV to do a thing once a week
from these things they're doing amazing
stuff and it's a great so well done show
you know and basically they talk about
tech and you know this is the response
to what happened at the you know she's
obviously a big fan of the Apple and
they're doing great stuff it's it's done
it's part of the video network the the
atom career on bloom thing and they're
doing real numbers by themselves no best
boy no gaps no you know microphone
holder dudes or whatever the technical
terms are am in hollywood i should say
more the seventh son a science fiction
novel delivered as an audio podcast why
because the guy couldn't print it you
know basically so it starts to deliver
his science fiction novels an audio
podcast it stretch doing so well that
big geek icons Nathan Fillion Firefly
and George Romero obviously from the
horror film industry they show up to do
cameos on this thing it gets so big
about thirty thousand listeners over a
million downloads st. Martin's Press
picking up 2009 went from podcast to a
physical print book you know rumor of
Hollywood doing the movie of it there's
always rumors of Hollywood doing a movie
oh but fatha matter was the guy came
from nothing recorded his book got the
printing job as a result of it things
are twisting things are flipping around
this is my favorite one this is my
favorite story at all grammar girl now
this is the typical story you write the
book right you write the book then you
get you know the extensions of the book
the audio CD isn't that kind of stuff
and then you get on Oprah right that's
the model right let me tell you what
happened to minyan mignon launches a
show called grammar girl where she talks
about grammar that was an interesting
cross stream of everything because who's
interested in grammar businesspeople
moms
want to teach their kids kids who want
to learn it you know everybody loves
grammar I guess I don't love grammar
that much muchly I don't know what the
proper term is and so she launches this
show where she each episode is just an
element of grammar like when somebody
says how are you doing do you say I'm
doing very well or I'm doing good what
do you say grammar girl will tell you so
grandmas girl starts doing the show for
about four months she gets a book
contract okay the problem is she gets a
call from and she hasn't really need a
book yet and Oprah says will you come on
the show Monday now how does she come on
the show apparently Oprah made some
grammatical oral mistakes and a bunch of
people wrote in the show saying hey
Oprah you should have grammar girl come
on to fix your mistakes so she comes to
the code so she calls her editor and she
says okay you know that whole thing
where you get the book out then you go
on Oprah yeah slight problem I'm going
to be on Oprah on Monday what are we
going to do they got a sound editor took
the best of her podcast episodes at the
time edited together an audiobook got
this thing on audible and then the
iTunes audio book store before minion
went on Oprah now when she went on Oprah
she wasn't should not speak of her
podcast did not speak of her book to not
do anything just her appearance on Oprah
got her number one inaudible and itunes
for this little thing and the book by
the way this was last March the book I
think comes out next month you know the
dead tree industry is a slow one I
emailed her and I said hey man I'm gonna
be speaking to the folks at Google um
can you give me some good numbers and
and I just got the text this morning and
that's why the slide isn't necessarily
the prettiest but I'm 1.2 million
Nielsen validated down loads of the
grammar girl show last month okay she's
monetizing she has grammar girl dolls
shirts she has she has a shirt very
popular shirt
talk grammar to me people buy it okay
and I'm she's gonna be going on to hey
you know Roy economics 101 find a market
fill it and mignon has done a just
fabulous fabulous job the numbers are
there stop it out smarts a online
training organization called stompernet
launches a program called smarts social
marketing training system basically is
what it was more than 2,000 copies of a
fourteen hundred dollar product sold in
less than a week do the math okay more
than 2,000 copies of a 1400 ollar
product sold in less than a week so only
online via video via PDF amazon s3 is
their CDN yes that is millions no
mailing the phone calls everything
digital an amazing sale a great program
we're almost done we've been Oprah look
what Oprah's doing 374 thousand entries
for you know you always got to have that
token in Google entry standpoint for
every slide deck you do so for podcast
to a 74 thousand lewnard spirituality
she's mentioned six times you know on
the top fold of the spirituality section
in in itunes so seriously old the new
media side by side Oprah's delivering in
our space our space is delivering an
opus space Oprah space the wall
platforms dead locking up the stuff drm
in the stuff just doesn't make sense
things like that popcorn box is going to
absolutely take over the index of all
this stuff is a very valuable index if I
can go to a place and type in I want to
watch the show what are my options by
the way that index doesn't exist yet all
this stuff has been happening in new
media space with absolutely no index at
all you can't find this stuff at all
your best choice maybe itunes but that's
so locked and so walled isn't even funny
index doesn't exist do we know anybody
who does indexing just a thought we need
to get serious about this my blog
follows this industry subscribe to it
the new media expose in august 10 its
fourth year
google has yet to get a booth booth
please start taking this seriously you
met Tim he's from there he didn't know I
was gonna make that pitch but I'm gonna
promote the benefits not the tack it's
not about podcasting it's been on demand
media okay if you promote the benefits
what we've got you know hey you can do
everything I do it's going to be
delivered right to your television set
the popcorn boxes are relevant you know
the fact that it was just the best of
the grammar girl podcast was that CD
doesn't matter bro the benefits not the
technology leverage what your audience
is already leveraging with content
already have and consider indexing this
stuff again that indexing term nobody's
doing it yet whoever does that it's
going to do some pretty fabulous things
again all the stuffs that Paul Colligan
calm / google missing sides and content
whimper questions questions from here or
wherever you guys are ya the question is
does advertising has a place does
advertising have a place in this
advertising absolutely has a place in
this however the role of advertising in
this place is very different than what
it used to be in the old days we threw
things up to a lot of people we hoped
something stuck Seinfeld would have you
know you'd watch five minutes of
Seinfeld there'd be the token commercial
for the 18 to 25 male demographic the
token commercial for the 18 to 25 female
demographic token commercial for the 25
to 45 demographic you know and you could
just tell who each of these rain before
that's not going to work anymore people
are not going to put up with that
anymore it's gone it's over if you send
stuff directly people you're going to
know who they are if you take a look at
what hulu is doing that's the NBC Fox
thing and apparently um they just signed
Comedy Central at least parts of it I
guess Jon Stewart starts today on there
you know hulu can build a very clear
database we love hulu it's one of the
things we watch on regular basis one
commercial / break but the fact that
matter is is i buy advertising and if I
know who i'm getting all pay good money
for that it's this I don't know who I'm
getting there for them kind of sloppy
with my cash so the traditional
interruption through everything else see
what sticks advertising
it's dying it's dying fast they're
really tightly demographically targeted
stuff is very very very powerful and
that gets integrated this stuff's going
to have on demand you're going to see I
mean we're already having this I'm shows
like ask a ninja very popular video
podcast people don't realize this but
every week the ad inserts change through
a very powerful system that just takes
whoever bought you know the inventory
this week it's done an audio I do that
on all my audio stuff so if you listen
to a show on june first you listen to
the archive of the show in july first
it's different commercials based on
whatever i'm selling to that string
demographic at that time so yes
definitely has a space but this idea and
podcasters tend to have this you know
the Kevin Costner school of marketing if
you build it they will come only works
in imaginary movies about baseball
fields in baseball fields in cornfields
and Nebraska or wherever that was it's
not really a good way to build a
business plan so this idea that i'll
create content people come through
minyan grammar girl you know what she
sells the talk grammar to me shirts why
because there's a lot of money and
taught grammar to me shirts and you know
a godaddy get your own domain edge it's
not going to do so well on her show even
though she's tried it so we have a lot
more power to be a lot more creative
with what we do so we're doing it but
this this traditional five minutes of
content two minutes of commercial it's
gone it's gone are you seeing it i mean
i mean who lose doing fabulous with one
perp and you know you don't mind
watching a show now you know and you
take the show there's one commercial
that's kind of okay where you pay the
buck 99 to get it without conversion
they'll see those options as well i mean
you're going to you know you're gonna
run up a show hey you want to pay for
this or not do you want to pay forward
to the spots want to pay for it you pick
same content different channels it's
definitely it's going there's just no
question and whoever runs that you know
if we know anybody out there who has you
know targeted ad insertion technologies
where consumers can buy markets and
decide where they want to have and you
know if you know anybody give them a
call tell them this is a good space to
get into hey the board you silly or
answer all the questions
so yep yep um well one out of every five
hours of television consumption by the
demographic enjoys that they do it on
the computer so an ad on abc.com I was
watching pushing daisies and the ad
between the commercial break said it was
for I think princess cruise line and the
princess cruise line ad said for your
custom five hundred dollar off coupon or
something click here and we'll talk to
you after the show's over with very
polite very non interrupted but very
very cool so for that for that twenty
percent of your audience is consuming
online you've got full clip capabilities
you know for a thing like a popcorn box
where you can stream stuff over you know
let them choose how much they like the
commercial and you know start
customizing the stuff based on that you
can do input on that's a pretty open
architecture in you're going to see more
and more of that so you know no it's not
there yet and there's gonna be a lot of
it we're going to have to know who they
are ahead of time but but input in the
live is is there i'll tell you a 3g
iphone with decent battery connectivity
we're stuck in an airport like i was
yesterday all watching shows with some
commercials and i'm bored enough that i
might click through i was stuck in the
airport yesterday I know all of you are
crying be able to hear you do you have
any questions that you'd like to ask
all right Thank You Bucharest I never
talked to Bucharest live before I think
it's kind of cool
great question so the question is right
now the podcast and the general new
media consumption space tends to be very
small groups for small audiences and the
question is where as that might be
interesting now you know the money is in
the consolidation and so the question
was whether it be like a Walmart of
podcasts now there are some
organizations who try to do that they
failed miserably at this point what's
interesting is is to support the
infrastructure of NBC you know the
broadcast studio you have to be able to
sell your show to a billion people but
to support the infrastructure of a
husband and wife team in an apartment in
Texas you don't have to sell as many
shows so what's going to happen is
you're going to see two things you're
going to see a lot of niche there's some
really interesting niche markets out
there some really really interesting
niche markets out there they're going to
have niche shows why now because it can
be profitable to do a niche show but now
let's talk the non niche show you know
geeks who love geeky toys there are a
lot of geek podcast out there ok I think
Cali's got the best numbers different
people would argue on that you know are
those going to consolidate you bet
somebody who does the standard evening
news is that going to consolidate you
bet as a matter of fact all of the major
evening news shows NBC CBS ABC are all
available via podcast now and you
download you know it's funny because
it's six-thirty you can watch the NBC
news or at six-forty-five you can
download it without commercials what's
really interesting I don't think I've
shared this with anybody so this is kind
of fun the Dave Ramsey show which is a
popular radio show what's really
interesting is is if you download the
Dave Ramsey show podcast on iTunes there
are no commercials but if you download
the Dave Ramsey podcast on the zune
podcast network there are commercials so
obviously they're getting it from
two different feeds and obviously the
Dave Ramsey group is trying out
something and I want to get down to the
bottom that I'll let you know but so the
larger organizations are going to start
broadcasting down the stuff HBO is in
the space Oprah is in this space the
consolidators are in this space but the
consumption you see a lot of things
happening in music right now you can see
Madonna for like you know five hundred
dollars now you know in the back of the
stadium if you want to or you can go to
the local club and this new band whose
really really good here you know you can
hang out with and we're moving away from
the monoculture to a mini culture and so
you're going to have on this device see
it's the great thing about this popcorn
our box on this device I can have HBO I
can have NBC I can have me I can have
you know some guy who does a show for 14
people out in Florida if he keeps
producing it then the barrier to entry
is so incredibly low that he's going to
keep doing this stuff now can he make
money on 14 people if he can god bless
them a lot of them happen it's really
interesting one of the funniest I just I
find this incredibly humorous nobody
else does but I'm the one on stage so
one of the top formats of podcasting
right now isn't porn isn't geek well the
top Florence podcasting right now is a
language learning language drivetime
French Drivetime Japanese and whatnot so
I get these emails from guys who go you
know I get hundreds of thousands of
downloads per episode I can't make any
money to think about it they're giving
away absolutely free of charge with
people whose to charge for you know
you're going to call Berlitz and go well
I'm giving Spanish language lessons for
free would you like to advertise your
paid product on my show you know not so
much you know and this is why we
advocate before you podcast have a plan
silly silly silly so the niche are going
to be there at the niche were making
profit I have shows with very small
audiences that I make good money from
and no matter what happens in the space
that audience is going to continue to
follow me only a couple of dozen people
in my new media inner circle right now
that's a good chunk of change so it's
very very narrowcast in the technology
is there now if narrowcasting the new
media inner circle required that i
bought you know satellite time or you
know airtime and all the networks and
markets at these people that never would
happen so you will see consolidation
where consolidation makes economic sense
but the economic reality is what we've
got right now do not make consolidation
an inevitable inevitability should get
grandma girl up here so you know we've
got amazing opportunities now you know I
put a.m. it was committee called cdbaby
cdbaby.com any band can put their album
on CD baby for 35 bucks and CD baby will
put you in itunes I took a speech of a
recording I did I put it on CD i sent it
to CD Baby I've now got a speech in
itunes how cool is that you know if paul
can get a speech in itunes anybody can
trust me and so now i am available my CD
is in the world's largest record store
you know consolidations consolidation I
didn't know that's a term but anyway you
know I'm saying there are a number of
organizations so the promise is the
promise is is a dynamic insertion of a
bad content on the stream or on the fly
or maybe the content gets changed on a
database so there are a lot of
organizations who do that conceptually
it's kind of fascinating because you
have things like you have general
interest events you know when spider-man
4 launches every piece of media on the
planet could hold a spider-man 4 badge
on it it doesn't matter I mean that's a
place where the spider-man 4 ad could go
would be on that Japanese learning
language podcast because you know
everybody wants to watch spider-man so
these organizations out there the
concept was they would manage you know
dozens and dozens and dozens of shows
with you know millions of impressions
per week and then do ad buys and add
cells and mass and some have done that
some have done quite well with that
godaddy continues to buy ads through
these organizations because the audience
of the tech podcast tend to buy domain
names they tend to be cheap Go Daddy
provides both so it does quite well
there are several sources online for you
know how big these numbers are and none
of them have gone public and that type
of thing the problem is is the general
this is Paul's interpretation of the
problem but Paul's interpretation the
problem is that the general conception
the general wrapping
this stuff is that these are consumer
content pieces and they're not they're
very specialized in very niche you know
if I have 500 brain surgeons and i'm
selling brain surgeon technology and the
commission on a brain surgeon technology
you know pays me a thousand bucks a pop
you know i only have to sell one every
blue moon to do much much better than a
you know traditional ad insert will do
so the in mass numbers you know mignon
works with an ad group geek brief cali
and neil they work with media who does
ad sales for them and so the large and
mass stuff that is there that is very
very doable but really the strength of
this is in the niche and and in the
insertion you know if there was a
company out there who would let me pour
you know say time codes into my podcast
content and let me sell the ads that you
guys sell the that other companies sell
the ads and you know let me did you know
decide price points and that kind of
stuff i'd actually take it in a
heartbeat you know as the entrepreneur
is the guy who runs the stealth himself
I don't need somebody in the middle
selling my ads I I build I find my
audience I find my ads and then I build
content for it so you know those first
two questions weren't there or else I
wouldn't have done it in the first place
so those companies are there I have
really really big numbers to run that
where's your get an ad inserted ten CPM
CPM is cost per thousand you guys know
that your google and you know you got to
sell a lot of thousands to make that
happen and mignon can make a lot of
money with you know 1.5 million
downloads but that's that's that's a
thousand CPM so if it was 10 CPM you
know a thousand that's $10,000 that's
great for somebody you know working out
of her house but a large multi billion
dollar publicly traded company you know
that's not that interesting now if you
provide for me the technology to
on-demand sell my stuff when I want if I
could click a button and add an ad
across all my shows I pay good for that
and put it up for bidding and if
somebody wants to pay more than i'm
making on it I have a show that sells a
big-ticket event the big-ticket event
pays me a thousand dollar commission per
per purchase so I don't have to sell
many to do very very well on that
podcast you know
I'm some sort of affiliate tracking I
usually buy for that big ticket i buy a
domain name specifically for the for the
podcast and so all clicks that come from
the podcast are coming directly from
there we're doing am I'm doing a project
right now and for downloads we're
putting down at the bottom of the screen
for more information about x visit blank
and that domain name is only associated
with the podcast and for downloads we're
getting about a five percent click
through and they say you know nobody
knows for sure what the downloads are to
consumption but I I'm going with 50 50
you know suvan at 50 50 i'm getting a
ten percent click through right now you
know and that's stuff that they actually
got to type in very very cool and we're
tracking that across a bunch of
different marketers it's kind of a fun
little project and so you know it's
there but yeah you gotta track it
differently you can never do that I mean
and you guys know that again your google
but you know you can ever do the you
know where did you hear about us from
thing down at the bottom that doesn't
work you know unless you give them a big
bonus for mentioning that down at the
bottom so I strack domain name you can
buy there there are sites now I'm i
recommend a two-buck toll-free com to
buck toll-free will sell you a toll-free
number for two bucks a month plus 3
cents a minute some people do that some
people do specialized email addresses
some people do offer codes go dad is
doing very well at the offer code system
right now so different shows geek brief
will say you know use our offer code gb1
that type of thing I recommend domains
because the important thing is I mean
there's there's two sides internet
marketing equation again your google so
you know this but you know there's this
click through in this conversion and if
i get 25,000 click throughs i need some
a thing that's the person i set them to
his problem not mine you know and and so
i want to have both sides of the
equation so domain names hidden and you
know there's this misnomer that there's
no good domain names left there are lots
of great domain names left not a problem
at all and they're getting dumped you
know the the bubble days when we bought
them for five years and bought a lot of
them are getting dumped all the time so
there's more domains coming in every day
then we're buying anymore so very very
doable some organizations do me vo does
does and offers things so like for more
information visit our media offers page
then they have click throughs there and
that type of thing but it's easy to find
a really decent well i mean big
seminar the podcaster who said you know
I would never watch a podcast that had a
pre-roll you know they always talk about
the evil of pre-rolls well three months
later he had a pre-roll you know on his
show why because somebody bought a
pre-roll and he said wow you know I
would love to pay a bill so so you know
when I start on the internet and one of
the reasons why i love podcasting so
much when i started the internet 95 the
thought of using the web for commercial
purposes was also considered obscene you
know the thought of having a website
that sold something was considered
morally reprehensible you know and back
then I didn't know what to do about that
I dunno what to do about that now you
know 495 I had the gumption to say no
guys trust me this is where it's going
if I knew that then I know that now so
yes there is a vocal community who
believes that the insertion of ads is
morally reprehensible but the real
number shows minyan shows has ads she
got on Oprah pause the ones that I'm
following geek brief TV has ads and
they're doing the real numbers to pay
the bills my shows have ads and we're
paying the bills you know yeah I won't
go any further but you know but it just
it's a small tiny percentage of people
who are getting a really bad rep for
this this wonderfully amazing technology
people the line pay for content that's
why we did I you'll you know you could
get the Yule Log okay on pretty much any
PBS station anywhere in the country many
times in HD we sold thousands of these
things to geeks who usually scream up
and down that they would never pay for
content you'll pay for content that you
want you'll pay for content you find
interesting somebody because the charity
angle but a lot didn't you know a lot of
people just bought it because they
wanted to have a fireplace on their ipod
you know so we proved and it was
marketed to all the geek whip you know
leo laporte this week in tech they
talked about this thing for about six
minutes on one episodes absolutely
fabulous a lot of sales that day there's
the same people who scream up and down
i'll never pay for content they will you
know just kind of you know wave your
hand over here while you sell over here
and it works pay no attention the man
behind the mirror
gives you a like you're saying index I
guess it somewhat gives you easy user
friendly way to search for content would
people be willing to pay for a podcast
like say it's 50 cents versus you know
my grandma searching the web for some
podcast on meeting people let's take
three different paths here the podcaster
who loves podcasting because podcasting
is free okay will not buy a podcast for
my tunes ok a marketing person who's
trying to figure out what the ipod is
done for marketing who searches in
itunes ipod marketing and sees a nine
dollar 99 cent CD called the seven ways
the ipod change marketing forever and
what you need to do to survive that's
only nine dollars 99 cents BAM they buy
it people have my little recording has
been purchased a couple of times and I
haven't marketed it yet so you know the
person who is obsessed with the
technology of not paying no they're not
going to buy people are looking for
content by there's a whole industry it's
absolutely hilarious it's you know I
always in the back of my mind is the
entrepreneur little things I want to get
into there's this whole industry of
people who do cover tunes of very
popular songs so let's say Britney
Spears is very popular right now they'll
do a cover tune of britney spears song
get it in the itunes directory just so
that sloppy searchers will buy their
thing instead the britney tues for hey
you know sixty-six cents a track and i
saw enough of those and brittany sells
enough of those you know that you're an
interesting place so I'm should never
run the person obsessed without paying
no they're not going to pay but that is
such a tiny market of people the people
who go to iTunes who are used to paying
they'll pay now let's step outside
itunes people go to google because they
know what they want and Google's going
to find it for him you guys change
search you know search used to be a game
now it's actually a tool if you want
some of you search for it in the stuff
that's the best prize at the top if I
want to find out information on X and up
at the top of Google is X get it on your
ipod now for two bucks I'm going to do
it I've sold a lot of downloadable media
for pay because people who want that
content now there's a guy perfect
example Cornelius fichtner in project
management did you know that project
management now has a certification
process to it oh my goodness that just
sounds haha the project management
preparatory exam okay Cornelius fichtner
yeah let's let's pull it up corniness
actually built the PM prep cast okay a
die it's a 40 hour and my screen got
resized here so you only see part of it
but it is a 40 hour training program for
the project management preparatory exam
it is sold completely totally as a
podcast okay and so you know that's what
you get it fifty bucks downloads
instantly but if you look at the website
p.m. prep casscom maybe my connection
here he's selling 10 dozen of those a
day at 50 bucks audio recorded you know
three forty years ago and and people
find it from google he buys adwords and
he tracks those things through to the
sale using the premium cast service to
sell the stuff now it doesn't say when
you get out to the website it doesn't
say you know the world's only paid
podcast for the project management
preparatory community it says you know
the fastest easiest way to ace the
project management preparatory exam and
then you read down further it says we
will deliver to your ipod right now so
it's the packaging of the stuff that
works and he does very very well and
he's converts there's just not a lot of
people thank God you know looking for
their project management preparatory
exam right now online and for those who
comes through he does really well
converting I don't know why we're not
connecting but so that is there I'm
delivered by podcast yes absolutely I I
mean it's absolute common sense you know
why wouldn't they I'm they've been doing
it for a long time you know is there
something special about you know the
convenience of a podcast that you know
that makes it impossible to pay for it
no and the thing is right now see it I'm
a geek I speak geek okay
we tend to sometimes associate the value
of the product with the technology to
produce it the delivery of a podcast is
basically free if I wanted to stream
something in the old days i had to pay
real a lot of cash rob glaser did very
very well as a result of my efforts but
now as a podcast it's essentially for
all six of purpose is free as a result
would kind of wrap our minds that the
content that delivered you know because
it was delivered free it's it should be
free content that's not it we've got to
get past that the technologies now
become so ubiquitous that you know that
cost doesn't matter anymore you know
people say for I you'll didn't you do a
lot of bandwidth yes we did a lot of
bandwidth a lot of people do not know
how to download a 1.3 gig high
definition file a lot of people try to
do that over and over again we used
amazon s3 is the CDN and we had you know
a couple hundred dollars dude amazon s3
but we sell thousands of you know skews
at five seven and ten bucks each you
don't mind paying your amazon bill when
they sold the stompernet product in the
smarts program i imagine they had a
significant amazon bill but 2,000 units
at 1,400 bucks a pop you don't mind
paying your amazon bill and I hear
there's another company doing some cloud
computing storage stuff that might be
able to give Amazon run for their money
and please do fast and so yes they will
buy convenience and that stuff you don't
do anything about it you know at the
kindle how many books have i bought
already after having it for three days
because i can get it right now you know
contact that popcorn box you know amazon
unbox you guys play with amazon unbox
absolutely gorgeous absolute gorgeous
you want a movie right now amateurs five
says that the apple TV great product sip
the first night it came out everybody
rented a movie that night better than
that you know you click the button
you're able to watch it progressive
download you know and you're you're good
to go the promised other people won't
buy the problem is that people don't
realize know why they want to spend 200
dollars in Apple TV box yet and that
type i think is we're not preaching the
benefits
and we're about to lose Mountain View
thank you very much for showing up
you'll get auto disconnected shortly but
continue okay goodbye bucharest
apparently bucharest is the name of a
conference room and not yes did not know
that you guys do you guys do not look
like bucharest ians sure no and there's
this there's this concept that audio is
dead and it's the most ridiculous
concept on the planet video is sexier
than audio is ok if i want to grab a
portland oregon okay our newspapers
terrible our business journal's even
worse an Oregon Business Magazine don't
get me started okay if I want to catch
the Oregon businessman Drivetime radio
1190 kex 7 to 8 30 that's when I grabbed
that if I want that demographic that's
when I grabbed period maybe drive home
but people drive home at different times
you know that that's 7 to 8 30 slot is
just amazingly valuable for me because
that's how I catch that group now if I
want to catch the 22 year old teenage
girl in Portland Oregon it's not going
to be Drive time radio 1190 kex you know
there are times when the consumption
opportunities for an audio content piece
it's considerably bigger than the
consumption option for a video piece in
the gym in the car yes our people watch
videos in the car but that's a whole
another story you know and so what it is
is it's a match of the media format to
the consumption where by which it
happens people are not going to watch
well people should be watching video in
the background you know while they're at
work but the idea of audio coming in the
background is there I have done some
experimenting in the video space but my
most profitable stuff comes from audio
now some stuff has to be delivered by
video geek brief you know you can't do a
tech gadget review show you know okay
guys i'm holding the popcorn box it's
really cool you know that's just not
going to work that's why i brought props
to show you guys so there are times
you know you know when that happens I've
been quoted as saying before video is
sexy audio is effective now you got
chased the ad dollars right now people
want to buy audio and that's where the
reasons why you know I find the market I
find the product and then we build a
podcast around it as opposed to as
opposed to vice versa people are willing
to buy video inserts at this point now
back in the 80s you know we learned
something from the 90s let's go back to
the 80's remember back in the 80s there
is this thing called MTV okay and it was
going to change music forever you know
we weren't gonna buy CDs anymore we
weren't going to buy music anymore the
only thing we're gonna buy with music
videos remember this you know and any
band that wanted to make it anywhere was
going to have a music video okay those
days are gone MTV now is my sweet 16 and
different shows about bratty girls doing
bratty things the music video is dead
absolutely dead you know now in 85 did
it make a lot of sense to make music
videos you know you bet it did does it
make sense now so you know you have
trends and you have people buy music for
the inexperienced plugging in the
headphones it was the Walkman in 85 it's
the ipod now you know so if you want the
most effective way to reach people it's
audio but if they're not going to
consume the audio where do we go next
but if I look at all the opportunity for
my audience to listen to audio on all
the opportunity from out its listen to
video I look at everybody scream and
running around doing the video thing
also in production yes I could film ntsc
but here's the problem you know I got
the face for radio okay to make me look
good a lot of post-production that we
got to do okay for audio I've got that
voice you know I told my wife one day I
said you know I want to get one of those
um you know radio on the air science
they can know when i'm recording it's
just I know when you're recording well
how do you know when i'm recording you
have your radio voice on it starts to
come through the walls of the house you
know so I'm video is not dead audio is
not did in any way shape or form there's
a lot of money right now being spent a
video there is a lot of attention being
spent in video but the long run it will
be audio forever I'll stake my career on
that and just you know look at MTV
by the way all the big radio stations
are still around now they're all owned
by one person but that's another story
it's an exciting space we're in the
opportunity for you guys to provide the
tech I mean I remember the day AdWords
turned on oh man that changed everything
and then the day then the day Adsense
turned on you know that changed
everything again and the opportunity
that Google has to do something in the
space is absolutely tremendous you know
I I don't know if you as most not you
know I paid my way to get here this is
not a paid gig okay you guys have the
opportunity to some doesn't make me a
lot of money so please do and should we
go lunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
