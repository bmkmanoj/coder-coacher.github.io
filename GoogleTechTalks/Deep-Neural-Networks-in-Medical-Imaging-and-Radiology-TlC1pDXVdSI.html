and early he's a staff scientist at
department of radiology and imaging
Sciences at NIH and that he's
collaborating with us Emily in the data
together to open-source and I actually
decide soon to release on Google Chrome
and the history search is focused on
medical image understanding and semantic
parsing to fit into new clinical
practices especially in the areas of
prevent preventive early cancer
detection diagnosis and developing novel
precision imaging biomarkers we are
large-scale imaging protocols and
statistical learning principles he has
worked on various Kornegay problems in
chronic Holly and the lung nodule safety
systems and he used to work as a Siemens
as a senior staff scientist he has been
named that eighteen US and international
patents and the server has a lot of
conference in fact cvpr I see and he's
hosting hosting the third medical
imaging workshop I business so the slide
is a little bit legacy I have been this
is the first version of it and it's
about one year ago I give a talk at CDC
that I try to summarize what we do at
the time my team meeting is booming but
it's not that much but this year just
after a year I really see a communis
interest everywhere is this lot of
things so I keep on updating this this
is kind of a log I might be interchange
not cover all the attack know each other
but the problem we are working on why we
are working on and how that will
indicate clinical you know Metro has a
has a better side of my jaw visa
I'm flexible
I have really a lot of freedom to do the
thing I like to do and I would call it I
collaborate with we the world best
doctors especially Ross hammer Lansing I
believe these when visionary doctors and
understand contribution and we're well
and I think ia attend the VP's course
while he was Sebastian who was on
sabbatical
a lot of its kind of connections and
sometimes explain things to him I feel
something he understand better than my
manager he met Chris company even a
healthy community units as a doctor are
amazingly they're very smart and a lot
in size I think that helps us near Anna
for example I think I'm kind of consider
is you know how they were trained in the
in the redness how this big Hospital
deterrent they get to except for like a
highly effective doctor what is the
curriculum how hard they doing how did
they learn from either saying start with
other thing or the leader they do I have
evidence in deeded or Hanukkah money so
they have a both this this big book and
they talk about all the normal
aberrations and that's assimilated
disease so they were a doctor you know
you can be a resident for maybe one or
two they starting to diagnose different
disease then they learn that class the
the pre-campaign cook Nick so they just
don't know what everyone wrong so
because it really looks similar
wherever similar to the pathology but
there are normal variations the FEMA has
a lot of nominations the really lumpy
problem is similar to Ottomans driving
it is really long
it's a long two issues and after happier
from that apparently commanding they
actually began to learn things new and
better so begin from their performance
oh is that a lot of thing nothing we
should be really petted into and this is
all this big and successful reputable
medical institution how they do things
in a way and I think the way we fantasy
is how we can make that job easier or we
can make them no effective they can care
more efficient better faster in the way
but we you did have a lot of
no I really years at each hospital they
will use sitting like a mating some
meetings some years of it's 100 years
old so they have a lot of thing what
about treasure issue
oh yeah so I said as some mature is more
for the general audience I guess from
last year how tools to comments people
say you know whether declaring time you
just wanna it's a strong yes we do
several things we do work on storylines
and I think we sure like aesthetics even
in the progress compromise crew is your
art and another thing I have to mention
is a deep level of deep learning is not
necessary to solve all four better than
before in individual achievement but
many many I'm trying to say that same
thing is I'm a die-hard citation the
crew is like the like active ship
modeling with boosting with our features
they can't be worried efficient where if
I wear it fast not necessary you will
just be better and my focus saying one
we can do more when we can do something
which cannot be done before Oh with poor
performance but this to yet working on
any problem how we can solve them better
so so we're focusing on fill in the gaps
so the some learning fun apparently well
understudied difficulty cannot put into
a car dock and we want to translational
things I was in any way we do like
similar running in a way like we we are
very much product focus we do everything
is for the product release after half
year six months nine months without that
learn to this part up so where might I
learned how to do paradise events and
fitting in Rd in convincing was to kind
of running my trying to take the best of
those words message so and so this is
something you know about training I'm a
controversial person so I think this
thing could be last forever it's not no
matter keep learning on on and because
this is not it's declaring this is
really I feel for my life is where you
to over
methodologies I will always keep in mind
and this health really helps to build a
robust product in my perspective I can
give a lot of example of line um it's
not saying I have a sure Microsoft for a
long time I want to say is I want to
emphasize this it's a female yeah it
should work started I specialist bucker
once you really work with dr. Shugart
make sure you know how many they are
and the our job is really how to help
them how to make them more efficient how
to turn to other that they work with
them and they can do tech no reasoning
with less getting more work yeah
Laura say you're coaching that sense so
this this is my perspective I have been
keep updating what I am trying to do of
thinking you know what's the mini
something we can do they have not been
enough efforts yet so really is like you
have at the beginning think about how to
build a human machine collaborative
system in Siemens like four five years
ago I think I know that time it wasn't
just beginning of those people Tiffany
not yet I think at that time similar
really build the amazing are you in
software wise it doesn't sell well for
many reason I think one of the reason is
very one problem is is no deep learning
some problem we don't reach it the
permanence or means the barrier that can
really introduce a new piece model a new
car go nuclear particle you have to
introduce a new claim particle that
should be better and revolutionary and
really relaxing I mean I really feel the
missing links is that they're not
invisible so Tucker don't really know
how you make these um how you will
access ma'am I'm hosting we have
hundreds or some features the selects
them and it's hard for them to know in
how much in was making this distinction
so the kuhn-tucker whatever really don't
need have per se okay so the good doctor
they spend on height is just amazingly
well you know opera is the word power
the Holocaust much better than machine
as now machine higher level I think we
have a lot I don't I saw a lot of shadow
so you know when pretty much into what
even is company tasks it is miserable
right now I'm still it's party but it's
still miserable of course you can do
certain things better that you know
right now face recognition you know it
struck me only recognizes fifty
bankruptcy picks up right no matter
where they are you smash this it
effectively pixel there's no much reason
anything to do yeah so so I'm oh I think
this is also you will they be like the
philosophy of things but you do need to
keep in mind because II will the people
pay to use our service or paying user
product right so because they need have
a way to incorporate the Machine
pageants with human tablets the
preventive medicine preventive medicine
mostly we're doing criminal medicine
before especially in semen pearler
medicine means money nominee for already
kinds of detection and the many things
and currently all the active crimes
particle is second reader because it
means like a doctor will first rate
independently without seeing what
collagen will produce then they take a
second impound all machine marks and
this causing parlor at least before and
why because doctor spent a lot of time
that's winning actor more higher so the
insurance wise is not offensive very in
Jensen
they need charge interest for that
software for actor time is spent on
reading text longer but you're not
seeing that time right you are not and
sometimes if the permanence is not
amazingly well internals you consider
sensitivity and also how many market
appreciation you know what in the
directly impression you're suffering
practical attacker is precision right
because if you miss Tucker action will
know unionism right
but doctor will see Co he give me
tomorrow only well not were correct and
many other thing is doctor can even
figure what they are and they can just
confusing lethal endings and but I don't
even know how to deal with that so the
actually enough similar higher without
mini increases the throughput or
increase the program
that's better so so so we need to wear
Carol doing repeat the theater we all
not just even the way all occurred
before it so we have to find a new way
we had to find a new innovative way to
really bring value and really how
doctors even really not this stuff is
really helping patients the precision
medicine actually at the recent years
I've listened to year like add although
more concrete ideas concrete works we're
going along this line I'm kind of like
trying to balance more from a proven
humanness in' from care or the
contraction to precision medicine the
prison many email connecting the
low-hanging fruit the many low-hanging
fruits and this is something different
cannot do it now but doctor needed and
let not they need to do a lot of
guessing I will fill in a gas so doctor
means busy doctor reading the images
right say okay he said this is this guy
is a severe uncertainty how severe it is
because we human well you cannot produce
conditional measurement just like that
right we don't know how much water how
many mean ml tissues was that on alt who
was in fact it we don't know this kind
of things well we can we can we can
pushing how many different separate
examination you can produce all this
power markers all produce these
attributes we can call them the new meta
features and the provide to female
doctors right on it's a no such thing
even they need that they know they need
that rather the use they use some a
surrogate a yield perfect surrogate but
this is the best they can do say for
example you detector muscle disease most
easy you want to know how much muscle
degenerated
odd - attends you know fact but how have
you matter how much you want him what
you think but so do I know what he do
defend the doctor eyeball slice they see
to MRI I both rise on the leg okay the
taku taku know what's the repetitive
slice that occur don't already know so
that's that's a different they need to
lock guessing and based on that
experience so the final slice the
contour the tissue and then the Calormen
occurs it's a 2d it's now 3d so they
used that either surrogate
but this is Betty Cantrell they have no
ways to that but you say you have a way
they can call you and you can say they
are reading from packs right so you can
compute all these counseling from packs
and packs of jets give them all the
attributes in need to fill it in Nevada
know what they are doing you know the
different human cargo was designed for
different purpose of diagnosis or
treatment plans so actually no lineally
one you can attend they should compute
so the packs can actually call I see
from Google Cloud or maybe whatever a
cloud
the packs company don't have the
resource we don't have the needle have
doneck development effort they can do
that right that's kind of like a party's
picture archiving and the commune system
so means like that all the images you've
done from a scanner no matter is semen
scanner scanner cheese that all the
scanner before you know Center center
page format and though they have many
different kind of like the pact
companies they have a standard right so
they can take into the data from all the
scanner so this story then the present
is to the doctors so the other machine
and human interface basically so all
doctor you're reading from tax the tax
will be put your data to the doctor
screen and doctor we read it right so if
you can just sing you are having it and
the our hospital wrens
we definitely can on day it's the same
thing right say the package reads the
intermediate thing you can do a lot of
fancy things right so you can see oh
this guy has the brim macaroni so it
should be seated
could you be on the kill where we
continue alert the you know some can
only recover significant clinical
findings that means you need call the
physic the pre knowledge is funny you
know you need to call the physicians
that may to move in here right away
because that's that saving the year
maybe it's kind of heavy calm down like
that's right so all the things you can
you can really you jerk lotto you have a
lot of competition encourage another
competition of things you do packs of
core you have to deal with packs a
provide them a because the packs will be
the you make past law III rice or
something
you know it's another thing you can do
okay we really call it I call it
remaking bamaca which is a unike tur
so do you read unstructured data
recovery into attributes aesthetic
attributes none it is the skill it's a
scalar or maybe vector something but
this remains our people even know what's
going on what this number means and they
don't have to have guess it's number you
give this with them this number I am
sure they will be useful but you still
need do you need what we saw her human a
new creative particle so she really that
efficient and out so this is a new
protocol they should be provide to the
other rest of the world Allen hospitals
the our hospital is doing actually
reportable a new nuclear a new new
studies you know we are kind of like the
last resort for some kind of patients so
we have occasion a cancer patient we
work with NCI very closely yeah we busy
fighting normal ways of funding and
hitting patient in assets in lives and
you know for example the the chemo
served one of the most important key mo
sorting would actually would actually
even in my hospital you know it's not
really with me but was there
however war on people doing some kind of
medical significant hell worry
this next was no compressed but no heart
only have a medicine is a more like
fundamental science right well certain
people the in over these years also the
heart-lung machine you know I know it's
amazing you can take the patient heart
out and do something using heart-lung
machine who make this feel function you
because when the heart beeping is
already cut to so many separate so all
these didn't many medicine bricks feels
like that
so the best thing the amazing work and I
could imagine like me the mighty things
and mo AI think can be used
that's really kind and reshape the
landscape so this is Arrington this is
something I want to do but I don't have
a I haven't done yet and a curiously is
a patient level simulacrum chosen it'll
be very useful for personnel
personalized study criminalize the
treatment be raining all the cancer tick
icon her the example all kinds of
patient a unit you say you have
no cancer us has about 60 K patient
every year but there's 600 sometimes I
mean you just have that is alejandra
something you always had long little
things that always burn rise and this is
across us right and then you can make
think everything index all the
charitable thing oh this is a new
patient and they have to try ABC to see
if it works on now but you in some way
how magical way you can match them to
the database somebody was successful
trade and you such treatment as a kind
of like a you transfer an onion right
you find this is the Khloe's population
original kitchen how we learn you from
being from there is nothing we can do I
mean kind of fluid not talk I don't
think we should just do females doing
further or this up precision medicine
part of this is so fun I have huge
interesting that your honor
yeah I'm gonna have time for a question
also using my personal I work on cancer
in velocity down here almost 11 years
and I work on a long time zircon vendor
that's most common cancer especially in
incidents I also work on comments or
debate but I feel I've romantic geez
that's really under studying for my
worried a lot of missing things there
they're very deadly actually an aura
will come breast cancer um that's not my
interest and it could be better
also our group we actually do a lot of
prostate cancer so we do a lot of things
where I could transfer some part enjoyed
the prostate cancer a caste system they
do multi-user study and I think I
actually is one also wounded leading
leading
Easter doing the prostate cancer so
that's kind of solution okay so another
thing you know I'm I'm trying unpack
training come every day so I always
think thanks for my come to Australia I
think that's a luxury a custom medical
imaging is a subcategory oh oh
conversion device the many things a
nerve of course a skin is different but
it's just actually to repeat us three
they are also strictly for my you would
not see you perilous reconfirms
detection segmentation by the text
mining and the immediate caption all the
interfaces of taxonomy is this really
easy at the same and no one goes through
but I already talked about you know you
to carry what you can do and I in recent
a year we started walking back two years
wide resting here we may be maker had a
me and the list of to debase we share
with you guys I heard you got to be sure
to the public um I really feel is using
this this is the Holy Bureau you
consider you know we we have a hospital
middle-sized to have really career
doctors our packs and risk
Reese's where the radhaji information
system so this piece of record of us
doctor was right here
the reports right so we have about 1
million when meaning heli I think the
high quality were it happened to you
quartz and you can't me it's about 20
years doctors in the work there right
and then the word best doctors and some
pure House bill maybe Stanford help once
on your Jung han-soo sutlers digit have
no patient we're small we had which we
patient of previously so Xterra has to
4.4 million studies we have about one
minute study and Tommy had 7 million 12
years ago I don't know what the exact
number so I'm here should have locked
the lot of doctors who clinical work so
busy one I see this treasure there's
really how we make way we can understand
how doctor was doing they already think
that we don't you repeat the world
cannot right so there are lot of
knowledge in there how we can get them
and use them to teach computer and by
our work to do deeper anthology you know
all this kind of this this is the
fundamental bricks from should be I
think I really what we have time so far
is a baby step but we're heading toward
that direction and before there's not
many people doing that because you know
many many hospital in
they have great physician but we don't
have people really understand
contribution per se you know how people
know protocol product we know how to
know how we are really understand what
they are and I think has some advantages
if I am any chance so we have to have
everything so we can start doing things
like that unfortunately not
okay so now I give you example well you
work with dr. unions you should adopt
the Ireland don't believe you so okay so
I give you a lot of pictures um for me
it's too hard to detect all these kind
of things you I work at currently
looking our hearts names
the leaf node Union swallow lived on
while even though the sewing on emily is
very performance and we have really make
big progress i mean i'm extending if we
only working on twelve years i should
reach you permanent level we can can
have a new part can have a new partner
in essence yeah I mean still were much
like their productions thinking I worked
in Microsoft and the Siemens per year so
Siemens really Cheney Minds thinking I
like the way they were putting thing to
work product so that that's really a
dependent either work yes
so then swallow nib no I won't be able
to detect it
you talk a little longer than dr. fan
that maybe maybe
Wessel maybe something that it will
discipline the hewa some kind of where
reflux will hair order a class or
something can fit in I don't think any
deep learning you just run the 3d chain
you offended it because the love of
reading there I I just I just think that
our current in your networks to have
lava limitation that otherwise we have a
lot of imitation we won't be able to do
that yet okay so there's something going
there but this is a very important this
is well the most important biomarker for
for cancer patient you basically want to
know how much and even on one of the
speaking hats you can be the best you
can track them over time because this a
fluctuation actually indicating how the
drug active right because of bringing
your track
play a you want CEO if Perry works now I
need fennel as early as possible where
you wait we will see the patient gasps
sinner or something they have always
maybe blood or something the whole way
to identify the implants working on our
if it doesn't work what that means how
was it what should be plan B it was
advisor to be plan a all this had not
seen any clowns attend things so this
can be well wearing polymer and we after
have a physician his whole life is
working wrong lived on amendment just
amendment and how that meaning is do all
kind of different disease treatment
disease that nonsense so this very
problem and this I don't think I can do
it and so basically they need is the
whole world environment about how much
evil
this machine has over time but of course
annuity tap that and design unit second
army so just show you like to know this
this worry already works it's not really
anything could be our but you think you
have to sing out of box
so before you know Simmons using our
previous Sardar with Steven and Steven
Tyler will be sounds really hard
features and it books and ready for it
is kind of aggregating is the one layer
is just one there's no cascades one
thing and when I say we have a cascade
well whatever method it is we have a
cannon generator so we basically
throughout and 99.9% of the one of local
regions carried out them will find the
other suppression regions now we do very
simple thing we do just to that
application like this will using hog I
just see even huh I see how it's truly
hard if you use in the well it can still
beat the eight posting and ran for it
with City Harkins or those kind of fancy
things by a large margin really pile
argument so you have to seek right the
complexity and a decomposition the this
is really power upon decompositional
critical
visual recognition that should be
embedded whatever you can to achieve
robust in and generality for according
the product of operating a hyper
ventilation system so this thing this
shows like you know if infomercial
you know but what make is kind of crude
the content saying you know this thing
is will you have no contour the female
would recognize it they have X based
maybe human alone in the doctor they
learned the contrast of conquer so here
is you when if we have a comfort
protecting system if I integrate that
into the cat will just improve and of
course now you can do everything keep
learning but um still but still the same
can do better and also this is like a
divide and conquer so we do the car you
need other thing to take care of you
really need like a layout where you're
fitting models how you fix it right this
is saying look we know well the
interesting part of carriers carry the
desire to find all these like a son
actionable additions or something they
can have big tumors really big humongous
tumors and Qasim d-don't detects that
welcome diversion is easy because we
understand is in no sample give us the
people population we're doing this for
screening so there may be not really
there may be only one or two or three
maybe you have your lucky dozen of
tumors tumors are killing us a human is
worried to see it but it's vertical
you mean to capture it but it's so
complex it's a big tumor in homogeneous
regions how you learn that you have
known and you just a long tail in
essence it's the moment what is long
tail because more the thing you see is a
subtle it's subtle thing one you really
 up detecting on such a thing we
detect this
it's always for human doctor may not
know what you were doing how they feel
can't trust you
they don't even know my keywords also
how you know just sick it was it I don't
know how do you sir right you you you
don't feel confident with that this is
something you haven't think about it
you have think about how you make them
happy yeah it's customers you make them
happy as you'll make a patient happy we
have to make them yeah yeah we also have
time but that's only go and of course
you know we shoes by simple gaining like
a hard getting or saketini if you're
just you're the branching system and you
can solve this in much brighter safer
this is very big I have no idea this is
doctors click and this was a Miss by the
provider
system I just we have a caning way we
can get it back so then you know this is
a no 2013 you know yes you haven't
November to answer a blocker we're
getting here so we try the time the
major challenge is there lot of people
believe you never can be useful man
going with it because we say the men you
mean the big harrowing is okay well
maybe 10 nation tiny taking hundred
patients
I have no enough data right well cannot
do it so this Acadians from I was
inspired by the work in Commission at
the time of the attack attack defections
mean it's like oh you do you don't do
the high high range at sweetie directly
to a detection but you do not know like
a cookie checking the noise they're
noisy the random but you do 100 gases
right the possible the pot you the total
sample maybe give you 15 of them not
possible but the needs will give you a
really low Lambert maybe I'm intending
on that same time they're all noisy but
you are kisses annoy they are we getting
this annoying the decisions and they're
clearly statically separate for so you
don't need to make a perfection at the
beginning of the low-end you cannot so
just don't do that and just aggregated I
I do think Neiman had correctly written
into may be much higher than this is two
or three right okay it's a therapy and
okay I'm probably maybe incisive how
those category how this costly bore how
they are Kathy you know a lot of things
with you know say I don't want to repeat
those numbers always changing
another thing that we found is the the
noon I would indeed some time works
better because the new memory is more
capable remodeling things who can trim
you know improve his papers they all
papad our customized tests on for a
category B category and we found we in
Sampson we actually can they're working
on both sides so this is the cardigan to
what I have just pregnant is about the
branching rotating so something I do
think sound philosophy from Virginia
self congregating in some sense also
Yahoo think well how to use that wisely
how to fit in your thing of course
everything is should be specifically
calibrated by the P okay so this just
shows how human doctors do listen ah my
data is it it's really you see ya
so human doctors has lorrison Timothy
about repeating they have been saying so
this is a similar word that was a
previous Austrian art so the please ask
a physician these detection first time
than a month later
so the physician is able to find about
15 3% of the funding he used to fund
it's just after months he forgot right
we do it but he but the human has a
really low phosphorylate so kahuna does
now tends to be it had missing things
but they don't normally a lot of
hospitals so did you sing this coming
when you build appareance congregate but
the same is the technical statics so
also we act in this another thing is you
know this example is very actually uh a
lot of citations about about 150 160 in
two years you know it's not comparable
to thieve gravity car is three four
times bigger than with high and it is
parallel people actually allow people
trying to see oh oh this is really a
detective mad shaking not many years 3d
so sometimes no we just shows not always
all to do just everything directly from
sweetie it can be 20 1/2 D to D and a
flexible connection application house
it's kind of funny you statistic you
can't get something better just than
just plain 3d and this actually a lot of
people though we we spread all the
papers although people doing that is one
of the new things we introduced to the
from academia perspective and nothing
underhand people theories of you know is
that he made useful or not for medical
imaging and how and that's also at the
time love you
use whatever but worries small skill
like that that very small they're not
really big it's kind of like ice big
eyes
Seifer net as bigger than that so who
don't eat a lot of investigation rx9
google an N of course is a lot of
investigation on how to use you mean
that whether you which conditioning that
would be helpful or not this is what was
done like two years ago you know right
now it seems that otherwise but at the
time it's it's a lot of things and you
know we always keep in mind and you know
because comfortably she ain't really
empowered by by you mean a crucial
models right so for many specialized
thought you cannot train from strategy
but nothing than crappy things and you
haven't started from somewhere and this
is different but we also show you have a
fence wait you have a fine showing maybe
it's wired differently if you some
people some comfort some much in mental
people before long they just use even
have written model they don't they just
use a feature attractor then they
packing are swam or something to
consider but we do we do show
consistently you do fine tuning you will
get a better and the later things
actually will you have a lot of data in
medical and you're starting from a
luminaire preaching model or you're
starting from scratch you end up getting
similar performance but the human hand
models getting come work much faster
maybe I mean with the last meet with
about half coffee if I really need like
I'm never interning with you and of
course this is really transferable and
this curvy by the way is the best car
ever produced in my life you know you
Siemens everything we do is what pushes
the curve to the left upper corner
that's what we do every year for six
years and I don't think this car is
perfect pretty yet but it is really the
best man okay and we which is plug in
the wrong data ten years so that was the
deal gear out you know also nothing can
think about is the DoD trout you the the
way aid because whenever they have a
more advanced are their first use for
of the heroes right for the veterans
because leave is there a lot of
treatment minds to my energies next to
the wat'ry National Military Medical
Center so the little thing Hendon can
make way more efficient and treat the
heroes better and with a lot of things
they're really tremendous opportunities
a financial interest something like that
to really you know it's amazing it is an
exciting you were to make a difference
okay so right now listen all my work is
my colleagues work I'm a closer provides
some consulting ideas and I think we go
even further so this is we're trying to
do all all the tags in my body all the
flag nobody because we have a new yes
and have a lot people they are all
related and how was it a factor that we
had a heart attack so you have to do
your bids can you do this is a heart
attack but you have to do soft back but
right now is not not hospital sub plan
yeah but you can come hit a risk factor
this if you can detect all those payment
doctor not we don't do it they just
don't do it and it's hard
another is coming everywhere let's look
around something digital is muscle fat
bone that's because they are ever
they're not a coherent off in there you
just look the everywhere they can't be
held in this everywhere so just I'm this
somewhere maybe you can have a respecter
you know when you have a exam you know
how you manage of that you can do a lot
of preventive and precision medicine
there so a lot of things and you know we
are not that big academic group so we
can do things but we all have to select
a few things to really push it forward
but this one on the thing now my work
but is exciting I think you know also
this is the house of sacraments is I own
her crack so you have to Sacramento
without clicking without the leaking the
bottle your Union ask him how many
caused him the hard crack there was a
volume of that
that the boring Moe had directly unique
it was something of fact risk factor of
the hardy weeds and other things like
stroke thankful and it's something we
detected a bowl inflammation bow
attorney why I work out I was mostly
working on colon cancer detection in
cement actually you know no I'm everyone
working alone but
Collins okay so long detection is Amalfi
is more while the easier but you have
the patient had many long many
inflammations all the tensile are you
what kind of ring even though if they
have information you inject something
and iris there's a lot of things you can
do that the brain inflammation when is
when they cut the patient is to the
surgery to help you dimension of this is
new formation swallow or is it something
more something now looking or this is
catharsis information we see action all
this thing you can talk will not do it
they don't have them they cannot eat
them every pixel they want they have no
time they have no resource to render the
chitin work that's the best part but you
can have I'm just imagining you have a
way to do all this kind of thing you can
really have a new way and really have a
precision medicine technologist maybe
the same time or even less time so do
you have more food you have more
information about a patient you really
can do a lot of thing more things than
that says I think different India
giveaway could detect on beat a post Pro
is a lot of things can be done I really
keep you man like that you always can
fit into the real thing
I just learned from Jason talked
yesterday the primary pop is stay back
from CDC the one thing inhaler from the
Lakota was saying you have to go to the
store to see what's going on whether
it's a how to talk that you have
disrespect sure you don't you don't even
know what they're doing and how you know
what would help them this I just give a
reference list and nothing fancy there I
was saying I want to repeat something is
submitting using really a lot of
interest
I like this way I think the industry you
may often and this is only in the best
of all there's only probably only way
that would work is really the the unity
and clean and the hospital this should
really work sugar or each other
that's no other way we'll make it work
because you you pretend you want to
change the particles not even the new
particle you need them to know give you
feedback right away you know IBM
deporting people in how to doing things
you know just gently is right whether
they can escalate the difference I did
not scored as a topic or this car but
that's really song me there's no other
way around you cannot get rid all this
mental institution have tremendous
amount of intelligence there you won't
you do you have no way to of if you feel
you're not doing something right you
just don't understand you know I says
the first reader has a lot of issues
this what we are currently working on
everyone is money working out I think we
have to be smart like what parent who
saw I would say the checks are a maybe
while an important form of yourself in
essence is why we stretch it but I'm
really and also the first I really think
something will fly the first Raider but
we're not ready yet I don't think we're
ready yet but might go this is mine it's
well my well my thing I want to make it
real maybe before I return I really feel
a magical machine that country our
patients and can really right now this
is really many of the magnetic Medicare
even the American Cancer Association you
become and you do this kind of them to
experience of cancer
you just cannot afford to do that
because they know the consequence and a
lot of effort gotta cost the cost and
benedek are not that obvious right you
always have a risk for the cost and the
benefits enough so when he is out the
dominie now you shouldn't there so the
radium is breathe Acosta bring the cost
down bring the product a hug right human
doctor right now the best thing that I
do believe you can do the trash they can
do the trade yeah sorry 23 meter he
didn't don't do that but we do know how
much we have
many false positives and you ask a
machine who exam all the 100 swallow no
Mohannad 500 slice one when silence lies
just trying to screen one disease you
give to see how many false positive
generate and you ask them to do 30 times
you need the multi-purpose thing to do
that a lot of polymer no Jinyan need to
be done there but I think that's a way
that we can get then we're really
significant from the human house so
we're looking Connors
doing online that's a little bit long
shot but but I think we need to do that
and also the big data should be fitting
we should be the Mali promise
same starting from scratch and even
building ontology everything that's less
than the go-go you kind of beating on
prior to the house a patient will not
healthy public you will not be bothered
but some people do you find them or you
say all English isn't stuff for you is
this of this risk factor but you don't
want really causing like the social
thing that if you have come and fall you
just scare people discovery board is a
lot of social consequence right um yes
so I this is my passion
well my passion I think this should be
done and it's hard but it is make that
more interesting I think uh it just
really is just too many right
not given you know you knew look at the
car in the last year the microscope
cocaina challenge and you see the
started you can was from who and I how
long did that I think that prevents too
far away from really being useful or try
out for you and so this thing you know
you live targeting very broad triage
like you know it can be defined by I
mean more typical right now because
there you'll you only gets reimbursed is
super high risk populations so it's like
you know people with high risk for
breast cancer genius than those you can
actually get paid yeah so triage and
you're looking for something more
specific but you know cancer is random
develop enter adrenaline there's no gene
and no they're high risk I have
for good pre-cancer general yeah cancer
has 85 personal enemies that's currently
believing your cancer how can the causes
open signs for below I don't process
nobody my impressions the lot of random
is there yeah but what I'm saying is
right now to the extent that there's
reimbursed screening it's for it is for
the subset of patients who have a high
risk that's because they're you're
typically looking for something very
specific because they're think you know
medicine since Union Carmel people the
best by CDC the American Cancer
Association
you need a caramel people we cannot caro
paquette we cannot afford a black it
subtract principle really is to get this
course study over the specific patient
that you're interested in other people
on the first stage from out of the items
for many from yeah you can you know they
do a long spinning eyes you can you have
ever think of this it can be a broader
definite come become anything this can
be done for everybody because really say
for example never risen the news housing
the housing people living in warehouse a
life the economy fluid need access a lot
they have higher risk of cancer so they
and everything is too quickly you have
no chance to make error
the irony has motion to make IRA IRA
produce all about at Perkins it happens
we don't know we barely know how our
body works they barely know how a primo
this is the fact right now so this is
sort of you know whole body screen is
done now it's available its cash pay and
so only rich people you know it's like a
thousand bucks a year you this family
resolutely enacted assuming that the
rich people buy a metal diamond over
there cannot find that the rich people
living perfumer symmetrically if you
wall so the gas came every morning you
know way so like is the costing like
that nonsense right now all the cost is
actually the machine is giving
so I 80% is the machinery and the
facility but a machine can be much
cheaper the machine is a really powerful
I think right now the machine dependent
cheaper the machine after that see CT CT
question you can scan a pitch in there
put an 8 second km time it dominates the
cost its you neither approve purple with
clear risk Benefield sectors FDA really
shows you have working with India you
engaged on doing that to change it the
desirable solution we have money left
and it's not a dealer we kind of pushing
more I think we can given them amount of
money we should be better I think
ok so I already said that to show you
example is saying this is a using
example of the Panasonic stack and I
remember I you might have well my friend
he win the Pascal 17 challenge that was
before the year of deep learning and I
given him glad to see our data and he
talked about how the conversion hard or
something and then I show him the
compass I think we know how saw it and
he is shocked is saying oh this is
really no boundary and the doctors who
sit in the boundary and ask the notion
of segmented he-man we I even cannot do
that I think you're already beating my
problem is but what was well that matter
no everyone just provides the best
matter ever possible to the physicians
so this is just really even eating them
or how many are example pregnancy is
very wonder why because you want her
screening pancreatic tumors or
pancreatic disease somehow the warning
lung pancreas is wearing
but no
this dude has a 210 pounds over here of
course the doctors capable of solving
what I would say is the best doctor they
are amazing they were trained in that
way for a reason
you know with some time you were
supplying tonight you'll be the two
years old you can't afford is the doctor
can't take the time to take the mouse
and yes ecology across nation so
different regions and different
caregivers they don't have a consistent
care standard across the nation that's
my usual if I understand you correctly
is a different village say you know I
was saying you know Facebook and Google
you know you have a lot data you're
pushing the common Kardashians used to
have 30% higher you know you have 16 we
can stick to more money right you for
medicine 30 percent 60 percent of trash
they just tracked you you had to push to
the limiter there can be really useful
for it but out her then you could use a
lot knowing they don't like it and we're
getting there
I do believe now sustain these of course
you didn't have the you don't have data
you have nothing to work with right you
know we open threes how you really
realize that not the beyond data issue
the many learning that many is to say if
it's here only to stay in addition we
don't need how to sleep anymore right
which is how this becomes a is doing all
the mayor
a million things there's no need for a
camera to exist it's not just data it's
a lot of receiver only whatever but
somehow I just amazingly stupid for
putting this in the demo humanly de
luchon running them I'm eating better
than new networks so my daughter
she's III do something on her because
she was a year infamous old and I spent
our mouth at home take care of her and I
study law I was like there he is
so she has went out to Train well we
have a neighbor he has a table with his
when doc the doctor running around and
she stopped talking realizes about then
other day I took her to see her doctors
and there was opinion about a dog it was
out in the back and I met dr. Zeko
I mean it is a God not the thought he
didn't I asked him darling he had point
out that you know he's not speaking
fully speaking yet and nothing is like a
Chinese and the different channel China
pending with seven words December this
is a static son birth honor things is
like a Western hanging about a peek for
video to mama beautiful burger
the times a different kind of burn the
Chinese given pinyin styles
he had only seven examples of trends and
this new localization there's a weekly
supervised everything I just tell her
there's a bird and shipping it out she
knows that's the bird and we whole of
things we've already know how how our
brain works our brain is my part is
insane for certain Cox emotion beeping
in there not just different even that
seemed happy why would care so we're
close to South we have a new efficient
neural network we can solve okay we saw
like a not just
pancreas temptation we also solved the
possible answer this also why I where
we're working on is we really want
generate a pixel mass of all the
different handle tempo in faculty these
and what's a volume they have that dr. C
I don't know how severe the ocular gasps
how severe it is
Christenson so and also we keep on
working on the Pantheon so we have a the
best model actually we we have it's not
sweet easy and yet is trying to happy CN
n with a conventional our scheme kind of
smoothing and we'll get a better result
but right now we're working on just go
down they know we're working on fully
annotated 100 cases how we can without a
phony recommend without dr. fully
sacrament angry on how we push it to be
too solid why so impatient how that we
negate maybe he will be intense on it
how we do that and this is the next
thing you do things in a while because
that with the you wanna use your arm for
original it's a you put a card solution
you want you accidentally call it yeah
you do you have no control but efficient
do we use you want to work for every
case even now for every case the net
original case right so you have this
give up so and the will scrap I never
triggered on your network based on the
3d shape your panel where is so much a
lot from patient aggression so you have
to keep this a mild so I never do things
that were failing that will really we
know it'll work fit you just do you
don't need it'll tell you that or that
you'd know that more fit because that's
why we need our you know human we make a
decision we we cannot trap all
hostilities you know but we do we've
learned which in conversion so we know
what's the best practice to what was not
and pictures and we spent long time ago
in LA but I can't cover it in a second
talk and because long long queues for
many people year and the crash kills one
points for me I don't think we can save
all the long patient I say we save ha
it's more than people died on so we did
with India realize the issue is really
the the data this is one major you show
so I'm very happy you know we
collaborate together but pushes the I
really got a lot a mails about when
we're you know I I think this also good
thing for show like probably be over to
citizenship tools for this efforts I
think that's great and so much for me in
an hour
as well citation precision medicine yeah
I'm saying I'm asking you to switch it
efforts from I think I haven't make any
credit I talk too much about brings
diversity topics one things we kept in
the pad pennies whatever for six years
but I know I'm actually working more on
signature because everything is simple
there is it did it correctly favorable
this is not human can do I even knew
that so we do think human need yes yes
not be tried fairly the different
strategies really wishing to cast that
will not remain involved or he may be
many democracy developers then you know
less getting more they're not little of
advance right why is this fishing you
need to go it gets better
yeah then it gets back to my
you know yes
so in precision medicine you early
people would think lonely children
notice of the data is actually the
fragmentation of the data is actually
very bad for precision medicine is that
so essentially if you want to divide
precise phenotype we want to have like a
third patient sort of medical history or
a long happy that's what we do non-acute
analysis and now I want all the data to
be here and then here I want to
understand so here we talk about
radiology medical image medical imaging
is one source of data and hopefully
we'll be able to collect it over a long
period of time like what we see yes
so the question for me is how this
actually how the medical imaging Bell
marker is actually work with the state
electronic medical record you write your
phenotype how they actually work
together so and how we
validate the biomarkers of the service I
just compare the image based evidence on
how this biomarker is sort of validated
and dance of in combination with other
by only I see that's what I'm curious
now so I know political to design our
trial but I know singing I feel we have
we don't have that yet
how we can design I can i unite means if
you don't have a protocol to actually do
that the biomarker we see today from
medical imaging study it's just a hint
for precision medicine instead of a hard
there's no will consolidate it right do
something which was not possible then
you play Bach speed what possible
purpose so that's the reason you have to
do you have to talk with doctor you have
to you know they have many many years or
insights this is why you have to work
with the medical physicians and they
actually know what they need yeah they
actually how strong the inserts about
what will be useful for future Pardo
I don't know I have no training you are
walking how beautiful one for you I
don't know this this is why you really
need you need it really important man in
the world we defend the visionary
doctors they think of beyond their just
daily work yeah they have a wish it is
they do maybe they do how I wish it is
and I'll continue find a doctor and you
need sacrifice you need to know that we
should is what you visible in the
meaningful will be impactful that don't
happen to get it down yeah just if you
have a doctor no wrong knows many other
things and other doctors will refer to
me well read the word best doctors and
the a visionary their job is not just
between pitching today deafening you
know we do with the kidding patient
today and even for tomorrow so this is
really a very nice unique set up other
edge you know to do contact yeah I can I
learn from the doctors I don't know it's
barely
so much
