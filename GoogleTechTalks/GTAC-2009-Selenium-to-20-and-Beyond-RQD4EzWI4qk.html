our next talk it's going to be about
Shalini to point o webdriver to point o
whatever it is I I'm definitely looking
forward to hear the talk Jason Huggins
Simon Stewart and we'll have a third
person joining them in over there and
the apparently broader group is with
them I mean they are fully prepared so
they mr. Cole will be part of the
presentation as well and please go ahead
and enjoy are we going to do the salmon
dance right okay well Jason's turning on
his mic I'll introduce myself I'm a
sammich it I'm a software engineering
test at Google and I'm also the primary
developer of a web automation framework
called webdriver my twitter ID is shs my
sexy yeah it sounds like a time I'm
Jason Huggins I am the co-founder sauce
labs I've also a former Googler and
creator of the selenium testing
framework also my twitter ID is gay
Huggins and I'll just a little bit
shameless plug about sauce labs we do
selenium in the cloud around soup today
that were actually installing portrait
support so on with the shameless plugs
we're done with those let's go into our
presentation all right so we could read
these all to you or we could just wait
10 seconds for you to read them you can
all read right okay anyways sing your
favorite song on hold music better all
right now that you read them will just
briefly summarize we're going to talk
about celeb webdriver why we imagine why
we're merging what does that mean show
some code show some demos talk about
random ideas it'll be awesome exactly
all right on with the show right so
first a little bit of history the
selenium project is actually kind of a
family of tools I am the creator just
did the first one that came along called
cilenti of pork and i'll briefly just
kind of show you what corn looks like
but also i will talk about the other
tools that we have we have something
called selenium ide which is for firefox
use to record your tests he also has
something called Swami remote control
which if you are real languages like
Java or C sharp Python Ruby vivek PHP or
pearl you can write all your tests in
language and remote control will then
run your tests for you and then grid
again shameless plug sauce labs does
this cloud but grid lets you effectively
it's kind of like a proxy server to
distributor test the big advantage is
that it run tests in parallel so it's
patrick so briefly selenium core tests
look like this if you're a real
programmer you would hide your eyes and
leave the room crying because this is
terrible syntax by the time it was
seemed like a good idea this is really
lifted from work cunningham like his
framework for a recurring the very
festive he's more famous for creating a
wiki at a time we were praying selenium
was looking for a test of taxes that's
good enough but the big thing about this
is that you've got it's a keyboard
driven framework the method name is the
first column and then your lock in to
two parameters only target and value and
you'll see the effects of this syntax
later on in other selenium tests
protable long and happy back with I
selenium ide for Firefox came along
grade by one if we're guiding chidiya in
Tokyo and it kind of looks you can kind
of see the syntax is little or four
great very much explicitly on purpose
for that the two huge benefits of
selenium IDE over Justin poor is that it
runs as a trusted browser extension
which means you it's no longer limited
to security Stan box with JavaScript
lives in so you can do cross domain
scripting can also toss tests ssl
decrypted sites it's actually it's a
nicer environment to be it the other
nice thing about hi des that it actually
is recording to it which is wonderfully
useful and evil but useful for
bootstrapping yourself into creative
tests it's evil because record playback
that's another talk
but selenium remote control came along
and effectively we've got two camps
abusers got core and ID user the
woodside cylini world and then you have
everyone who uses so this is for the
real program in the room the big thing
to know about the Sonia server
architecture is that this thing in the
middle is a selenium server process even
if you're a Python fan like me you write
your Python tests has very thin client
library talk HTTP to the selenium server
process running and this is that on the
same machine that stunning server jar
running it knows how to start a browser
and proximate proxies which is called
salemi and cool roaming in that oh right
the important thing to know thank you
sorry that's okay this selenium core is
but and grant came along and this is a
kind of the architecture kind of a crazy
slide here but the important thing to
know is instead of talking to a selenium
RC server like you would you here
between your Python tests you now
actually talk to a selenium pub server
which depending on the configuration
screen you send it will proxy that
command to the correct browser now so I
move a file ever driven ah yeah
webdriver you may or may not have heard
of it if you haven't heard of it the
elevator pitch is that it's a developer
focused tool for the automated testing
your web apps which is kind of what
selenium does so by developer focused
what we mean is we've concentrated on
having something which is nice and
friendly for a developer to use so you
know if you hit control space and you
using webdriver the the list of
completions tries to guide you toward
doing the right thing and a Trostle
limit the number of choices that you can
do so you never overwhelmed by like a
screen full of possibility and automated
testing well you know we all know what
that is so it's always quite instructive
you take a look at the driver
architecture like how we build this
thing and the difference one of the
major differences between webdriver and
selenium is the fact that we tightly
bind to the browser that we're
attempting to drive and we we go in as
close as we can to it in the case of
Internet Explorer we actually use the
comm automation interfaces that
Microsoft have so kindly provided and
maintained between versions it's
brilliant so the same sort of calm
interfaces are present with a six seven
and eight so webdriver works with I six
seven and eight and it works of XP and
it works on vista we run that in process
effectively so we've got a sort of C
library and the Java binding which you
can see this tiny box over here that
talks to that C library if we wanted to
add another implementation in Ruby or
Python or something like that rather
than having to go down the entire stack
because we've put all the smarts in this
C library we just need to be able to
cool down so f fi or C types or J in
Java allow you to call the C library
without having to do clever linking or
anything like that so it's a pretty
lightweight way of getting hold of it
because not all browsers run in the same
process so Firefox is a standalone
separate process so how do we
communicate with that well what we've
done is we've written our own custom
webdriver extension which we install
quietly behind the scenes when you start
with when you start firefox driver and
we communicate with that via ajay singh
protocol over something that is starting
to look more and more like HTTP and the
reason why it's starting to look more
and more like HTTP is it sometimes you
don't want to run the browser on the
same machine as the test you want to
separate these things so we've taken a
leaf out of selenium book we've got a
standalone server process that you
communicate with using a protocol that's
based on Jason over HTTP so ultimately
what's going to happen is the Firefox
driver is going to be an instance of the
remote web drivers there anytime you
want to communicate something how to
process you can do that the nice thing
with that
it's because the protocol is shared when
you come to do an implementation in
another language python ruby c-sharp you
get this one implementation of the
protocol and you get all the drivers
that we support for free because
everything communicates for the same
fresh girl so we've lowered the cost of
racing gear implementations makes sense
yep cool does that make sense cool gone
ok say one thing I like about webdriver
of being the selenium guy is very
especially particular being a Python guy
is that there's this notion of webdriver
scaling down if I just want to write one
test on one machine I don't want to have
to use a remote API I love the fact that
winter ever has I could just adjust need
to see library volumes browser go go oh
yeah we keep them talking about Python
if you are a Python esta do easy install
webdriver and you'll get the webdriver
API available for Python yeah that's
pretty cool um so Jason right so go if
you watch all of your key back videos
number of the years you might have seen
assignment against the show here's a go
in g pack New York we gave separate
talks and then we did one shared
lightning pop I think we're the top
Google hit her still occasionally yeah
we can't tell your friends link to it
and make us stay number one but
somewhere pitch after gee tac new york
and both the start of our career google
we hatched this plan whose idea it
wasn't but selenium and webdriver
similar spaces we have a lot in common
there's a really cool tech in webdriver
tonight hey we should we should talk
more than just in front of random people
and so you see what we should do so what
we're going to do is show off some code
that's a pitt to help Thanks so we're
going to step through some code with a
very simple test thanks basically is the
same test one using selenium API and it
again with the web drape
bribery they will do some crazy stuff
but first i'm going to show you the
manual test with you going to google co
uk because we're here in switzerland and
if you gotta calm you'll be redirected
to some random sites google suggest is
here i typed in selenium ide and the big
important part about this little demo is
i'm going to click the arrow key on
keyboard down and you notice that the
first row is highlighted my nexus the
first row is highlighted right notice
that uh that's the important part with
that so uh my IDE fine thank you I'm
here to prompt to Jason basically right
so the important thing to know is that
you've got the selenium objects you've
got the open command I use command
selenium is one of those issues but this
money made god we've got lots of magnets
for typing for personal reasons the
actual type command didn't actually type
it just set the value people complain
about that but you've got an AJAX a
thing like we will suggest so i beez
came along that actually will fire the
events but still sometimes it doesn't
get that right then we have another
command because your home type native
actually uses the robot library but even
then that's actually not nativist robot
ever you got its own issues so typing is
a little bit of a tar pit it's like they
were just pointing that out other things
to note is that we've got every selenium
API method we've got those two
parameters to be compatible with Sonia
for locator multiple locator strategies
JavaScript plenty other things to note
is that selenium does the explicit
waiting actually webdriver head of it as
a teacher / picture feature right other
frameworks like windmill and water do
complicit waiting we're doing explosive
a day so we are both realizing we're
going to be embarrassed and waste
implicit modules and then the last thing
he up there not so nicely does anyone
know what that unicode character is poor
that's the down arrow right but it
should be over here to help so anyway
I'm just going to run this mess around
honey there you gooo and there's the
test and a brand it fired off that event
but it didn't quite work whatever reason
it didn't fire the down arrow but if you
actually look at the muck around with
the implication for the suggest it then
really key off the key off of event
that's a very explicit JavaScript to
keep up event if you do it as a human it
really is several events should have
gotten fired keydown keyup price yeah
maybe select Google suggests actually
keys off of one of those other ones but
as a developer of selenium sometimes you
might get it right kind of it away so
there it is right now i'll show you test
Simon I'll show you okay yeah okay so um
this is the web / / AP I you'll notice
that it's still Java we get hold of a
webdriver instance and rather than open
we get the URL I named it after the HTTP
verb thinking that would be obvious I
still think it's obvious um why isn't it
open that's because it's not just get
word because get is more obvious you
could you could also go web drove it up
and navigate over cable it they'll do it
this way now again dot come on give me a
dot all right give me two dots there we
go driver never get to http google doc
cojo UK i hope this works in the head of
change status um so what we do then is
we find an element by name q and so
whereas the selenium API has a sort of
opaque string do you happen to know the
syntax of internally the webdriver API
makes explicit the finding mechanisms
and I can show you how explicit we make
it but you know when I said you know you
hit control space and it tries to lead
you through your control space try to
lead you through so we find by class
name ID link text name partial you can
read so we find the element on the page
q is the the main search box we then
send keys rather than type um I wanted
to emphasize when we were creating the
API the fact that you were using the
keyboard to send keyboard input to the
browser so like you may think of it as
typing and when you're typing into an
input element that makes a lot of sense
but when you're trying to use keyboard
shortcuts in gmail you've probably
thinking of it like I'm using the
keyboard like I'm using the keyboard
shortcut so that's why it sank you we
then have an explicit wait with timeout
measured in seconds and we wait for this
element to be visible and then we send
an arrow down shall I run that yes
chances of it working now that I've
changed it it's Thank You cheeky hmm yes
and come over round it can we have a
round of applause last time i did this
demo it didn't work that was that was
two years ago i've had a lot of time to
practice you'll notice that the ide like
that the first option has now been
selected so you know we're actually
sending the right keyboard events when
you when you hit the key down I will
probably not mean to do that Jason race
so the important thing to know that yes
we've got these two tests with two
different api's you can argue that the
webdriver API is lovely but but the
really important thing out of this talk
out of all the important awesome things
that we're going to say is that if you
are an existing splenium user you do not
have to have to do not have to migrate
your tests to the web director driver
API to start using it one will show you
some magic thing here that instead of
using selenium I will
webdriver communication this is magic
where you get to take your existing
selenium test and it will now be using
webdriver behind the scenes actually
execute the test if we scroll down we
can prove it your canvas scroll down all
the way but webdriver back selenium with
a instant of the Firefox driver so we're
taking the existing webdriver API and
we're adapting it and making it look
like the selenium API so i'll repeat
again after my great but you could if
you wanted to do let's run this test
some of it ah there it is Oh what let's
just try this again there's kill random
Firefox windows until we get bored of it
I mean hopefully ends just note at the
bottom that actually was what forever
and notice the line got violated even
though yep all right focus go and now
because we're such wonderful friends we
love sharing but so it's wonderful that
selenium can be back my web driver but
to complete the wonderful tricks we have
up our sleeves now you can count kidding
a styling so yeah alright so you
actually could have a webdriver
implemented use the webdriver API even
actually have it / selenium execute the
test parentheses so if I actually here
now run this test magically hide from
roll this is actually the webdriver if
you have is actually running study class
right and notice sent the little key oh
yeah we're all tested here yeah everyone
special that instantly even though it's
in the time I supposedly was the key
down thing that's plenty of putzing
little bug there that it actually
rendered it instead of actually set
so one of the nice things of the project
marriage is that I'll be able to fix
that for you I don't know which one of
these Firefox's air it is so that the
takeaway point here is that you can
interoperate between the api's so if
you've got an existing set of selenium
test and you want to do a managed
migration over to the newer API that's
going to be possible if you've got the
webdriver API and you decide that you
want to use the selenium one that's also
possible inadvisable but possible the
other thing as well is that by using
selenium webdriver can support can
provide support browsers that we don't
currently have support for notably
Safari but also things like Camino
Conqueror and the smaller browsers in
the market okay thanks of weaknesses yes
there are strengths and weaknesses of
selenium webdriver yes we will um so one
of the things that I really like about
selenium is the fact that it's just pure
JavaScript and when you come up to a new
browser when Google launched chrome
rather than having to have an intern in
for three months to write a chrome
driver Daniel in the front row wrote the
chrome driver there was just a simple
case of modifying the browser launcher
and maybe tweaking some of the
javascript is there was a pretty low low
impact change to make so it's lovely and
easy to support new browsers and also
because it's in JavaScript it's a
language that people are familiar with
it's super easy to extend it and add new
capabilities so things like the UI
element extension which hardcore
selenium IDE and selenium core users may
be familiar with is written as just the
chunk of JavaScript that uses this
common API because you know the downside
is that it's trapped in the JavaScript
sandbox so the you can't do nice things
like cross
domaine scripting or uploading files
unless you somehow managed to elevate
your privileges and personally I find
you know hitting control space and
having several screen fills of options
slightly terrifying I did grep over and
word counter over there over the API and
there's something like 150 methods right
yeah I'm sorry probe like the THD it
difficult everything's in one big game
space that's the second time we've named
drop to PHP right right so that if I
could that's so I intra there's
strangest about webdriver that I really
like and the one yeah is the API
everything is the interface properly for
two big things you've got things that
were driving the browser themself itself
starting and stopping it this properly
siloed into a bucket of the next leaves
basically have all of the elements is
nice I love it the other thing though is
they pick the biggest be remain the
important reason to projects is we have
hokay support Firefox really IE is was
the biggest thing that web driver was
getting ready exclaim really
architectural II couldn't get right
because we had so much stuff implemented
in Java Script were just architectural
II at this we solve eighty percent of
the problem and that last twenty percent
we have to do it a fundamental different
way and web driver who's doing it so
perhaps I am to go forward with better
support and existing browsers and
getting out of the webdriver really does
get all the way out of the JavaScript
sandbox by the way when you see us doing
keyboard input on linux and on windows
and at some point we'll go on first ten
as well we're actually sending keyboard
input at the operating system level
directed at the window we don't demand
window focus in order to do that but we
do send proper os-level keyboard events
one of the nice advantages of that is
that you can hit key down one of the
disadvantages is if you hit control be
you're going to open up the bookmarks
window in firefox and somebody felt that
is a bug with me recently and it like no
no no it is
to open that's a keyboard shortcut for
doing it so I guess one big weakness so
it's not all just someone who's well
someone spell weak knees by the way the
one besides savings abilities though no
it's true accounts well so any of it was
easy to bring on board new browsers and
it's really hard to bring on new
browsers and web driver because if you
saw that one architecture slide to get
the IE thing going you have a see
library that talks to C++ code about the
Java library you have to know some
really like what how big is the
worldwide market who knows C C++ Java
and the internals of like a couple of
them might be true but the outside this
room if yes the worldwide number doesn't
go so it's that much more important for
the projects to have silos silence right
but yes having really easy let me get
away with just well the one of the it
doesn't you don't need to know every
language out there I mean I think I
described it as a masochism of languages
occasionally but if you want to work on
one particular browser and that's what
you're interested in then you don't need
to know c++ to work on the Firefox
driver for example and if you want to do
a language binding you don't need to
know any of it you just need to be able
to speak Jason an HTTP HTTP even or call
down to see library so if you've got a
particular skill set there's probably
part of the webdriver that he could work
on yeah yeah to be fair the thing I like
about the social innovation besides
technical about web forever things were
properly separating so we can have
browser vendors just there than browser
in silentium project we actually did
follow this rule of the don't repeat
yourself problem is we had the API
implemented once we had this crazy build
process that was a competitive
JavaScript and xslt that code generated
old libraries yeah and sane but only one
person on the planet
anyway so the webdriver project is even
though you have to know we have to bring
on c if c plus plus people who know that
tech the project is now set up so those
people with those skills can easily
contribute exactly there we go I'm if
you do want to easily contribute for the
way go to selenium googlecode com you
can download the code and then send me
patches that would be lovely we should
talk about a two point oh man beyond
because that's what people are here for
yes well they're not here for that only
um so 2.8 right so it's already no no
okay by the way father passed the 2
point 0 is some social things yeah and
some actual code code things on the
social side of things we need to merge
our mailing lists on how we actually pop
do we actually talk to each other we are
we are now on developers list on google
groups we've also the big thing I would
like to say we but really that's me
Simon migrated to code the separate code
repositories forever in place we're not
done yet though um we've currently got
separate issue tracking systems the
google code guys have been fantastic
they've recently released a GData API
that allows you to automatically create
and modify issues so we're going to take
advantage of that and we're going to
pull all the bugs into one place so
finally the project will be one happy
family and to celebrate that what we'll
do is we'll do the 2 point 0 release um
what will the two point O release look
like it'll look like someone's taking
the webdriver jars and the selenium jars
unzip them into the same package and
then package them up again because
that's probably how we're going to do it
so that the initial to point a release
is going to be one download with both
api's available in an uber jar we should
have done heavy metal umlauts or labor
it
go for it oh yeah two point x I should
talk about that so the initial release
is just going to be like are slamming
everything together but like like Joseph
like we said with the typing thing
there's sort of stuff in webdriver that
selenium can use and there's bits in
selenium the webdriver can use so the
two point AXA life cycle will be a
hybridizing one where we take the best
bits from both frameworks and we merge
them so to a user the API is going to
remain consistent and solid we made
deprecated some methods we may not but
your test will continue to work but
behind the scenes and in the
architecture we're going to be doing
we're going to be breaking it up into
three major pieces and the first piece
is javascript is fantastic language for
interacting with the browser you can
query it so you can get the document
title you can find out element
attributes and you can do these sort of
read-only operations so we're going to
extract a common set of JavaScript
libraries and we're going to be able to
use those to query the Dom because it's
useless to have JavaScript libraries in
this you can execute that JavaScript the
second bit will be a series of
JavaScript executed really so at the the
most basic one will be based on selenium
court and that will be trapped in the
JavaScript sandbox but the more advanced
ones will be based on the webdriver
technology which allows you to take a
take advantage of all the nice things
that we've done with webdriver and
finally it's not enough to just query
the browser and go how are you doing and
because it go climb on about blink and
there's nothing you need to interact
with it so we'll be extracting a library
for doing keyboard and mouse interaction
which will unable to interact with the
browser I'm either using synthesized
events using accessibility API s so if
you can give the browser window focus
will be able to do as good as the
operating system allows or the current
webdriver approach where what we do is
we don't demand focus that requires some
hackery and it's not perfect but it's a
heck of a lot better than it could be
and it does mean that you can carry on
reading your email with your tests are
running and we all
that these end-to-end tests take the
better part of a millennia to run does
that make sense I don't know why I ask
you these things I shouldn't have um so
it's going to be three pieces the
important point for a user it's going to
look the same um it's but behind the
scenes we're going to be breaking things
out and making a far more modular and
pleasant to work with so when does it
all happen it's already started um so we
i love thats like robots ish and it's on
the keyboard look yeah so yeah so it's
already started already co-hosting the
code in the same place we're merging the
issue tracking but also jason's been
checking in code to the web / / code
face and i've been threatening to check
into the selenium one so we're going to
end up starting that hybridization
process sooner rather than later and
kicking things off so um where are we
now we're in Switzerland um but but
we're heard the brown where'd it was the
webdriver support like it's not enough
just to have Java support because not
everyone programs Java for some reason
and there's a range of different
browsers out there so webdriver promises
to support the big four languages which
is java python ruby and C sharp there's
also a JavaScript API so if you do all
the work in pure JavaScript we've got a
JavaScript API it isn't as capable or
fully fledged as a comes the real
programming Java is it javascript is a
real language but we strip out for the
sake of simplicity and the ability to do
conditional logic and loops so if you
want to do a straight run tests through
your code and that's pretty cool so you
could do like a unit test style with it
if you want to do an end-to-end test we
strongly advise using proper language
also point out that in the Swan Ian
project 21-point oh where we are it's
actually big sex the 20 we mentioned
peer to be three times now four times
now right so I encourage we've got our
hands full yeah um if you do want to get
started the remote protocol is the place
to go because then you can use the
remote web driver to drive Firefox ie
cream and remote we've got language
bindings now there's a github somewhere
which has all the Ruby code in and that
Ruby code supports Firefox iu cream and
remote it's it's parallel to the Java
one it's got the same level of
capabilities the sushi up code Andre
who's sitting over here recently did a
pretty big update so the c-sharp
implementation bie driver he is now up
and running and the Python code Jason's
been working on that too you can do easy
install webdriver now and you don't have
to start a process in a little wonderful
so for Python in Firefox it's actually
yeah and we'll end up doing the
interrupts tough as well so if you've
got an existing suite of Python testis
in selenium you won't need to rework
full of your pie contest what would a
competition go I beg your phone that
there's someone saying in the audience
will get the gem in about three days so
Jamie install you should probably call
it selenium right slowly yeah selenium
to that much more competition for the
cool
so plans and schemes I think I'd like to
introduce Dennis from opera software who
is going to try and set up his machine I
will ad-lib for a little bit so one of
the nice things with webdriver is the
fact that we developed it test driven so
we've got a suite of around 300 tests
and that you can use to verify that the
the implementation is doing what it
should and the other nice thing is that
we are nicely siloed so and silo we're
nicely modularized that's the word and
so you can take the interfaces and you
can implement it we've got one
implementation that sits on top of HTML
unit for example so if you're a java
hacker what you can do is you can run
your tests in memory super fast which is
kind of cool because it means that um
that are you ready almost ok cool I'll
stop I'll stop talking them and let
Dennis
yeah okay and we support multiple
devices to issue that we have a protocol
named scope it's a roll roll circuit
protocol Oh TCP its current using XML
but it's a bit over headed so we
switched the protocol buffers and Jason
for next protocol and this protocol lets
us use the same test exactly the same
tests on every device dead fish upon we
implant the webdriver common interface
so it should better in drag and drop
solution and you also implanted some
extra API and the last extra pair that i
implemented it was stolen from Simon's
idea its directions API he suggested in
the hackathon two days ago and i'm going
to show you them off how it works um so
well dennis is plugging in his machine
there I think the important thing here
is that a principal how awesome is that
and that you can take your test your
webdriver test and run them on your
mobile devices there really isn't a huge
amount of frameworks that can test the
web browsers on a mobile device so it's
kind of nice to have that wow that was
fast it's up on his screen but not in
the area distler sneaking in and
disappearing and sneaking in okay I'll
carry on ad libbing um ok for the
browser tall it's from the little yes
sir that's a big font for the heart of
sight um Petaling code beautifully onto
YouTube ok so what I'm going to do I'm
just going to run tests on the this this
is we use the Oprah debug protocol which
is also used by a dragonfly or debugger
you can see the tests running here the
first one I'm going to run is the is one
of the webdriver tests so um dennis is
about to just kick off some of webdriver
zone internal test suites that we used
to verify that the drivers work yeah it
should ok that was fast yeah that was
that was ok it did you blink he's going
to be much faster so it took 0.6 seconds
for 12 tests it's the test plan of the
test from web driver common but let's
look at the extra API that we support a
part for mid-level
do you take test case there it is so um
unknown unknown to you opera is doing a
heck of life stuff or it was doing a
collab heck of a lot of stuff nicht and
let's see it's a lotus so I'm hoping
some work yeah we okay okay so yeah
sorry so let's see what this I have on
this extension is I can so we ran the
essential google test everyone knows
this one I'm guessing so yeah this is
the one on the project page so it just
went to Google and it typed Oprah and
it's a submit it checked at the page
source contained a link to our page come
on it's actually really hard shall I
hold the microphone for you so you can
use two hands on the keyboard thank you
okay and wow that's quite an the second
test is quite a nice it shows actions
API I added some comments here I read
about these comments but I finally
commented the webdriver implantation I
made so hopefully limits public is going
to be possibly do what i do i load
google find the element q and type of
browser software and then i click escape
because it suggested some stuff which I
don't want and then I click the element
try again and then I click tap twice and
press enter the East can also be key
down in here and this should press I'm
feeling enough heat lucky and if you are
really like like he's gonna load or
possibly since it passed I think did
okay i want to show people a of it Eric
am so this exactly the same if I that
sign suggested what is it does it that
it has an action that you can keyboard
key and then you can do a mouse click on
and you could you can do a keyboard key
or you can go to your Chi down
you sure you there possibly gross so
this is heavily inspired by the stuff
that the window licker guys have done
they've come up with a beautiful API and
we're talking with those guys as well
yeah so you can do keydown keyup or you
can use the keys that you clicked and
you can also I don't know what you can
also do button down on button up from
click on low on on the mouse and
learning executives going to exist all
of them in order and then you can get
your results from the page this this
test is very specific to us it's a
contents color test I try to load the
google page and find logo image and
check if it contains color maroon the in
Opera we have tests that the pages that
should not contain any red or wing and
talk to my those tests we added a
contains color API so you can just tell
element contains color and it's going to
take opera colors actually you can take
an array and it's going to return a
result if it contains any of these
colors okay yeah one other grammar yeah
I have just one few mini and we also had
a screenshot API which Michael showed a
few days ago it's also supported in the
Opera the way he has we also support it
another way we can just get the hashes
of the images from the browser so we
don't need to download the whole whole
image what we do we get the two images
and we tell the Opera to give us the
hash and then we match these hashes and
if the hashes are a match it's of s and
you also support the select all cut
paste etc so everything is supported
from the browser and it's there is no
hockey Becky solution it's it's the
protocol that's handling everything and
fast way thank you
okay that microphone work anymore oh
well I'll meet this one I'll hold this
one for you as well I think oh wait you
might actually okay so bland screams
road is implicit waiting we're planning
on doing that it's kind of obvious and
useful and it's something that people
need so especially with Ajax
applications becoming far more popular
we don't excellent I don't know why is
holding you learn I look like a lemon um
so Ajax applications it's going to be
important to do that well so forgot I
don't not sure if I heard you say
anything about IDE or grid ID and grids
right we didn't mention ide other than
me saying it right now as far as what
the plans are for two point oh we should
probably talk about it over beers maybe
afterwards but for the benefit of the
people on the video will say we should
have some plans for that but right now
they're in the plans schemes and bright
ideas if they will be supported going
forward we will improve the IDE grid
ideally we'll just be grid and support
the what it does now and it must be
backed by webdriver but we should have
more formal plans but we don't have them
today simple matter of programming
exactly we're running out of time I do
have I guess we had 21 more things today
one was the native opera support the
other one is I go into that yeah you can
you can show what so Jason it hasn't
looked to the codebase very often um and
when he did he he noticed one thing that
made him squeal with excitement it was
actually quite embarrassing to be near
him when he did it um and that was the
fact that we run on the iphone as well
so we've got a little application then
wraps a webview runs on the iPhone it's
called the iWeb driver written by a chap
called Joseph gentle I should click play
you should just get click Play and high
and prevent the power so this is our
expected applies line yeah
but I was applauding when I first saw
this demo so if I can make a dare to
make a prediction future gtalk so the G
teaching tax talks it's all a iphone and
android future that will be living in
and in it in Opera as well for mobiles
and blackberries and all the other ones
but there'll be a lot more mobile talks
in the future I suspect it won't just be
a last-second web testing time i'm
talking about iphones anyway pretty cool
i absolutely glenn beck if i can figure
out which one I'll do the on hold music
that then that should just close ana ba
ba bad but no go to the first one oh
yeah there you go so I think we are
unless we have any more bright ideas I
don't have any bright I did then open
for questions and we have maybe 10
minutes or a little bit less than that
for questions cool any questions old
bulls are fantastic wait for the mic I
guess to come to you I think we may get
away without having to answer any
difficult question yeah we're close like
what's it going to be cool would be an
obvious one all right kind of cult
selenium to probably can i started the
question yes ok so at comcast we have
implemented continuous testing with
selenium grid hudson and subversion now
one of the problems we had with Tonya's
testing is Hudson produces the emails
every time something breaks and we go to
the Hudson console is there another
reporting I mean report generating
process that we could use when test case
is running continuously or do we have to
have a scheduler on a Mac machine i
would say that a reporting tool
specifically is out of scope for the
selonian project if you go and talk to
many commercial vendors they would say
oh yes will sell you wonderful reporting
tools and of course now i'm a corporate
entity i will of course then to say oh
yeah we'll sell you some reports too if
you use our service they'll be online
will be very pretty but as far as the
open source project reporting tools the
SATA scope the expectation
is that you write your tests using test
ng or j unit or pi test you right to
that that's the point of integration to
a hudson or any other kind of continuous
integration server so you code to a unit
test library you find another product
like Hudson or something else that
actually does those reports but we've
got our hands full just keeping browsers
running that reporting engine is hard to
do yeah however if you wanted to do it
on the cheap BNC is a recordable
protocol like there are VNC 2.flv that's
the name of the project I think it is
and will allow you to record a VNC
server so if you can set the display
overview of your browser to use that
then you can record a test run and maybe
you can include that as a build artifact
in husband cool right yeah I don't know
for video recording was part of the
question but if it was it's kind of a
nice reporting by hugging a and again if
you're giving you these soft balls but
my service we record videos of all the
tests that we run potentially another
softball could you smacktalks on your
competition a little bit I guess now
that it's not each other I know
windmills out there I'm not sure not
sure what else there is a well I could
be really controversial or polite I
don't know if I should be I want to go
mean but i'll try to temper my words um
let's see that as far as the competition
water in silentium have been around the
longest but because of the way selenium
and water were implemented we never
quite could figure out exactly how kind
of to do a merger but i will just say
that there is actually I can't really
smack talk the water guys at all but the
webdriver is apparently becoming kind of
a common ground the Switzerland if you
will of places that we can kind of come
together and work together that we
weren't able to do it but before
webdriver came long as far as windmill
in particular I've said this to them to
their face so I could say it publicly as
well that I think they took the wrong
bits from selenium and implemented that
Justin Python and i love i love the
facts i felt the same way that having a
java server in the middle was it felt
dirty being a Python guy
just want Python and my browser and
that's it and and so I agree with them
in theory wit how that what they did
what they're trying to do but what they
did is they took the same limitations
that selenium has by creating by
proxying commands you don't you're
they're not actually driving the browser
natively like webdriver is so things
like pop ups like file download boxes
all kinds of things they're still kind
of stuck there their proxy and commands
that ultimately a run in that JavaScript
sandbox that's the biggest difference
between the windmill and selenium so so
even though so I'm with them on being a
we need to have pure python stuff but in
that sense that IAM to point o
architectural e technically is a better
platform than what how windmill but
built their stuff up should say if
anyone wants to build a better api or a
better testing tool on top of webdriver
that's cool like it's a tool for
building more sophisticated tools and
sort of on a project I'd expect
developers to be sort of writing code
that would make it easier for this QA
team or even developers to write
meaningful test but you know and there's
no reason why you can build something
like the current selenium API on top of
webdriver in fact there's so little
reason not to do it that we did it next
question anyone we obviously explain
things really well possibly everyone's
just get the will it's just the plunge
is coming up next ah lunch is coming up
next excellent well if there aren't any
more questions thank you very much guys
it's been a pleasure
