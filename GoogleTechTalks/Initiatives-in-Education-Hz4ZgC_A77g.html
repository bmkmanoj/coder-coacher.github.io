tell you a little bit about what we're
doing here at Google in education so a
couple years ago we started thinking
about ways that Google could help with
computing education and we wanted to
find ways where Google could really
uniquely contribute so I mean let's take
a step back why should Google care about
this and it's a really important
question one of the things that is
really important in you know to us from
our perspective is that we you know we
feel that computing education is a
really really essential thing to be
thinking about in the 21st century
technology is everywhere so if we're
going to use it really effectively we
need more and more computer scientists
we need more and more professionals in
all domains thinking about computing and
understanding how computing works so
it's a it's a big challenge and it's one
that we really feel is important to meet
and we're working with a lot of
companies and a lot of organizations
including Jan's working groups in the
NSF to to figure out how to meet this
challenge and really focus in on how we
can help with computing education so
going back to a couple years ago when we
were trying to figure out what is it
that Google could do to help one of the
areas that we we focused in on it has to
do with our mission statement our
mission statement is that we organize
the world's information and make it
universally accessible so during the
course of doing that we have built up
this really significant and powerful
infrastructure that makes it possible
not only for you to find things very
easily on the web but it also makes it
very efficient for us to be able to
deliver results in content know at scale
on the web so this is one area where
again Google could uniquely contribute
in an education space so we really
focused in on that first the other thing
that we thought a lot about when we were
trying to figure out how we were going
to operate in this space was just
recognizing that that google also has a
really deep base of computer science
knowledge here and it's just a function
of the way we hire we hire really we
hire experts in computer science in all
areas of computer science and it's a
many of them are former educators so
it's a really net it's a natural
resource for us and it's so that along
with the infrastructure
something that you know if we just take
a look here you want to leverage our
infrastructure and our computer science
knowledge to encourage teachers and
learners to innovate so how do we do
that well one of the ways that we kind
of hit on was to try and build and test
models of curriculum that can spur
innovative grassroots development so
these models of curriculum have to do
with computer science they have to do
with computational thinking they have to
do with figuring out how to use really
simple programming to enhance learning
of math and science and in k-12 so we
really wanted to to identify what are
some of those models and then build some
of them test test them a little bit I
mean we're in this great position unlike
many of you which is that we don't have
any constraints of standards we don't
have to worry about the things that
educate you educators and administrators
have to worry about we can just you know
find a school that's open to having us
spend an afternoon with their kids test
something out see if it works and just
kind of move along that way so we're
able to come up with really kind of
innovative out-of-the-box thinking
because we don't have those constraints
so it's it's a great place to be and one
of the focus is in in the models that
we've developed is that you know you're
all you know working with young people
all the time so you know that there's a
really avid use of technology by kids
it's almost rabinus use of technology by
kids and it's uh it's interesting if you
really focus in on consuming technology
what we really want to do is take the
next step to having them to create the
technology and you know it's really not
a big step you'd be surprised how how
kids just take to this and how easy it
is for them to think this way they
really just to kind of do it already
anyway so we want to make that step
really small so that we can empower them
to actually be the creators of
Technology in the 21st century so a lot
of our models for curriculum focus in in
these areas so we we kind of get these
little germs of ideas we put them out
there and we use our infrastructure to
support development of a community
around you know maybe taking those ideas
a little farther or maybe coming up with
a completely different set of ideas
whatever it is we want
build the community and then we want to
use our infrastructure to deliver at
scale whatever it is that people come up
with so that's really what we kind of
the themes of what we focus in on so let
me just get a little bit more specific
about some of these areas we have three
areas we work on in terms of the models
for curriculum we have the undergraduate
computer science which at the college
level the university level that's
computer science specific we have at the
high school level it's a little bit more
computational thinking and I'll tell you
what that means in a minute and then at
the k-12 so middle school and going into
high school we're focusing more on on
using programming to really support the
math learning this third bullet has to
do with the the infrastructure is
talking about earlier where what we
really want to do is we've got so many
tools products search all the different
things that Google does whether it's our
arms you know our spreadsheet or a word
processor we've got Sketchup we've got
so many different things that we use
that can be used in an educational
context and they're already being used
has been going on for years so that's
one area of you know really important we
really important contribution that
Google can make and everything's free I
should add that the other thing is we've
for also for years been doing a lot of
outreach what we would think of outreach
it's just supporting individuals through
internships and scholarships supporting
organizations and foundations through
partnerships all funding whatever all of
these things that we've been trying to
do for years all in support of you know
that that whole idea of getting
computing education out there and really
supporting any organization or company
that's actually doing this kind of work
so we've done a lot of that over the
last few years and continue we will
continue to do it going forward okay so
let's uh let's get into the curriculum a
little bit I'm going to start at the
college level i know that's absolutely
irrelevant to you but it also gives us a
really good example of how we do things
so it's just I'm just talk for two
minutes about it so what we've done it's
about three four years ago we were
making this observation that you know at
the college level for computer scientist
and
your science faculty they have the same
kind of pressure that anybody else does
in any kind of academic discipline in
college they gotta get tenured you know
they've got all of that pressure on them
to do all the things that they have to
do to get tenured and typically teaching
and curriculum development kind of at
the bottom of the list so add on top of
that for a computer science professor
the pace of technology so not only do
they not have time to sort of do what
any academic would do they also have
things changing on them constantly so
it's been our observation that there's
you know the computer science curriculum
at the college level gets out of date
really quickly so how can we help you
know instructors and faculty members at
the university level update the
curriculum as easily as possible so you
know this is a good example of what we
were talking about earlier where we
create kind of a model and put it out
there and use our infrastructure to try
and support a community developing
around it so what we did was just going
to try to get online here real quick
if you go to google.com / edu we have
this nice website that has just about
everything any educator could ever
possibly need just to tell you really
quickly I was an online before by Google
for educators this website in particular
has lots and lots of content and
curricular materials around our
applications and all the things that all
the ways that that one could use that in
the classroom so I just wanted to point
that out google code universities
example I just wanted to to mention I
just talking about at the college level
so what this is is a website that
basically has a number of content areas
that are very current things like cloud
computing parallel computing web
security web programming things that are
really state-of-the-art kind of skills
that we really would like to have our
our students know coming into industry
these are things that are really very
important so over here on the side we
have a lot of the the topic areas and
what we did in typical style i mean this
again is sort of the way that we do
things is we seed it a little bit so we
put some of our content out there we
write maybe some of the tutorials we
might do some of the slide decks just to
get things rolling so for example if you
look at district distributed systems
here there is a set of tutorials there's
a and the tutorials and the course
content can range from you know being a
couple of projects to being some slide
decks and speaker notes and a project
that might work with those that slide
deck to being a complete course that so
many might have donated all of this
stuff is donated content or it's a
little bit of stuff that we have seated
in order to kind of spawn off that
development so the idea is that if you
have you know you're teaching an
operating system course and rather than
do that three lecture thing that you
usually do on the history of IBM
mainframes would you take that part out
and put something in on you know do
three lectures on distributed computing
well the the lectures are here you know
you've got the slide decks you've got
you can go through a tutorial so that
you can answer the questions that the
kids might have got a project that goes
along with it so any any number of
different things so if you kind of go
down here you'll see that we have a
large number of colleges that have
I've contributed and that's really on
any of these areas we get weeded the
seed content and then we build the
community around it so that's just to
give you a good sense of sort of the way
we try and do things with with our
curriculum models okay okay so that's at
the college level you just go back to
now talk briefly about the high school
level so at the high school level what
we're trying to do here is focus in on
helping helping students learn
programming easier so this could be
non-technical students it could be
technical students and the idea is that
you know having meant many of the people
working on in this curriculum have
taught programming for many many years
and one of the things that you notice is
that you start talking about some of
these constructs and programming
languages and they can they can be kind
of abstract when when students first see
them so when they look at that it's like
yeah you know they don't quite get it
but if you can connect it to something
in the real world it just it just goes
it happens you know the light bulb goes
off and they get it so there's some you
know a simple example so is a bad word
decomposition you all know what
decomposition is there's actually many
not so positive definitions of it but
decomposition as a computational
thinking skill means that I've got this
big problem and I'm going to break it
down into parts that are easier to solve
so I could have the problem that you
know i'm going to write a calculator
program i'm going to write a calculator
and it might break it down into three
parts i have to have some way of getting
the input you know somebody's got to
tell me what numbers to calculate i need
to process those numbers so there's got
to be something else that's a second
step that has to do the processing and i
have to display the results so right
there I took this I'm going to create a
calculator and I broke it down into
three steps that's decomposition so you
teach high school students this and you
take them through this process in there
kinda like I don't quite get
decomposition you know they kind of see
it but they don't get it so connect it
to the real world and you can say like
for all of you well I came to a workshop
at Google this morning that's my big
statement okay break it down
well I got up I ate breakfast I took a
shower got in my car and I drove here so
five steps now break each one of those
down how let you kind of figure out how
you got up on a bed the spring or take a
shower you know all these things you
could break this down again and again
into all these different steps if you
connect it to their real-world sort of
functioning all of a sudden they get
what decomposition is so long story
short what we have done at the high
school level is we created about looks
about 30 modules where we connect you
know the teaching of some programming
language construct or some you know it
could be about the history of the
internet it could be how about how the
web works all any number of different
concepts and we've created these little
10 to 15 minute interactive kind of
project-based discovery-based kind of
learning that if I'm on computer science
teacher in high school and I'm teaching
iteration or teaching whatever it is
that I'm going over that day I got this
little thing I can inject in there for
10 minutes that's going to make the
connection for them and we tried to make
it really generic so that it really can
kind of come in and not disrupt anything
it's really you know it kind of fits so
cs4 HS is our means for getting that
seed content out and then again
hopefully building a community around it
cs4 HS is a Carnegie Mellon program that
we've sponsored for many years now and
we're really going to be ramping up over
the next next couple years it's a two to
three day workshop for computer science
high school teachers to go to a call a
nearby college campus and and be taught
by you know the faculty there or Google
engineers whoever might be available
because other people other companies
sponsor this as well to you know teach
them teach them some basic computer
science concepts and or take them
wherever they are and give them some
professional development to take up to
the next step so that's a that's a
program that again this models of
curriculum what we're trying to focus in
on I'm going to go a little further
afield now this is a little more
experimental computational thinking have
you heard that term this morning do you
have a definition in your mind for it
would you be surprised to know that very
few people have a really solid
definition
it's one of those things that could mean
a lot of different things because
computation it means so many different
things for us in terms of what we've
been trying to come up with with our
models of curriculum it means
abstraction an abstraction is a term
that we define and yeah I actually look
it up in the dictionary it's defined as
taking a really complex real world
situation removing all the details that
you really don't need so you have a
model that captures the essence of that
real world situation and then you take
that model and you use computer science
techniques to implement an inside of a
computer and then once it's inside the
computer you solve problems about the
real world in the context of the model
that's what computer scientists do all
day long every day every computer
science here google does this this is
just it's the essence of how we think
it's how we're wired so abstraction is
sort of this over well foundational it's
a foundational thing that we all do so
what abstraction could be a thing you
take a look at this map we've got los
altos hills here and you know I've got
all the houses and all the trees and all
this you don't need any of that if I
want to know how to get from point A to
point B get rid of all those details
create an abstraction which is a map
that's the you know quintessential
example of an abstraction an abstraction
could be a process it could be that
you're noticing patterns in someone's
behavior or some process that's just
repeated again and again and again what
we have here is in accountants worksheet
and a calculator some brilliant computer
science scientists many years ago let's
create a spreadsheet out of that process
that is that's just repeatable again and
again or that behavior so this is how
sort of abstractions played out over the
years you know and it's given us some of
our most powerful tools now if you were
to decompose the abstraction process you
all know what that means now right then
the first thing you have to do is you
actually have to recognize a pattern of
behavior in the real world for what
you're going to do whatever you're going
to do with but you got to recognize the
pattern and then once you recognize it
you generalize it you have to get rid of
all those details that you don't need
and then once you have the detail or if
you've gotten rid of all the details you
write some algorithms around it so you
can get it implemented into a computer
and then you write the program that's
actually going to manipulate the model
so those are the four steps that we go
through okay now that's that's kind of
how we think of computational thinking
when we got into the k-12 area and
started thinking about ways that we
could help there and what would be some
curriculum models we um I mean the first
thing we did was well you know let's
bring the scope down inside look there
must be some way to do something in math
or STEM you know so we brought it down
at least to that brought the scope down
at least that far and then we started
thinking about math and in particular
and we wanted to find you know what is
one of the biggest pain points for four
students as they go through a math
curriculum what's that you know the most
challenging transition and we met with a
lot of teachers a lot of math teachers
and one of the things that came out of
those discussions was when they go from
arithmetic to algebra it goes from
something that's very concrete it's like
how many fingers am i holding up to 3x
plus 2 x equals 4 you know it's just
like night and day for kids when they
first see this and it's a big challenge
to get through that transition so we
heard this again and again is that this
was one of the most difficult things
that that teachers were having to get
students through the students were
experiencing so we were thinking about
this and thinking about that and what
happens in Computer Sciences you start
with an abstraction and then you use
programming to make a concrete you know
you look at a program and you know
assume you know how to read programming
languages you can actually see the
implemented the implementation of the
model in that in that code so you go
from abstract to concrete the problem
with the students was they were going
from concrete to abstract so we were
trying to figure out is there a way to
make this abstract a little bit more
concrete with programming so we were
trying to you know what would be a
sequence that we could take kids threw
to first of all make patterns more
obvious in this abstraction process but
then maybe use programming in really
really simple ways to make it more
concrete so here's our our process again
we did a lot of the
talking to teachers looking at the
standard ways that things are taught in
textbooks that things are taught in the
in the classroom and what we noticed was
that patterns are everywhere in math
they are just you know they're really
ubiquitous you can find patterns in all
the different areas of math and it's
just not brought out in the textbooks
necessarily it can be it may be a little
bit but not really explicitly all the
time so the fact that it's not brought
out and that the teachers aren't always
bringing it out we thought that this was
it something that we really could focus
in on regardless of whether we end up
doing coding or not just making the
patterns more explicit explicit and
applying that part of the abstraction
process so what the workflow we came up
with was got some basic algebra concept
you have the students identify a pattern
in it you have them generalize the
pattern then you have them write an
algorithm for recognizing the pattern
and then you know if you want to go the
whole nine yards you actually have them
program the algorithm so that they have
a concrete representation of that
abstract concept okay this is like the
worst thing to do to you after lunch but
I'm going to do it anyway you all
remember perfect squares okay okay
pattern recognition very simple this is
very simple x squared plus 6x plus 9
equals x plus 3 times X plus 3 you
remember that right got another example
up there 4x plus 4 times X plus 4 so
just as in the illustration of this this
whole process I just showed you what we
do is we we have some worksheets that we
have kids come into a computer lab so
you know say they're studying factoring
for four days in the classroom maybe on
the fifth day we've got some
supplemental materials that they can
take in the computer lab we have them
work in pairs just it's called pair
programming and their worksheets that
take them through all of these steps so
the first step is to recognize the
pattern you know to recognize that
actually you know 3 + 3 + 3 x 3 that's
what really makes it makes a perfect
square that's the thing that really is
there so the same with four and then we
get them to generalize the pattern to
actually represent it you know if k is
for then it's 2k in this case we're so
generalize the pattern one
you've made these observations and
recognize the pattern so we take them
through step by step and then you know
explicitly define what the pattern is
the next step is to define an algorithm
so we just have a representation we take
them through you know some variable
names and you know what are being see
well in this case it's 8 and 16 so you
end up with this equation B over 2 and
square root of C that's you know be over
two is three or four square root of c is
three or four if they're equal you know
you have a perfect square so you find
this little algorithm that that helps
them recognize the pattern and then you
can even factor it you know so B over 2
is going to be that value so once you go
through that whole process with them
again going through these worksheets and
they're kind of going back and forth and
they're on the computer and they're
right and stuff and they're very
interactive very discovery-based we have
them actually program it but we only
they only program a tiny bit of it they
only program the part that they
recognized and that they generalize so
they are only going to write the code
for the yellow part everything else we
give them but you know they read it and
they see it and they understand it I
mean input what's be input what's see so
they get what that means and when they
run the program they can see what it
means but they only add the parts that
they've recognized so they go through
and do this they run the program and
they have a solver now for that
recognizes perfect squares and factors
them for them what's really cool about
this example is that you've got the the
plus ones well if you just enter
negative six or negative 84 be the same
program works it just works so then they
have a salver for X minus 3 times X
minus 3 if you take a look at you know
something down here that's not a perfect
square you still have this
multiplication of three times to an
addition of two plus three so that
pattern is still there you had a couple
more lines to the program and you can
factor anything that doesn't require the
quadratic formula but anything that is
going to sort of work and it's just this
you know and this is a 40 minute session
they go all the way through this they're
creating a solver for a whole class of
problems and they've done it because
they recognize the pattern we have
another kind of pattern that we've been
working with we've got the what we think
of is
patterned a program which is the process
I just took you through there's this
equally interesting one which is program
to pattern where you actually take you
know they just are working in this is
called Python it so it's a programming
language and it's just totally simple
you know it's just not you know it's not
visual it's just your add a little box
and you're typing this stuff in but one
of the things that that we've been able
to use this for is this discovery
learning where you know there's tons of
identities in math well if you can take
them through so that they can actually
discover the identity themselves as
opposed to you know you read in the book
and then you use it it's much more
powerful so in this particular language
called Python we have this function
called Powell and Powell XY just means X
to the Y and you type that into the
command line and like POW 20 that's
going to be press Enter will give you a
one poway hundred ninety four of zero
press ENTER gives you one have them do
let that like three or four times
recognize the pattern and then have them
represent and generalize the pattern all
of a sudden they've got an identity
there's an algebraic identity that they
discovered i mean there's a couple more
examples here just with pow but you know
there are any number of ways to take
them through some really simple examples
and have them recognize the patterns
from it and given get an algebraic or
any kind of an identity from it okay i
wanted to also just briefly mention that
we have we're working on this entire
site on a math curriculum through high
school we're going to have these modules
these types of modules as well as the
computational thinking we also have one
of our teachers working specifically in
science because there's so many hooks
into science again focusing on
computational thinking and really
critical reasoning skills so so what
we're really not that much involved in
is you know simulations and things like
that that that we might do you know of
which there are many many examples of
that type of application another place
where Google is uniquely qualified to
sort of you know be in the spaces with
data we do everything based on data so
it seems like an interesting thing to
take on to help students be more aware
of data so we call this data skills and
you can you can think of a sequence of
modules similar to what we've just
described here where they go into the
computer lab and they
some things with data so what is data
how do you create it how do you find it
how do you work with it you know what
are some simple analysis test you knew
on these small data sets you know just
to sort it how do you sort it you know
when you sort it why do you what do you
need to think about in order to know you
need to sort it and then once it's
sorted how do you bucket it so that you
can actually do a pie chart or whatever
it is that you want to do what are those
simple abstractions which do you use
when how do you you know what a standard
deviation vs. mean versus median all
that really basic stuff getting into a
little statistics but always going back
to the data and building these skills in
these instincts around around data so
this works into our site our middle
school science curriculum and we we have
one of our teachers working on a set of
modules around data skills we also have
a whole team here at Google headed by
how abelson who is working on a really
interesting project called App Inventor
which is a scratch like visual
programming interface that sits on top
of Android so what that does is it
allows for non-technical students to
very easily build Android applications
and and you know actually implement them
and execute them Oh android android is
our i can't carry my phone it's a phone
that Google had there it's one of those
android is a software development
environment for mobile technologies
that's open source so this is something
this is a google product and there's
google phones and basically what it is
is that allows any java program are out
there who wants you to build mobile
phone applications and salt open source
so it's all open so what app inventor is
then is this interface it's on top of
that that makes it very very easy for
anyone to build applications and we're
working it into our science curriculum
in a really interesting way because i
should have that phone sharon give me
your phone the other thing that is very
interesting about these phones is their
sensor devices so it knows where you are
just gps in here it knows all kinds of
things about what's going on in your
environment and there are other things
that are being added to it all the time
so you can imagine going out of the
field using this phone to collect a
bunch of data for some
science experiment you just stand there
and it collects it and then you walk
over there and it collects something
else and then you come back into the
classroom maybe do a little application
that processes the data you know helps
build these data skills so we're working
very directly with this team to to you
know build up out at least three or four
modules in our science curriculum that
are focused around mobile phones and how
you can use those for data data
collection and visualization all the
other things that go with it okay the
last thing I wanted to say then was we
feel really fortunate to have you know a
great relationship with Jan because the
way that we view our work in conjunction
with hers and what's going on and many
other organizations is what what we'd
like to do is if we have this sort of
going along the entire high school math
curriculum you know these mods just as
little programming stuff the kids are
learning maybe once a week our hope is
that at the end of that process if
they've gone through this from eighth
grade on that don't know how to program
by the time they get by the time they
graduate they'll just know how to
program because it just got it in their
math class and it wasn't programming /
say we didn't sit down and say okay
here's a while loop and here's how you
do this they see it and they work with
it and they see how powerful a tool it
is just to help them do their Matt and
it supports the learning of their math
in a really powerful way so you have
that go all the way through high school
and we're hoping that it just builds a
huge volume of students who want to take
these computer science courses as well
as just increases the awareness and the
sensitivity of everyone to technology
and helps them see how they can actually
start creating it so that's sort of what
we're we're thinking about it not long
term okay thank you
