thank you very much for the opportunity
to come and get this talk today I'm
gentleman from NASA Ames and the SETI
Institute and I'd like to acknowledge
the other people that are on this
project has this is part of the core
team for this idea that we're coming up
with and trying to work through Brian
day from the education division is here
in the audience and liza co is also from
education Pascal Lee and chris mckay
aren't here today because they're back
at NASA headquarters for a different
lunar meeting so they could make it
today but jeff moore and michael sims
are here as well so we have a good
representation you can hopefully answer
some of your questions and we're going
to talk about today is an idea for the
lunar database and supporting lunar
sandy landing site selection for NASA's
upcoming return to the moon and just to
put this in context for the reason why
we're doing this just give a little bit
of background information it's all stems
from NASA's vision for space exploration
and so the document is released in
February of 2004 and so NASA is now
working very hard to realign with these
objectives that are outlined in the
vision for Space Exploration and some of
these objectives include retiring the
Space Shuttle by 2010 so just a few
years from now and the shuttle flights
that go from now until then we'll be
aimed at finishing up to the best that
we can the International Space Station
and honoring all of those international
commitments that we have the parts that
we're interested in for today our NASA's
plans to conduct a series of robotic
missions starting no later than 2008 as
human precursor missions so basically
gathering the data that we need in order
to support future returns of humans to
the moon and simultaneously with that
NASA's also developing the crew
exploration vehicle or the cev and this
is the vehicle that will be taken humans
to the moon and to Mars and wherever
else in the solar system that we go
because the goal is to have human
missions to the moon by 2020 and we're
going to the moon first as a stepping
stone on to Mars so that's the next
bullet in the whole grand plan so that's
the overall scheme but focusing in on
the lunar missions that are going to be
relevant for the data we're talking
about today these are the upcoming
missions in the new exploration program
I'm in 2008 would be launching the lunar
since orbiter and that's shown over here
so this is a nice mapping mission which
will take a lot of data several
different instruments also on that
mission which was just decided a few
weeks ago there will be a secondary
payload on that launch and that's the l
cross mission that's right here and
that's a mission that I'm working on and
basically what we're doing is we're
taking the upper stage of the launch
vehicle and attaching this little
shepherding spacecraft to the end of it
and then driving both of those entities
to the moon and then once we get close
to the moon we separate the upper stage
of the launch vehicle which by now is
just a big piece of metal basically and
then we have the shepherding spacecraft
and the big piece of metal slams into
the moon at the South Pole ejects a big
plume of dust and whatever of their
materials in there and then the
shepherding spacecraft flies through
that plume makes a lot of measurements
returns a lot of data we're going to try
and figure out what the regula that's
composed of and also the reason we're
interested in going to the South Pole
region we'll talk a little bit more
about this later to is because these are
regions in permanent shadow and we think
that there might be water ice there so
our main objective here is to go and see
if there's water ice in these
permanently shadowed regions at the pole
so that's the El cross mission and those
are both launching 2008 and then after
that our plans for a series of
additional missions several lunar
landers that are being studied right now
and this is all leading up to finally
human exploration 2018 2020 time frame
so the reasons that we're going back to
the moon what we're actually going to do
once we get there first preparation for
human Mars exploration because we're
using the moon basically as an analog
for Mars and we're learning how to live
and to work off of our home planet so
there's objective one and objective 2 is
scientific research on the moon so we
can actually learn something about our
satellite and also we'll be doing
scientific research on Mars as well so
it's relevant for doing this on the moon
and we go to the moon for two main
reasons it's a high fidelity analog that
have real risks and relevant challenges
so it's the best place that we can go
and it's nearby or can actually test out
what we're going to be doing once we go
to Mars which is a much more difficult
problem and also we actually need to
build up experience in long duration and
remote
in operation so how we're going to
actually conduct these types of missions
we're going to practice that on the moon
first and I'm not going to run through
each of these bullets but there are good
valid reasons that a lot of people have
come up with for how the moon is
preparation for Mars in terms of
establishing long-term basis in terms of
the science that will actually do
geology biology chemistry etc doing that
field work the needs that we have like
long-term life support that we're going
to need for both of those types of
missions on technology flow through and
how we actually do these operations and
also human performance issues and
psychology issues and group dynamics and
injured individual performance and
things like this so the reason that
we're so interested in the moon and
there's a very close connection to the
moon with NASA Ames because NASA Ames is
the home to the robotic lunar
exploration program or the aisle up
office and the goal of our left is to
conduct these precursor robotic missions
in support of human returns to the moon
so Ames is for the entire agency of NASA
is heading up this entire program and
all the data that's obtained from these
robotic missions and from all the
previous lunar missions that we've had
I'll go over some of those have to be
catalogued and made accessible to see me
to the community so that they're
actually useful and that's not a case
right now and that's something that we'd
like to change and we're going to use
this data to guide site selection
activities to determine the location of
future landers so we're going to send to
the moon and also where we would set up
crude bases on the moon because we don't
actually have those sites picked out yet
because we need this precursor data to
make those decisions so the real
underlying thread through all of this
work is slight selection and figuring
out where we're going to go on the moon
and site selection drives with no
program in the near term and in the Far
term because long term planning we have
to define what we're going to do on the
moon and that's dependent upon where we
go and that helps resolve the
architecture for the types of missions
that you're going to send if you having
a long-duration mission versus shorter
duration missions and what you can do in
each of those time frames and for the
near term planning our generating target
list for the places that we want to take
data for the lunar reconnaissance
orbiter which launches in 2008 and also
for a future mission Lander
actives depending on where we end up
going and what information we decide
that we need so we have been to the moon
before and we landed on the moon and
here's just a little graphic showing
where we've been so we haven't been to
the far side at all we haven't landed
over here here's the near side because
the same face of the moon always faces
towards the earth and so most of the
landings have been focused in the
equatorial regions we haven't sent
anything to either the poles and this
will be a significant that's where we're
sending the El cross mission as well so
there's been a lot of interest in what's
actually going on at the poles of the
moon so we haven't actually been there
so what I want to do now is quickly just
step through the considerations for site
selection and show you the types of data
that we need to support these decisions
and the considerations that we've
outlined here we have eight different
categories on the general accessibility
of the landing site basically based on
orbital mechanics can you actually get
their landing site safety once you've
picked your site mobility so once you
get there can you move around and how
well can you move around and how far a
utility of a site as a Mars analog power
considerations if you want to have
Institute resources you generate power
also communications that's referring to
communications with the earth and I
asked are you considerations in situ
resources in geologic diversity for
science and so basically what we do is
we go through each of these categories
and figure out which sites are best and
optimal for each of these and then we
have to synthesize all that information
together and see which sites end up
being the best overall considering all
of these categories so the first four
we've grouped these together orbital
mechanics landing site safety mobility
and Mars analog because these first four
really can work anywhere on the moon
there's no place on the moon that you
can't go to for example or orbital
mechanics nASA has said we're going to
use a big enough rocket you can go
anywhere in the moon you want so don't
worry about it so that one's done
landing site safety these are really
we're talking about local versus
regional changes so in this little
schematic here which is very simple but
very poignant obviously if you're going
you're picking a region of the moon
you're going to land in the flat part
you don't
on the pointy Rock over here so this is
local scale variations so you don't just
get rid of one part of the moon it's not
like you can't go to the north polar
region because there's nowhere to land
or you can't go to the eastern part of
the moon you can go to any region you
just pick the flattest part that's in
that type of terrain also same thing for
mobility that's more of a local scale
variation so you don't discount any
large regions the moon for that so you
drive your Rover in the flat part and
not over all the big rocks over here and
same thing for a Mars analog because
we're learning to work and live off of
our planet we can do that anywhere on
the moon so there's no regions that we
really are better than any other ones
the next one they'll power and light
this one actually does matter because
there are certain regions indicated up
here by green at the poles where there's
near permanent or permanent light at the
rims of craters and this is very
important because if you want to use
solar power say to power your base or
you're over whatever spacecraft you sent
up there you might want to go to one of
these regions of near permanent sunlight
and it's only at the poles because the
earth is rotating around its axis and
these are the regions that are in
continuous light and we'll talk about as
well these are also regions where
there's continuous shadow where the ice
might be which are down inside of the
craters so you've got the crater rim at
the top with the light and then the
Creator in the darkness at the bottom
and so you could go to the near side or
the far side going to the polls and this
is a little misleading because these
areas aren't actually this big they're
much smaller and much more localized and
we have that from imagery data taken
over long time frames for communications
again because the moon always shows the
same face to the earth because the
period of rotation is equal to the
revolution period of the moon so that's
why it always looks this way you can go
anywhere on the near side and you can
always look at the earth and have direct
communications if you go to the far side
then you're going to have to have some
sort of comm relay system or some other
satellite system in order to relay back
to the earth
I
yeah the question was it's going to one
of those craters near the pole
automatically make you in a hazardous
landing site the answer is we don't
actually know because there are flat
regions well every call the creators are
different but there it depends on the
terrain of that particular crater and so
people have argued for and against going
to cratered sites because at the poles
particularly at the South Pole there's a
lot of jumbled crater terrain so I've
heard it argued that you don't want to
go to this region because your mobility
will be limited because not only the
terrain that's difficult but also the
lighting conditions are difficult
because it's changing a lot at the polar
regions if you're here at the equator
it's 14 days of dark and 14 days of
light on the moon so it's a whole
different type of scenario but for the
topography that also changes as well
yes yes and that is one of the best ways
that we do we can get typography oh the
question was with the changing shadows
can you get topography and the answers
yes and we're also going to get better
topography because we're sending a laser
altimeter on the Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter so that will give us even more
precise information because we don't
have very good topography at the polls
actually and there's a lot of
uncertainty in the heights so this we've
already talked about a little bit up in
the cratered regions at the poles this
is where we think that there may be ice
in those permanent shadows so if there
is ice in these permanent shadows we
need to go there and find out if there
is or not so we can make a decision if
we're going to use water ice for is are
you which is the Institute resource
utilization and so this will be one of
the objectives of the L cross impactor
mission that impacts into one of these
craters and ejects all this material up
into a plume that we then fly through
and we observe from the ground to see
what's going on in these permanently
shadowed craters but using water ice
isn't the only resource that we could
use on the moon there's also in the
regolith here closer to the equator in
particular where there's we know that
there's oxygen in the regula on the moon
so we may want to go and harvest the
oxygen and use that as our MCG resource
and if that's the case then you're going
not to the polls but you can see here's
a map titanium dioxide over here so you
can see you want to go towards the
equatorial regions in the moiré over
here instead of at the poles so it
depends on the abundances what we find
how hard it is to extract this material
but we need more data in order to make
this type of decision then another
consideration is the geologic diversity
and so these numbers just represent a
list of different sites that geologists
have put forward is saying these would
be good sites to go to on the moon to
study because they're really really
interesting and one of the best places
to go is up here in the northwest
quadrant of the moon and Jeff Moors in
the audience as well and he can talk to
you at length about why that's so but
there's a lot of geologic diversity here
there's mountain ranges there's volcanic
flows geologist paradise is what I've
heard it called so if you are going just
for purely scientific reasons you might
not particularly want to go
polls you might want to go somewhere
over in here so there's different
considerations to be put forward so we
have all these outstanding questions and
we have decisions that need to be made
to drive the upcoming missions that are
coming so something a need that we've
identified is the need for something in
like a lunar database because there
needs to be some way for the community
to access all of this data that we have
from previous missions so we need a
user-friendly interface to disseminate
this data hopefully via the internet so
that the widest amount of people can use
it and what they will use it for is to
support site selection and surface
operations of these robotic and human
missions public outreach would be a
great public outreach tool as well and
used by the scientific community to do
lunar research so just a quick overview
of what types of data do we have and the
types of things we would like to
integrate into this large database I'll
just step through briefly some of the
previous missions to give you a sense of
the information that we have already
this is Ranger in the 1960s and the
spacecraft deliberately crashes into the
moon taking pictures as it's going down
so you can imagine you have a whole set
of nested images as you're approaching
impact and so have several thousand
images from these three successful
Ranger missions and so here's an example
of some of the images that you would
have and this also highlights the fact
that you have the actual data that came
back from the spacecraft then you also
have data products that are generated
from this raw data so there's a decision
to be made as to we'd like to have all
the raw data accessible and then which
of the generated data products do you
also include in this database which
would be useful such as rendered terrain
maps from them next up was lunar orbiter
later in the 60s I've got a few thousand
images from this there were five
successful missions the first three were
going around the equator and looking at
potential sites for Apollo and then the
last two were in polar orbits were doing
more broad scale regional mapping and so
about 99% of the moon was mapped at a
resolution of about 60 meters or better
so we have a good idea of the terrain
for most of the moon next up was the
surveyor missions following this you can
see that there are a lot of images that
have been generated from this we had
five successful Landers they had
television cameras and strain gauges as
they were coming down and landing which
is interesting and then as the missions
progressed further out you include
different instrumentation on these
different missions so here's just some
here's the first image that we had and
then you can mosaic these images this
would be another one of the data
products depending on how you wanted to
present the data and of course there's
Apollo there's a tremendous amount of
data from Apollo which we couldn't even
have time to talk about in a one-hour
lecture but some of the imagery we have
the metric camera covered about twenty
percent of the moon 25 to 30 meters per
pixel which isn't so bad so a little
over seven thousand images there's also
the panoramic camera which covered at
about one to two meters per pixel which
is pretty good so that's over 4500
images and then there's also some
handheld photography which sent back a
lot of images nearly 20,000 images that
are in there and so you can see that
there's images of all different sorts of
things here's outside of the spacecraft
looking here is on the surface with the
lunar rover astronaut here's looking at
spacecraft in space here's pointy
there's a lot of images pointed back at
the earth which is very interesting and
then also especially the handheld
photography there's a lot of pictures of
the astronauts in the spacecraft and
whatnot and putting this slide together
took me far longer than it should have
because just start going through all
those images it's really fascinating so
there's a lot of other science it was
done on these missions as well and I'm
definitely not going to read through all
of these different experiments that were
on here but this is just to give you a
sense of the vast amounts of data that
we have that would be nice to be made
accessible to the community you can see
as missions progressed we have orbital
and surfaced experiments and the number
of experiments and the complexity of
them increases so these datasets do
exist but they're just not very
accessible right now further out back in
the 90s Galileo was actually going to
Jupiter but on the way it took some
images of the moon so here's some images
that was taken down here here's a little
portrait of the earth-moon system which
is nice and also collected spectral data
which is the background image in here so
this is a false color image obviously
showing different compositional
different
so we have spectral data as well it
would be nice to be able to use then
Clementine in 94 had several cameras in
several different wavelengths returned
nearly a million images so there's a lot
of data out there at all these different
wavelengths and also there's topography
mapping with laser laser ranging so
that's useful as well a lunar prospector
was a very good mission this is one of
our last missions that we had this was
run out of NASA Ames and it was in 97 it
didn't have a visual camera on it but I
had gamma-ray and neutron spectrometers
alpha particle spectrometers
magnetometers etc and the really
interesting thing that came out
prospector was the discovery of these
water ice signatures there's a spectrum
down here and you see that there's
potentially hints for water ice down at
the poles and so these blue spots are
showing where the water ice might exist
in these permanently shadowed regions
and so what we're seeing really are
enhanced levels of hydrogen that's what
we're detecting and you infer that this
could potentially be water ice and it's
only at the one to 1.5 percent level so
it's not clear that it absolutely has to
be water ice but it might be and so
since water such a valuable resource if
we find it on the moon that we might
want to utilize that's why there's all
this emphasis and focus on really
understanding the pulses we haven't
really sent spacecraft there and
actually ground truth did before so the
idea that we're coming up with an idea
for a joint NASA google project is to
have a partnership to develop and
maintain a lutheran database and website
and the purpose of this would be to
distribute the lunar data and certain
data products as well it's really
important that their co registered so we
know where we're looking and some other
things as well in an easily accessible
format to NASA to other researchers and
to the public and the purpose of this
would be to support NASA site selection
activities for future robotic and human
landings so I don't think it's too far
out there I think it seems like a pretty
natural fit here is one of the quotes
taken from when Ames and Google were
announcing all these ideas to work
together and whatnot so the vision that
I have is sort of like a Google Earth
but for the moon and with additional
capabilities as well so some of the
things that would be really need to have
that our team has come up with
characteristics we would really like to
see visualization with full zoom
capability so you can go into the
highest resolution data for whatever
site you decide to pick a clickable map
so you can look at other co registered
data sets as well so it would be really
nice to take all the data that we have
and bring it all together in one place
so temperatures elevations sunlight
availabilities composition radar
signatures the hydrogen content that's a
big one gravity fields slopes are
important for landing sites as well you
can't land on a cliff face surface
roughness that's also important for
landing sites and it should be
searchable so that you can search any
data field as a variable so you can find
whatever it is that your heart wants to
see and then other requirements as they
come forward 3d representations or any
other things that would be useful and
presenting the data so some of the
objectives that we've come up with with
our team and now these are all just
tentative so we're just you know this is
our brainstorming sessions open public
access to all the lunar data that we
have including data from the past
missions and also the upcoming missions
that are coming so the new data as well
easy reliable and timely access so it
has to be user friendly maintained to
access so we don't want it to a trophy
this is one of the problems with all
these earlier missions that we've had
for the lunar data you can't just go out
and search online right now you just
can't find it and it's very difficult to
find and we have projects right now that
are going on where we're digitizing some
of that older data so that it can be
accessible to more people complete
traceability of the data's pedigree this
one's really important because we need
to know exactly what processing was done
on any of the data that's put into this
database if it's ever to be used by the
scientific community which I think would
be a nice thing so that it's actually a
useful product to have so we need to
know if it was co registered or not if
it's been radio metrically calibrated
whatever processing has been done on the
data needs to be documented in here and
this feeds into having data and the data
access consisting with scientific uses
again so that it's a useful product that
we can use having a straightforward
pipeline of designated data
onto this site so that it's easy to get
data from all of the upcoming missions
that are coming so we can get that in in
a timely manner and also including the
scientific community on aspects of lunar
data so we don't want to just leave some
of the users in the dark we'd like to
get input as to what would be most
useful in developing this product so
that we can actually use it later on so
we've outlined some potential tasks
again these are just tentative so these
are just our thoughts completely open to
comment and suggestion so NASA Ames
already is leading site selection and
supporting surface activities and that's
a natural product of the fact that the r
lip office is based at ames so Ames has
a heavy hand in the lunar exploration
game at NASA provide oversight on the
quality of the data products so again to
make sure that it's useful for the
community to use for the site selection
and surface activities providing access
to the raw and process data products so
we have a project going on right now
being led by Michael Sims who's here so
you can answer more questions about that
to bring all this data together in one
co-located place because right now it's
scattered in many different places and
not accessible so we're trying to bring
that together and the idea is that we go
through NASA and take all the data that
we have and then we have this database
that we can deliver to google or and
then you know have that put into a more
user-friendly format and also we can
provide data analysis and interpretation
expertise because we have a good lunar
science base at Ames so we can help an
interpretation of what's going on and
also the data analysis is important as
well because you have to know how to
deal with the data and how to process it
and it's not always such a
straightforward thing potential tasks
for Google developed the website so
maybe something based on the Google
Earth model would be really nice
incorporate the previous mission data so
hopefully giving that to you in a
digital format so lunar orbiter Apollo
everything we've already stepped through
in all those different data sets and
also provide a mechanism to incorporate
future data so we have LRO that's
launching we have the el cross mission
we have a lander mission that's in
formulation are left to so some way to
include all this data
in that database and then create
standard and requested co registered
data products and co register come ups a
lot because it's pretty important so
there's clearly expertise at Google that
NASA can benefit from and it would
probably be a good idea if NASA did
benefit from that obviously large scale
data management Google's the place to go
data mining I don't have to tell you
guys this because you guys are the
experts introduction of entrepreneurs to
the space agency a web interface
development so that it's user-friendly
and bringing this information and the
excitement of exploration out to the
public in the US and abroad easy access
to the data and data products for NASA
and other users that would like to use
it and low-cost solution to database
management because we have all this data
that we need to deal with NASA can also
bring something to the table I think we
have the access to the lunar data so
that's why we're trying to collect that
now and get that all together
development of a software at a process
that raw lunar data and to calibrate a
data products so make it actually useful
for people to look at and we have the
scientific expertise to interpret the
data with our good base of lunar
scientists some of whom are here today
and also the lunar exploration program
that warrants the necessity of having
this lunar site selection catalog in the
first place so there's actually a reason
for doing the other than just it's cool
and anything to do but there's an actual
real reason to support these future
missions and then also sharing this
information and the excitement of
exploration with the public and then
there's some mutual NASA Google benefits
as well strengthening ties between NASA
and Google as Google enters into the
research park over at NASA Ames a way to
initiate public and private partnerships
and provides a nice project to start
building relationships for future
projects as well that can be beneficial
to both sides and also bringing space
science and information technology
benefits to the general public so we
want to get more people involved in
understanding and appreciating the
excitement of we're going back to the
moon and we're sending people to the
moon and then we're going to send people
on to Mars and it's a really spectacular
thing and getting
word out is uh something that Google
does well so we've done a quick estimate
just to give you an idea of how much
data we're talking about we very roughly
estimate about 50 terabytes of lunar
data exists from the previous missions
that have already gone and then we also
have the upcoming missions as well it
would have to be built into that
database so just a quick summary we
actually need a consolidated lunar
database and it has a reason for
supporting these missions and there have
other uses to science community public
outreach etc but we think it would be a
nice idea for a joint NASA google
project to develop this user-friendly
database for all the missions with raw
data data products etc etc so I'll just
leave this information up here this is
our contact information can call or
email these are the core members of the
team that are up here now and I'd be
glad to take questions and ideas
they're bad they are
also like years
yeah the question is how much access do
we have to international missions that
have lunar data and I think Michael can
probably answer for the past missions
but for the upcoming missions i know
that NASA is in negotiations with other
countries to have data sharing so for
example Japan is launching a mission
called saline and so NASA's in you know
talking maybe we can cooperate you know
and share data LR 0 vs saline and that
sort of thing so I know that there's
negotiations going on for future
missions Michael do you have a sense for
the past missions it's a case-by-case
basis right now there's a lot of it
DVD edition is there a number of our
colleagues are working
scientists at media
elaborate working
expectation that a curiosity for to
those
Oh skater requirements yeah we didn't
put that into our overall idea the
sooner the better really because well
but realistically LRO is launching in
two thousand eight and the initial plan
was to have a lander mission or have a
mission every year through our lab but
that schedule has sort of slipped a
little bit but we have to start site
selection well before the mission itself
so a year but there's no hard date right
now because of the fluidity of the our
lab schedule yeah so I was curious about
your thoughts on how you would approach
the outreach aspect of this you use is a
one-way communication channel or you
something where users could you know
perhaps give you know you put their own
ideas as
possible interesting landing sites or or
share information with other members of
the public that they find useful all
right that's a good question the
question was the ability for having
input coming from the public and what
not and I think that if we could do it
that would be useful because for a
particular example with the LRO mission
the L rock which is the camera that's on
that mission they're going to be
selecting or soliciting for sites from
the public to actually go in and say
this is I would like a picture of this
site but they haven't specified I've
just met with them few weeks ago and
they haven't specified the mechanism for
doing that yet for getting an input from
the public so they can actually target
the camera and same thing goes for on
the Mars mission that just went into
orbit the MRO the hi-rise camera they're
calling it the people's camera because
there are soliciting targets you know
from people that want to have specific
regions on Mars that are imaged so if
there is a way to do that I think that
would be great and I don't know of the
protocol yet for doing that for what
particularly L rock so but it would be
very very good and it would be very good
way to get more you know interest in
interaction in that so but those are
just my thoughts it's not the official
position of NASA I don't I don't know
sir
I'm in public yeah its public public
dated yeah right there's a period right
after data are wired but a undergoes
verification so these very short primary
periods or a hawk on scale
Oh
there's the ground with it
but all
where to
mass
I don't ask a google person by the 1990s
was all digital and US Geological Survey
he
that they
grand jury also to a
sound to their works
done to be older data says I person
analog data that the archival data
sources of army
scandia
correctly and registered
to the Reverend later
I
high-resolution photographic activity
from lr 0 will have a public Wallace
absolutes
you a call
your point because there's there's a
project at Johnson Space Center that's
being funded via NASA to digitize a lot
of the Apollo data and there's also
there's a proposal from a group in New
York to digitize the lunar orbiter data
so we can get that in a format that's
accessible from the original from the
original data sets not second or third
generation prints survey live staff
together
very
all right let her lose the 2nd 3rd
generation stuff anti-regime never
mastered ass but were themselves created
for the door hi mrs. Cooper body man
so there's our digital data available
I'm a little confused what is what is
this original date that's not in your
luggage will be photographic plates or
media murder used technology developed
by the airport for surveillance
1960s houses the works period giant
kodak artery of
polaroid camera system which basically
developed big strip the other 70
millimeters trip of film on board the
spacecraft we just did scanned a passive
optical scanner and an analog signal is
sent back to the earth and then stand on
the film
people recorded tapes or analog tape
taking some curated and the archival
copies are those master-
directly from the signal about 1967
it means amazing what they did look at
the quality of the images are strikingly
good so you think about how they got it
it's all morning
supreme technology people employed do
stay in fact was that
anything else but we can stick around
for a few minutes afterwards if you have
additional questions but thank you very
much for coming and we peaked your
interest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
