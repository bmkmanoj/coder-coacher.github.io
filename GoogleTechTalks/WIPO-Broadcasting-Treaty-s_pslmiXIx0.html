kind of classic civil liberties issues
like privacy and free speech and also a
lot of the the funds then that you that
you give us than our donors give us go
to litigation on these issues so we're
about half lawyers fighting in the
courts to protect your rights we're also
we have some staff technologists who
work out what what these new
technologies do with a how they affect
our freedoms and then there are people
like me who do some communications work
and also help channel the voices of
ordinary individuals to policymakers to
legislators to Congress to make sure
that ordinary people are heard in major
policy debates so we take on those
issues with the privacy and free speech
also electronic voting will be there on
the front lines in the November election
as we've been for the last four years or
so and also we deal with innovation
policy and fair use many of you may be
familiar with some of our major issues
because they have to do a digital copy
right and of course Google itself is at
the center of measure that many of the
major digital copyright issues today
well that's certainly true it's
important to realize that the issues
Google is facing now with respect to
copyright are exactly novel right there
an evolution of an ongoing battle that
we've been having over these issues for
eight or ten years or more about how we
properly strike the balance between the
rights of copyright holders to have
enough encouragement to produce their
works and the right to the public the
rights of follow-on artists the rights
of educators the rights of citizens the
rights of innovators to reuse those
works to create new technologies that we
use those works and how we properly
strike the balance between those two
goals and I want to make it clear that
Google is part of this evolution of this
battle because it really helps set the
context for what Gwen is about to tell
you about wine is going to tell you
about a new IP like regime for broadcast
cable cast net casting that's being
discussed in a far-off policy body in
Geneva right the decisions made there
will affect the internet will affect
Google will
you in three years five years ten years
they may have grave consequences for the
internet for Google for you so to think
about how this copyright evolution has
has affected Google put one case in the
into focus there's a case of by perfect
10 against Google right now that's now
on appeal in that case perfect 10 adult
magazine publisher sued google for
linking to images that may be infringing
and for its image search that shows
thumbnails right of these potentially
infringing images interestingly enough
the perfect tens arguments mirror in
many ways the arguments of Hollywood and
the major record labels in their cases
against file sharing companies right and
for that reason the Motion Picture
Association and record labels have lined
up in support of perfect 10 in this case
right eff has been involved in
file-sharing issues for many years and
we took the groc stir case about
file-sharing networks to the Supreme
Court on the most narrow terms that case
dealt with whether people could create
multi-purpose file-sharing networks and
distribute software to the public more
broadly it dealt with the issue of all
innovators whether they could create new
exciting multi-purpose technologies
without begging permission right again
Google didn't have to beg permission
from Hollywood in order to create its
search engine right they could come up
with the algorithm implement it put the
website up that was it right that sort
of wide berth for innovation is critical
to get new exciting technologies like
the ones are created here while the
Supreme Court's decision in broster was
flawed many ways it did hold intact one
of the the most important standards that
protects innovators and we're very happy
that that the court left that intact eff
was also involved in a case called Kelly
vs. Arriba soft which dealt with one the
early image search engines and said the
search engine basically by making the
thumbnails was making a fair use of the
copper it works illegal use even though
they didn't have permission from the
copyright owners that precedent is of
course important in the perfect-10 case
it's also critical when it comes to
google book search right the analogy
being that an excerpt from a book a
small snippet similar to a thumbnail
of an image so it's these sort of this
evolution of the digital Copyright fight
that's now coming to a head with Google
so with that in mind it's important that
the return of the broadcasting treaty we
nip whatever problems that there might
be in the butt before they come back to
haunt innovators 10 years on as many
innovators have been haunted by the
problems would transition and copyright
into the digital age and with that said
I'll turn things over to Gwen to talk
about the broadcasting tree well I also
want to thank you and thank the kind
folk at Google for the opportunity to
talk with you today this is actually a
very timely time food during this
presentation this week in the marble
walls of marble halls of Geneva the
world intellectual properties 182
members are going to vote about whether
to convene a diplomatic conference
intergovernmental conference on adopting
this controversial new broadcasting
treaty that I'm about to tell you about
my goal today is to give you a sense of
that wife as concerned about this we've
been working in opposition to this
treaty for three years because of our
concerns and my goal is to try to give
you a sense about why you at Google
should also be concerned about this and
what you can do well let's start off by
looking at what the treaty would do the
treaty is above and beyond copywriters
definitely put it the tweet a broad new
set of Rights that apply in addition to
and over the top of copyright
broadcasters and cable casters the
treaty covers both broadcasters and
cable clusters would get new rights a
right to control the recording or the
fixation of their transmissions a right
to control or authorize who can do civil
taneous retransmissions of broadcast and
cable cars over the internet and broad
new fifty-year rights that apply to
recorded content so rights that would
include making available transmission of
recorded copies distribution and public
communication a recorded content both
over the Internet and over traditional
book
cable car channels most importantly the
treaty includes a requirement for
countries that sign on to provide legal
protection to technological protection
measures that are used by broadcasters
and cable clusters many of the folk here
I'm sure are familiar with the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act that Daphne
mentioned so what we're looking at here
is an additional set of rights that
apply over the top of copyright and a
new type of DRM regime digital rights
management regime backed up by law the
treaty would in effect allow
broadcasters and cable custer's to use
these broad new rights backed up by the
legally enforced technological
protection measures to restrict access
to material that's transmitted even if
the use of that material would be
permitted under national copyright law
if the materials Creative Commons
licensed for instance or if copyright
didn't apply for instance where our work
might be in the public domain and
therefore not subject to copyright at
all this is obviously a concern to those
of us who believe that access to
information is what gives us a
foundation for technological innovation
and what's necessary for social and
economic development I want to pause
here and just no one important thing my
last bullet point here at the moment the
US broadcasters do not have intellectual
property rights in their broadcast and
cable casters likewise so the treaty
would actually be quite a radical change
for those of us in the United States the
reason the US broadcasters don't have
intellectual property rights over
broadcasts is because the US has never
signed on to the 1961 Rome Convention
which is the existing international
instrument that grant broadcasters
twenty-year rights in countries that
have signed on to that treaty the US
isn't a partagé that so instead in the
United States broadcasts are protected
by a mixture of copyright in the
underlying content some Federal
Communications Act provisions and at the
state level there are various criminal
laws that deal with theft of services or
50
programming there's also some provisions
that specifically deal with decryption
of devices for devices that use that
receive encrypted content webcasting
this is why you should care about this
treaty you may not care about
broadcasting and cable casting but the
treaty may well cover webcasting in 2002
the United States made a proposal to
extend the treaty to webcasters there
are various webcasting companies in
United States Yahoo News Corp and the
digital media association their industry
body who have asked for these rights in
the treaty to be granted to webcasters
and their main argument for one of these
rights is one of parody they believe
that broadcasters and webmasters should
get equivalent rights because they're
often transmitting the same type of
content even if the platform is
different and for that reason the United
States put forward a proposal in 2002
and then again in 2003 to include
webcasting and that's been in the treaty
up until the last draft that has been
extremely controversial in 2004 and 2005
most of the other member countries that
weapon have rejected extension of the
treaty to the internet and web casting
was the main point of contention
negotiations actually almost came to a
stop earlier this year because of this
very issue and so as a compromise as a
way forward in May 2006 wipo agree to
take webcasting out of the country and
split the treaty in two so what we
currently have is a treaty that
theoretically deals with broadcasting
and cable casting in the traditional
sense and we're dealing with that at the
moment that's on a fast track and we
separately have a new second instrument
that will deal with internet
transmissions and specifically with
webcasting the goal is to have that be a
separate instrument that will be part of
discussions in November but it didn't
actually work out that way the nice
pimple clear and simple divide is not
actually what we have in practice the
current draft of the treaty actually
doesn't include work
fasting but what it does do as I
mentioned is give broadcasters and cable
clusters exclusive right of control over
simultaneous and deferred transmissions
of their content over the internet so
the internet is still part and parcel of
the current treaty draft the story is
not in there the u.s. in August produced
a new proposal to extend the treaty to a
subset of webcast is called net casters
that will either depending on how the
vote goes this week in Geneva that will
either be part of the current treaty
that is on the table or else as I said
it will be part of a new treaty so we'll
have a new conversation about a new
treaty that will look probably quite a
bit like this treaty that would deal
with net casting the key question you're
probably asking is what does net casting
look like this is stuff that makes a
copyright lawyers heart warm this slide
goes 44 to this definition which is the
definition of the proposed extension
goes for two slides I'm going to let the
words speak for themselves because if I
read that out you'd all go to sleep
alright so if you got that great great
as I said it's truly loyally dream stuff
I guess the sort of the simple take away
from that is it's an amalgam of various
things it looks like IPTV mixed with
some symbol casting and it has to be
done by a legal entity whatever that
means but that's not currently in the
treaty as I said that's on the table
lurking in the background we're waiting
to see what happens the treaty does
include internet transmissions but
potentially could also include these so
what's so bad about the treaty why is
eff concerned well the extensible reason
why we're going through this process of
negotiating a treaty is signal
protection there's a concern that
broadcasters invest money and kept
lobsters as well and in order to protect
the the signal that they've invested
money into we should have a treaty I
think many people agree that that's
laudable aim there's a general consensus
amongst all the people who are following
the treaty that signal protection is a
worthy goal the problem is the current
treaty draft goes beyond signal
protection and creates new intellectual
property rights 50-year intellectual
property rights over broadcast and cable
casts and potentially over net costs and
those broad new rides backed by as i
mentioned legally enforced technological
protection measures can do or could do
four things first they could create
potential liability for internet
intermediaries they certainly will stay
for technological innovation which is
one of the reasons why eff cares they
will restrict access to knowledge and
freedom of speech online and the online
communities and they're likely to
threaten consumers existing
time-shifting and in-home or personal
networking retransmission rights in the
United States which is something that's
currently lawful under us copyright law
technological protection measure thank
you for the clarification
well we think this will be bad for the
entire internet but to make this a
little bit more concrete and to explain
why we'd like to give you a sense about
how this treaty might apply to googles
mission to organize the world's
information and make it universally
accessible and useful and we thought
what we would try to do here is
highlight how some of Google's current
products and some of the products that
we think might be likely to be developed
how they might be implicated by the new
rights of this treaty would create you
guys know Google way better than I do so
I know the broadcast do treaty at what I
have chosen to do is chosen these three
areas and I'd be happy to talk further
about other Google products that might
be on the line in the question session
after we finish so let's look at Google
search engines let's consider Google's
video search the current radio search
and a new product that would be an index
created by google of the world's audio
and TV broadcast content there are
already entities that are out there
archiving radio and television broadcast
Google might well want to create an
index that actually provides user
functionality to finding content in that
archive that technology relies on access
to recorded content without seeking
prior explicit permission how would the
broadcasting treaty implicate that well
the broadcasting treaty will change that
environment for two reasons first it
will require permission for copying for
indexing and for displaying search
results and linking to search results
secondly what we can see straight up
front is that the technological
protection measures if they're used on
broadcast or cable cast content might
prevent some material even being part of
an archive or even being indexed and
therefore being carded with the search
results that you see so you might see
parts of the world's audio and
television broadcast archive being
blocked out of the Google search
how does copyright deal with this well I
wanted to highlight here that that we
have a sense about how this goes in a
copyright world particularly as regards
to search engines but what I also want
to highlight here is what is novel about
these rights as I mentioned these rights
don't exist in the United States
broadcasters do not have intellectual
property rights in their broadcasts and
cable casts and this treaty is not a
copyright treaty this treaty is a new
would create a new and completely
unknown set of rights in copyright we've
got a hundred plus years of history we
know what the boundaries are we know
what sort of secondary liability one in
direct liability for a copyright might
look like we have no idea whether there
will be second reliability and what it
will look like in relation to these
rights in relation to the direct rights
that the company might violate again we
have no clear boundaries about what the
scope of these rights will be so while
I'm highlighting the the way that
copyright is dealt with these things are
imperfectly dealt with these things in
the case of the perfect-10 case I just
want to highlight that much of what
we're dealing with here is the unknown
and that's exactly why many people are
concerned about this treaty and
implications but to look at the basics
as such if we're talking about creating
an index in a search we're talking about
reproduction in potentially reproduction
in relation to caching and we're talking
about display rights arguably
distribution rights so there might be
questions about whether Google would
have added directly violate copyright
owner's rights we've seen that being the
subject of litigation and pack of your
google and filled the google and perfect
10 b google i'm sure many of the folks
who work on these cases chapter in verse
exactly how these issues work so i'm
going to greatly oversimplify here and
just say there are a number of potential
points here where Google might find if
it were to create a broadcast index or
an index of broadcast and audio cast
works it might find that there's some
question about liability
there may be issues about reproduction
as I mentioned the treaty precludes any
reproduction of recorded content without
prior permission from broadcasters and
cable casters it also gives broadcasters
and cable casters exclusive control over
making available or transmission or
communication of recorded content so
anything that looks like a display by
producing a search result again might
involve either primary or or secondary
copy or secondary broadcast treaty
liability for for Google the point I
want to highlight here is this in the
copyright cases that Google's been
involved in so far google has largely
with some exceptions on relating to fair
use and thumbnails in relation to google
image that Google has benefited from the
exceptions of limitations and US
copyright law that has allowed google
true released to the market fantastic
innovative products that benefit all
society it has in fact benefited from
fair use something that's well
understood in the United States it's
benefited from a series of statutory
safe harbors for Internet service
providers who cash hosts and who provide
location information tools and it's also
benefited from a fairly well defined and
understood set of principles about
secondary liability for copyright what's
different in relation to the
broadcasting treaty is that none of that
is guaranteed there's no guarantee that
there will be any equivalent or mirror
set of exceptions and limitations to
these new broadcasting rights and that
should be a source of major concern it's
for exactly that reason that Internet
service providers such as AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
and us telecom have weighed in in
opposition to this treaty because it
creates potential liability for any
Internet intermediary not just Google
but any Internet service provider who
for instance transmits content and
authorized recordings across a network
might find that it has potential
liability under this treaty with no
guarantee that there will be in turn
intermediate exceptions that parallel
those we currently rely on in copyright
law the treaty actually allows countries
who sign on to the treaty to create
mirror exceptions but it doesn't require
it so what that means in practical terms
is that you have a domestic battle when
it comes down to implementing this
treaty in US law and that looks like the
will of your relevant national
government this is the strength of your
domestic lobbying enterprises on behalf
of the broadcasters who are seeking
these rights and what I fear is that
will see a battle at the US
congressional level to protect every
single exceptional limitation and
copyright law that we rely on repeated
at the broadcasting treaty level
let's look at another part of the Google
video service google is google video is
also hosting enterprise users can upload
content to the google video website and
the question that Google might be asking
itself here there are two questions why
is will Google get the benefit of this
treaty is it possible that Google will
suddenly find itself in a situation
where Google gets 50 year rights over
everything that its users upload to
Google Video will it suddenly get the
the absolute exclusive rights of control
over Internet redistribution of google
video content that comes down to will
Google be considered a net caster for
the purposes of that long definition I
put up several slides back I think the
answer to that is likely not and that's
because if you went back and looked at
the the wording there the concept that
is clearly envisaged by the net casting
provision is IPTV and the sense that
that the person who is doing the
transmission controls the timing of the
information being pushed out to
consumers and that the content is
receiving is simultaneously obviously in
relation to google video that doesn't
apply the end user who's watching a
google video will be the one who pulls
the content so the second question
Google might have is will there be any
potential liability for hosting material
that might be infringing obviously if
Google were to get direct licensing from
broadcasting and cable casting networks
for their content that wouldn't be an
issue but because the treaty gives
broadcasters and cable casters exclusive
right over recording broadcast or cable
cast content it's possible that Google
could find itself in a situation where
an end user posts to google videos
something that is an unauthorized
recording of content well what does that
mean in the copyright context we know
what that looks like we've got a
well-understood somewhat imperfect
mechanism for dealing with that we have
this provision a notice and takedown
procedure that is one of the statutory
safe harbors in the Copyright Act and
section 512 and it's straightforward it
doesn't always work perfectly but
it's someone who is hosting material
receives a letter a notice and takedown
request from someone who alleges that
material being hosted is copyright
infringing if the host of takes down the
material then notifies the original
poster that they've done so they're got
limited liability for copyright
infringement again my point here is
there will be no equivalent regime for
broadcasting content you cannot assume
that the same type of mirror exceptions
or the same type of safe harbors will be
created in relation to this new set of
Rights finally I wanted to sort of touch
on another area where Google has an
important mission in making content
available and it doesn't through new
technology I wanted to look at two
things one is a new version of google
news that actually looks at broadcasting
and cable cars content and mention
google books here the google book search
project both its partner program and the
library project are important in this
regard each of those projects would
require requires access to content
without prior permission even if it's
with compensation as in the case of
Google's payments to Associated Press
for its news feeds for Google News and
it's not clear exactly what the
broadcasting treaty will do in this
regard other than to give you some sort
of broad brushstroke answers obviously
there's a concern or there might be a
concern that there will be additional
licensing costs to pay here parallel to
those that apply in relation to
Associated Press in google news feeds
the second and perhaps more important
point is to notice how the treaty
impacts technological innovation so the
creation of new devices that Google new
devices new technologies that Google
might create in order to make content
available to the world citizens is
what's at risk here I'm going to pause
and just note in relation to this whole
suite of issues in the copyright context
again we haven't really defined and
clear-cut principles in US law that give
us bellwethers they give us markets so
that we know roughly when we're doing
technologically
where the lines are and and where we're
safe to move there's obviously failures
and implied license is reverse
engineering that's protected as a form
of either unprotected speech or fair use
in the United States law all of these
things are well understood mechanisms
but they won't apply it again in the
broadcast treaty context so I just want
to touch on specifically why if F is
concerned about technological innovation
and hopefully speak to your hearts here
about why we think you folks should also
be concerned about this treaty we think
that the combination of the
technological protection measures
legally enforced technological
protection measures with broad 50-year
post recording rights is going to have
four potential consequences first of
them sort of the very top level the
development of any new technology that
interoperates with broadcast or cable
cast or potentially netcast content is
going to have to do an additional set of
rights clearances they'll be copyright
potentially and also transmitter
clearance secondly as I mentioned
there's a possibility that the treaty
would create new potential secondary
liability for software developers and
technology makers device manufacturers
who create goods products that end-users
might use to infringe this new right to
broadcasters cable casters and
potentially net casters that's going to
chill innovation many companies are
currently worried about this particular
point third and most important from FS
point of view is the fact that the
treaty includes legally enforced
technological protection measures that
in combination with the broad post
reporting fifty-year rights that I
mentioned will allow broadcasters and
cable casters and again potentially met
casters to control the market in devices
that will receive that content so what
we're talking about there is set top
boxes DVRs and if we talk about net
casts personal computers
what that might look like is precluding
the development of the next Tebow or the
next slingbox finally our experience in
the United States has led us to conclude
that the broadcast of technological
protection measures that are envisaged
by the treaty might require technology
mandate laws in order to be implemented
as part of national law I'm sure me of
the folk in the room are familiar with
the broadcast flag regulation from the
FCC that's currently stalled and has
been the subject of many legislative
attempts to reinsert it let me just say
this since I'm sure many of you of me
with the technology issues technology
mandates are not good for innovation
they increase design costs they reduce
feature sets and they are likely to
reduce market competition and devices
for consumers also they're bad news
consumers usually bear the brunt of the
increased costs and more importantly
abroad technology mandate lower like the
one that we expect would need to be put
in place to implement the rights that
are part of the treaty could potentially
oberoi consumers existing time-shifting
rights under us copyright law and their
ability to retransmit or use material
that's been lawfully acquired inside the
home or their personal network
okay so I talked a lot about Google my
goal in doing so is to try to let you
see the sort of the range of issues that
eff is concerned about here as I said
this treating is bad for the Internet
community as a whole not just Google but
if it's bad for Google is bad for the
Internet what we're talking about is
changing the current internet world a
world which is based on permission
permission free internet exchanges and
replacing it with a transmission right
remember broadcasters don't have to
create a comment content purely
transmission right is what we're talking
about here and if that's backed by
legally enforced technological
protection measures as I've said we're
concerned that will have a great impact
baseline both on the device designed
market but also on people's free speech
and communication rights for other
companies other internet companies are
the web portals are the Internet
intermediaries we think the liability
issues a somewhat similar to the things
we've talked about in relation to some
of Google's products I also just want to
emphasize this last point here that the
treaty is bad for the entire Internet
community not just internet companies
podcasters the user-generated content
that is part of YouTube and it's part of
the rich media experience of myspace all
of that is is put at risk here by this
treaty and last week and again yesterday
eff delivered a letter to wipo that
signed by 200 podcasters and podcasting
organizations representing collectively
thousands of podcasters around the world
their voices they're concerned about
this treaty they've got two particular
concerns one in relation to their
freedom of expression they believe that
the ability to get right clearance for
the material they want to use in their
podcasts they already faced significant
hurdles due to unlicensed undeveloped
licensing markets if you add another
layer of Rights above and beyond
copyright over the top of that that's
just going to make one more barrier make
it a little bit more insurmountable for
podcasters to use licensed clear content
the second reason they're concerned
mentioned is the impact this treaty will
have on technological innovation and the
environment that allow the creation of
such things as iPods and web syndication
technologies like RSS that make
podcasting possible this is a major
concern to many people in a free speech
community online so next question what
stage is the treaty ad well as we speak
discussions are underway in Geneva the
wiper General Assembly is meeting this
week and it has the task of voting on
whether to hold a diplomatic conference
next July there's been a recommendation
from the copyright committee part of
waipo that they should in fact be this
conference the wiper general assembly
the plenary body of waipo has to make
that decision this week if they decide
to convene that conference the goal
would be to have the treaty adopted then
in July they could vote otherwise but
unfortunately it's just not clear at the
stage which way this is going to go if a
treaty is adopted in United States law
treaties aren't self-executing so then
what we would need to see is us
implementation legislation that would
make the treaty part of US law and as I
mentioned what we see the effect is that
will be a battle for trying to develop
balanced exceptions or limitations that
provide enough room for technological
innovation to go ahead battle that may
well be hard fought and difficult to
predict
I'm going to hand it over to dereks
powder tell you what you can do to
support its efforts in this area said
sort of wrap things up and tie it
together i mean i think is when meant
what happens to be bad for the internet
in this case is bad for google i'm sure
there are some things that are bad for
google that are good for the internet
but in this case what's bad for the bad
for the internet is is bad for google
and i hope we've instilled a lot of fear
in you if sometimes we hear people say
well we're just fear mongering what
we're doing is just speculating here
about the trees it could go either way
well let me ask you who's really
speculating here right because right now
okay we have we have a world where to
use broadcast content all sorts of legal
ways you don't have to go ask permission
first Google could make a lot of new
services that would be really innovative
and so could other innovators on the
other hand under this treaty we have a
world where the first line in your
business model is not create a cool new
product it's ask broadcasters permission
to create a cool new product right who's
going to fund that what VC wants to fund
that where you have to ask permission
first I think you're gonna have a lot
less takers now okay so we're not
speculating what about the broadcaster's
right is there a lack of broadcast cable
cast and webcast content that you have
access to write do these people need
more incentives to distribute works in
these ways no there's tons of broadcast
cable cast content sure that care of
things about theft of service and signal
piracy people not getting cable that
they haven't paid for not getting HBO if
they haven't paid for it sure that's a
whole different thing than what this
treaty is about where's Gwen is
explained we're talking about a broad
regime of new rights and new technical
restrictions on use of your TiVo all
sorts of things okay now what the
broadcaster's happen to have of course
is a lot of money a lot of power because
of a lot of money and it's tough to
fight against that a lot of time it's
expensive enough to fly to Geneva right
as Gwen has to do over and over again to
wrangle with these people in far-off
bodies policy bodies so there couple
things that we would of course love you
to do if not Google to do certainly you
as individuals one you can go to our
website action DFS org and take action
now to tell your representatives to
oppose this treaty second thing you can
do is support eff as I said we are a
small organization we have 25 people
small budget we find a lot of tough
cases on a lot of different issues
litigation is harp flying to Geneva is
hard and it's expensive so as I said we
have on the table over there brochures
and little donation envelopes you can
also go to our website sign up become a
member get a hat get a t-shirt get an
LED keychain good stuff right and you'll
be supporting a good cause so I think
those are those three things those that
spread the word about the treaty to but
mainly can go to our Action Center now
and then in support eff we'd be quite
pleased thanks very much for your time
and I would add to that that Google will
match donations to eff I've heard rumors
of whoever does the donation matching
digging in their heels and trying not to
match if they do that email me or email
a mac and we'll straighten it up because
eff is doing great work I'll say that
personally this is a google urging you
to donate to eff and I'm sure a lot of
people have questions so let's open up
the floor yeah go ahead
as far as I'm concerned view all our
great organization and
so we're gonna please take my comments
in that light because I as a present I
want to push you a little bit on one or
maybe two issues charge me when you talk
about the creation of human rights for
people like broadcasters I was thinking
about in volume of talking and there are
other words that I think are more
suitable gear I mean simple words like
powers because when you when you talk
about right so you're talking about
something that this country goes in no
time right in it the key part of the
Constitution is the Bill of Rights and
in there it's really about the rights of
actual human beings and limiting powers
right right the right of the people
peaceably to assemble and and
petitioning the government for redress
of grievances that's us right fit limits
government power and I feel like it just
kind of hits me every time you talk
about giving broadcasters new rights
where I feel like what what strikes me
is the issue of the ability of small
numbers of commercial entities to limit
to restrict or control what actual human
beings are and that's what wow that's a
thing that bothers me as i hear ya but
not that yeah we're not going to
disagree I can phrase it I can phrase it
in some glute legalistic terms as a set
of exclusive rights because that's what
the treaty says but I think what's at
stake here one hundred percent is power
the power to control your devices the
power to limit freedom of speech online
the power to limit your ability is a
consumer to time shift and to retransmit
content within your home so I agree
go here with a pepper yeah yeah I mean a
second one said about the eff and the
work it does and just comment about
using words like restricted powers and
eggs but are you aware of any
broadcasters in whose interests these
human powers aesthetically who
nevertheless have come out against it is
there anyone who said we don't want
these powers in relation to broadcasters
no I mean to me would to be perfectly
frank the people who are largely pushing
for the scene united states and the
north american broadcasting association
as i mentioned there's a number of
webcasters on the web casting front
there are a number of this there was a
letter that was presented to weber by
eff back in 2004 signed by 20 major
broadcasters and internet companies
people including mark cuban the owner of
hdnet elliott loss from chuckles to my
rally a number of internet Illuminati
people who have a dog in the fight who
would get the benefit of this treaty who
expressly rejected webcasting they
actually thought it would hurt their
interests and give given each two
incumbents over their enterprise but no
broadcaster surprisingly are pushing for
these rights and as I said this is
actually kind of surprising in the u.s.
context because in the US we've never
really granted powers however brides
based on purely investment-driven motive
sweep the at least in relation to
copyright we require some modicum of
creativity so this whole concept of what
I mentioned the 1961 one can mention
that alien to the US tradition but yet
broadcasters here are particularly keen
to have these types of rites and they
want economic crime if they have used
the word economic rights oh yes let's go
back on the road
so first off I went to North Carolina we
had pasted this past December where one
of the major
my car again
we don't want to comply with the law
because it's too expensive and actually
I've or anywhere based on that step over
chart that so
you know you have happened to
a handful dinner
but my question with regard this is
where does leave you copyright holders
whichever example if I you know creating
something mellow sound
and it's you know broadcast
violation of copyright law what happens
what's going to go on that music this is
the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question
for the treaty says that it doesn't have
the latrines preamble service-learning
temple to affect existing copyright
rights to the NCAA say that well who
needs other dmca the the interesting
point to note here is that there's a
collective of white-collar organizations
the international photographic the
International Federation for undergrad
for Guinness trees which is essentially
the international version of the Raa and
the mpaa that were familiar with here
they and a number of the road children's
organizations however the last few
weapon meetings up until recently oppose
the treaty and have said that they are
concerned about the potential for
complex because it'd be over like a
nature of the rights they should have
excitements on this point I have to say
is the end game draws near the NPA a in
America actually have come out and
supported the treaty but had said along
with the RA that they support the treaty
but they support only and there are a
signal piracy based treaty well hey if
they're from the police signatories you
sign on to learn to the USPTO two weeks
ago and to Wi-Fi last week also support
a signal piracy treaty this treaty yank
back so I think the more the mortgage
thing hypothetical that I talk about a
lot with Gwen is is if you have a public
domain work right work that is not under
copyright anymore or something that has
been permissibly licensed like a
Creative Commons license work what
happens when that gets broadcast right
the broadcaster gets it gets rights over
that public domain work even though
under copyright you would be totally
free to use it however you want I'd be
basically snatching that that work back
from the public domain and putting it
back under broadcasters power with
is like so Satan comes to with respects
to the point about the Gulf my becoming
fear more rights and say that someone
comes to middle video and says we please
put our video online the original
content or elaborate work has happened
to all the time but that music on
broadcast so now you're saying somebody
works a salir Accords the simpsons and
wants to put it on google video or
broadcast our own thing in my point
what's the so yeah so say let's say that
so it's fair you something so she'll
calm yeah um has discovered that they
want to be able to put their we want to
look good short clips of their sitcom
yeah the comment is it worth I think
land and that's why they're you know
that's it companies broadcast as well
but people who produced the sitcom
wanted to be on duty here do they have
to then where is it google lot smoother
than go back
so I think this is one of the
interesting questions I think in a
competitive licensing market where I got
two energies on my reading bag cream
authorized retailers in that situation
it's the tree you know the trees formal
language says that copyright is not
affected that is a practical matter if
it's effectively a limited licensing
pool for that copyright holders might
find that they don't get as much of the
pie as they previously did I mean
obviously these things are dealt with in
the US the moment under under contract
Lauren thirdly another analysis of that
but yeah it looks like two entities have
the same ability to authorize
retransmission and extract licensing
fees and this kind of the same as the
DMZ a relief for the creator of the
right to a hundred interoperate
something good can I could you get a
sort of a quick overview of who is
showing up in Geneva you give it a
certain bits and pieces what who is
being partnered as this is well I mean I
think the thing I want to point out here
is there's been a sea change in the last
few months US industry has shown up in
force and one of the reasons I'm here is
because i'd like to see google as part
of that contingent but let me give you
some names intel Sony Panasonic eighteen
t Verizon dell us us telecom the
industry body for the telcos communicate
the computer communications industry
association and Consumer Electronics
Association together with eff a number
of the major public interest groups and
all the International and US libraries
signed on to a joint statement opposing
the current treaty draft and that was
delivered to wipe out last week of those
a number of those / as I said Intel's
being there in person ccas there in
person verizon AT&amp;amp;T us telecom they're
all there in person and they're going to
Geneva because they really are quite
worried about how far advanced this
treatise let's go back there
forecasting there is no definition of
broadcast that is one of the things that
a number of countries would like to see
in the current trading the current
treaty draft instead defines
broadcasting and it talks about
transmission of combination of sounds
and audio or the representation there
I've it doesn't deal with any more
granular detail that's a very good point
all right so assuming the treaty passes
in
Washington with the US
the time I've ever populated early signs
are plowed US Congress is the
well it's kind of cross that bridge when
we get that right day in the in the
meantime there are many fights that have
to do with restrictions on your
non-infringing use of broadcast content
right so is Gwen mentioned there's this
thing called the broadcast flag which
would basically require all digital
television sets to recognize certain
copy protection for you know controls on
over-the-air HD TV all right this is
again having the tivo having to go back
mission from the FCC and Hollywood to
build their newest devices right and
that's a live issue right now in fact in
that and mainly in the Stephens bill in
the Senate that has to do with telecom
reform it's been snuck in there as well
similar bill regarding digital radio
that's been snuck in there and also a
satellite radio so those are really the
live issues right now and those are the
ones that are I think going to be live
in Washington over the next foreseeable
future when this comes up the time table
in Geneva is pretty hazy as it is right
they suspended discussions today Geneva
time in order to have informal
discussions between member countries
because it's such a divided question at
the moment you basically have the United
States opposing the convening of a
diplomatic conference and for different
reasons many people in many countries in
Latin America and in Asia and on the
other side you've got Europe Eastern
Europe and Russia calling for diplomatic
contacts it's hung in the balance at the
moment so it's difficult to predict the
other thing I will point out is eff
members have been taking action for some
time on the treaty we've sent and I
think over in total over the last couple
of last year in a bit maybe 2,800 of our
members have contacted their
congressional representatives about this
and our understanding is that actually
this is becoming quite a live issue
there's a number of the companies who
are now involved in opposing this treaty
have also been separately engaging in
discussions with congressional committee
people and and those conversations are
ongoing both at the house
a community level scrubber I'm going to
make the point i suddenly realized i'm
confused if i take a picture of the Mona
Lisa I don't own the Mona Lisa but I
still own the rights to my picture right
this was I understanding of what the
this transmission bill was when you
saying no you actually if someone out
there you know someone goes to the loop
no here's the Mona Lisa are you saying
that they now own the content for their
transmission this is not like you were
saying before but you know transmitting
visiting resulted with YouTube they both
play on the transmission or giving the
content well they put it off a mission
maybe of tons as a separate right so
there's a copyright holder right so this
copyright holder who is transmitting the
television show right or rather there's
not transmitting it was delivering it to
who's ever transmitting right there the
copyright holder if they either their
bundle of copyright rights right to
distribute right to copy things like
that okay then there's going to be the
whoever the cable caster is is going to
get a separate sort of right and it's
over the recording and use of that work
later right so you were you look sick
but if you record it and then reuse it
but I mean this is this is the issue in
a nutshell basically what most people
who are concerned about this treaty are
concerned about is the fact that it goes
beyond signal protection we understand
what it means to siphon off a cable or
get unauthorized access to satellite
signal it's not clear to us why you need
intellectual property powers or rice to
protect something that is already
protected under copyright if eff and
many of the industry groups who I
mentioned us now would be happy to see a
treaty go forward if it is dealt with
signal piracy this treaty doesn't do a
signal piracy the issue is until it has
these broad rights that apply after
you've recorded the content and that
The Fairly fudges the distinction
between signal protection and content
protection information before broadcast
of something that was common among the
Lisa maybe but many podcasts from me
feel the same way yeah similarly for so
you kind of touched on it but what is
the argument that the broadcasters are
making like what what technologies are
they're saying that they would implement
if only they have these new powers what
are they scared away from doing right
now they could do under these new powers
well I resume and speak for the
broadcaster sorry I have to make it
clear that we are on one side of this
particular conversation what I can say
is your personal things that the
broadcasters and said I think that's a
fair way to describe it so there was a
US Patent and Trademark Office round
table that took place on September 5 at
that the senior associate general
counsel for north american broadcasting
association so the reason they were
looking for these rides looking for this
treaty was to protect against internet
retransmission of signal piracy that's
what they said and the sick and he
mentioned in particular case called the
i crave case if they dealt with a
Canadian Canadian internet company that
received / received television
programming from the US and
retransmitted it over the internet now
in that particular case i create the
canadian entity was shut down by the
copyright owners in the content so going
back to loans question copyright owners
actually took action in the u.s. code
and closed down line crave but he
mentioned that in sort of the case what
they wanted was to have the
broadcaster's in that instance he said
wanted to have a direct right of action
I didn't want to have to wait till the
copyright owners waiting and protected
their content so that that's one thing
and the second comment he made in
this year just before the world cup
kicked off in its all its glory as for
us was that broadcasters wanted to
protect sports broadcasting rights and
that certainly has been something that's
been said at many meetings over the last
eight years this has been discussion at
wipo again you know if that's point
would be well copyright and theft of
services laws deal with that already in
the United States and in many other
countries in the world show us why you
still need these new 50 year rights and
more to the point we've seen things like
podcasting YouTube and myspace
proliferate managed to disseminate
content on the internet without 15-year
rights way again do you infusing your
rights so I gave our point is we don't
think there is adequate justification
for that's what they've said so in
fairness to them explanation I think
we're winding down on time so maybe one
more question is over there are
countries out there and do have some
notion podcast right so um Chris Rose
major what
are you seeing any sort of these
hypothetical situations to be bringing
up and look at having the United States
do you see similar parallels and tourism
already do have these so there are 83
countries remember wipeout just sort of
benchmark things wipo has 182 member
countries 83 countries have signed on to
the 1961 room convention and I guess to
answer your question about one of the
major country as well Australia where
I'm from has broadcasting rights Europe
has rights and I guess a large amount of
the push for a sort of an intellectual
property rights powers based approach
comes is coming from the European
countries and the European Commission
which as I said is one of the group of
the 25 member states and three accession
states are speaking as one calling for
this diplomatic conference to be
condensed oh they are very keen to see
this go ahead my understanding is that
at least in relation to things like what
might be called simulcasting or net
casting that in some European not at the
community level but in some European
countries that right exists it certainly
exists in Britain but there's actually
been little on the ground the use of
that right today the technology is not
there even if the right exists on the
law books is the paper right so it's
it's difficult to make any assessment
and the other point I would make is the
1961 this tree would be broader than the
1961 treaty which the US never signed on
to it would be brought up because it has
expanded coverage it covers broadcasters
and cable casters and potentially net
casters it has a broad range of Rights
and most importantly or for the
technological protection measure
provision is novel here so many of the
things we're particularly concerned
about haven't been part of that
framework yet because tpms geological
protection measures have not been part
of the broadcasting framework even in
the countries that are sign on tomorrow
yeah
so thanks so much to both of you for
coming direct colors table of
information over there and i think is
more than happy to tell you more about
eff and their programs and their gfs org
if you want to find out more about them
