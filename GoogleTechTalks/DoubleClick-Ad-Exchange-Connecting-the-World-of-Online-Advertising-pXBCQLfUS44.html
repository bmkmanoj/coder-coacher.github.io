to Google we're very excited to have you
here my name is Al and I'm an
engineering director here in a New York
working in the ad space and we have an
exciting program for you this evening a
highly interactive so everyone is going
to have time for questions and we look
forward for that so I'll say a few words
about today this is kind of our very
rough agenda but one of the cool things
in what we do and speaking on behalf of
four of us here we work on the ads side
of Google which in my view is extremely
interesting and challenging and the
reason is challenging to me is because
it combines a lot of computer science
from machine learning to distributed
systems and an auction theory game
theory and much more with are bringing
economical value in a criminal
economical formulas to the web making
the web better and richer for everyone
keeping the web open and free and we're
going to talk about it more soon
personally I've been here about four and
a half years in Google New York I
started at a software engineer ah
building one one of the ideas we had at
the time called the the Ad Exchange and
it became successful and that's been a
thrilling and gratifying right for me
and with that I think I'm going to pass
it on to Jacob who is leading a big part
of our ad serving just to understand
what ad serving is think about all the
users in the world looking into websites
trying to get the best content and then
everything come has to come to some some
server in real time and fast is better
than slow right so which are a lot about
a concern we try to improve and this is
what the team does with that I'll hand
it off to Jacob
thanks al I'm just going to load up the
presentation here so we're going to be
talking about Ad Exchange which I all
mentioned it was his project when he
came into Google and he's still all of
our boss so let's talk about first of
all why this is important what we do
which I all touched on as well so what's
so what's the point of having an ad
exchange well imagine you're a newspaper
company imagine you're say the New York
Times or The Washington Post over the
last 10 or maybe even 20 years people
have increasingly been looking at your
content to the stuff that you pay your
reporters and so forth - right they've
been looking at it all increasingly
online instead of in their newspapers
and for some reason they expect to get
it for free so you have to make sure as
someone who's publishing content on the
web we call these people publishers just
as we do offline we have to make sure
that they can get enough money to
support their business to support the
website that all of their visitors are
coming to pay for so particularly as all
of these people ship their business
online it's been really a struggle and
the very new space of online advertising
in the grand scheme of the economy this
is an unbelievably new industry to make
sure that these publishers can monetize
their websites effectively that they can
get the money that they need to build
the websites from advertising otherwise
they'd have to find the money another
way or they wouldn't be able to have
their website so what we really look at
our job as is keeping the web free we
have to make online advertising as easy
and effective as possible in order for
these content providers these publishers
to make a living so that the web keeps
on going as the wonderful free mostly
free to consumers medium we know today
and that's really what we're trying to
do so to discuss how ad exchange does
this the way that we're trying to make
the online advertising world better
first let's talk about how ads get to
where they are if you go to a website
today YouTube say
and you see an ad in the screen where
did that ad come from how did they
decide to show you that ad and not a
different ad well initially people had
these systems called ad servers in the
ad server was a server that sat in a
data center somewhere and when you
loaded the page the ad server would get
called and it would pick an ad to show
and the ads that it picked a show or
mostly ads from advertisers who talked
to directly to the publisher to the
person who owned the website someone may
even have picked up the phone and said
hey would you like to show my ad how
much would that cost me they probably
the actual ad itself which we call in
the industry for some reason the
creative they would have maybe even
emailed to the publisher and the
publisher put it in this ad server so
the ad server made all of the decisions
but as you can tell that model doesn't
really scale if you want to show ads on
dozens or hundreds of sites across the
internet that's a lot of phone calls
that's a big staff you have to have and
as a publisher if you want to manage to
sell all of your ad space through these
deals then again that's a lot of dinners
you're taking advertiser sales reps out
on so along came these companies called
ad networks and ad networks what they
did is they represented a lot of
advertisers and then they would go to
the publisher and say you don't need to
make a deal with me in advance just
whenever you have some ad space that you
want to show an ad on give me a call and
we'll try and find an advertiser for you
and we'll pay you what we can get minus
some fee and so this was their business
model and publishers like that because
it's good to have somewhere to go
no matter what who can maybe give you
some money in fact publishers liked it
so much that there were lots of
different ad networks and if there's
lots of different ad networks as a
publisher if you're only working with
one you feel like a sucker because think
about the money you're leaving on the
table by not working with all of them
and picking the best one at any given
time so what happened was that
publishers ended up working with lots of
these ad networks and also so did
advertisers so that they can make sure
to get the publishers they want and
advertisers also got technology to
manage their interests and to manage
their reporting across all of these
different ways that they were showing
their ads confusingly this is also
called the net serve so as you can see
the eCos
got a lot more complicated and it only
got worse from there
today there's tons and tons of different
companies involved in showing an ad even
maybe just a single ad on a website
there's all these different ad networks
there's companies with different
acronyms of acronyms like SSPs
sell side platforms demand-side
platforms data providers whose job is
perhaps telling the advertisers
something about the user that you'd be
showing the ad to to see if that makes
them more interested in showing an ad at
a given time the verification platforms
which help advertisers make sure that
their ad actually got shown so all of
these companies adding value but also
adding friction TV ecosystem so this is
really just kind of a mess because every
single new service that comes into the
advertising ecosystem clearly it's
adding value to someone and it's serving
a purpose or nobody would be using it
but that doesn't mean that these
services necessarily interact well
together and if you go to a website that
has a lot of ads and the ads are not
configured very well you can notice it
takes a lot of time to load the page oh
that one of the reasons for that is all
of these different services all of them
most many of them work by just trying to
put some JavaScript on your browser and
if they're all putting JavaScript on
your browser well then that's going to
take a while so user facing latency ends
up suffering thanks to the size of this
ecosystem and this is bad for users of
course and also for publishers because
the longer it takes to load an ad the
higher the chance that no user will ever
end up seeing it but they'll just get
frustrated and go away and it also adds
a big cost to all of these different
players in the market to the advertisers
and to the publishers because they have
to know about how to use all of these
different technologies and to try and
integrate with all of them so that's
where we come in ad exchanges trying to
provide an open and transparent
marketplace for buying and selling
advertising on the internet a place that
no matter who you are in the market if
you want to buy or sell advertising
regardless of the technology you use you
can come and buy it on a single platform
across the internet if you're a
publisher we try and give you the best
ad no matter where it comes from no
matter which ad network or which company
is providing that ad we try and
the best one and also give you a unified
place to tell us what kind of ads you
want instead of having to control that
separately for every person you're
getting ads from and if you're a buyer
you get to show your ads to hundreds of
millions of different users all through
a single system that again you can
configure once and have it work
everywhere so we're really trying to
connect online advertising and reduce
the amount of friction involved in doing
advertising on the internet so this is
really hard so we have to serve billions
of different requests every single day
and everyone we don't we can't just
serve it from our own system but we have
to also find out who wants to buy this
ad so how do you think that we figure
this out how do you think for any given
ad we figure out who's interested in
buying it but what we do do is we
actually call them in real time while
you the user are sitting on a page
waiting for the page to load we call
them in real time over the internet and
how long do you think we have to do that
so it says so we have 30 milliseconds to
do everything we have to do in our side
but how long does anyone have a guess
how long we try and take to get bids
from all of the real-time bidders yes so
we try and get it in 150 milliseconds
but in fact we try and do it and we're
trying to lower that to 100 milliseconds
for the bidders printable so we're
trying to do 100 mill in 100
milliseconds in a tenth of a second or
up to 150 milliseconds in some cases
we're trying to call everyone who might
possibly potentially want to show an ad
on this publisher site and figure out
what ad they want to show in the bid
that they have that they want to send us
and not only that but we have to figure
out if these ads comply with our
policies and with the publishers
policies and this may be an ad that
we've never seen before
and maybe it's an ad we have seen before
but how can we tell and again we have to
figure out whether this ad is the kind
of ad we want to show in real time while
someone's sitting waiting for the page
to load
which hopefully doesn't take as long as
it's taking me to read through this
slide and of course we have to do this
all in an incentive compatible way we
have to figure out how to show ads and
how to let buyers bid on ads in a way
that does right by all the market
participants we have to make sure that
everyone feels like they're treated
fairly and everyone has the incentive to
tell it to be truthful to us to tell us
what they actually are willing to pay or
willing to earn for showing a given ad
let's talk about some of these things
more specifically so this is really the
basic question how can we do this all at
scale how can we figure out millions of
in millions of places at once
the right ad to show to all of these
different users while respecting all of
the preferences we get from all the
buyers and all the publishers well we
have to build a really very global
scalable system we're serving on
thousands of cores all around the world
and one of the big challenges here is
how we handle state so say you're an
advertiser you probably aren't willing
to spend an infinite amount of money
advertising probably you have a budget
say you're willing to spend a thousand
dollars advertising around the world
well what that means is that some system
in China might want to keep showing this
ad but in order to figure out whether
it's allowed to show this particular
buyers at it has to know what all the
rest of the computers all around the
world decided to do with this ad because
if they've all been showing it really
quickly then it might that advertiser
might be out of budget so we have to
take the state we have to send it to all
of this systems around the world while
still doing this all within 30 seconds
to do budget yes
yes mistake why giving away freebies we
overshoot exactly yeah so so so hitting
budgets exist this is a very good point
getting budgets exactly is very
expensive both from a latency point of
view and probably because any of the
reasonable ways of doing it mean you're
going to forego some impressions you're
going to not show some ads that you wish
you'd shown which is called under
delivery and we really try and avoid it
the advertisers don't like it either so
that means that we mostly we're trying
to hit a window and we might overshoot a
little bit and so but we try an
overshoot of course as little as
possible while still staying in line
with the actual budget and we will
reimburse advertised as if we overshoot
a similar distributed state problem
involves user data one of the big
features that advertisers use on the
Internet is what's called frequency
capping you say this is a lot like a
budget but instead of a budget through
your ad globally it's a budget for you
ad for a particular user you say I only
want to show this ad to any given user
on the Internet at most a certain number
of times three times a week because
what's the point of view seeing the same
ad over and over and over and over again
that doesn't benefit every anyone but
this means that the users state we have
to we every any computer that you might
potentially hit any of our servers has
to share all of that data about the user
and we have to update it very quickly
because in some cases if you're going
from page to page you can see ads in
quick succession and we have to do all
of this with very high availability
Google really as a company prides itself
on the availability of our systems and
Ad Exchange is no different we try and
do this all while showing ads a very
very high percentage of the time so
maintaining is high ability a
distributed system is a real challenge
for us and latency again is also a
challenge so I was touching on this a
bit but really to get to the kind of
latency we want we can't store anything
on disk and we can't do make any
requests that aren't local to the data
center and we can't block on anything
because the moment you blah
you know if you get woken up a few
milliseconds late that's it you get
you've blown your deadline so managing
to do everything we do really really
really really fast is one of the biggest
problems we face what this means is that
we have to use an indexing system and we
actually use the same indexing system
that's used for google search to store
our ads that we can retrieve the ads
quickly enough to serve a given request
and by the ads I know that this sort of
contradicts what I said about getting
the ads and you'll find from from buyers
but what we do is we let them tell us
some stuff in advance so that we know
what kind of inventory they're
interested in buying we have to figure
out the contents of the page at some
point in our system we have to actually
go crawl the page and figure out what's
on it because we let advertisers target
based on the pages contents so how can
we do this and still manage to serve
these ads in the brief time we have oh
of course we have to do a lot of clever
caching this is another one of the big
problems we face and doing any sort of
eligibility check we want to do an X we
have to do all of this we can't store
anything on disk and we have to and we
can't store anything that isn't locally
replicated what that means is that if we
want to if you make a change to an ad we
have to we have to somehow get that
change and tell every single server
that's potentially serving your ad
around the world that your ads change
very quickly as well which is a big
challenge that we've been working a lot
on recently and another one of the
things that makes ad exchange so
interesting is our auction so when we
should so what does it mean that we have
an auction when we show ads well we
don't do of course we're doing this of
course billions of times a day
we don't go while you're waiting for the
page to load and have a bunch of people
with paddles go and decide who's going
to get the ad what it means that we have
an auction is that we have a mechanism
for ranking and for pricing ads that
runs in our system in real time and in
particular the one of the most crucial
features of this auction is that its
second price so what that means is that
when you bid on the right to show an ad
on a given page we don't end you win
you're the person with the highest bid
and we always incidentally give the spot
in addicts
the person with the highest bid because
we want to be very very transparent
about the about who wins the auction
it's to be a market it's important that
everyone feels they're on a level plane
and the way we do that is by saying we
just take your bid and if your ads
allowed to show any of the highest bid
you win so why wouldn't we charge people
their bids why do we charge people
instead the bit of the next person down
so maybe maybe one of you can tell me
what would what would you do as an
advertiser if we said when you bid for
the right to show an ad on that exchange
we'll charge you the amount that you say
you're willing to pay what would it be
in your interest to do yeah lowball
you'd want to bid just enough to get the
space but no higher because if you say
the next person was willing to pay $2
and you're willing to pay $3 well you
you get your bill for $3 and you'd say
well why am i paying this extra dollar
if I bid too low one I would have still
won and I would have saved 99 cents so
maybe I'm going to try and game the
system I'm going to try and find the
lowest possible bid that would still get
me all the benefits so even though
initially it looks like it would be
better for us and better for our
publishers to charge people the maximum
amount they're willing to pay if we
actually did that if we ran a first
price auction we wouldn't know what
people were willing to pay and also this
would result in significant instability
for the advertisers themselves because
now you're not competing against other
Pete you don't actually know what the
other people are willing to pay either
we only know what they tell us they're
all gaming system as well so we
recognized for google search and we
maintained that principle for ad
exchange that having a second-price
auction which which gives the buyers the
incentive to tell the truth
about how much they value the ad space
is really better for all the
participants in the market it's also
worth mentioning if you buy an ad on
google.com or if you buy an ad through
Adwords
on the rest of the Internet you can say
how much you're willing to pay for a
click but that's not how we work on the
Ad Exchange because the because in order
to run a fair auction with
cost-per-click you have to have a good
estimate of how much people are willing
to pay per click which is a very hard
problem
so what we do is we say well if you want
to charge your advertisers per click if
you're a network and you think your
advertisers want to pay per click well
you still have to bid per in production
which is called
CPM for reasons I won't go into and then
you have to take the risk so this means
that AdWords which buys on that exchange
this is this is sort of our own internal
network they let advertisers
pay-per-click but they have to do the
conversion they have to guess how many
what the chances of a click and bid on
ad exchange on a per impression basis so
the publishers know that the person
willing to pay the most got the
impression and it's we're not using any
of our click-through rate prediction
magic unfairly so with this auction like
I said everyone should bid the valuation
the amount the maximum amount they're
willing to pay for the slot right almost
we wish but as I said earlier
advertisers have budgets and this is
this changes the model to some extent
because if you're bidding a dollar in an
iterated second price auction what we
sort of take that to mean is that you're
willing to pay it a dollar for
impressions like this forever and ever
and ever but of course you're not
because if we eventually you run out of
your budget you wouldn't be willing to
pay anything anymore
so budgets kind of change the equation
but overall we found that an iterated
second price auction leads to very good
characteristics and to stable bids and
good results so we're almost there
except for the budgeting thing but the
Ad Exchange auction is actually key to
many of the features that we implement
on the exchange particularly features
for publishers and we end up having to
work with it and figure out what the
right thing to do is in the auction for
a bunch of the different things a bunch
of the different features that we built
so a great example here is reserve
prices so publishers don't necessarily
want to sell their inventory at any
price they may want to have a minimum
that you can date to buy that ad space
because they may have something else to
show there they may want to put in a
promotion for an internal service or
they may already be telling you
advertising through another system and
they don't want to essentially undercut
themselves which would cost them a lot
of money so we let publishers specify
the minimum that they want to charge for
any given slot but it gets more
complicated than that because what
happens if that minimum price leaves
some ads unsold
well maybe if none of their existing
customers knew that they were selling
that same inventory for less and maybe
if people who wanted to buy on their
site in particular still had to pay the
advertised rate they could sell the rest
for lower and it would still work fine
so you probably are familiar with this
model if you've bought a hotel off
Priceline and you'll see you know a
hotel that it won't tell you what hotel
it is it'll say this is a hotel and say
Philadelphia in downtown four stars for
a very low price but we won't tell you
who it is until after you bought because
they don't want to compete with their
advertised rate so this is the very same
thing here and we call this feature
anonymous inventory if you get to you
the publisher get to sell your inventory
anonymously just as sort of white label
this is a site about sports the users in
the US but we won't tell you which site
it is and that way you can manage to
fill a lot more of your inventory
without having to undercut your existing
deals and we implement this by having
these dual reserve prices we have a
branded reserve price for people who
care about showing on your particular
site and an anonymous reserve price for
everybody else but this has been
implications because all of a sudden
what happens if the if you the top
bidder have to pay at least three
dollars because you're buying branded
but the second price the second place
guy who is buying anonymously is only a
dollar fifty what are we going to charge
you are we going to charge you three
dollars or a dollar fifty so actually
what we do is we charge the maximum of
the reserve price in the second price
because really the reserve price
functions kind of as a bit this is a
price that the publishers willing to buy
the inventory back from you and so from
an auction theory perspective this ends
up
being the right thing to do and in fact
we're reserve prices are really big
control that we have because it lets
publishers decide what they think people
should pay for their inventory it's a
big tool that lets them control what
kind of ads that they show maybe they
think expandable ads are really annoying
to their users and so they want to
charge a higher price if anyone wants to
show an expandable ad maybe they want to
charge a higher price to certain buyers
who they know are really interested in
buying their inventory but with all
these reserve prices how does the
publisher get any sense of what number
to put in what the right reserve price
is to set and we have a really
interesting feature for that and so I'm
going to turn it over to Nemo here who's
going to tell you how publishers set the
reserve prices and what tools we give
them for that Thank You Jacob so I'm
going to talk as Jacob said about one
particular aspect but it's part of the
general so as you heard the auction is a
complicated system
there's participants and it's been
carefully designed to have the right
incentives so that buyers tell the truth
sellers also tell the truth and they're
happy and so it's basically it's it's
not a zero-sum game it can actually what
we are aspiring to is really a win-win
situation if when the abbé shows
publisher is happy because it was the
best possible ad and they made the most
money that they could have made
advertisers happy because that was the
best place to spend their dollars and of
course most importantly the user is
happy because they got to see that
webpage and it was free and also the ad
was hopefully if the good ad that's
relevant to them and giving them some
information that they need so the key
here is so we try to design the system
so that all these people have
everybody's only is essentially behaving
selfishly of course the publishers are
not there to have to give free stuff to
advertisers and vice versa so everybody
but even as they're behaving selfishly
we want the overall outcome to be a
Wyn sort of like a game in sports with
if you have good rules you'll have a
good game
yeah and it will be entertaining and
both both parties that are playing the
game will be happy to play so I making
it a second-price auction solves the
bulk of that problem but there's still
room for strategy so for example of
strategy is buyers you know we say ok
according to these rules in theory you
should bid your true value well what's
my true value it depends on what you
tell me about what this thing is worth
so for example if I'm an advertiser
for a product that's offer or service
that's offered in New York maybe I don't
want to waste my and I want to advertise
on you know let's say wo Wall Street
Journal com I don't want to waste my
money when a person who's in Germany is
going to Wall Street Journal calm
because they'll show an ad or B for a
local business in New York is totally
irrelevant to them so if we give the
buyers more information that helps them
determine how much this thing is really
worth then that will help them be
truthfully and get the best value
similarly as Jacob mentioned you know
you may have the right value and it may
be a great deal for you but you know
maybe if you're selling potatoes in New
York and you know it makes sense to bid
50 cents to show your ad for potatoes
maybe you don't have a trillion dollars
to spend on potatoes but you have you
know two trillion users coming to that
website some of them from other planets
similar so the buyers have to have
strategy budget is one of them sellers
also have to have strategy and as Jacob
mentioned it's basically they have to
decide at what price am I not willing to
sell this this product which is this
impression so just just to get a quick
idea how many people have heard the term
reserve price in an auction okay great
so about half so it's basically the
floor price for the other half it's
essentially say you're selling your
house and you know hopefully it's not a
foreclosure but let's say it's an
auction
and you're saying well you know I'm
willing to sell it whatever price is
possible but if it drops below a certain
level I might be willing to just keep
the house and rent it out instead of
selling it because that makes more sense
to me below a certain price so you'd put
that floor price so essentially here
it's the same thing with the impressions
the publisher may say well if it's
really drops below a certain level maybe
I'm better off just serving the page
with no ad and the user will just see in
our page with only the content and no
ads or if I have some other advertiser
like we heard before from ad network
source or some other source that I have
an opportunity that I could have sold it
somewhere else I don't want to sell it
below that price because if I can't get
that price in the auction I want to go
and get that other value somewhere else
so that's that's called the channel
conflict so there are many reasons for
selling floor for setting floor prices
and what we do you know we both we
design the auction but we also try to
help both sides be smart about how
they're playing this game so we provide
tools suggestions and automated
strategies so once in a while when we
design these features we have to sort of
put on the publisher hat or the buyer
the seller or the buyers hat and say
well if I was a buyer and I had you know
all the power of Google's computers and
algorithms and so on how would I use
that to do better and which I so we try
to create these strategies for both
sides so I'm going to talk specifically
about how the strategy for the seller of
how to set the reserve price so as I
mentioned the buyers are very different
as lorina or rather as Jacob mentioned
there's different buyers who may have
different reasons for valuing that
impression so when I go to again wsj.com
some people might be interested in
placing an ad because the article is
about
you know let's say the auto industry so
you'll put an ad that's relevant to
people in the auto industry and so if
I'm reading an article about the auto
industry maybe I'm they'll figure that
this kind of ad is most likely going to
be interested interesting to me or
another advertiser might say oh this is
a guy who
fixed English so I have it I add for
english-speaking people or a guy who you
know who reads the whole street journal'
so he might have money and we should
offer him a vacation so different users
for the same thing different people have
different value and there can be big
differences between these values so
sometimes the publisher if they don't
set a floor price they may not get
everything they they want out of the
auction like I said in the case of the
house suppose you decided to sell your
house and you made it a second-price
auction and the day of the auction maybe
you didn't advertise it well on the
newspaper and nobody or one person shows
up and it's and he bids one dollar and
he takes your house for one dollar
obviously you wouldn't want that right
so so there are good reasons to say well
I need a floor price in my auction so
what we do is we say like let's look at
history let's see how much we can learn
and advise them to give them the best
possible floor price and it has to be
optimal for the publisher but again if
we have to do it in a way that doesn't
mess up these incentives in the market
because if we do then the buyers will
say well the game is rigged against us
we don't want to play and they'll go
somewhere else so we don't want to
change the incentives for the battles so
how what do we do I'll give you a simple
example that hopefully illustrates the
main idea of how you optimize reserve
prices and also gives you an idea of
generally the types of things that we do
so let's say you're a publisher this is
what it looks like for you
so down here we have time so again I
have a website maybe I have a million
visitors who come to that website every
day each time a user comes we call that
an impression or a potential impression
for and we ask advertisers hey who wants
to show an ad on this impression so
let's say the first page view or
impression we get three advertisers one
of them is willing to pay $5 the next
guy is willing to pay $4 and another guy
is willing to pay $1 so that's that's
the auction we would in this case we
would run an auction the top guy would
win and because as Jacob explained is
the second price auction he would pay $4
if you know a few seconds later or
milliseconds later another another
impression comes along a different user
or same user on a different page and
again you know let's say you have these
two values $1 and $2 and so on it keeps
going so over the course of the day the
publisher for a particular piece of
their inventory is going to see a lot of
different options here we have five
Illustrated with different bids and
every time the bidder the winner is
going to be the top bidder and the price
they pay is the second price so what
happens again we're now we're wearing
the publisher hat so we're saying how
much money did I make from all these
users who came and these advertisers so
in this case I had five impressions I
made four dollars on the first one again
as I mentioned on the second one the
price paid would be $1 maybe this one is
a little bit higher so it's 150 this one
again the $5 guy won but he paid $2 this
time this guy this time another guy who
bid $3 one that he paid $2 so total the
publisher average average two dollars
and ten cents per impression okay so
that's working this is the publisher is
making money and the advertiser is the
best possible advertiser is winning the
publisher looks at this though and says
hey I heard you know we don't tell them
what the bids were we just tell them
what the price paid was but maybe the
publisher did some research and found
out hey some people are bidding five
dollars and I'm only getting two dollars
you know so it's like my reviewer this
content that I've created is worth five
dollars
why should I only get two dollars and
ten cents on average I'm going to put in
a floor price let's say for 50 you could
even go up to five but let's say the
publisher says okay you know I put in a
floor price and as Jacob explained the
floor price is essentially a bid that
the publisher themselves is saying is
putting in it behaves exactly like a bit
so saying at this price I'll buy it back
from myself I don't want to sell it to
anybody else
so they put it in for 50 what happens
here well they did you know they made
more money from the five dollar guy
because now he's going to be paying 450
that these other times
they you know these are this time the
highest did was $2 and you had a floor
price of 450 so nobody want nobody want
you standing the second song so here you
end up with an average of $1 80 per
impressions so that's not good because
so the reserve price is just a floor
price I'm not sure I'm understand so
it's yeah so that's why in this case
well okay well it depends on per query
let's say so for let's say for the
traffic that you had you had five five
people came to your website right in
scenario a those five people generated
$10 and 54 per yeah yes so yes and in
this case so the same you had the same
PI 5 pageviews three of them got no ad
which you know maybe the user was happy
about that but the publisher is not
happy because they're making a dollar
eighty on average for all this content
that they've generated in this traffic
that they've attracted to their website
so and there
the
so yeah well that's a good question but
this is why second price auction matter
so as you heard for if in the second
price auction the key property is that
for a buyer it's there is no reason to
bid other than your maximum so these
guys are this is the incentive
compatibility piece this guy is only
paying three dollars because he really
does not want to buy this space for more
than three dollars let's say again he's
selling potatoes and if he so shows the
ad for three dollars there's a certain
chance the person will see the ad and
come to the store and buy those potatoes
and he'll make a certain amount of
profit but if he pays too much for the
ad it's not worth it he'll cost him more
to advertise and then the business
generates for him
so again so in this world the
advertisers are already bidding what
they would be willing to pay so if the
floor so again the floor price just
asked acts just like any other business
like I got big I don't even know that as
an advertiser that whether I got beat by
the floor price or by another bidder I
just know that hey there is a billion
queries and I won fifty thousand or
something right so I don't know but it's
the same and the important thing here is
that the publisher can't simply change
this all the time they have to set a
relatively static at least in our case
once a day at most floor price I mean
they can do it more but in try not
necessary certainly they can be changing
your floor price billions of times a day
so we try to say well okay well where
would be another type of situation well
okay what have they put on the different
floor price and set it at 250 instead ah
well here
okay first query unaffected by the
reserve price the winner wins and pays
the second price so it's as if the the
reserve price didn't exist second query
yes nobody want again it got lost but
you know we made it the reserve price
raised the price in this case and here
and here for in different bidders so
what you end up with now with the 2.50
sense reserve pricing
option you sold for impressions out of
five possible impressions and you
average two dollars and 30 cents that's
good that's better than what you were
doing before so that's basically better
than zero it's better than the floor
price that's too high
essentially what you've done is a
trade-off between volume and end price
so just think of a very simple like any
other product you could sell more of it
at a cheaper price or fewer at a higher
price somewhere in the middle is the
sweet spot where you make the most money
so what we do is we analyze this very
carefully and then we tell the publisher
hey this is what your landscape reserve
price landscape we call this so for
every possible reserve price that you
could have set on average and remember
you know this is not five queries it's
Millions
you know these this is what you would
have if you had set no reserve price you
would have average two dollars and ten
cents if you set in a reserve price of
250 you'd average to 30 and if you have
set a floor price of 450 average 180 and
out there obviously at some point if you
get really high you make zero because
your floor price is excluding all the
buyers so the publisher looks at this
and says okay great thanks for the
suggestion I'll set my problem in my
floor price at 250 and I will make you
know 11% or whatever it is more than I
used to make and I'm happy and that's
the story for the publisher now and we
output this for them as a this is what
it looks like so in a real life scenario
hopefully it's efficiently blurred that
you can't tell who this is not just it
but the graph is obviously not based on
five queries it's based on billions and
billions of queries a day it's pretty
much everybody on the internet at some
point goes throughout our ad exchange so
we get all kinds of different graphs and
this is really useful insight publisher
can say ah this is where I should set my
floor prices to maximize revenue there's
a lot more details that you have to be
careful about in particular about not
upsetting the buyers are not changing
these incentives that we've talked about
that that's essentially optimization on
behalf of the publisher seller strategy
and with that
since we're just showing you the the
front end here I'll hand it off to norm
who's going to talk a little bit about
the Attucks front end systems starting
to get really uncomfortable
so hi my name is Nam I work on the front
end for that exchange and I don't really
have a feature to talk about
specifically I wanted to discuss the
front end in general and the challenges
that we face you've heard some really
interesting concepts both from Jacob and
namo and they're all really great and
they provide a lot of well at the end of
the day money and utility to our
publishers and advertisers but they're
all run in the back end so these
publishers and advertisers like they
can't hold up a paddle they can't walk
over to our data center and put their
creatives in our servers and so in order
to streamline this we have to create a
front-end for them to manage their
campaigns and manage their ad units
places where the where they're going to
serve ads from and that's where our job
comes in play
so this is a kind of a blurry piece of
the AdWords front end I don't know why I
took it I don't have a lot of slides
mine's going to be much shorter and I
assume you can all get up to get some
beer after so the challenges that we
have in the front end that I wanted to
discuss are we want to make it quick we
want to make it available we want to get
intuitive and while those sound obvious
it's not necessarily simple and if
you've ever built a website or have you
built a some user interface you know
that these challenges come with their
their own set of challenges
each and so we have a very
low tolerance for high latency are our
goals are to keep page loads under under
1 1 second and we try to keep our our
pcs under half of that availability we
said before that our our apps and our
ads services are available all around
the world and so we want our UIs to be
available in those places and in those
languages so Google has an initiative
which is 40 languages for apps in ads
it's a little less I don't know why
those people pay money should so so on
addicts we we support over 26 countries
and over 15 languages so that's another
challenge intuitive simple but
functional I mean those are our you know
just kind of three little words that
have a huge impact if you have a passion
for user interfaces you know exactly
what I'm talking about if you don't have
a passion for user interfaces go get
some money from the bank and tell me how
that experience was so so what what
what's interesting about our front-end
is that unlike you know Docs or or Gmail
or any other application that you use
daily to you know consumed social media
or or what have you
these these UIs are used for making
decisions whenever a publisher logs into
their UI they either go and check out
how their inventory is doing if they
need to modify anything maybe they need
to block certain advertiser that's
lowering their quality maybe they need
to change you know their reserve price
so every login basically translates into
a decision that decision at the end of
the day could translate into money in
their pocket their bottom line so it's a
very it's very important that again the
UI is available and that it's intuitive
because if you make a mistake there we
have to pay back we use so I kind of
glanced over reporting but reporting is
a huge challenge for us we spoke about
millions of impressions and we have you
known mo steam goes and crunches that
data to figure out the reserve the
optimal reserve price we also have to
give our publishers and our advertisers
a way to see how their campaigns are
affected by certain changes that they
make and they want to get this data
immediately so sure if I'm running two
ads and there's five people looking at
my ads and there's not a lot of data to
look at but if I'm running thousands and
thousands of ads and maybe millions of
keywords and I'm running them all over
the world and I'm doing thousands of
queries per second then that's a lot of
data to crunch and it's it's tricky
again from a front perspective to put
that information in a very intuitive and
clever way for our publishers and our
advertisers to understand what they're
looking at so we're not just going to
dump a bunch of numbers on them although
some of them do use the API for that GWT
I wanted to plug that since I assume a
lot of you are computer scientists or
engineers in the field is a Google web
toolkit it's an internal form an
internal it's an open source web
framework it's actually more of a
compiler than anything but we use it to
build our applications so AdWords
Adsense addicts to name a few use GWT
and experience is or the experience of
using it translates into how fast and
and how polished are you eyes look and
feel and just to end it up as I promised
is going to be short the most important
thing for us on the front end is pixel
perfection so with that hopefully I'll
you're up again
thanks a lot for the great talks nice
with that you've heard about various
technologies and aspects and auction
design I think we'll move to Q&amp;amp;A and
take question
so you get 100 that make us work so I
mean I'm not sure we can we we find
actually that the number of people
involved in an auction really varies
there are some cases where we have
impressions that a lot of people want to
buy and there are some cases when really
especially the people numbers left above
reserve price to be very small and even
just one so yeah we have to be careful
with numbers but there's one number and
I think we were I was approved for from
the Kindle so ah there's on average we
mentioned this in a blog post I think
it's okay to talk about but on average
it is more than half a dozen but bidders
on any impression but the high-end can
range up to over a hundred and there's a
very wide variance Jacobs as as for what
happens when we have multiple people who
are both the highest bidder we flip the
coin we pick one at random
unbiased ly at random
um the best way is probably to to step
up and speak to the microphone and if
more people have questions you can just
line up behind one - all right all right
so it sounds like a lot of your auction
theory is geared towards keeping people
honest but you do provide buyers the
ability to single out what they're
bidding on do you have any mechanisms to
detect collusion amongst buyers if
there's 12 buyers at all knowing they're
going to buy the same type of persona or
the same website content do you have any
way to detect when they've been working
together to cheat your system oh I've
started so the question I guess the
other angle to think about it is why
would reputable buyers do that well I
would yeah so a couple of advertiser
might you know try to game but as we
just heard from the previous question
the market is really what we call
efficient in various measurements and we
do keep track of our partners to make
sure they're legit in a way that there
are you know serious businesses and
obviously from the by side they compete
with one another in a way that's kind of
the whole model so we do have some
mechanism some advanced mechanism in
place to do a bunch of sampling and try
to detect these people try to override
their policies seem concerned well okay
I think there's more we can yeah there
is also the issue that suppose you
created a coalition of buyers and say
okay well when I did you don't bid so
that I all you know we help each other
out and you get some it's not inherently
that's not sustainable because one of
you is going to cheat
the other guy won't trust them because
al said fundamentally we're competing
against each other so if you have made a
little there's too many buyers yeah well
there's always new these so there's too
many buyers for you for the buyers to
these able to really agree okay you know
when I bid you don't bid and then I will
talk about it I'll privately on the side
I'll give you something it was just not
sustainable because fundamentally
they're competing and and I think that's
a very good question because when we
design as never said earlier when I
designed the auction and we think about
incentive compatibility and about the
win-win-win situation you want to make
sure what we launch is good for the
publishers and advertisers and the users
first otherwise we don't found you so I
think they're perfect let's at least we
have a very strong attempt into creating
a marketplace that matches those
guidelines probably okay to mention that
we have a pretty big ad spam team that
does both proactive and reactive at spam
detection and they're quite good at it
they have a lot of resources and sorry
last thing on this we do think about
this a lot and we do monitor metrics
like you know auction density second
price premium how high the first prices
above the second price and also there's
a much bigger challenge than then
collusion between buyers on the exchange
this may be digging us into a deeper
hole but I think it's worth mentioning
each of each of our buyers they aren't
advertisers themselves usually their ad
networks or other companies representing
a bunch of different advertisers so what
if you're a buyer you represent 100
advertisers and you know that with very
high likelihood you have both the top
and the second highest bid for you of
the person who's willing to pay the most
in the second most for a given
impression well it's a second price
auction you're only entering one bid so
from our perspective it looks like
there's just one guy and the publisher
will get the next highest but that's
outside of your network so the publisher
isn't really capturing all of that value
which is really if we have one big
auction would be there instead it's
being captured by the
so dealing with that situation going
with a multi-level auction that we have
ends up being a very big challenge from
an incentive compatibility point of view
and from keeping everyone's interest in
my point of view and it's very hard for
us because this is their own system that
we don't have inside to do anything
about that hi thanks for a good talk um
I actually had a very quick question is
there any dependencies between auctions
because when I heard this it sounded
like every ad space is bid separately
but suppose you had like two scenarios
one is your few ad spots on the same
page anyone had like oh and at the same
buyer get both or if you want to have
dependencies where you want to have it
for a second ad only based the first ad
having accepted do you have those kind
of strategies and what does that involve
that complexity I'll take that I think
and so the answer is yes and no and it's
a very good question
we try to cater to advertisers and
advertisers may have a strategy to take
over the page for various legitimate
reasons or to not show an ad based on
content and we have business rules
within this system to make sure they
match what they intended to do so you
would think about two very big brands
they probably don't want to show in two
different ads spaces on the same page
right so we have some control over that
but as soon as we launch a feature or
launch disability the advertising space
is so innovative they count with a new
requirement so it's kind of a lot of
evolution around those type of feature
sets I'm not gonna extend it out but
what you want what you talked about is
like a dissonance but I was wondering is
there is there a possibility for someone
to bid on contains together as one like
you have like auction Lots kind of thing
that is that a concept that's there we
don't have that right now we look into
it of course you probably know in the
limit this is a combinatorial auction
which is an np-hard problem I'll just
mention one one small case it's not
technically it's not a pure ad exchange
feature but on YouTube you know how you
have compared what we call the companion
ad
so you have the slot on on the page on
the right-hand side and then you have
the in-stream ad which is the ad in the
video itself
they don't always both exist but and
when you have those two there is a way
that you can actually buy those two at
the same time there's one a consistent
experience for these so it's a YouTube
option feature more than an attic switch
but it exists in some questions can can
you just speak to the mic please or or
we can try just you know from where you
are that's already one material I just
wanted to know whether or not you have a
strategy in mobile applications
especially in hyperlocal advertising a
long lat radius are you doing that or
are you planning on doing that that's
that's a very good question and a
follow-up Yankee do like I don't want to
come here again
what is the CPM versus regular website
I'll take you for a stab at the first
question so there is a huge shift
happening towards mobile devices right
cell phones tablets from desktop it's
obvious and it has a lot of potential
for content providers and ads as part of
that content we do have the ability to
do that long type of targeting in
general in Google ads we are still in
discussions we also did data it times to
target so the advertiser could target
based on you know the user is here and
I'm close to the next store and that
story is also in advertiser so maybe we
should show that ad right those type of
scenarios it could be extremely useful
for the user based on all the other
targeting criteria that that they have
so we are working on something similar
we're taking a lot of privacy
consideration into the decision of
how to exactly build that type of
feature but speaking on behalf of the
kind of the larger not at exchange the
larger Google Ads there are capabilities
that enable you to do that I don't think
we can disclose the exact figures in
terms of CPMs but so in general the rule
of the rule of thumb is that the more
the better targeting you allow
advertiser the higher CPMs to get higher
value they get from dad right and and I
believe this is more of a personal
opinion then then then numbers that we
looked into that there is a lot of
potential in a hyper vertical hyperlocal
targeting to generate the liquidity in
the auction and higher prices but we
cannot go into unfortunately we cannot
go into numbers right now that came here
so just to be clear I don't I don't know
if you got that but addicts does have
mobile ads so so already that that is
already launched so if you you know you
get an app with ads in it some of those
go friends so just like okay so it's a
big it's a huge area of development and
we do already support mobile apps iPhone
iOS then as far as the pricing there's
it goes all over the place without
giving numbers there's argue there's
reasons why it should be higher there's
reasons why it should be lower because
yeah and you know the like you said
location is a user whoo reason why it
might go higher user intent may be a
reason why it goes lower because they're
doing something else so but we don't
know it's early stages
I just like to ask you to talk a little
bit about the differences in your model
as applied to different language
communities
I can't imagine that advertising in in
German would be the same as in English
the very different size of market and
different culture can't imagine that
advertise in Chinese where Arabic would
be like either in English or German I
wonder if you could talk maybe in
general or what you found
Thanks that's like that's a great
question
as noted earlier we're trying to provide
a global ecosystem in pretty much every
product we lounge they won't have any
opinions about the differences between
markets we mostly leave that up to our
participants I think is sort of the
other side is that's one of the nice cop
outs of being a platform is we get to we
get to lay this all at the feet of the
people buying and selling in an exchange
so we give you the features of figuring
out all the other stuff is your job
figuring out what you want to buy what
you want to sell in how much and of
course we give them lots of features to
help them do that I know from a sales
perspective the landscape is very
different in different countries but so
far not much of that is trickled down
into the product I think it's fair to
say now one of the reason is that on the
creative level on the graphical digital
unit that you see this is the mostly
formed by the advertisers themselves so
they would know the audience that
they're trying to target and we
essentially acted the vehicle that they
can use to target the right audience at
scale so that's where localization that
comes into play
yeah yeah well think about it's where a
market place right Nasdaq works equally
well for companies that are were you
know 212 recent examples aside in theory
it does whether your company's worth you
know 10 billion dollars or 100 billion
the master is just a mechanism for
buyers and sellers to meet and transact
so it so and and language or the content
the geographic location there are many
dimensions that matter a lot as Jacob
said we try to give you all these
dimensions so you the buyer can make the
right value decision and come up but so
but in practice you know we have orders
of magnitude difference between the
price of one impression and another just
because there's different information
and different value for different
websites and different users what keeps
you up at night either competitively or
technologically outfit night
so I try to sleep well what keeps us out
the tonight is uh I think like like
speaking just from you know experience
Google has this amazing culture of and I
mentioned it in one of the conversation
earlier to really develop the best
system possible so anyone that has ever
written code anyone that has ever
written a system that is used by many
many people know that after a while
requirements change that the landscape
changes and maybe what you thought is
the best design two years ago is not the
best design now and how can you make
sure it keeps working and and the
culture and Google is something that
allows you to you think you need to
redesign the whole thing you need to
think you need to throw away the code
even you know many people worked on it
and build something new and and better
to make sure that it's automated and
running well and scalable then we just
do that to avoid kind of old code
situation that I'm sure you know what I
mean but other than that I'm not sure
what keeps you guys off at night pushes
on Fridays this is I'm sure that I mean
my team is heard me talk about this
forever and ever I just I would have
just personally and I won in general at
Google is just the responsibility for
this amount of effect we have on the
internet yeah you know if if we write
code that crashes it's gonna be hundreds
or thousands of the hundreds of millions
of people affected so it's just the
scale of the potential impact both good
and bad is one of the things that really
it's like so we have time for like one
or two more questions yeah so my
question is about possibly how much
statistical learning algorithms you guys
use in doing your secret sauce and your
magic if any if that's involved in any
way
statistical learning approaches Peter
Norfolk's machine learning is a big area
and everything at Google area so you'll
find every corner of computer science
here from machine learning to game
theory to disputed systems right right
everything so it's it's deeply embedded
in what you guys are totally we use it
in some surprising places an example I
think I can give is we want to figure
out which advertiser is associated with
a given ads landing page so because as I
mentioned the buyers aren't necessarily
the ultimate advertisement we would love
to know which advertiser it is who's
actually responsible to be given an
excuse machine learning for that tons of
different stuff across can use or do you
you do use okay good alright other
techniques new questions some like one
how do you know like which advertisers
are eligible for a particular auction
than the one and and number two how do
you know that you're like notifying them
really it like at the same time as we're
dealing it like bill assigns a those are
two great questions so I think the first
one can be found within the second one
how do you know which ad to sir so the
advertising world is extremely
challenging and interesting in that
sense and there was a lot of metadata
that either the advertiser tell us for
the publishers tell us or we infer from
various things like Jacob just said we
understand who the advertiser is even if
they don't really tell us exactly and we
try to validate and verify a lot of the
information that we get from external
party to keep the web kind of honest um
and in real-time we match the ad that we
have all that we have in all the
hundreds of properties for those ads the
metadata with what the publishers allow
us to serve and that's even before it's
going into the auction that's what we
call kind of the contending ads or the
eligible ads and I'm not sure answer
your question but
and I guessing game sort of like
probability-wise you can only see some
guessing game in the sense that you try
many advertisers try to predict whether
someone would click on add a or add B
right how which actually serve a day or
B so there's a lot of modeling behind
that yes as an exchange guessing can
kind of get us into hot water from a
transparency perspective as a platform
because if you say well I think you have
an 80% chance of buying this ad and I
think you have a 70% chance of buying
this at the 70% guy will say well you're
wrong because I happen to want to apply
this to buy this ad space and you are
unfairly discriminated against by
predicting low what can I say to that so
we really try and be very very
deterministic as an exchange in terms of
who gets the chance to buy what ad space
but the process that we go through of
picking which ads want to buy which we
call targeting ends up being a big big
part of what we do in a big part of all
the features that we develop and as I
was saying in the talk we use some
infrastructure from Google search to
help us do this in terms of indexing
inquiry against the kinds of F that we
have
how do you make sure everybody has like
a fair shot at Atticus we're dealing no
assignments though so we do have the
latency limits that were mentioned
earlier and the option is kind of a
sealed envelope and we monitor very
closely a new work with our partners if
we see they're not within the time
budget we tell them and we try to people
so they're motivated to submit as fast
as they can and we're trying to reduce
the latency every few months review it
in and see but we do give everyone the
same time budget to bid
anonymous on the web is kind of going
away how deeply are you tracking users
purchases so tonight as an advertiser
say I might advertise to people that
bought at laptop you don't think we
doing here ago 30 days ago first of all
there are very detailed policies that
encourage everyone like that uses the
wave to to read it's not that long and
we do not use any personal information
or what we call PII we cannot say
whether a third party that's buying on
the exchange uses you know what
information exactly they're using but we
have very strict policies and we allow
users to opt out in multiple dimensions
from tracking and we enforce that and we
innovate on that all the time with the
recent it no but are not tracking
purchases right now to target users it
we are not as ourselves we are not
tracking purchases we do it but let's
don't convey that to you and have helped
target ads to them they do in some
circumstances some do some site may give
us information but the end of the day
the exchange is a broker between buyers
and sellers and you want to make sure
they use kind of the same language
exchange become efficient in any market
if they use the same terms and we're a
facilitator but we have very strict
guidelines on PII I think also something
worth mentioning and this is in fact
maybe a big privacy benefit of that
exchange so you can opt out of all our
user tracking from all of Google if you
go to google.com slash add slash
preferences in the field you'll see a
big button labeled opt-out and you press
it and of course before we have an
exchange we can only offer out of ads
being shown by our network but now we
can opt out of it out of user tracking
from anyone who's buying on the exchange
any ads sold through the exchange if you
click that opt-out button we won't have
any user data on you and neither will
they so now that opt-out manages to
apply much more globally and just as we
have the benefit to the buyers of only
having to go to one place we have the
benefit to you of one place well one
opt-out
will have a much greater effect across
the Internet
but it but we yes we do let people do
various tracking of you if you don't opt
out okay we the last question
dead rest google.com slash ads slash
preferences thank you a sort of a wonky
trading question do you see this
evolving from sort of this OTC situation
or the sort of very curated auction
system towards a sort of a central limit
order book with like basis stuff like
both machines on a futures market
obviously that's a great question
equities markets do you see a market of
markets each competing sort of liquidity
pools but what what you see and if you
do see that in the future how do you see
that evolving on what sort of timeline
do you see that at all I think that's a
that's a great question the exchange is
relatively a new concept in in in in ads
and from the name you you think about
future is right and in a way they're our
futures in advertising today you can buy
media in the future at a certain price
but the question becomes what's the
relationship between the price on the
spot market and the price on on the
futures market so many of us here have
done a lot of research to understand how
I seen could be related to one another
and whether we can expand the market
beyond what exactly as you described so
certainly there's a lot of effort on the
research side right now that is going
toward that if you want to add it I'll
just add that yeah I mean that's a great
question my favorite topic but the out
say it's early
Hector Nemo in life in itself yeah that
if you just look at it from historical
perspective the ad exchanges are
probably at the stage where you know
other financial markets were when they
were ten years old and it's evolving
much faster but we're still you know the
spot market is still new and then the
derivative markets are coming for sure
right the first commodity and financial
exchange happened around a thousand
years ago and then it got people
in England in the medieval days right so
advertising is a little bit younger
and wait till we get the futures market
crash and advertising when the
speculators jump into advertising prices
along a similar law vein you mentioned
dropping your latency down successively
it's going to very quickly get to a
point where you're going to have to talk
about hosting your correspondence in the
Google Data Centers Louis you're going
to hit the same problem the high
frequency boys and girls have that the
speed of light cannot be improved so for
people to get faster on the trigger
they're going to have to be sitting in
the next rack that's the closer question
and clearly there are a few people good
weather in New York from the financial
industry to answer your question yes and
we do have an effort underway to
facilitate on feeding on the Google
infrastructure or just using the Google
infrastructure for whatever you want and
maybe you'll use it for everything but
if you're an advertiser and you're
interested in something like that and
you should talk to your representative
and not not like congressman I mean like
think we're out of time but we're going
to stick around it's loud ask us a
question
hey also you can ask another question
question is how do you value the system
performance how do you value it how do
we evaluate it especially when you have
the automatic strategies how do you
compare with with any other system and
they're randomly throw up your throw up
advertisement to the publishers so we
obviously have metrics that we track on
the health of the change in the health
of the market but essentially we work
with our partners and our partners would
tell us this and you're doing a lousy
job here or doing a great job here and
this is why and we all kind of share a
common vision I think us and our
partners to make the market more
efficient better for the users better
for the web in in a way so we
we try to really live it for market
forces to dictate what's going on
my understanding is that you build a
very deterministic system and throw it
to the market and try the other part
into manual our quality and our speed
basically are the debate the best
indicators and our growth tells us
compared to our competitors yeah but but
if we're doing well or not don't look
into the competition too much we try to
build the best product we can and we try
to design the best product with
incentive compatibility and known kind
of exchange mechanism in place like
translation of languages between
participants keeping the people honest
and so on so there are a bunch of
exchange related the paradigms that work
across markets in the ads market is just
one of them my impressions that are you
talking about is for having a publisher
who you management so as an advertiser
if I buy a premium impressions is there
any quality control say we ability say
if I bid on a I don't care the powder
price I want to be on as high as I could
I want to get impressions is there any
quality control say I put on $30 but the
view our billing is only 50% like a name
is Chan or like who's under control
others so the publisher or say your
responsibility to make sure I get what I
pay for um so I think I think I think
there's a two question one to make sure
that you pay the real amount that the
two charge is actually the real the real
amount how can I validate the amounts
that's less than my bid price so um and
we do have a way that allows you to kind
of verify that the exchange is honest
and keeps track of and how much we say
you should pay is what what you pay and
there are ways that you as a buyer can
sample automatically and see if you know
I bid $2 obviously I'll win probably two
at the maximum of two dollars and I can
experiment
see that at least I bid less for Saturn
threshold and map map the landscape I'm
probably going to lose there's more
advanced research that you've done on
that a couple of years ago how to
validate that the auction integrity
actually applies and the highest bid
wins we give you a lot of information
back as a buyer or as a seller to
understand in just enough data without
revealing third party information that
the auction is needed a second priced
honest auction what about this the
scenario say the s not loading correctly
yeah and someone my impression that I've
been is actually not disturbed so I
don't like that so the way that we solve
that problem and that's a very real
problem that in many systems are the ID
server think that I deserve but if the
user did not really see anything in the
way that we do that on every other in
the exchange we add what we call a view
through call so we call back to our
server for every ad even if it's not
alone and after the ad was rendered see
if the other kind of left Tower oh that
would not show and we only charge it for
sure
to the best of our capability that the
ad is shown and that's I think it
differentiates us from from a few other
systems that make sense all right all
right so thank you so much for coming
today and listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
