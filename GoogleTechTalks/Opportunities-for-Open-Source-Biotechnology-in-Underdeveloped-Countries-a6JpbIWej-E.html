Nunez mukha from the parasite enzymology
lab and he's going to be talking to us
about the challenges of innovation in
developing countries Guido thank you
very much well I like to speak in this
afternoon about the science
intrapreneurship and innovation in
developing countries but I would like to
talk more than about abstract issues
about my personal experience and how has
been for my laboratory to develop
diagnostic al kids all the problems that
we have to endure and all the
opportunities that we have had and what
we would like to do in the future so
this is not going to be like an abstract
analysis what more a personal story
thank you well first I'd like to begin
with this this graphics therefore UNESCO
show the proportion of papers published
in different areas according to
different geographical regions it it is
clear that maybe sixty seventy to eighty
percent of the published papers come
from America and not North America
Europe and South Korea and Japan which
is here industrial Asia India and China
are considered in other Greek assault
regions and this these figures might
have changed because they are like
almost in years old but I don't think
that besides China and India the trains
are now very different than than what
they were so this is telling us that
more or less like twenty percent of love
the population of the planet pretty
creates like eighty percent of total
research and this is outstanding and
there are a lot of reasons of why this
is this way
but even more shocking it's other
patents disparities according to the
income of the countries i have here like
high-income countries have almost 350
patents per million people medium income
countries less than 10 and low-income
countries have zero patents in the other
case we could we could see that even if
if developing countries produce create a
bit of science they at least do
something science and they publish and
they can work on scientific issues but
when it comes to technological issues
measure as patents they are not doing
really we are not doing really well well
of course this is a this is a bit bias
because this is these are international
patents applications and patents are
expensive for people in undeveloped
countries well they are expensive even
for people here and you need in
universities special offices that take
care of that bureaucracy but we often
lack those mechanisms in undeveloped
countries I think a question I would
like to consider here if is the number
of scientists is determinant if there is
any relationship between the number of
scientists per capita and the number of
patents and it's a tough issue because
there doesn't seem to be a really clear
relationship for instance South Korea
that is has a less than 3,000 scientist
per capita per 1,000 people excuse me
has a very much higher rate than other
countries that has more countries / cap
more scientists per thousand people so
that this is this is clear it makes
clear here that
there are a lot of social cultural and
economic factors that affect the rate of
patents per million people no it's not
it doesn't depend only of the numbers of
scientists in society and there are
countries like Finland for instance that
I didn't but Finland here in the graph
because the situation is much more
complex then they have like almost 6000
scientists per thousand people oh sorry
if that's a mistake per million people
excuse me see the mistake ah but the
important thing here is that it is not
related directly to the number of of
people then we can ask what is affecting
the production of technology in
undeveloped countries well happy answer
for that could be that most of
underdeveloped countries rely on
economies dependent of raw materials and
they are very little diversified for
instance my country Venezuela we rely
only in oil and several other minerals
that are raw materials we support we
lack even the most basic industrial
infrastructure even a bolt sometimes
cannot be built in Venezuela if we need
a special boat sometimes we have to ask
it a to another country even if labor is
cheap in Venezuela industrialized labor
is scarce most of labor forces in the
services sector other countries rely on
agriculture and what what happens with
this that raw materials can be extracted
with very few technology that is very
specialized for instance after the
political problems that we had in
Venezuela many of our oil engineers were
fired by our government and they easily
found
work elsewhere in and foreign companies
so it's not that the quality of the
human resources in undeveloped countries
is not good or is inferior to the
quality of human resources in developed
countries well here we can see here at
Google have people from all over the
world things have changed things since a
lot of things a long time ago and we
have a better educational systems all
over the place but even 30 years ago a
lot of East Asians and South Asians were
coming to America and a lot of South
American people also we're coming here
and they proved that they were good
scientist we're good engineer so it's
not maybe it's not education what's
missing here a very important obstacle
to innovation here is lack of anything
industrial and technological
infrastructure for doing new things
things which are new it can be we could
be done here in America or in Europe in
a start-up are very difficult to do and
here it comes the personal experience
here is the check it the pains and joys
of innovation in my laboratory we have
developed the first one hundred percent
Venezuela and diagnostic al kid it's it
diagnosis chagas disease and as you can
see here we don't have like high-tech
facilities it's it relies heavily on on
monotonous work that may be here could
be automatic we don't have the resources
for that but as labor is cheap they're
even specialized labor we can keep the
cost down the check as disease is a
disease that affects around 20 million
people in Latin America and every year
100,000 people gets infected it is
lethal around three percent of times and
it kills people
around 30 years after the initial
infection the point here is that it
means people it makes it makes people
unable for physical labor like a long
time before they're dead so if they are
pissants they rely on physical labor and
and they're sorts of think on depend on
physical labor and when they can do it
they be kind of born into a family and
they end up even poorer than they were
before so this is a very nasty and very
important this is to in Latin America
current diagnostic methods are not are
not good and they give cross reactions
when people have for instance
leishmaniasis or TV they could get
wrongly a diagnosis of chagas disease or
sometimes the methods are not sensitive
enough to detect the disease so people
the people get a sauna whether they have
a medical condition that can kill them
and even if there are no pharmaceutical
here's for the disease people can get
tango frequent frequency to the doctor
and get checking and get their heart
checked so they have a better quality of
life we decide to create these
diagnostic kits because foreign kids are
of good quality but they are too
expensive they could be like a ten to
twenty dollars per some per sample we we
created these diagnostic on kids and the
cause of every blood sample to analyze
every blood sample including labor is
less than one dollar although bio bio
chemical reagents are made in Venezuela
the antibodies the recombinant antigens
are made in Venezuela but we had to go
through a lot of things to finally make
this possible the kid is bigger is it's
being marketed this summer as I'm here I
suppose that the first units have been
shipped but it could be don't even last
the
what happened that the easiest part of
all this was biotechnology it could be
maybe this is a more complex part
technologically speaking but things as
simple as these glass vials to build
them in Venezuela it was hell to get a
simple plastic box that contains the the
kid it was totally impossible it was the
last thing we keep to do why because in
Venezuela as I told you and that's true
for a lot of countries in Latin America
and for the love countries over all
around the world we have no industrial
resources no industrial infrastructure
so even casting and you a new mode for
special plastic it's something very very
difficult there are there is only one
company that does it in Venezuela we
cannot go elsewhere because costs go up
and we have we're trying to keep this
cheap for people and for our government
so we what we have here is a situation
where know where the specialized labor
no specializes methods are not the most
difficult part of creating the startup
as the opposite here in America another
problem that we have is that regions are
take very long time extremely long time
to arrive for instance at hear any of
you worked in the biological sector any
scientist here any scientist here how
many days if you are the region today
when you will have it
okay when we are there a region in
Venezuela it can take as long as six
months that's the average time if we are
extremely unlucky it can take nine
months 10 months it's very difficult for
us and this is not only because lack of
free commerce and and customs and the
existence of costumes on taxes but also
because as the market for that is very
small and there are only very few
companies who can who has the license to
export regions from America to other
countries they have like a virtual
monopoly and they don't offer good
service they can they can they can be as
slow as they want they can be
incompetent and we have to buy things to
them when we try to get around regions
by an online using an American credit
card and buying the region's to American
than shipping us to Venezuela the
company did a background a background
check in on the address we were shipping
to and they refuse to ship the three
unions the reasons were not dangerous
bacteria was not evil a virus it was
pure protein from from milk from cows
milk that's it something as harmless as
that cool not bishop so then we tried
with a person here in America for that
person to buy the yridians and then to
get to the to his home and then that
person will ship it was it could not be
done because they background check and
they found that that person is not a
biologist nada que me so they refused
finally we tried to we try to get a
chemist but they did background checking
they found that that chemist was not a
working chemist so the reef finally we
gave up we had to go through the regular
channels and we lost five months
of time and that's that's only one
sample of what's going on here what was
going on there all the time concerning
in the transit times it's very difficult
for us but in this part of that that
makes what my more creative we try to
implement we try to create alternatives
so when we run out of a product we try
to explore other ways to achieve the
same result but as this has to be
standardized it we accept that we have
this result and we only we have set this
result that we have here and we only
purchase in advance and we try to
calculate when we are going to run off
reagents sadly and work a very
particular trait that we have in
undeveloped countries is that patents
and copyrights are not enforced this is
a mini mark and mini pilot movie market
and this is a rather small one from
things what I have seen it I've seen
stand with paranoia is more or less the
room of the size of this room filled
from top to bottom with a pirate movies
and no one really cares probably this
poll is there are only checking what are
they going to take for free so that is a
problem when they fall in a well a
problem an opportunity for innovation
because if you issue a pattern no one is
going to respect it no one is going to
honor it and you could get all your work
we replicated and they will not pay
royalties to you here maybe because it's
very impractical we have a lot of
problems with crime we have a lot of
problems with a corruption so how
authorities are not going to pursue
patent violations it's science fiction
so we have to rely on secrecy
unfortunately but that also makes and
creates opportunity why because if we
could share costs if we will create
communities of development as companies
know that the their patents are not
going to be enforced certain new method
or new machines could be used to build
new communities what are the
opportunities for biotechnology well on
there are lots of Roman needs in health
care livestock management and impede
humanity test for several conditions are
not cumbersome and expensive and
sometimes not apply it at all for
instance before our our kid was released
chagas disease was not tell it wasn't
test for in blood bank so there was a
small percentage of transmission of the
disease because of tainted blood a new
generation of cheap test will be adapted
immediately by public and private
healthcare systems as in fact happened
with our kids out for ADIZ in hospitals
are waiting for a kid to in begin to
implementing mandatory testing for blood
for checking cc's as it is on ray 48 and
none other diseases currently test for
livestock diseases are expensive
inaccurate and slow results can take
weeks so farmers can the cows are just
going to die and the farmers will find
that this is the cow died like one month
after ricotta it's it's very it's very
slow and it's very ineffective so
farmers are have a lot of money and
they're willing to pay for new test one
good thing that we achieve with the
building with the creation of this check
it is that now we have our
infrastructure for biology and we have
we known how to make antibodies how to
stabilize antibodies and allow for
things if so we can create easily
I know a kid's for another diseases you
only have to find the antigen which is a
rather rather slow process and can be
cumbersome but sometimes it doesn't have
to be that way so we have a lot of
though a lot of way already advanced it
and if we decide to release these basic
tools for creating other kids other
people could do it and as they're huge
and there are off Ormet needs we can we
unload in our laboratory we cannot and
Design kits for all the possible
diseases that we could do so this could
be an opportunity for open source
biotechnology another opportunity for
biotechnology that here is not only
important for people in undeveloped
countries but also for people in
developed countries because we live in a
global H now and everybody seems to be
traveling all over is that the emergence
of new viruses for instance in Venezuela
in the plains we have the one editor
virus which is a hemorrhagic virus we'd
have a fairly high lethality and the
death rate is around thirty percent I
think and if this virus spreads out it
could be very dangerous the same way
than other viruses in Africa like Ebola
or rift fever so this sign of cheap
quick new test cool offer an opportunity
to do sampling of permanent sampling of
the areas which we know are endemic for
virus in in order to detect the
outbreaks before they spread now we're
we have been speaking about trends in
in diagnostic basis on proteins we
haven't spoken about trends in DNA
because currently DNA amplifier machines
the PCR machines are very expensive for
standards of develop undeveloped
countries so we can see here that the
number of sequences that indan gene and
gene bank which is the database where
sequence DNA sequences are stored has
been growing almost exponentially at the
same time the cost of self sequence
sequencing and synthesizing DNA has been
dropping a drop in and these figures are
three years old four years old and so
the cost must be even lower now and
there should be even more sequences now
ten years ago we only need we didn't
even have the human genome well sequence
now we have like 300-400 genomes I don't
remember the exact figure but we have a
lot of genome sequences already and the
speed is increasing so DNA more than
proteins could be the future of
biotechnology for diagnostic health
purposes coupe and could be even cheaper
and what is the proposal for open source
by biotechnology well when I was he up
here in California last year I went to
the tech museum and I saw this i saw
that small child they're doing molecular
biology that that child could be like
five or six years old and he was
creating very easily for him of course
there was a rack of petra dishes there
and there were as solutions so the kid
was just spreading like the solution the
DNA the bacteria over the petri dish and
put it on the stove and next day he went
to internet and he checked his green
fluorescent bacteria bacteria glow in
the dark I
that when I was 20 years old in college
so people do not need to know the basic
foundations of knowledge in molecular
biotechnology to get useful results this
is very important and the same way that
a person coder doesn't have to know
quantum electrodynamics and electronic
to create good programs people could use
these new biotechnological tools to
create to create their own solutions to
their very local problems that probably
they don't have a big market share
enough to justify a perfect excuse me
too don't have a market share enough to
that it will give them enough to create
a company or to get venture capital but
if these chips get really really tool
these tools get really really cheap they
could do it for instance in the other
picture we have like this new DNA
amplifier machine the total cost of this
machine is ten dollars current machines
are costs around two to three hundred to
three thousand dollars they are too
expensive for us in the developing
country which is which is the proposal
here designing the primates the DNA
primers is not really it's not a really
cumbersome process it could be done in
one day designing a primer for diagnosis
analysis what is a primary a primary SAT
DNA's a DNA sequence a very short
sequence around 20 nucleotides 20 weight
basis and it could be if you have the
genome on a online or on a database that
many genomes of diseases there are
online you could design with only a
computer and access to internet your
primary then you cool synthesizes and as
the cost of DNA synthesis are going down
it could be fairly cheap even for people
in undeveloped country soap
if we could distribute these machines
they are cheap enough for there being
one in every even small village hospital
so the Regents could be cheap too
because the reunions are are not a pet
are the paint that the patent expired
for the enzymes that make it possible
and all the reagents are could be
manufactured locally distributed locally
and it could drop the drive down the
prices in any case with this machine
this machine school also be connected to
the internet and they run up and you
just don't let download the program for
the region sir and you have your results
in 30 minutes I suppose it has one or
two hours as now so these machines are
even not only cheaper but faster than
current Peter DNA amplifying machines so
the proposal could be that you could
build around this machine a community of
developers in biotechnology because the
developing is not really expected it's
not really expensive or difficult what
what is difficult here the trials of the
new diagnostic method and that's why it
is an advantage to do to do this in on
the well in undeveloped countries
because the burden of regulation is a
lot less strict than here in the United
States or in Europe regulation is almost
non-existent and they ask for very
little for very little proof so you can
market your test with medication is
another issue but with the diagnostic of
test it cooled alone and even in the
case of livestock there is no there is
even less regulation that for that for
trials for diagnostic methods for people
so a net word of users of these machines
will allow us to distribute clinical
trials of math diagnostic methods so it
could spread it we would spread the
burden and as there is a physical part
of this that has to be synthesized and
primary synthesis is still is still not
cheap enough to have a primary DNA
synthesizer in every village or every
hospital the revenue of the cause the
revenue of the of the new test could be
distributed among those who are willing
to to make the trials so this could be a
new model and mix of open source and
co-op model that I think that could only
be successful in developing countries I
don't think it would be successful here
because of patents and because of
boredom regulation but once this system
is starts to yield results f and if the
speed of approval of new tests and speed
of approval of a spill of creation of
the test because we have a bizarre model
here going on and we have a lot of
people working different issues I think
that once it is going on it will be used
as a as a template for older models that
could be working here and by the time
begins to your results technology will
make this kind of stuff even cheaper and
I think that could be a very good
approach for open source biotechnology
now I'm going to speak about that a case
that really moved me that is about the
farmers of gujarat Gujarat is a state in
India where there are a lot of cotton
plantations
the company Monsanto tried to get
approval of for their bt cotton that is
a transgenic genetically modified khodam
that is resistant to pesticides around
2002 they started the trials in in the
field but the Indian government refused
the permit refuse to allow the the big
cotton to be sold to farmers on grounds
of environmental dangers hypothetical
environmental risks a couple of years
later well the problem with this bt
cotton is that those are varieties
release it here in the United States
they are adapted to these whether they
are adapted to this kind of soil and
they are not adapted to the farmers
conditions so it's like a sander variety
and Monsanto is not going to invest more
to adapt that to adapt that variety to
Gujarat what happened a couple of years
later a then Monsanto realized that
there were some crops some conquer up
some corn fields that would seem to be
resistant to the two day insecticide so
when they took this plant and their
analyze DNA they found that those were
hybrids of the original BTW plants they
they found they were hybrids of or the
original BTW plants with plants from
gujarat and therefore they were best
suited to the environment to that
whether to that soil but also they had
the gene that made the plants resistant
so they were doing better than
indigenous varieties why because they
were resistant to the to the insecticide
and therefore which will be eliminated
more quickly but they were also doing
better than the Bt cotton than the
original bt cotton because they were
suited for the
that environment Monsanto tried to sue
the farmers but it wasn't successful
because there were so many of them that
it was just pointless and the Indian
government later tried to avoid the the
spreading of these plants but they were
also successful because these plants do
much better than either variety and
farmers are happy with them they have
they have better yields around thirty or
forty percent and the the the picture
down there the blue the blue package
it's a package of seeds of these hybrid
seeds well you see that the work best
has the B and the T letters highlighted
right they are not saying that this is
bt cotton birthday that's a way of
saying and it's it says F one that is in
Mendelian genetics is a term for the
first generation of hybrids so they are
implying without telling us explicitly
to avoid to be to avoid being sued by
Monsanto prosecuted by the Indian
government well that was some years ago
now they are not being prosecuted that's
a way of telling the other farmers that
those are hybrid seeds that will perform
better and this chip by the way we're
way cheaper than Monsanto seeds so this
is a very exciting for me this is a very
exciting example of what people could do
when they are given the tools we have
been relying on scientists and engineers
to cover our our needs of innovation in
the last couple of one of the last
couple of centuries but we are are all
homo sapiens the man that knows I think
that it's an intrinsic trade in in us to
be able to create to be able to do new
things and finally we have tools cheap
enough that will elope allow people even
in the pool
replace to solve their problems no
matter if they are if those problems are
not profitable for from others those
prongs could ease up with cheap tools
and they have to and they want to solve
it because they have the interest in
solving the problems so I think that is
it this example is a only a taste of the
things to come and it shows that people
they don't need to get a formal
education to be creative and to be
innovative and despite although all the
problems that we have in the undeveloped
countries despite all of these all these
problems what I said before I think that
things are going to change things will
change if these tools are available we
only have to look the way Europe was
like 200 years ago and we only have to
look Europe now and we have seen that
what a mankind can achieve is wonderful
once it was thought that not everybody
can learn to write and read they thought
that the people in the elite they used
to say that pissants didn't need that
now in Western societies we have like
literacy rate of more than ninety five
percent that I would have shot too many
of that people now we've been told or a
lot of people thinks anyway that
innovation is only it's only feasible
and possible for a few chosen ones I
don't think that I don't be I don't
believe that and I think that all of
these tools we have now and the tools
that we have in the future will change
things and they will be more efficient
for an environment that has a lot of
problems there are very serious but that
can be solved but also has a lot of
opportunities thank you very much
we have Howie how easy will be trading
inside South America we have a number of
free trade agreements and we're on the
way of making borders less cumbersome
for commerce and for people and right
now is is fairly easy to trade inside
South America the main problem is not
the trade itself but distribute
distribution channels because as private
companies that they have a very I have a
very restricted list of products and
they are only carrying their product and
the public sector the government
sometimes is not interested in to this
or any knee an initiative for instance
from the Venezuelan government will be
only distributed in Venezuelan we will
have to look for other distributors so
the no distribution channels are harder
that's the main problem rather than the
than the tariffs and taxes between
countries
one has been my our experience with a
government and the challenges or under
help we have had from them right so far
the government has helped us a lot in
some ways but also the bureaucracy has
been a really really difficult issue
because there are a lot of offices and
they approved the money but then someone
then it's it stays in an office for a
month and it for an ornament that's a
very hard issue we have had approval
from the government and actually the the
funding that we got for this project it
was a very interesting method because it
was a event venture capital from the
government they are expecting us to
create a company and to share the
revenue when with them this they didn't
give to us I will just say garant less
money or ask or funding for free but
they they want a part of revenue of the
of this company that we have now and we
have a company and the next step is that
it will be my job my future hopefully
will be with the revenue of this company
create a new company totally independent
from the government and self-funded or
the self-funded or funded from the
revenue from the check it concerning
political views in Venezuela right now
it's very very it's a very sensitive
issue if you're working with the
government and
your political position and is not the
same than the government mostly you can
have a funding or you can have other
help or a kinds of help but you could
find with stubborn people that will make
things difficult for you if they find
that you oppose the government but so
far it has been even if most of the
people in my laboratory up we're not
sympathetic to the government to say in
a polite way we have a we're working
together and that's what matters
