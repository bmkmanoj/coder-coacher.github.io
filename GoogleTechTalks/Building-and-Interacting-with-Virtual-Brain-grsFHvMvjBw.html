a project we've been working on for
about seven years called the virtual
brain it's part of an international
collaboration amongst about 10 different
universities spread across North America
Europe and as well as in Australia and
there's two sections to the talk one is
primarily focused on theory an
application and the last price focus
more on sort of the next phases for the
project so hopefully they'll make sense
to you if I guess we should wait for
questions till after talker you want or
drain a talk whatever just so the
outline of talk basically the first part
dimension is talking about the theory in
the architecture underlying the the
platform and then some applications the
first application looking you would have
called resting state networks in the
brain for those of you who know of
neuroscience literature there's been a
lot of buzz right now about what what
what to bring doing you're not doing
anything and this is called resting
state networks has been discovered quote
unquote using functional MRI and there's
really some questions as to what does it
actually represent these resting state
patterns and that leads into an
exploration of the internal noise in the
brain finding out the actually the noise
near Ben is quite an important feature
of enabling your brain to actually
explore what it's capable of doing but
also maintaining brain health and then
it's not obvious extension then to the
application for understanding brain
damage and disease and then the last
part is this is a new project that's
using the virtual brain of sort of a
broader sort of social not neuroscience
experiment called my virtual dream and
I'll spend about 5-10 minutes on that
time permitting so when you ask people
how the brain works you get a variety of
responses depending on the profession of
the person an app that answers the
question there's some nice cartoons that
represents sort of stylized versions of
that you've got the guy plugging in
wires in the brain and depending on how
cheeky the person this is asking how
does the brain work you can see it works
very hard this is generating a lot of
sweat if you go across the history of
neuroscience again is a broad range of
what people think is happening when the
brain is generating cognitions emotions
consciousness and so on and right now I
think
the major focus on brain function and
how we think it really works is that at
some sort of network property that the
brain is a series of connected systems
and their connections are at mediate
different forms of cognition so now
we're talking about brain function as
emerging from different network
operations but these areas work together
to instantiate different kinds of mental
functions it's kind of obvious in some
ways if you look at the architecture of
the brain that there's something
important about connections this slide
here is actually a real brain from made
Atlas from Des areen done about 1920 and
that's just the blunt dissection of a
cadavers brain you see the very nice
fiber tracts that are coursing around
the different parts of the brain these
days we have the capacity to measure
these tracks at least in principle in
living tissue in a brain and a human
when they're sitting inside an MRI
scanner using techniques called
diffusion tensor imaging or diffusion
spectrum imaging which is sensitive to
water flow through tissues in the brain
and the assumption is that that water
flow tell us about the direction of
fibre pathways in the brain so you can
actually get something that looks sort
of like that from using DTI and dsi data
so you can measure connections you can
measure networks in the brain and
certainly there are now an explosion of
methods that are available to help us
measure and quantify network operations
in the human brain EEG fMRI we can this
is an fMRI scan this is again another
representation of diffusion tensor scan
and now is also an explosion of
informatics architecture that are used
to try and pull these things together X
naught has once been developed out in
East Coast but there are other
variations of these databases that allow
into puleeze data with the idea of
trying to have some sort of sensical
confluence of these things created from
these intersections analytically there's
a lot of new methods that are evolved
certainly in some of the conference's
involved in imaging about half of the
presentations are focused on data
analysis it's been a massive increase in
that across the domains this is a
representation of these resting state
networks I'll talk a bit more about
later using
independent components analysis so where
we at with this I mean this has been
going on now for arguably about 20 years
and the question is how far we really
gotten in terms understanding how the
brain works we can get a lot of data
from an individual it used to be about
three gigabytes now we're getting into
hundreds of gigabytes and probably up to
the terabyte level in terms of the
information you can gather from one
person's brain that's only in one
session you can imagine if you're
attractive person across time it
explodes tremendously arguably I think
the computational architectures are up
to up to up to speed in terms of being
able to pull these kinds of data
together whether you talk about high
performance systems in-house or cloud
computing and so on there are software
as well as hardware that are able to
least pull these data in some reasonable
way but the real problem is that we're
still focused on single studies single
exemplars of how the brain works instead
of looking at how does the same things
in my head do everything that I can do I
can see I can smell like and walk I can
talk I can eat I can usually talk and so
on I sleep I eat whatever all those
things happen in my hit in the same
brain but most studies actually focus on
a single function it's really the
question is what's unique about the
functional and structural architecture
my brain that allows me to do that
plethora of things that I can do and
that's where this virtual brain project
came into play is that it it provides
that means of taking large sets of data
and trying to merge them to understand
what is it about the function structure
confluence in a brain that allows this
plethora of things to operate this gives
you a overview of sort of the workflow
for the virtual brain platform I'll give
you a bit more details in the
architecture in the next slide the idea
basically is you start with data you
measure on an individual you can get a
person's cortical surface you can get a
measure of their connections for example
using diffusion tensor diffusion
spectrum imaging using their actual
geometry you can generate local
population dynamics based on derivations
to
give you mean field approximation for
populations of neurons in each part of
the brand you can parcel it however you
want you can make regions of interest
you can make a large surface wave a
continuous chink can use the changing
populations of neurons so this
represents sort of the underlying
architecture in structural sense the
platform also allows you to stimulate
nodes whether you do it for example
using TMS transcranial magnetic
stimulation or stimulation as you might
actually seen an experiment so do visual
stimulation auditory stimulation and so
on and then generate what we actually
measure from your brain whether it be
local field potentials if we can stick
it electrode in your head or EEG emmy
gee or generating fMRI bold signals as
well and then it completes the cycle
going back then to the empirical data to
make sure that the models reproducing at
accurately what we've measured in your
brain this is sort of the core
architecture of the brain this this is a
paper that we submitted to frontiers and
their informatics is under review right
now it should be through the pipeline in
about a month or so the core really is
the simulator that takes a wide range of
knowledge that's been accumulated over
the years about how to measure how to
generate veridical activity from
populations of neurons that you actually
would measure so various types of
approximation so Wilson Cowen Fitzhugh
nagumo I can give you a list of the
different different equations that are
in that particular simulator so there's
ways you can measure population dynamics
various forms that you can capture the
structural connectivity based on the
weights the distances between nodes and
the matrix how fast the information is
transferred as well as how strong the
connections are in the matrix you have
surface dynamics the generators
themselves the integrators what's
monitor in terms of the the data that's
generated you g m-e gene bold and then
stimulation parameters all this thing
gets written out to either your local
computer you can save it to another
format if you'd like it's written in
Python right now the license is a GPL
version to the map the platform itself
is scalable and modular I can run it on
my laptop I can
run it on a large cluster I can run it
on UNIX Windows Mac whatever you want
and it runs under OpenGL primarily this
is a screen capture of the interface the
the core of it is the simulator is a
simulator cockpit that allows you then
to set the parameters in this screen the
connections how the connections are
modulated etc and then what you want to
measure from that model EG time series
you have the connection matrix here some
bold data here as well as some analysis
that can be done principal components
analysis for a transfer and so on that's
what you would see if you're generating
either cortical surface field potentials
as well as the bold we generated through
this module you can visualize it you can
also dump it out to a file for data
analysis this is showing you the EEG
generation there's a 32-channel cap on
this virtual brain now generating the
cortical EEG signals these are just some
very coarse videos that show you some
approximations the virtual monkey brain
is a virtual fMRI study so we took
macaque essentially and threw them into
a scanner and that would be the activity
would you would generate in this virtual
monkey brain on the other side is
cortical surface EEG if you actually
script away the skull and put a cog
which you actually do for example
pre-surgical mapping that would be the
pattern which you would get from this
virtual brain and they're pretty
pictures too so you have that kind of
aesthetic aspect to it so the nice thing
about this platform is because it's
using empirical data as the basis to
generate the model you can go back and
forth between the model and the
simulation to see what is it that's
critical in the model to make my data
fit what actually measure in the
individual so for example here is a some
data from I think there were 100
subjects in this particular one looking
at the anatomical matrix that's sort of
the average across as individuals in
terms of the connection weights
the distances between nodes and the
matrix and the directionality informed
by some other anatomical databases and
then the overall pattern of functional
connections or correlations between time
series of these different nodes in the
empirical data and then the
corresponding simulated data from that
model the correlation coefficient
between these two matrices is about
point four seven so it's not too bad we
could certainly improve that and down
here you see that the range of fits that
one can get it's probably hard to see
the numbers but basically there's the
range of the correlation values that you
can get across different parameters
ations of the model this papers now I
think in available online of brain
connectivity journal and it goes through
this whole process of how you generate
these models and do the empirical fits
back to the data that's a example from
fMRI this is an example from EEG if you
do cortical source modeling and then fit
the model sources to the empirical data
these are some examples of fits you get
again they're quite remarkably close see
I'm going to forget which red and blue
is here i think the blue is real data
and the red is the simulated data to the
different cortical sources in about a
one-second snip and you see the variety
of different fits are all pretty good
actually rather high remarkably so given
this is a relatively simple model but
again the ideas go back and forth now
and see what are the parameters that
either change to get this model fit my
date and that helps you understand what
are the critical features and then bring
that allowed this these dynamics to
emerge
those are resting state there's a series
of stays in it right now that we're
using I'm somatosensory stimulation as
well as mapping it back to what we see
with TMS for instance so I'm going to go
through now some examples as I mentioned
in terms of the empirical applications
to resting state anatomy to
understanding the importance of noise
and finally the impact of lesions is
that my coffee thank you to keep the
caffeine levels that have constant
otherwise all so as I mentioned before
resting state dynamics is a big area in
neuroscience right now everybody and
their dogs using these resting state
networks for trying to understand what's
going on the brain at least that's the
idea this is a paper that was published
a few years back just showing that
across a large sample you get fairly
reliable estimates of resting state
networks in the brain using an appended
components analysis but I would argue so
at this point we really don't understand
what are these reflecting is this simply
sort of structured noise is it something
that's really important in terms of the
brain dynamics or is it something that
sort of artifact of fMRI for instance
which would be a bad thing for the
investment in fMRI of course so there is
some suggestion from from empirical work
that there's some dependency of the
patterns of functional connections that
being the correlation amongst these
areas and the underlying structural
connections so that in some respects
resting state was reflecting what you
see in terms of brain connections the
actual structural architecture of the
brain and every simple study was done by
my gracious just up the road I guess it
would be fine there's a fairly good
correspondence of what you see between
using diffusion tensor imaging and the
areas that are functionally connected in
the resting state but it's not perfect
and it's not always direct maybe sort of
indirect connection which you kind of
would expect in the brain where you have
both direct and indirect influences but
it's not the case that it's a one-to-one
mapping between if there's a structural
connection this can be
tional connection that's certainly what
we found when you started doing the
models and this is a paper that Chris
honey from our collaborative network
published a few years back just looking
at both empirical measures between the
resting-state functional connections and
the structural connections method
measure with DTI and then taking that
same anatomical framework and then
generating brain dynamics and finding
again that the correlation is high but
not perfect actually far from perfect at
1.44 so by measuring resting state
networks you can get some idea of the
underlying structure architecture but
it's not completely deterministic just
something else it's missing in our
capacity understand what the resting
state networks are actually reflecting
that's what led to the next series of
studies that while there is a structure
function link part of thing is missing
an understanding these dynamics is the
fact that the brain is a noisy
biological system but that this noise
may actually quite important in enabling
reasonable dynamics to emerge and also
to enable a broad functional repertoire
of the system to emerge this is a very
simple example showing you the kinds of
dynamics you get from a single
oscillator when you add noise with no
noise you ping it it oscillates and then
dies you had small noise it doesn't die
quite as fast if you put a relatively
large amount of noise it shows you
dynamics as you might see if you
actually stuck an electrode in that
oscillator if you put these oscillators
in a broader network and then scale
things like the velocity of the
connection and the connection strengths
as sort of a sweet spot in that
parameter space you start getting
interesting dynamics emerging that are
in this what's called a stability
diagram basically looking at where do
you get the transition from quiescence
to oscillatory phenomena and that's
these parts of this stability diagram
here right in that sweet spot you see
through here
it's kind of interesting what you find
then when you start doing these these
games with the noise is once it gets to
that point of unstable part of the
system it puts ghost notes called the
metastable state metastable state is
basically that the system has multiple
configurations that it can take at any
given point in time multiple attractor
landscapes to use the vernacular of
nonlinear dynamical systems and what you
find is that the system seems to
establish explore these possible
configurations when it has both optimal
connection strength velocity and
importantly noise noise here is very
simple noise it's just basically a white
noise added to each individual annoyed
note node but of course when you put in
the network and be multiplicative and
much more nonlinear in terms of resting
state networks interesting thing is that
the areas that seem to be the ones that
carry the system through from this
quiescent state to the unstable
oscillatory phenomena are the ones that
are associated the default mode of the
network as well which are highlighted
here in these red balls that's a very
simple network kind of a cool insight
but again relatively simple way of
incorporating function structure to get
you new insights on how these dynamics
emerge that we measure in the human
brain we can get even more complicated
now try to get a better handle on what
is it that's happening up with these
intersections between connections
velocity and noise something specific
about having the brain at this point in
this metastable state that allows it to
respond in some optimal way so we can
make a more much more complicated model
having again a more detailed
tractography measure we'd get now
instead of 70 or some odd nodes you get
hundreds or thousands of nodes generate
the simulated bold and measure the
functional connections in the simulated
data as well as the empirical data so
that's what's shown in this triangle
here and do the correlations across
different parameter spaces to see where
does this correlation become maximal in
the possible parameter space that we can
search
in this relatively simple model so it's
shown in this slide and it's a bit
complicated so I'll just go through it
relatively slow this does say something
about having the bridge on the edge of
instability that's been used a lot and
if you talk about nonlinear dynamics in
the brain this idea the brain is on the
edge has been put out quite a bit but
this is actually why it's action on the
edge this is what we're trying to show
you now so in this column here on the
left side of the slide what I'm showing
you the top is the correlation between
the empirical and the functional
connections as a function of the
strength of coupling in the simulated
network you see as we go across the
x-axis that the correlations rise to a
peak at about 2.5 in terms of the
coupling strength and then drop
precipitously after that point if you
measure the phase space of this system
you find that the number of attractors
will change as you go across these
connections links as well so you go from
a fairly trivial spontaneous state where
you have a single attractor as you get
to this point where you start having a
rise again in the correlations you get a
bifurcation where you get multiple
attractors in this new part of the phase
space you get to a peak point then all
of a sudden the system collapses again
into the single attractor which kind of
makes sense because you figure if you
get to a point where everything is very
strongly coupled you'll have a single
system essentially so where is this
sweet spot where you get to this point
we're at the coalition's maximal at that
point we tried to do now is say okay now
that's telling us something about where
do we actually produce the empirical
data is best we possibly can there's
some peak in that thing there's
something to do with how the system now
responds that once that makes it want to
stay in that particular location and
this slide here this other column shows
you the response now to stimulation of
this model when you go across that part
of this other space you find that in
this area a that the response to v1
activation this is reaction time in the
system is actually slow relativity if
you get to this peak right here where
the reaction time goes down so just the
system is actually able to optimally
respond to incoming stimuli what's right
on the edge of that point okay so
something actually quite important about
being on the edge it allows assistant to
both explore potential States exploring
Democrat patois r but also when there is
a perturbation the system can quickly
switch and adapt the networks to respond
optimally to that perturbation now
quickly there have been series of
studies that have done with my group
looking at whether there is in fact
noise in the brain that's important in
terms of understanding how cognition
emerges so the first thing we found was
that if noise is important it should
change as you mature make some sense we
actually found is that as you mature the
noise in your brain from being kids to
adults actually goes up instead of going
down so I'm showing you here is noise
estimates based on single trial EEG data
in kids from 8 to 15 and then adults and
the red indicates that there's more
variability there's more noise in the
single trial data so you see that this
is pre-stimulus and post stimulus in an
EEG study that the noise across the
groups is actually higher as they mature
and there's actually also a drop in the
noise when this thing was introduced
suggesting a very deterministic response
in the system when you're younger is you
get older you get a more multi
confidential more complex response in
the system the neat thing is that if you
correlate the estimates of noise with
performance you find that noisier brains
actually perform better as well in this
particular sample I won't go into detail
you can look at this afterwards
obviously the top slide just shows you a
negative correlation between noise and
the stability of your response its
ability of reaction time as you're
pressing a button in a very simple
memory task yeah
for pre and post-training for a complex
task like someone said your music
training or a year of I have it for
shorter shorter duration task we're
looking at not music but actually
acquiring information about a visual
representation and that you find that
noise will go up as they learn
association then as you learn more it
will reduce in certain areas and
continue to grow in other parts of the
brain party performance here this is a
what should I give you more information
it's a one back memory task they see a
series of phases and all there has to do
is say that that face you see now match
the one you saw before and so the two
performance measures were reaction time
variability of reaction time and the
accuracy of the performance in the task
there's no correlation of these measures
with mean reaction time there's a
negative correlation to the variance of
reaction time so the more noise the more
stably reaction time is and also there's
a positive correlation with accuracy so
the more noise you have the more
accurate you are doing this task it's
kind of paradoxical but it actually if
you think about again that there's this
highly nonlinear system that has to do
all this kind of stuff and looking
different configurations the noise
actually might be adaptive in this case
to allow you to have that capacity to
look at different possible
configurations that can ensue that was
some kids we replicated that in infants
as well as other studies looking at kids
with different technologies we're now
looking at aging and for those of us who
are aging it just to indicate that
age-related changes and noise don't
always go in one direction that
something goes up some goes down and it
looks like those of us who actually do
have changes in noise in certain areas
do better I'm ultimately than those who
don't this figure is done using fMRI and
what you find the variance of the bowl
signal as you age goes down in these
medial areas which are typically again
default mode regions whereas the areas
in red will tend to go up in terms of
their variance I'm with age but the
degree of changes in these areas
actually again cause with behavior in
this situation
pardon me sorry which which which this
one here sorry these are Lisa H over
here and across here is the standard
deviation of a sort of composite score
across the brain so each point is an
individual subject there is because no
there's no people between 40 and 50 in
our sample because they work you don't
come in to get scan they have day jobs
we also looked at whether the noise
scales with task and we found that
individuals in the larger sample the
more that you're the higher the noise
you have they actually more you're able
to switch Network configurations as you
go across different tasks so those who
have who were in the sample either
younger faster or more consistent in
their behavior we're also those that
tended to switch the noise
characteristics of their brain and doing
these tasks where those are tended to be
older or slower or less consistent had
less change in the noise profiles with
task now I want you to keep in mind that
this is what's in a healthy population
I'm not saying that always having more
noise is good you can envision a
scenario we have too much noise what
actually does that pushes you out of the
capacity to have this nice attractor
landscape or the converse is having too
little noise in which case you have a
flat terrain with not much going on so
it's sort of a sweet spot in the sense
having an optimal amount of noise allows
the system to both respond but also to
explore potential configurations explore
what's called a repertoire yeah
it's a good question that's always come
up when I give this presentation is what
is your definition of noise is it a bad
thing or is a good thing there's a paper
that was published in Nature Reviews
neuroscience fear is backed by wolpert's
group talking about levels of noise in
the nervous system you find that there's
there's because it's biological system
not perfect you do have a lot of slop in
this system imprecision sand channel
openings precision and synaptic release
and so on whether that's noise in the
sense of noise is a bad thing or noise
in the sense of an actual evolutionary
adaptation we have no idea this is the
fact the fact the matter is it is this
stochastic process that's in the brain
that seems to have some functional
relevance and what for lack of better
term were going to call it noise for now
okay applications to patient studies
this is a really severe lesion this is
actually in the virtual brain interface
what we've done is taken a connection
matrix and blast it out the entire left
prefrontal cortex so you can see in the
connection matrix over here there's all
these gray squares and then in the 3d
representation it's a chunk of tissue
mission seldom are lesions that clean in
reality but this is just sort of it give
you an example of what you can do in the
system obviously you can read in data
you could put in a reasonable lesion
which I'll show you in a second this is
showing the same representation of the
anatomical matrix for the entire brain
this would be the normal case and then
the person with the lesion and if you
measure cross correlations of the this
is actually now cortical local field
potentials again you see that there's a
drop in the correlations for the areas
that are knocked out but you see that
the impact of that lesion is quite broad
that there is a quite a broad drop in
the correlations amongst nodes that are
intact as well suggesting that lesions
aren't just going to affect the notes
that are removed but also broader parts
of the network so to understand what
happens in lesion case you have to look
at not only what's what's gamba what's
left and how that system is responding
with the with what it has left through
to respond to the lesion that's sort of
the point of some of the other studies
we did with this platform looking at is
everything equal in terms of the impact
of the lesion on the system the answer
the question is no because there are
different capacities for information
processing for different parts of the
brain because of how they're hooked up
because of their wiring if you apply
graph theory metrics to anatomical
matrices you can characterize different
potential properties of different parts
of the brain one of the most popular
ways of characterizing now are looking
for hubs in the brain hubs are exactly
what it sounds like their house like for
example the airport Atlanta's a hub for
airport airline traffic for instance
in the brain you have at least two
different kinds of hubs you have hubs
that are called connector hubs and these
are hubs that link up disparate parts of
the brain you have provincial hubs which
are connected with areas that have a
similar functional operation for example
visual areas stay hubs sorry okay keep
on forgetting to change my language from
over there and you have the sort of
areas that are sort of primary reasons
for example what we show on this slide
is what the impact is on leading this
different hubs on the capacity of the
remaining of major the network to
process information so that's quantified
based on the drop in what's called
transfer entropy which is a measure of
directed information transfer in the
system you hit connector helps you have
a massive drop and information
processing capacity this would be sort
of an acute lesion provincial hubs you
have a much more focal statewide impact
whereas in the primary areas the impact
fairly small if not quite local this
tells us why different lesions have
different impacts we'd give us an idea
of how to explain that you can take that
and scale it up and actually use a real
brain and how that lesion may actually
manifest in real tissues someone who had
a left parietal cortex lesion you see
here and here the extent of the lesion
from a stroke if you take that and model
it in this brain you see what happens in
terms of the change in the capacity of
the remainder of the nodes to process
information what you see happening here
is it's not just reductions or increases
in information but actually both happens
in the acute phase of lesion recovery so
the blue and red arminta indicate
connections that go up or down in terms
of their capacity to process information
when you knock out this big chunk of
tissue and again it's going to help us
potentially interpret what happens in
the acute phase in terms of stroke but
potentially also gives us a target for
modification helps
many recover because now we have their
brand in the acute phase you can
envision using something like TMS an
aura therapy and our formal pharmacol
therapy try and reestablish some sort of
equilibrium in terms of the remainder of
the connections that are trying to
recover from that from that damage so
where we going to go next obviously the
clinical application is a big area you
can envision quite a broad potential for
application for clinical decision
support for instance and stroke for
pre-surgical mapping and epilepsy you
could take EEG data from an epileptic
patient and see can we predict where the
stroke where the seizure focus might be
free in some instance and also predict
what's going to happen when you
eliminate that note in terms of the
capacity of the system to stop
generating seizures as a matter of fact
in the latest version of the software
there's a module called the epileptic
which allows you to put in stroke or
seizure foci into the model the last
thing we're working right now is
actually looking at brain stimulation
effects like TMS for instance or deep
brain stimulation as well you shouldn't
thing about DBS and TMS DBS is now used
therapeutically and nobody actually
knows why it works they just know that
it does it's rather typical neurology
because they're either going to chop it
out or stimulate it and that's typically
the way it gets treated and often is the
case they don't actually know why it
works they just know that it does so
hope it will get a better idea of why
stimulation actually works in some cases
and why it doesn't all these techniques
are all these applications right now are
assuming that we're going to take an
individual's brain and have that
individual brain become part of the
virtual brain but would it not be
possible as well they have multiple
people actually interacting with the
virtual brain now and that's actually
this next little phase of the project
it's the virtual brain can interact with
one person through for example EEG the
question is can we actually do it in
groups of individuals can we do like a
social neuroscience experiment for
instance and that's this idea of a
virtual dream and then what we're going
to do this is out is it basically based
on a large sort of immersive art
installation this rendering here is
dome that for those you know Toronto
this is actually on the edge of the
University of Toronto campus in the fall
of this year the idea is that we'll have
groups of individuals 20 people at a
time coming in we'll have wireless EEG
headsets on that will feed into the
virtual brain platformer to be in the
center here and based on the consensus
up for example spectral fluctuations in
their brain waves that information will
then go to modify the audio visual
environment that the people will see
inside this dome basically what you're
actually doing is essentially creating a
dream internally in real time so the
audiovisual fluctuations are going to be
a combination of animations whose speed
who is Hugh whose vibrancy will change
as the consensus power spectra change
and people can actually see this
happening in real time in addition is to
make it even more of a head trip is
we're going to have live musicians using
this audio visual display to cue off of
to jam essentially with the people and
with the virtual brain at the same time
so the nice thing is that we can collect
these data from these individuals look
at how they're interacting look at how
their brains are trying to drive this
thing see if we can get some consensus
in terms of the power spectra but they
also will have fun in principle as
they're doing this it'll be debuted as i
said in Toronto in Fault in the fall of
this year the nice thing though is that
this platform we're putting together is
actually portable as well so the 60-foot
doma is going to be may not be portable
the contents themselves can be moved
around quite easily in various locations
we're actually surprised to find they're
actually dome vendors that will set up
domes for you for a small price so so
where we going with this so as I said it
looks like we can interact with
individual people but now we have the
potential of also having broader sort of
social neuroscience experiments the
richer you is in fact a merger of art
it's an immersive art experience but
it's also the science underlying social
options underlying can we use our brains
action communicate with one another it's
scalable it's portable and we're
planning right now to have it installed
in various locations around North
America and Europe and it's an
incredible amount of data enabled to
collect in a single session liebe
launches 12 hours long we're measuring
probably about 480 people in an evening
that would come through this display in
various degrees of intoxication probably
but that's part of doing these
naturalistic experiments of course and
besides that it's actually kind of fun
and so with that I'm happy to take any
questions thank you for your attention
yeah it would be correct to think that
we're talking about the question of
knowledge brought up earlier would be
here to think of that in terms of
answers
I mean so if you're finding a sweet spot
of entropy where you have the phase
space available to the system if you
increase those than your brains react
better to things yeah now in the network
level actually I do think we're talking
about entropy for sure as a matter of
fact one of the ways of characterizing
this noise at the network level is using
a measure that we call them is called
multiscale entropy which looks at
entropy as a function of different time
scales and you find that that in fact
increases with maturation positive
correlation behavior and it changes with
age as well so it's information if you
think about intervening from information
is synonymous for sure but it's not
simply it's nonlinear so that's not the
other characteristic of it but people
tend to disregard this noise we're in
fact when persons notice one's personal
information essentially negative entropy
fun differently yes now the important
point about this as well as that there
are different levels at which this will
manifest as and in you're going to have
a network level of noise or entropy but
also local levels of noise and entropy
and whether those are synonymous is
that's less less clear so might be that
the noise it's at local populations are
single neurons may in fact be quote
unquote pure noise whereas you put that
noisy system noisy oscillator in a
larger nonlinear system that I'm
actually maybe information that part we
can actually actually sure about yet
back in the back
factum understanding noise so does this
add more noise as it might might it mean
more neurons firing just more components
or larger components each other or more
neurons now that have to become adapted
to the task or something but before they
were uncaring you're just funny and
remember any closer does that mean no
because if you it could be but if you
can actually test that by for example
looking at getting rid of absolute
fluctuations for example or getting rid
of aerial changes and seeing if you do
that does this these things still happen
so I'm for instance in the EEG data the
empirical data as well as a subsequent
emmy gee data we did is did the same
analysis by eliminating differences in
amplitude difference in the spectral
power for example and the entropy
differences still exists so it's not
simply a case of having more tissue
engage it's actually something to do
with the interactions amongst the tissue
it's really the important part yep do
you have an idea of the range of noise
ratios
better fmri an image what's the noise
ratio to the signal approximately I got
it really depends on there's so many
factors that kind of range how big is in
ways trying to remember what it was I
think in this in the EEG data it's it's
usually down around 0 point to 2.3 an
fMRI can be really crappy it can be much
higher fMRI you probably need to do a
bit more in it sticking from empirical
data down to actually being able to
analyze it it's a lot of things you want
to get rid of that really obscure the
important noise in the fMRI data as a
matter of fact and sometimes in the
signal-to-noise ratios and fmri day it
can be really really bad and raw data
with pre-processing you get them down to
about closer to EG point2 maybe
right I mean it also depends on what
would it how do you define with the
signal is as well in this particular
case which is another problem of course
one comment about Roy's simply a
question there's a I don't know if you
know why Jeff Hanson quit ball machine
learning Percy's now with google oh he's
still at he's still in Toronto so he did
some nice stuff with I mean there's been
a long idea that noise helps helps us
learn but he did some recent work some
people in his group showing that noise
done the right way when learning
actually gives rise to some very
powerful effective my colleague a
mixture of experts so if what you have
is a look it was a network under all
network this is trying to learn and you
use zero out certain neurons while
you're learning different neurons at
different times what you get is this
effect that in one large network you end
up building on ensemble of less well
connected networks that then vote it's a
voting mixture of experts that spoken to
solve your problem so it's a nice
regularization strategy and it allows
the individual experts to to be risk of
your so sweet so to sit closer to the
edge so I don't know how strong of a
connection there is because it's about
learning yeah I mean it may just be a
hand waving connection but I think
there's probably something to be said it
means you got personal India you know
between what you're doing and all of the
people trying to use the Oasis different
you know different heads regularizing
sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
