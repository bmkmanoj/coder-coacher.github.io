introduce to you today dr. Sean Carroll
here to talk to you a little bit about
the nature of time and as today is about
astronomy I thought I wanted to just do
a little plug we were talking earlier
that today is actually a semi important
day kind of a local maximum importance
for astronomy in that this morning was
released that the u.s. dick Adel survey
which kind of focuses what astronomers
will do for the next 10 years and so one
of the things that came out of that
survey was that new experiments about
dark energy and about looking back
further in time at the early universe
where at the top of the list so this is
kind of very appropriate talk for today
just a little bit about Sean before we
get started
Sean started out with a PhD at Harvard
in astronomy spent a little more time in
Boston at MIT then he came out to
California to UCSB and then went back to
the other side of Mississippi up to the
cold Chicago and then has landed for the
last four years back in the sunlight
here in California at Caltech besides
all these credentials and these nice
universities and his great publications
one of the reasons that I asked Sean to
come here today is that he's a great
science communicator and I even verified
this on his Wikipedia page this morning
that is a direct so you have to know
it's true he's recently made appearances
on The Colbert Report as we were just
talking so you may have seen him there
and a few of you might have been at the
comic-con a few weeks ago where he was
at the booth round table about science
and science fiction movies and you know
as people become famous these are the
things that they do and now they're here
at Google giving a tech talk to you all
so with that I'd like to present dr.
Sean Carroll talk about the origin
universe and the arrow of time thank you
Chris
I never really loved it when the
introduction says that you're such a
great speaker or communicator or things
like that it sets up a little standard
that I know I can reach but it's great
to be here at Google it's especially
because without you guys I would not
have any of the images that I'm showing
in this talk and it's a great topic I
think to talk about to almost any
audience because what I'm gonna try to
do is to connect things that happen in
your everyday life the sense of time you
know we all know what time is we use it
all the time you were smart enough to
get here at 11:00 a.m. for this talk but
there are deep mysteries about how it
works and those deep mysteries thinking
hard about them leads you to think about
the multiverse so I really want to try
to convince you that just trying to sort
out what happens in your everyday life
in terms of the difference between the
past and the future ends up with you
thinking about these grand ideas that we
are then trying to bring back to
experiments that we can actually test
somehow so the first question everyone
asks is what is time what do you mean by
time and there's a famous quote by st.
Augustine back in 450 ad or something
like that where he says I know what time
is until you ask me I can use it you
know you can get here on time you know
what it means if someone says a certain
TV show lasts an hour or something like
that but then you start thinking about
it and you get confused and the reason
is actually not because the concept of
time is all that confusing it's just
that we use the word time in different
notions different senses and so those
get mixed up but the simplest notion is
actually very easy one time is kind of
like space and this was something that
was really made very formal by Albert
Einstein in theory relativity but it was
true even for Isaac Newton or for
Galileo time helps us locate things in
the universe if you want to get here to
this lecture you say where it is
which particular room it's in at Google
in California etc you say where it is in
space and you say when it is in time so
just like we have the three dimensions
of space where you use to locate objects
we have the one dimension of time it's a
number it helps us find things in the
universe you have the Train moving
through the station you want to get on
the train you know what station you're
at and you know what time the train is
leaving
so one way to think about time is it's
just a coordinate it labels different
moments in the universe we happen to
live in a universe that has the very
very nice property that things don't
completely rearrange themselves from
moment to moment in time there's
smoothness there's some continuity the
world is not exactly the same from
moment to moment in time but it's not
completely different either so you have
a moment 1001 1002 etc there's you and
there's your cat your cat is walking
away from you but the cat does not turn
into a dog or just you know scatter
across the universe from moment to
moment in time there's some continuity
there that's one of the things that
makes it a little bit different time
versus space and as you go from point to
point in space things can change
dramatically here is the table here is
not the table from moment to moment in
time things change smoothly as a result
of the laws of physics now what you want
to do if you believe that is say well
how do we measure time we measure space
by meter sticks or odometers which are
basically things whose length we know
the nice thing about meter sticks is
that every meter stick is the same
length as every other meter stick it was
a difficulty back in the day when people
literally measured lengths in feet by
which they meant the length of the foot
of the boss on the project and every
project would have a different notion of
feet these days were smarter than that
we say we have a universal notion of
distance one meter is this much size so
likewise for time we measure time using
clocks and what a clock is is simply
something that does something
repetitively
in a predictable way compared to other
clocks and now you say that sounds like
a little bit of a circular definition
but you look at the actual clock here
the thing about a wristwatch or a
conventional clock is that every time
the little hand goes around the big hand
goes around 12 times that is absolutely
predictable the earliest clocks were in
the sky they were astronomical events we
know that every time the Earth revolves
around the Sun it rotates around its
axis 365 and 1/4 times it is a fact
about the universe that clocks exist we
could imagine different laws of physics
that didn't have clocks in them we
imagine that you could set up one little
wristwatch but for no other wristwatches
in the world was that was there a
relationship between them we live in a
world full of clocks a world where
things happen repetitively synchronously
over and over again in predictable ways
that is what allows us to tell time and
to measure it and to use it as an
important part of how we get around the
world so the next question people ask is
but I experience time to move faster or
slower sometimes and I'm here to tell
you that is your fault that is not the
fault of the laws of physics and the
reason why you experience time
differently is because your body is full
of clocks you are implicitly telling
time there are things about your your
person that repeat in a predictable way
your heartbeat your breathing the
rhythms and pulses of your central
nervous system all act as clocks but
they're not very good clocks if you've
had too much coffee or you're tired or
you're bored or whatever the perception
of time tends to differ because those
clocks are not keeping very good time
one example of a successful application
of this idea was Galileo this is a story
which I suspect is true I can't actually
verify whether the story is true but I
will tell it to you anyway because it's
such a good story
Galileo grew up in Pisa he went to
church at the Cathedral in Pisa which is
right next to a leaning tower and this
is an image on the left from that church
some days the sermon was not as
interesting as other days as you might
expect and so you or I our minds would
wander and we would think about what
we're having for dinner that night or
whatever
Galileo being Galileo thought about the
nature of time and he was looking at
this chandelier this this precise
chandelier in the Cathedral in Pisa and
he saw that it rocked back and forth and
again we would go oh that's a pretty
chandelier but Galileo said you know
some days it's rocking back and forth
quite a bit other days it's only a
little bit but it looks like when it's
moving far it's also moving faster I
wonder if there is some uniformity there
and the time that it takes that
chandelier to rock back and forth is
always the same no matter how far it's
actually rocking back and forth again if
we had that idea we would think that's a
cool idea but Galileo did the experiment
he said I'm gonna test whether or not
the time it takes the chandelier to rock
back and forth is in fact uniform so he
timed the oscillations of the chandelier
using his own pulse using his heartbeat
as a clock he timed the number of
oscillations of the chandelier versus
the number of beats of his heart and he
found out by doing this on successive
Sundays that indeed the time it took
that chandelier to go back and forth was
always the same this is the beginning of
what physicists now call the simple
harmonic oscillator the foundational
idea for anyone who's ever taken a
physics course and the idea behind a
pendulum being a good time keeper for a
grandfather clock or for other kinds of
timepieces the existence of oscillators
like this that are predictable lets us
tell time these days we would use a
little quartz crystal that is even more
accurate but it's the same basic concept
our bodies are not as good that's why
time seems to move faster or slower for
us so those are the similarities between
time and space just to get your
grounding here but what I really want to
talk about is the most important
difference between time and space and
that is that time has a direction and
space does not there's a little bit of
an exaggeration because here on earth
space does have a direction you can tell
the difference between up and down down
is the direction in which things fall
when you drop them but if you're in your
spacesuit far away from the influence of
the earth if you were sort of
experiencing space all by itself
not under the influence of this giant
gravitating mass beneath us all
directions of space would look equal to
you there'd be no difference between up
and down left right forward backwards
the laws of physics don't know any
difference between different
orientations in space but contrast that
with time there's two directions there's
forward and backward the past and the
future but they're very very different
you might walk around a unknown City and
make a wrong turn turn left instead of
turning right no one ever makes a wrong
turn into yesterday no one ever confuses
the past with the future they're very
very different you remember what
happened in the past you do not remember
most of us what happened in the few
you can influence the future you think
that you can make a choice right now
that changes what happens in the future
but you can't make a choice right now
that changes what did happen in the past
so what is the origin of this difference
between past and future that's really
what this talk is going to be about the
way that we talk about this difference
between the past and future is in terms
of the arrow of time unlike space time
has a direction pointing from the past
to the future here are a bunch of
pictures comparing two similar kinds of
objects and under each of them I have a
big blue arrow saying the direction of
time but the point is I didn't need to
put that arrow there whether it's the
car the king of rock and roll or the
evolution of a species if I just showed
you these pictures it's perfectly
obvious to you which is one which ones
are in the past which ones are in the
future that's because we all experience
time to move from past to the future in
a consistent way we might some day
imagine discovering alien life based on
different chemistry with different laws
of society and so forth but we cannot
imagine discovering an alien species
that remembers tomorrow and tries to
predict yesterday
the arrow of time is completely
consistent within our observable
universe we grow older we're born we
grow older and then we die it's never
the other way around no matter what
Benjamin Button movies you might be
seeing now the reason why this is a
mystery is because just like with space
the laws of physics don't pick out this
arrow of time the deep-down laws of
physics whether we're talking about
Isaac Newton or Einstein or Schrodinger
or super string theory all have the
property that they treat the past and
future completely identically there is
no arrow of time to be located in the
fundamental laws of physics if you look
at billiard balls knocking into each
other over there you can do the
experiment there's a pool table right
over there if you imagine physicists
billiards where there's no friction
there's no noise or anything like that
and you just have two billiard balls
bump into each other and scatter off I
could make a movie of that and I could
play the movie backwards and you would
not notice anything funny going on the
laws of physics that just
DR just two particles bumping into each
other and going their own way are
completely reversible any trajectory any
solution to those equations works
equally well played backwards in time
but then you find a messy circumstance
with lots of particles in them like we
have in the macroscopic world like a cue
ball and a bunch of billiard balls that
are racked together nice and neatly you
will see very often in the world
smacking that cue ball into the rack
balls and they scatter across the table
that's going from the past where the
balls are nicely arranged to the future
you will never see starting with balls
scattered randomly across the table
someone smacked the cue ball and they
all arranged themselves into a nicely
racked orderly configuration in other
words if I took the movie of the
original thing the rack balls scattering
across the table and I played it to you
you would instantly know that it was
being if it was being played backwards
or forwards the arrow of time comes into
existence when we go from just a couple
of particles to a large number of
particles and this is actually not a
mystery in any way it's it's the
beginning of a mystery well we
understand the basic mechanics of why
the arrow time moves in one direction we
attributed to something called entropy
entropy is basically a measure of how
messy or disorderly things are so here
is the natural progression of time from
neatness on the left to messiness on the
right now we have to emphasize you can
clean up your room there's no law of
physics that says you could not take a
messy configuration and make it nice and
more organized but the law of nature is
that left to their own devices in other
words a closed system a system that is
not influenced by the outside world only
ever becomes Messier only ever has an
increase of entropy that's the second
law of thermodynamics so if you leave
the left-hand side room all by itself
people walk around they bump into it and
so forth it becomes the right-hand side
it's never the other way around the
disorder of the universe increases time
and that is the thing that is the single
unique foundational thing that separates
the past from the future
so to quantify it we invent entropy and
here we go from the bottom left you have
a low
entropy configuration organized and in
the past so you have an unbroken egg as
time goes on it's easy enough to break
the egg it's easy enough to scramble the
egg and disorder increases all along the
way that is the second law of
thermodynamics if I made a movie of that
played it backwards you would know that
I were playing it backwards now I want
to emphasize I can't go into all the
details here but I want to emphasize
this claim that the increase of entropy
is really underlying all the different
ways in which the past is somehow
different from the future so the fact
that we are first born and then we live
and then we die that's ultimately
because of the increase of entropy the
fact that biological goes from what we
exhibit in the early atmosphere and
biosphere of the earth with just a few
unicellular organisms to all the
complexity we have today that's also
because of entropy the fact that you
remember the past but not the future is
also because of entropy the fact that
you can think that we can cause things
to happen tomorrow but we cannot cause
things to happen in the past it's also
because of entropy it's not because of
the rules of logic or the fundamental
laws of physics the fact that we feel
time to be passing in our personal lives
again it's because of entropy so here's
an image due to Roger Penrose that shows
you exactly how this is working here on
earth if entropy were at its maximum
point all that thermodynamic equilibrium
so the gas in this room where it
smoothly spread all across the room
that's an equilibrium entropy is as high
as it can go there is no change in the
gas in this room there is no flow of
time it's just sitting there the reason
why here on earth there is any notion of
time passing is because we are very far
from equilibrium and the reason we're
far from equilibrium is because the Sun
is a very hot spot in an otherwise cold
sky so if you actually count up the
amount of energy that the earth gets
from the Sun its equal modulo a little
bit of global warming to the amount of
energy we give back to the universe we
get light from the Sun and we're
irradiate radiation back into the sky
but for every one photon that we get
from the Sun we give
20 photons each with on average one
twentieth of the energy so we get mostly
visible light from the Sun we radiate
mostly infrared light and four photons
the entropy is just proportional to the
number of photons so in other words we
take the same amount of energy from the
Sun that we give back to the universe
but we've increased its entropy by a
factor of 20 that is what allows stuff
to happen here on earth that is why we
are not in equilibrium we are little
machines whether it's photosynthesizing
or chewing plants and metabolizing or
thinking and computing as you guys do
it's all increasing the entropy of the
universe which is allowed because we are
so far away from equilibrium we are
nowhere near a maximum entropy state
there's a long way to go before we reach
maximum at equilibrium so this was more
or less put on a quantitative footing by
this guy Ludwig Boltzmann in the 19th
century this is Boltzmann's gravestone
in Vienna and I like to tell my students
that you know there's a equation on top
of Boltzmann's gravestone so they should
all be thinking throughout their
graduate school careers what is the
equation that will be on my tombstone
after I die if you can do as well as
Boltzmann you're doing very very well
so the situation for Boltzmann in the
1870s was that physicists didn't really
believe in the existence of atoms for
the most part there were a few pioneers
Boltzmann Maxwell Thompson who thought
that atoms were the way to go but a lot
of physicists said you keep talking
about these things but we can't observe
them science shouldn't deal with
unobservable things these might be
familiar arguments if any of you are
fans of cosmology and particle physics
today but Boltzmann and Maxwell and
Thompson said the reason why we should
think about atoms by the way the
chemists had already caught on chemists
were all believers in atoms because they
help them understand chemical reactions
so Boltzmann and his friends tried to
make the same argument for physicists
they said we can understand
thermodynamics and the properties of
gases and fluids if you believe in atoms
so we can understand them in a better
way and make predictions and ultimately
maybe we'll even see these atoms someday
so what Boltzmann said is well what I
can understand is entropy if you grant
me the existence of atoms I can tell you
why entropy tends to increase and
basically he said that entropy just
counts the number of ways that I can
rearrange the atoms of a system without
changing its observable macroscopic
properties so here the bottom you see
another example of the arrow of time if
these were all the same collection of
milk and coffee you would know that the
one on the left was in the past the one
on the right was in the future it's easy
to mix things together
it is hard to unmix them so Boltzmann
says I know why that's true it's because
over on the left I could change to
Coffee atoms with each other we would
now call them molecules but two coffee
particles without changing any the
overall observance the macroscopic
appearance of that cup of coffee I could
also exchange different milk atoms with
each other but if I started mixing the
milk atoms with the coffee atoms then
things would begin to look different I
would disturb the macroscopic appearance
so there's a small number of ways that I
could do the rearrangements on the right
hand side when the milk and the coffee
are all mixed together there's many ways
that I can do the rearrangements there's
just a lot more freedom to arrange the
constituents of that system without
changing its macroscopic appearance
so if Boltzmann said is that the reason
why entropy tends to go up is simply
because there are a lot more ways to be
high entropy than to be low entropy if
we get a little abstract here for a
second here is just a plot of all the
different ways that you could have a
collection of atoms and they're divided
up by what you can observe about them
the individual atoms you don't observe
when you look at the cup of coffee you
don't see the position in the velocity
of every single atom you only see some
macroscopic features so if Boltzmann
says is there are a lot more high
entropy states a lot more ways to
arrange the atoms of something with high
entropy than with low entropy so if you
start a system in the low entropy
configuration you're starting it very
delicately arranged very very precise
and if you just let it go if you don't
disturb it from the outside world by
cleaning it up as it were it will
naturally wander into a higher entropy
part of the configuration space
there are more ways to be high entropy
than low entropy that's why entropy
tends to increase this is Boltzmann's
great contribution in this formula on
his tombstone is the formula that says
that the entropy is the logarithm to be
technical about it of the number of
arrangements that you can do to a system
without changing its macroscopic
appearance so that's a pretty good
explanation for why entropy tends to go
up there are more ways for to be high
entropy than to be low entropy but if
you're thinking about it you realize
there is yet something that is not quite
answered and this has been controversial
since the time of Boltzmann to today and
that is if there are a lot more ways to
be high entropy than to be low entropy
why did you ever start out with low
entropy why is it in other words that
the entropy was lower yesterday
so what Boltzmann is able to do is
explain why starting with today entropy
will tend to go up there's a lot more
ways that our universe today can evolve
into a higher entropy universe tomorrow
what he can't explain is why the entropy
was lower yesterday given everything we
know about the universe today there are
a lot more higher entropy pasts from
which we could have come then lower
entropy pasts but nevertheless we
believe that the universe really did
have a lower entropy yesterday why is
that well the reason why the universe
had a lower entropy yesterday than today
is because it had an even lower entropy
the day before yesterday the reason why
it had an even lower entropy the day
before yesterday is because it hadn't
even lower entropy the day before that
and this is not I'm not going to reveal
the true underlying real explanation
that is the real explanation for why
entropy was lower in the past and it
keeps going many many days 13.7 billion
years to the Big Bang the reason why
entropy has been increasing during your
lifetime is because we live in a
universe that started at the Big Bang
when our observable universe came into
existence with an incredibly low entropy
an incredibly tiny entropy compared to
what it could have been and the entropy
has been increasing ever since there is
no explanation for that in terms of
anything that Boltzmann ever taught
there's no dynamical explanation there's
no statistical mechanics argument
particle physics argument general
relativity argument or anything like
that that explains why the entropy of
the universe was low near the Big Bang
this is something that we can assert is
true we start in the little tiny region
of that graph and everything we know
follows from that all the business about
thermodynamics memory causality free
will we can explain all that if you tell
me that the universe started with a low
entropy if you ask why I can say I don't
know this is at our job as cosmologists
so it's kind of again like space
remember when we said that there's no
arrow of space except of course that
we're here on earth so there is an arrow
of up and down there's an arrow of space
in our local vicinity because we live
close to a very influential object
namely the earth that influences our
notion of up and down the arrow of time
is the same way is what I'm trying to
say the reason we observe an arrow of
time around us in the universe is not
because it's there in the deep down laws
of physics it's because we live in the
aftermath of an influential event the
Big Bang the Big Bang started with a
much much much lower entropy than it
needed to everything else follows from
there so we want to understand why was
the big bang like that so to do that
let's think about the universe and the
universe when people try to when
cosmologists give talks to large
audiences they usually start talking
about rubber sheets and rays and bread
and things like that my favorite thing
to do is to actually think about the
universe cuz we're not standing outside
looking at the universe we're embedded
inside this is a picture that you would
get if you took a really good camera and
pointed it at a region of empty space
and just kept the shutter open for quite
a while that's what they did with the
Hubble Space Telescope and this is the
Hubble Ultra Deep Field
it just shows us that even what do you
think looks like an empty region of
space is in fact full of galaxies in the
1920s Edwin Hubble pinned down what
these little blobs were they knew that
they existed but there was an argument
or they just clouds of gas and dust here
within our Milky Way galaxy or are they
outside Hubble showed that every one of
these blobs for the most part is a
galaxy just
like our own so we live in the Milky Way
galaxy with about a hundred billion
stars roughly speaking we live in a
universe the observable part of the
universe has roughly a hundred billion
galaxies each one of them roughly a
hundred billion stars so the universe is
big that's the first important thing to
know the second important thing to know
is the universe is getting bigger it's
expanding this was also discovered by
Edwin Hubble in the 1920s if you look at
a galaxy and you look at it and not only
its distance but measure its velocity if
all faraway galaxies are moving away
from us that's not because we're special
in any way if you sat on one of those
galaxies we would be moving away from
them every galaxy sees most of the
galaxies around it to be moving apart
the further away a galaxy is the faster
it is moving so what this really means
is that the whole universe is expanding
the space in between the galaxies is
growing if you play that movie backwards
in the past everything is closer
together the density is higher you keep
pushing it into the past the density
becomes very high in the temperature
becomes high so in the early parts of
the universe's history the universe was
a hot dense plasma and it was opaque
about 380,000 years after the Big Bang
it cooled down enough so that the
universe became transparent and we can
observe the relic radiation from That
moment when the universe became
transparent that is the Cosmic Microwave
Background this is an image of the
microwave background from a NASA
satellite called W map and the tiny
little fluctuations here in color are
enormous ly amplified from the actual
tiny fluctuations in temperature that
you see when you look at the microwave
background from point to point the early
universe was incredibly smooth and
that's a reflection of the fact that it
was incredibly low entropy I said that
the air in this room is high entropy and
smooth but the difference is that the
early universe had an incredible density
there's a tremendous amount of stuff
there when the density is that high
smooth does not equal high entropy
smooth equals low entropy because it
wants to collapse under the force of
gravity wants to be wildly inhomogeneous
with black holes and empty regions and
so forth but instead the early universe
was a
credibly smooth we can go all the way
back to 13.7 billion years ago
everything is at the same place in the
universe the density is infinite the
curvature is infinite that's the Big
Bang that's what our equations tell us
we don't know whether that's true or not
we're trying to put it all together so
that's the past of the universe in the
future what's going to happen well this
used to be a great thing to debate when
I was in graduate school we used to
wonder whether or not the universe would
eventually rika lapse or not
now we more or less know at least we
have a very very sensible theory that
makes a prediction which is that the
universe is going to expand forever the
reason we think that is because in 1998
astronomers measured the velocity of
receding galaxies to unprecedented
precision what they realize is that not
only is the universe expanding it's
accelerating if you look at a galaxy
right now and measure its velocity away
from you go away and then come back a
billion years later and measure its
velocity again that velocity will be
faster that's a surprise because if you
think about an expanding universe it
should expand but ever more slowly
because the different galaxies are
pulling on each other through their
force of gravity instead it's expanding
and now it's sped up so what is going on
we don't know for sure what's going on
let me admit that but we do have a
theory that works very very well and is
probably right and that theory is that
there is energy in empty space what we
call dark energy or vacuum energy or the
cosmological constant so if you have a
little cubic centimeter of space and you
empty it out there's nothing there it's
completely empty and you ask how much
energy is there in that little cubic
centimeter of space you might be tempted
to say well there's zero energy because
it's empty the truth is that there is
some energy even in empty space not very
much ten to the minus eight herbs but
there are many cubic centimeters in the
universe and right now there's more of
this dark energy than any other form of
energy about 73% of the universe is dark
energy
bye-bye energy and the effect of this
dark energy is impart and impulse a
perpetual push to the expansion of the
universe that's why we've now begun to
accelerate away and that's why we're not
going to wreak elapsed the universe is
not being pulled by the matter in
I'd anywhere near substantially enough
to ever make it come back our best
theory right now is that the universe is
13.7 billion years to the past to the
Big Bang but the future goes on forever
literally to infinity that is the best
guess we have right now it will not end
so here's my very brief overview of the
history of the universe one second after
the Big Bang
is the earliest time when we have any
data from Big Bang nucleosynthesis this
is an image from my imaginary telescope
it was hot it was giving off gas it's
white here 380,000 years after the Big
Bang it had cooled off enough to become
transparent we see the microwave
background and now we can perceive these
subtle ripples in density from place to
place ten to the ten years later
approximately today we're dominated by
stars and galaxies this is the stellar
if heurists epoch in the history of the
universe when you can actually see
pretty pictures by taking images now if
you wait until ten to the fifteen years
after the Big Bang those stars will die
out you'll be left with a few rocks a
few brown dwarfs and a lot of black
holes we have a black hole at the center
of our galaxy which is pretty big a few
times a million solar masses that's
nothing compared to the galaxy the
galaxy is a hundred billion solar masses
but if you wait long enough those stars
are gonna die out and they will all fall
into that black hole so after 10 to the
15 years after the Big Bang we have a
dark universe nothing but black holes
and a few stray rocks however black
holes don't last forever
in the 1970s Stephen Hawking showed that
even black holes give off radiation they
evaporate due to the effects of quantum
field theory they lose mass so these
black holes turn into a thin rule of
particles moving apart in this
accelerating expanding universe and it
that will die out after I have to say
this one Google years in the good old
fashioned sense of the word Google
before you guys messed it up with your
search engine stuff ten to the one
hundred years after the Big Bang all the
black holes will have evaporated away
into particles and those particles will
all have separated followed all the
other particles and we will be left with
nothing but empty space and that will
last forever
so 13.7 billion years is a long time
Google years is an even longer time but
this lasts forever that's a very long
time and it should emphasize how weird
it is that we live in this year era of
the universe's history where it's sort
of warm and comfortable almost all the
history of the universe is dark and
forbidding we live in a very unusual
time and that is a reflection of the
fact that the Big Bang began with an
exceptionally low entropy this is the
high entropy state of the universe
nothing nothingness is disorderly high
entropy and stable it just sits there
that is what equilibrium is really like
so this is the evolution of entropy in
the universe it starts out low things
are orderly because you have to
delicately arrange the density of stuff
in the universe to keep it smooth once
it expands the force of gravity acts as
a contrast knob on the universe it makes
stars and galaxies but those stars the
galaxies will eventually evaporate into
nothingness in the future entropy is
going up the entire way so our task as
cosmologists is to explain why that is
the case given that there's a big bang
why did it start in such an exquisitely
ordered configuration with such low
entropy if you randomly picked a
configuration of all the particles in
the universe it would not look anything
like the Big Bang so one thing is for
sure the Big Bang was not randomly
chosen we need some answer to why the
Big Bang looked like it did and we don't
know the answer some people will tell
you that they know but they don't this
is an open question right now we're
working on it so I want to sort of
explore some of the possibilities one
possibility was actually broached by
Boltzmann himself he appreciated that
this was a problem there's a long time
when Boltzmann and others thought that
they could prove that the entropy needed
to be smaller in the past but eventually
they realized that you can't do that
because the ultimate laws of physics are
time-symmetric you can't prove that the
past must be different from the future
you need to put it in there so Boltzmann
did the sensible thing he said well if
the low entropy of the past is unusual
what would be usual what should the
universe looked like now remember in the
1870s physicists thought that the second
law of thermodynamics was a law not just
good idea it was absolute but Boltzmann
said look if you believe my statistical
understanding that the reason why
entropy goes up is because there are
more ways to be high entropy than to be
low entropy as a consequence of that
occasionally the entropy can go down so
there's a standard exercise that you
learn when you do it as an undergraduate
physics major when you learn stat max
take all the gas molecules in this room
compute how long you will have to wait
on average before they all move to one
half of the room it's a long time it's
much much longer in the age of the
universe but if you're a Boltzmann you
know about the Big Bang you don't know
about general relativity you think that
Newton was right space and time are
absolute and time will last forever
he thinks the universe is not going to
end nor did it have a beginning so he
imagines that even very very improbable
things will occasionally occur you can
start with the collection of particles
that is high entropy spread out through
the room eventually they will just
through the random motions of the
molecules come into low entropy
configurations and then relax back so
here is a plot of an actual simulation
in a computer of a box of gas with
maximum entropy when we've normalized it
so that the entropy is equal to one when
it's maximum and it can't go up it's at
its maximum but it can through random
fluctuations go down and then relax back
up again and that's exactly what it does
so Boltzmann says maybe we live here the
point is that if you wait long enough
you will get fluctuations that are
relatively large maybe we live in the
aftermath of a random fluctuation of the
particles spread throughout the universe
we would remember the past as being the
point of low entropy here remember the
arrow of time is not fundamental it's
not there in the laws of physics it's a
reflection of the fact that entropy is
increasing so on the right-hand side of
this graph people who live there
remember that minimum as the past and
this right hand side is the future if
you lived on the left-hand side you
would remember this as the past where
the entropy was lowest and you would
call this direction the future what you
label the past in the future merely
reflects the local growth of entropy in
your
roundings so Boltzmann said the
anthropic principle and the multiverse
he used ideas he didn't have the words
he used the same ideas that string
theorists used today to try to explain
our universe he said look if my theory
predicts that the universe should spend
almost all of its time in thermal
equilibrium the problem is that you
can't live in thermal equilibrium he
says there must be then there in the
universe which is in thermal equilibrium
as a whole and therefore dead
that's the entropic principle here in
they're relatively small regions the
size of our galaxy which we call worlds
which during the relatively short time
of eons that's a little physicists joke
deviate significantly from thermal
equilibrium so Boltzmann says look ok
maybe most of the universe is in thermal
equilibrium but we can't live there as a
selection of fact living beings will
only arise in regions of space and time
where the entropy is changing according
to Penrose his picture so most of the
universe is unobserved by people like us
but occasionally there are fluctuations
into lower entropy states very
occasionally there are large
fluctuations into very low entropy
states like our galaxy maybe that's who
we are maybe we are just in the
aftermath of a fluctuation into our
galaxy if you read Boltzmann's papers
back then it was he was slightly
embarrassed by this idea but he thought
it was kind of cool and it's interesting
to read this is not however an original
idea if he do the literature search you
can find it there precursors Boltzmann's
idea the earliest one I found was from
50 BC this is a Lucretius a Roman poet
writing in dactylic hexameter but like
Boltzmann Lucretius was anatomist at a
time when being a de mist was not the
conventional thing to be Lucretia's was
a follower of Epicurus and Democritus
the Greek philosophers and he was stuck
with the same problem that Boltzmann had
namely if the universe is just made of
atoms and the atoms have no purpose or
teleology they just are randomly bumping
into each other how do you explain all
the structure and complexity in order
that we see around us and so Lucretia
says and you have to imagine he's
speaking sarcastically at the beginning
of this quote surely the atoms did not
hold counsel assigning order to
flexing their keen minds with questions
of place and motion than who goes where
rather they shuffled and jumbled in many
ways in the course of endless time
they're buffeted driven along chancing
upon all motions and combinations at
last they fall into such an arrangement
as would create this universe so it's
exactly Boltzmann scenarios just chaos
particles are randomly moving around but
if you wait long enough you'll get a
universe just like ours so this is a
venerable idea and it's a good idea in
the sense that yes it would lead to
universes like ours without assuming an
arrow of time there's no intrinsic
direction to time in this plot here
there's no overall trend right or left
we're just looking at a really tiny
piece of the overall plot the problem is
the idea doesn't work
Boltzmann unlike Lucretius had recourse
to equations he could make predictions
and this was actually done by Arthur
Eddington in the 1930s and he realized
that Boltzmann scenario made an
extremely strong prediction that is very
vividly falsified this is a good
scientific theory it's just wrong and
what Eddington realized was that if you
are most of the time in thermal
equilibrium and you're waiting for a
fluctuation to decrease the entropy then
it is overwhelmingly more likely that
you will get a small fluctuation than a
large one in fact they're exponentially
more small fluctuations than large
fluctuations so if this is true the
prediction you make is that given
whatever you need for anthropic reasons
let's say you want a person to exist or
you want a planet to exist or you want
the galaxy to exist no matter what it is
that you choose that you're going to
wait around until it fluctuates into
existence this theory predicts with
overwhelming likelihood that everything
else in the universe is still in thermal
equilibrium so if we wait long enough
for our galaxy to fluctuate into
existence we don't need a hundred
billion other galaxies we would just
have empty space outside our galaxy but
that's not true and then you can sort of
focus it and you realize you know I
don't need the galaxy I can just do with
the solar system it's much smaller and
then you predict that the rest of the
galaxy shouldn't exist then you realize
actually I only need this room
I don't need the rest of the universe I
could fluctuate into out of the
surrounding chaos I could fluctuate into
exactly the configuration of stuff in
this room right now including all of you
including all of me including our brains
and the state of our brains that really
is convinced that outside there is a
Google and there is a California and
there is the earth these are just in our
brains it's a much easier configuration
to get your brain with the thought that
Google exists and actually get Google or
the earth or whatever so if you like the
prediction of this model is that as soon
as you walk outside it's thermal
equilibrium this is a model that is that
is falsified everyday all the time so it
is not true the all the way that you can
take it
reductio ad absurdum says you know I
don't even need you guys I can just have
myself if I don't need my body I can
just have my brain with E with the
thoughts that you were all here so what
this scenario really predicts is that
the overwhelming majority of intelligent
observers are disembodied brains that
fluctuate out of the chaos into a
configuration that lives long enough to
look around go hah thermal equilibrium
and then dissolves back into the
surrounding chaos so we don't live like
that this is not true this is ruled out
by the data these brains are known as
Boltzmann brains this is an image from a
story about them in the New York Times
they mislabeled them it's not
Boltzmann's brain Boltzmann's brain is
under the tombstone in Vienna
these are Boltzmann brains that are the
prediction of this false model however
not only not everyone really likes this
idea so after this story was written in
the New York Times those of us who were
quoted in the story all received a
letter from someone who didn't really
like the idea and I will read the letter
to you I have to translate it a little
bit this is from George wing who is 10
years old
he says I don't know if you exist but I
do I do not agree with your article and
I do not believe that mumbo jumbo if you
do well it's a disturbing thought but I
know how to deal with it I will not let
the world disappear under my nose but if
you do I can't say I'm sorry
sincerely a ten-year-old who knows a
little more than some people Jorge wing
PS some people have a little too much
time so I appreciate your system from
George and from people who are much
older than George and should know better
but there's a fundamental
misunderstanding here we're not saying
that we are Boltzmann brains we're
saying that this is a theory that
predicts that we are but we're not
therefore this theory is wrong this is
the standard way that science gets done
okay so that was a possible theory in
the sense that it made predictions I did
not put in an arrow of time by hand but
it's not right we need to do better but
we have a lot of things that Boltzmann
didn't have we have quantum mechanics
general relativity cosmology the Big
Bang so the context of our problem is a
little bit different what Boltzmann knew
was that at some moment in the far past
the entropy was very small what we know
is very specific we know that we started
with something like the Big Bang it had
it low entropy but we know more than
that it had a very specific arrangement
of particles that we need to explain so
as cosmologists it's our job to explain
why the Big Bang was like that my own
personal and again we don't know for
sure it might be that there is no
explanation other than that's the
universe in which we live Stephen
Hawking said it's like that and
therefore it is we are have a boundary
condition it's just put like that and we
need to live with it rather than try to
explain it I think we can be more
ambitious I think that when we have
something in the universe that is so
unlikely in terms of conventional
counting that's a clue that is a hint
that there's something going on and we
should uncover what it is in my own
guess is that what is going on is that
the Big Bang is not the beginning of the
universe in other words an egg and
unbroken egg is much lower entropy than
scrambled eggs are and yet when you open
your refrigerator you're not surprised
you find an egg you knock oh ha that's a
very low entropy configuration this is a
puzzle why because the egg is not a
closed system the egg is not all by
itself it's not the whole universe so
maybe the egg came out of a chicken
right maybe the universe came out
Universal chicken maybe the universe is
not a closed system maybe it's not all
by itself maybe it's part of a bigger
system where we can find some dynamical
explanation for the arrow of time now
you may get a little uncomfortable about
the idea that there exists something
before the Big Bang that's because
people like me cosmologists go around
telling you that the Big Bang is the
beginning there is no before the Big
Bang talking about what happened before
the Big Bang is like talking about what
is north of the North Pole it's a
nonsensical idea all that is not true
I'm here to confess to you it may be the
way that reality is arranged but we have
no basis in what we currently understand
about the universe for saying with
confidence that there was nothing before
the Big Bang it's just a guess what we
have is Einsteins theory of general
relativity that's our best understanding
right now of how space and time works
this is the picture that you should keep
in mind
Einstein most pictures of Einstein were
taken in when he was 70 years old and
the hair was all going off and he was
wearing the sweaters and so forth but
back when he was actually inventing our
current notions of space and time
someone was combing his hair and he was
a very well-dressed young man he looked
very sharp and he was and what he was
doing was understanding how gravity
worked he says that gravity is a
manifestation of the curvature of space
and time and he wrote equations which
are still the right equations as far as
we know for understanding how the
curvature of space-time responds to
stuff in the universe those equations
tell us that at the Big Bang
things were singular the curvature of
space was infinite the density of stuff
was infinite the right way to think
about that is not to say that the Big
Bang is just a boundary to time and
space at the moment of which everything
came into existence the right way to
think of it is to say that we don't know
what happens that is the position that
is the place the moment where our
understanding gives out the equations
blow up and it's not the we shion's set
we can say from those equations what
happened it's just that we need better
equations
Einstein's general theory relativity is
not good enough to tell us what happened
at the Big Bang and this is not a
surprise because general
relativity is not compatible with
quantum mechanics the other great
triumph in theory of 20th century
physics we know general relativity is
not the final answer we need to do
better so the best thing we can do about
the Big Bang right now is to say we
don't know what happened we should be
open-minded maybe it's the beginning
maybe it's just a phase that the
universe goes through maybe the Big Bang
happens every once in a while so the my
strategy would be to do the same thing
that Boltzmann did instead of taking the
universe as we see it let's ask what the
universe should look like if we really
buy into this picture of entropy is
counting the number of states that
things look like and you say that high
entropy states are more likely than low
entropy states then what should the
universe look like well the answer is
our actual universe is increasing in
entropy it's going up toward the future
so we should just say what will the
future look like the future looks like
empty space nothing there so the strong
prediction of a sensible model if you
take the entropy argument seriously is
that we should live in empty space and
you might say like Boltzmann did well
but we can't there's an anthropic reason
why we don't live in empty space namely
there's nothing there to do the living
it's empty
but even that argument turns out not to
quite be right and the reason why is
again because of dark energy if the dark
energy is truly persistent and constant
as we think it probably is it doesn't go
away it lasts forever but in the 1970s
Gary Gibbons and Stephen Hawking said
that if you have dark energy even empty
space isn't really completely empty in
the following sense if you go to empty
space Google years in the future from
now and you bring along a thermometer or
a particle detector and you say well
just put it there and wait to see what
it measures you might say well it's
empty space doesn't measure anything but
in fact there are fluctuations due to
quantum mechanics and all the fields of
which the universe is made the
electromagnetic field the electron field
the neutrino fields the gravitational
field these all fluctuate if there were
no dark energy if space were truly zero
energy in those fluctuations would be
undetectable but when there is dark
energy they bring to life those
fluctuations
nonzero temperature to empty space I can
tell you what the temperature is it's
about 10 to the minus 30 degrees Kelvin
it's very cold actual empty space right
now has the cosmic microwave background
in it which is three degrees Kelvin
that's a lot warmer and more comfortable
but even empty space has a non zero
temperature and what that means there
are fluctuations particles can come and
bump into your thermometer and it lasts
forever so it in fact is Boltzmann's
scenario what we said was a ridiculous
scenario that is not right turns out to
be the real world it's the favorite
scenario of modern cosmologists the
universe will last forever and there
will be these thermal fluctuations
inside these will include atoms you will
fluctuate in two molecules you will
fluctuate into DNA you will fluctuate
into brains and planets and galaxies but
you still stuck with the fact that
that's not the world we live in this is
a problem this is what is called a
Boltzmann brain problem why do we live
in this warm comfortable part of the
universe when there's an infinite amount
of time stretching out in the future and
a very small probability per year that
things like us will fluctuate into
existence so you multiply a small
probability by an infinite amount of
years and almost all the people in our
real universe should be disembodied
brains living in empty space we are not
that is a puzzle furthermore most
planets should be otherwise in empty
space etc however unlike Boltzmann we
have a loophole we have something that
Boltzmann didn't have and that is
relativity general relativity the idea
that space and time are not absolute not
fixed just sitting there they are actors
in the game they are not just the stage
they can change so in fact you can get
fluctuations not only in particles but
in space-time itself so it's possible
although this is again not established
physics by any means it is possible that
if you wait long enough you will
fluctuate into not only a brain but a
whole new universe in other words you
can imagine because space and time are
flexible you can imagine there's a
fluctuation in which not only do you get
a bunch of energy to make some object
but space-time itself
and pinches off so you start with a
little bump but then it becomes a little
pinched off region of space and then it
becomes a completely disconnected region
of space it separates from the universe
around it and it's almost egg-shaped
just to keep the entropy argument going
there it's almost like the universe is
giving birth to another little egg we
call this a baby universe and the thing
is that the baby universes are easier to
make if they are small so you make small
universes rather than big ones but most
universes that you make most baby
universes don't last very long they will
just collapse very very quickly and you
will not notice that they were ever
there occasionally however you will
fluctuate into not only a baby universe
but a baby universe with a huge amount
of dark energy and you might worry you
might say well where did this energy
come from this is the miracle of general
relativity that if you have a closed
part of the universe if you have a
self-contained region of space the total
energy is always exactly zero it costs
no energy to make a new universe you can
make as many of them as you want if it's
an empty universe it will just wreak
elapsed but if it contains a huge amount
of dark energy that will make that
universe expand and accelerate and the
dark energy will fill it with a
tremendous amount of energy density
which will eventually then decay into a
hot plasma that is very smoothly spread
out throughout the universe because of
the stretching influence of the dark
energy in other words the natural future
of this baby universe is just like what
we perceive as the Big Bang so the idea
is that unlike in Boltzmann scenario
here we have a way to increase the
entropy in Boltzmann scenario we said we
were in thermal equilibrium we were at
the maximum entropy we could possibly
get but the hypothesis that we're now
considering there is no such thing as
maximum entropy there is no state of the
universe which just sits there stabili
forever the entropy can always increase
by making new universes these universe
cost zero energy you can make them one
could come into existence in this room
right now they're very small from our
point of view what
would look like is a little black hole
fluctuated into existence then
evaporated away almost as quickly you
would not even notice you might have
just given birth right here to a whole
new universe this is very rare unlikely
that has happened even once in the last
13.7 billion years but we have an
infinite number of years to wait it will
happen an infinite number of times so
the universe is a bubble making machine
the bubbles mostly collapse and go away
but occasionally they grow into
universes like ours the explanation in
other words is that the reason why we
live in a warm universe where entropy is
increasing is because we are a spin-off
of the bigger universes attempts to
increase its entropy forever and the
nice thing about this scenario is that
it can work both directions in time so
here is a map of the universe in space
and time time is going vertically and in
the middle of this map you're in empty
space nothing but dark energy nothing
else going on there's no arrow of time
there's time but there's no difference
between the past and future in this
empty region of the universe so you
evolve it forward in time and you ask
what happens what happens is it gives
birth to a new universe here and there
so these little funnels are new
universes baby universes that come into
existence are warm and happy for a while
and then become empty space themselves
and last forever this happens many times
and in that little period between the
birth and the baby universe and when it
cools off there is an arrow of time we
live in one of these regions just one of
these tiny little regions of space-time
is our entire observable universe
however if you go to the past the same
thing should happen because the laws of
physics work the same forwards and
backwards so there should be the birth
of baby universes they will expand and
cool toward our past so these guys if we
if they live here observe an arrow of
time but it's pointing toward what we
would call the past to them we are in
the far past to us they are in the far
past locally everyone sees everything
normal there's no universe in which
there's a Benjamin Button scenario and
people are born old and grow younger
everyone to them to their own point of
view is born young and grows
older observes eggs turning into
scrambled eggs remembers the past and
not the future it's just that the
overall orientation is different between
these two different sets of universes
which are completely disconnected and
can never talk to each other the nice
thing about this is you didn't put in
the arrow of time you didn't assume it
from the start you started an empty
space with no arrow of time and it
developed out of the creation of baby
universes of course we have no right to
say this is what happens this is a
attractive scenario for the reasons I
just explained but there's a lot of
unknown physics lurking here so the
question you should be asking is how
would you ever know you should be asking
the same question that Ernst Mach was
asking Boltzmann back in the late 19th
century how will you see these things
how you ever know that they are actually
real well unlike atoms improved
technology will not allow us to see baby
universes that they are truly
disconnected but we don't know if that
it's true there are some people who are
looking into the possibility that other
universes literally bump into our
universe and leave signals in the Cosmic
Microwave Background you might say well
it should be obvious if another universe
bumped into us but in fact it's not
there's many scenarios in which the
influence of another universe in our
past is actually fairly subtle and you
have to look very hard to try to observe
it the more promising idea I think is
that we need to understand better the
fundamental laws of physics if we
understand how gravity particle physics
and quantum mechanics all play together
we'll be able to say whether it is
naturally true that empty space predicts
the baby universes are created or not so
what we need to do is improve our
knowledge of particle physics and
gravity one obvious example is the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva the
new particle accelerator that just
turned on and is now collecting data
smashing protons together at
unprecedented energies trying to
discover new laws of physics new ways
the particles interact with each other
another example as chris mentioned at
the beginning of my talk is observations
of the universe the astronomical decadal
survey recently came out and is saying
that we should look to understand better
dark energy and fundamental physics
throughout the universe so I think it's
these kinds of observations which will
eventually help us figure out
not only what our universe looks like
but what maybe the multiverse looks like
all right so the last slide just to put
you back in firm grounding here here are
three things we know for sure first we
know that it is entropy that is
responsible for the arrow of time even
things that don't feel especially
entropic like the fact that you remember
the past but not the future are all
ultimately due to the fact that you live
in an environment where entropy is
consistently going up the second thing
is that the reason why entropy is going
up is because we live in the aftermath
of the Big Bang the special initial
conditions 13.7 billion years ago that
set up the universe like a little
wind-up toy it's been clicking along
ever since and eventually it will just
die out the third thing we know is that
we don't know why we don't have the
final answer to why the Big Bang had
such a low entropy this is an incredibly
important pressing problem for modern
cosmology if we are going to claim to be
understanding and making predictions
about the early universe this is the
puzzle we really have to solve so when
it comes to oh we don't know we don't
know what the right answer is we don't
know is it just initial conditions are
we supposed to be satisfied with knowing
what the early universe is like and not
trying to explain it or is there
something else going on is our universe
part of a bigger picture I love the fact
that you are led to these speculations
by thinking about stuff that happens in
your kitchen and your everyday lives and
if you want to learn more people are
writing books about this stuff or you
can just wait to see what the
experiments and the theories tell us I
hope that I can come back you know in a
year or two and explain all the answers
to these pressing questions thank you
all right thank you very much I think we
might have time for a couple questions
it doesn't look like we're getting
kicked out right away so if you want to
ask a question feel free to step up the
microphone so you had a picture of what
the world looked like one second after
the Big Bang yes
how'd you take that photograph were you
there this is a yeah so this is a image
one second after the Big Bang this is to
be honest it's a false color image but
it is based on data in the following way
we you know we see the Cosmic Microwave
Background that is the earliest epoch in
the history of the universe where you
can actually see with a telescope
however one second after the Big Bang
the universe was a nuclear reactor it
was turning protons and neutrons into
helium deuterium and lithium we can make
a prediction based on our theories of
the universe right now that says if the
universe was behaving in such in such a
way how much helium should you get etc
those predictions turn out to be right
one second after the Big Bang is a
moment about which we have empirical
information before that we don't we can
extrapolate our theories back to 10 to
the minus 35 seconds after the Big Bang
but here we actually have constraints
you can't come up with a new theory of
cosmology that says the universe was
doing radical something radically
different one second after the Big Bang
Thanks how do baby universe itself that
Boltzmann brain problem wouldn't you be
much more likely to create a little baby
universe big enough just for one
Boltzmann brain now that's a very good
question and I mean the honest answer is
we don't know so the question is fine
you make baby universes but why don't
you make small low entropy baby or high
entropy baby universe is tiny tiny
fluctuations rather than big
fluctuations that have 100 billion
galaxies in them so I can't tell you for
honest that we know that you do but if
it is true that this solves the
Boltzmann brain problem it's because of
inflation it's because the universes
that survive there's basically two
categories of baby universes there's
baby universes that just wreak elapsed
or baby universes to start exponentially
expanding on
the influence of inflationary cosmology
and if that's true it's easy to get a
hundred billion galaxies no problem so
they're the the fundamental answer for
how you solve the Boltzmann brain
problem is that it is easier to make a
universe than to make a brain since
you're talking about entropy going on a
little bit of a tangent here
but are you familiar with the new theory
about gravity being can be explained as
entropic force on the holographic
universe and a little bit yes so you
want to know something about it and do
you think that is a credible theory and
and if so first of all I mean how does
it actually interact with the arrow of
time because we think of gravity so this
physicist named Erik for Linda caused a
ruckus recently by being quoted in the
New York Times saying gravity does not
exist that's not true gravity exists he
does admit that things fall but what he
means when he says gravity does not
exist is really that space and time the
curvature of which we see as gravity are
not fundamental that just like air is
not some air fluid it's actually just
made of atoms interacting in different
ways he thinks that there's a
fundamental deeper constituent that
makes up space and time and just like
sound waves can actually be explained in
terms of atoms gravity can be explained
in terms of the thermodynamics or the
statistical mechanics of these
underlying degrees of freedom it's an
interesting idea it's very promising we
we honestly don't know yet whether it is
absolutely revolutionary and true
completely false or not even able to be
turned into a sensible theory so it the
jury is still out on that I think it's
gonna be interesting to see what happens
to it over the next few years there are
a lot of theories about the universe is
expanding and there's some major change
coming along in 2012 do you have any
point of view on that way I'm sorry I
couldn't hear you say it again a lot of
theories about the expansion of universe
and
frequency of earth-changing
a near future like 2012 there are a lot
of 200 2012 right yes complete craziness
unfortunately yes
yes what what happens in 2012 is much
more like the y2k problem than the end
of the universe it's really just the
date in the Mayan calendar when you flip
over to the next page it's not the end
of anything even according to the Mayans
and certainly according to modern
cosmology there's nothing dramatic that
is going to happen in 2012 except the
possibility that Sarah Palin becomes
president or something like that but
certainly from the cosmology and
fundamental physics point of view
nothing nothing bad is scheduled how do
you know you're not a Boltzmann brain is
that disprovable no this is a very good
question how do I know that I didn't
just imagine you making that question I
mean frankly my imagination could do
better in terms of questions that but
but it remains true that if I if I if I
say the following question given that my
brain exists and given that in my brain
there are the perceptions that you all
exist and there's the memories I just
gave the talk and the memories of you
assassins question etc and nothing else
no other information what would I
predict about the rest of the universe
and the answer is yeah you're all
thermal equilibrium and it's all just a
fluctuation into my brain how do you
know that's not true and I said that
you'd know that's not true because you
make a prediction in the prediction
comes false you walk outside and it
should be thermal equilibrium that's a
little bit quick that's not a very
rigorous answer because if I walk
outside and I see that it's not thermal
equilibrium but then I react the
question and I say well given that I saw
it's not thermal equilibrium outside
what do I predict and the answer is
still that you guys roll in thermal
equilibrium so the better answer is that
it's cognitively unstable in other words
I cannot get through life consistently
and coherently imagining that I am a
Boltzmann brain you could ask the same
questions about being a brain-in-a-vat
or simulation on a computer I cannot
make sense of the world around me
assuming that I am a Boltzmann brain you
can always be
a radical epistemological skeptic you
can always believe that I have no right
to believe that gravity exists etc but
you don't walk out tall buildings from
the top floor likewise to live in the
world you have to make some sense of
what you see around you and to do that
the only intellectually respectable
thing is to imagine that you are not a
Boltzmann brain what difference do you
think it will make 10 to the 15 or 10 to
the 100 or 10 to the 10 to the 100 years
from now whether or not any of us lived
or what we did with our lives and is
there anything we can do to change that
well I guess I think the difference that
is made is made now and I kind of
believe I'm not a hundred percent sure
about this but I kind of believe that if
we wait 10 to the 100 years in the
future
I can't see any possible way in which
there is any record of anything that we
have done now that will remain no matter
it's just sort of it seems to me to be
in principle impossibility not just a
practical problem but I could be wrong
it's just I could just not be
sufficiently imaginative about it
some people like Freeman Dyson have
claimed that we can organize things that
we do an infinite number of CPU cycles
between here in the end of the universe
but I think these are open questions and
honestly it does not keep me awake at
night
even if everything that I do is
forgotten a Google years from now I am
still motivated to do things today so
you think then if look for those of us
who are concerned about what happens 10
to the 10 to the hundred years from now
that the solution is to be more
imaginative and and to read up on this
Dyson guy that would be one I can't give
you advice sorry
you could do that my question is a
little more technical and less sort of
morally philosophically oriented okay so
the theory as I understand it is that
the universe will expand forever because
of the the nature of dark energy but I
also understand that the current
inflationary theory posits that dark
energy underwent a phase transition
where its behavior changed what is what
leads us to believe that won't happen
again
now that's well that's a very good
question dark energy I said that it is
persistent in its constant 10-8 orgs per
cubic centimeter and will last forever
that's not necessarily true in fact we
believe that the amount of dark energy
per cubic centimeter was higher in the
past there can certainly be phase
transitions in which things change the
best argument that it won't happen in
the future is that it hasn't happened in
the past the the universe is already old
enough that if the dark energy we
observe now were truly unstable it
probably would have decayed already
that's not airtight though we could
certainly get around that and it's a
very viable theory to imagine that the
dark energy is very very slowly changing
I just think from experience personally
writing papers about these other
possibilities the pay possibility that
holds together the best seems the most
robust and easy is the one that says the
dark energy is constant and it's not
going to change so that's what I based
these ideas on if the universe if the
dark energy really does go away we don't
have a Boltzmann brain problem for the
future we still have the problem of the
low entropy past and now I don't know
how to solve it so I actually don't
think that's an improvement
yes yeah so you talked about like Google
years from now when the universe is all
cold and there could be then there is a
possibility of fluctuations which could
lead to baby universes I mean is is this
looked in this direction that the
fluctuations are big enough to create a
single Big Bang or it's just a single
universe like you give an example that
how much time do we have to wait so that
are all the gas particles gas atoms or
molecules in this room arranged at one
corner of the room right no is there a
possibility that I mean all all the
matter that it it is a you may have to
wait for infinite time but they collapse
together to one part of the universe and
in the new Big Bang start I think that's
not a very big worry because you can
calculate the time these things take so
there's matter in the universe it's
doing it is subject to a lot of random
fluctuations but the even though the
universe is old 13.7 billion years
that's a very short time compared to any
of these fluctuation timescales once you
get more than about a hundred particles
the timescale for fluctuations like
we're talking about becomes larger than
the age of the universe so these kinds
of thermal fluctuations into law or
entropy states are just not relevant for
the universe over the timescales of the
Google years over the actual amount of
time that will take for the universe to
expand and do things and wrap rate away
so first all the matter in the universe
will disperse into nothingness long
before we have to worry about thermal
fluctuations the the baby universe kinds
of fluctuations are really quantum
mechanical fluctuations of space and
time itself that's a little bit
different when I try to describe your
book to my friends and parents and I try
to make the connection between the
second law of thermodynamics being the
only thing we have that gives direction
to time which is kind of an abstract
notion especially for non scientists and
the idea that we believe we can
influence the future but not the past
right which is a very concrete thing
it's hard to make that intuitive
connection can yes flesh that out a
little bit well I tried in the books my
back
I admit that I didn't do a great job so
you're right that is something that is
um it's it's something you can say it's
something that is true it is hard to
make it quite vivid the example that I
use is so the question just to make sure
everyone is clear the reason why there's
an arrow of time is because entropy is
increasing one of the manifestations of
the arrow of time is the fact that we
can influence the future by making
decisions
we cannot influence the past we can you
know what I think I say in the book is
if your if your friend says I've changed
my mind instead of having Chinese food
for dinner tonight let's have Italian
food you would say okay and you make a
decision if your friend says I changed
my mind
instead of having had Vietnamese food
last night let's have had French food
last night you go you're nuts ultimately
that's because of entropy but it's hard
to say exactly why but let me give you a
little example that I think is the best
that I can do right now imagine you're
walking down the street and on the
sidewalk you find a broken egg okay and
you ask yourself well what are the
possible futures over the next 24 hours
of that broken egg and there's lots of
possibility someone could clean it up
dog could come by and eat it it could
just sit there and get moldy or could be
washed away by a rainstorm there's many
open things if you say what was the
possible past 24 hours of that egg
you're like well 24 hours ago it was an
unbroken egg you're much more certain in
your reconstruction of the past than of
the future and why because you know the
feet the past is subject to a low
entropy boundary condition so you know
something about today and you know
something about the past but you know
nothing about the future in terms of
macroscopic boundary conditions so
because of that the set of possible
interpolations between the past and
today is much more small much more
restricted than the set of possible
futures if you believe in deterministic
evolution if you knew everything about
the universe you could predict the
future just as well as you could predict
the past but we have much less
information about the future than we
have about the past so that's why the
past seems fixed to us because there's
fewer things that are compatible with
what we know when it comes to the past
then comes to the future best I can do
yes
one last question we even take one last
question and quick question if if one
universe spawns off two baby universes
that are both the same size as the
parent doesn't that break the law of
conservation of mass energy no it
doesn't because every new universe has a
total of zero energy that's the great
thing about general relativity roughly
intuitively the way to think about that
is that there's stuff in that universe
but there's also space-time curvature
and the curvature of space-time accounts
for a negative amount of energy always
exactly equal to the positive energy of
the stuff inside that's just an
implication of Einstein's theory so you
can make universes forever and that's
the escape hatch that lets you escape
the Boltzmann brain dilemma and
hopefully try to explain the arrow of
time experience to those questions let's
