I'm going to talk a little bit about
kazoo the company we both thought it was
set up only seven years ago and focus
was on building personalized public
transport information services for
mobile devices and also for the web his
picture of our chaotic offices what
channel insane early was very resonant
for me because you thought me Matt how
difficult it is to test mobile services
over the years we've written appear
tools and frameworks to help test mobile
devices what we're going to talk about
today though is more it's not really
about mobile is more more general and
active writing literate plan from what
we call literate functional tests and
the basic idea is to write tests and
very understandable by both developers
and by the customers that were
travelling software for this in
particular element because kazeem is an
XP company it's been great being that
absence of a setup and so we were always
looking our customers so what is literal
functional testing let's go through word
by word literate comes from a bubble new
idea of literate programming like many
things in computer science it all goes
back to leave his idea there was to have
documentation and code embedded in the
same document we need to be something
slightly different width or more about
readable code we're not talking about
integrative documentation here however
there is a quote from New futile read
out and which is quite famous instead of
imagining that our main task is to
instruct a computer what to do let us
concentrate rather and explain to human
beings what we
onto computer to be so that's that
chimes with this idea of communicating
with the customer the other strand of
literate is to do with linguistics
programming languages of always used
ideas from natural language Webley
accomplished that explicitly or not I
think Larry wolves quite fun he talks a
lot about the influences from that for
language in Perl so in this framework
women talk about we're going to
acknowledge the different linguistic
devices that we're we're using so
functional in this real functional
testing goes back to XP so we're talking
about the unit of delivery of XP is a is
a kind of functional unit as feature and
then the important thing but maps is the
way that that's in the customers domain
of discourse these things that customers
talk about are things that customers
talk about and so they understand and
they can they decide what they are so
this is to distinguish it from you
testing and then the testing is the
automatic testing bit which is where we
come in this conference where we come
from a book job a background so we're
using lots of Java automated testing
tools some of which may be one which you
know where ju for example needs no
introduction gain mock is a objects
testing framework and
written in Java you know tastic and I
think three of the authors are in the
audience today functional testing we've
been focusing on web applications and
certainly for this talk will mainly
focus on on testing HTML so we we use
HTTP units and htmlunit HTTP is slightly
lower level than an HTML unit which we
prefer
so a simple equation describing what
we've done we read about their different
style plus htmlunit plus J mock gives
the illiterate functional testing
framework so that's the kind of
caricature of the work we've done
however like most caricatures had
suggested or wrong the we started doing
this not because we're testing a web
application we're actually testing a
proprietary at expo marker so we weren't
using HTML even so let have to use it
each Tamar unit so when the jayhawk
suggests we're doing what objects and
we're not mock objects really about unit
testing with my functional testing the
reason I put game up on the slide is
because we use the flexible assertions
and the constraints and j mock so those
are two other things in jail off besides
mock objects that we found very useful
and influential for our framework also
we've built on your own works we haven't
just added them together and called a
digital function testing or other ideas
that have come in which will go through
in this book
so why we're doing this well our aim is
to be able to write tests that
developers can read very easily that's
quite a common requirement you want to
test that when you come back to it in
three months time you can read them and
get the intent very quickly without
having to understand and low-level stuff
that's going on furthermore we want to
be able to use these tests as test
artifacts that we can share with
business analysts and customers that's
not something that happens much these
days if at all so
these pests provide a common language
for us to talk to our customers and
though there is that app cuts out
developers having to interpret what
they've done back to the customer so
instead of saying this year we put your
requirements and we implemented it and
this is what it kind of does we want to
give customers the literate test and say
that this is what we've done you can
read haven't behaved all these tests
parts this is this is the system and
then they can look at those and
understand them and feedback so do that
we've got five principles that framework
follows the first to a high level and
readable are important for the customers
so we want them to be high leveled so
that better in the customers language
there that the user level as it were and
we want to be readable so the customer
funds happen those two are very
important for developers to obviously
they should be read both for developers
for different developers or yourself
combat code but the for the last three
points need to apply to the developers
as well it should be easier for a
developer to come along and write new
tests it should be composable by which
for me the constructs of the the testing
should be applicable in different
contexts you shouldn't have to write
lots of stuff to test your system you
should definitely use it as ways and
they should be extensible we want to be
able to grow the framework as a as a
developer developing a particular
application I want to be able to grow
the framework to use of a catenary of
the domain and that fits into the
customer as well so it's talking that
so that's what we're going to do I'm
going to hand over now to Robert who's
going to talk about how the framework
was born and the initial ideas thats get
got it started okay so yes those topics
they begin to start out doing web
testing eventually started out when we
were building their back nine months ago
now application for cattle information /
digital TV because obviously you want to
make a transfer or oppression or at home
but we assume and so this is some XML
markup so we didn't actually have an
off-the-shelf tool to test this thing so
it feels something so this is an
opportunity to build something that was
new and suburb fitment so Steve
mentioned earlier HP in histol and what
you seem truly well I think Stevie said
something like that you can get it to
run go to this age and click on the link
with the label egg but if you keep HTTP
you can't write back at this this is one
of the tests that we had from only a
year ago from where our packages it's a
bit messy it mother's up concepts of
HTML staff with web client stuff with
the actual requirement that you want and
the theming you're testing and it's all
a bit kind of model together and there's
quite a lot of code so for me but Java
program this year probably fine for work
out what's going on here but I can't
show this to my business analyst
probably I definite can show it to my
customer by won't they won't know what's
going on it seemed a bit difficult for
me to literally hand see what's going on
so in like something that was a bit more
expressive something there's a bit more
in the domain of the requirement that
it's shorter ready so what size do the
scope and think and what we want and
they build a framework that we support
subject
so he just took some painful things just
like Photoshop mock-ups of what the
applications going to arrange I'll
design the edge so you see it's got some
menus and stuff it's got some drop down
boxes and radio buttons and you've got
yes sort of a summary you start
information about so looking at least
I'm not come to go okay well how can we
write the test just on a bit open that
says how we know what we do in French
this feature and have to admit that we
didn't have a deal that we were going to
also make this using some sort of
programming language so we need a
complete free form language but which
are only in English its kind of stylized
but these are some of the things that we
want to say so he said so that the
current page has three select boxes
whether they named region cattle time
pectinase so that the region segments
has between nine and twelve Evans
including london and the south-east so
hopefully this will be understanding why
even a non program at the commission
check it against the mock-up you know
and the plano that every intern
something capacities text we should
imprinted the right thing so the
customer knows that we're writing the
right test because they convenient if we
can make a couple incidents which is
tricky
it's only sota totally worth it to
happen or something okay right so come
in electronic form power that one how
can we refine it into something a bit
more code like so not trying to think
too much at this point about how will we
implement the framework but you know
something that might be incremental sort
of add blankets and things in like
religion places you know squash and
worse again there any kind of John style
some vibration some strings are the
things that literals in page this
becomes with the other example here the
nine and twelve options one so you can
kind of see that this is going towards
something that might point passes a bit
of code if you have something to support
that okay so actually so actually most
of our tests that we're going to show
you look something like this so this is
kind of a common style so this is a kind
of form that you'll see you cover the
meeting so a little and asking you the
different types of things we've kind of
got if you doing types of things
so other things that you'll notice was
that all of the best starting grid
assert that something now Miss Lee this
is not my invention I was some reading
Joe Rollins's gostoso them he'll be
talking about my age a saturation so
it's really one of the literally three
or four posts on the boards in last two
years and about flexible Jaden and
assertions and he says that you can you
know if you have all sorts of different
decisions and JT brother sir people's
sayings are true and you can basically
replace all of these we've assert that
from the general framework and obtain
much constraint this later how this
ashley infinity but nice we can have a
lot of things in at the same four minute
look at it go out the sentence I've also
got English is the subject in water
session so normally we're talking about
page or screen and so we only talk about
the current page we've got things that
we want to be on the page or not sitting
on my page so kind of like mounds it
more centers so we'll see lots in so I
methods the Detroit things and you've
also got instead of just things
different properties of things so rather
than just any select books week like the
Select box which is latent region so
much get to pick out I take to a
qualities of things and 230 sentence
together Oh me neither so here we've got
has so we want to check that the
cartridge has the staples and not only
does not have accidents
now in one of the things I wrote we did
between nine and twelve options and in
the code we had something like this
between 9-12 so you're kind of
emotionally programmers here probably I
think you're interpreting this as treat
nine and twelve but doesn't say between
nine and twelve this is the truth so why
not seem like much but actually we
thought quite a lot about you know how
do you actually make Java have the words
in the right order that if you strip out
the dots and practice the german force
you to have then you can place it into a
word you can send it to your customer
yeah and they can read it and they think
that you really were hacked which which
you know this is really good for doing
my test football so I wanted to test
printing help pick pretty free send it
off to them or just look at the code to
me we've had VA's and stuff just reading
over the coming through the telescope
yeah I can see well that us so just
really the sort of having some
linguistic inference and just working on
things and to try and make the Java read
properly was quite hard but I think it's
been quite important in having a
framework where we drink and write tests
that anyone hopefully can reach so we're
going to pass back to calm now what
weird so just to say so we started off
doing this traditional TV as I say
they'll be family work quite well and
then so in our next project regression
doing the full web application so we try
to develop the framework further so that
we can support more elements of HTML
rather than the somewhat restricted
subsec you gave me
so what tunnel demonstrate is how far
we've got what you can do with a full
HTML text look
okay so what we're gonna do is go for
famous websites and things look for some
images and I'll do that manually and
browser and then I'll switch to a job
edit own and write the test these are
the steps we're going to follow through
um I'll switch to the browser straight
away and come back to this this slide
bit later
ok
basically just going to say the words
that you might say when describing what
I'm doing the fairly minimal way so
first of all peeps the index page which
is people but okay
check that the page has a little Google
which it does click on the energies link
I'm do some search for some images of my
company so enter kazoom into the text
field and click on button labeled search
images okay the best one is the presumed
time a party in two years ago which went
really well so I'm checking that the
page contains the text because in time a
party and because it's an image search I
should also check that the was an image
on the page somewhere 84 before you can
treat that tomorrow 4.jpg so that's very
simple example with a manual test I'm a
switch to eclipse and write the test now
encouraged
okay call it evil test
and then can extend class for navigating
literate functional test base and this
is used when you navigate between pages
which is most of the time
I'm just going to import a couple of
useful static methods say
you'll see why we need to determine a
teaching so confess
okay the first thing we need to do is
tell the test framework what the base
URL that's where we start and that's the
google homepage
now we can write a test proper
so I mean inpatient notice this is
actually based on Jen unit as well
somewhere up the chain
so now I can start writing the words I'm
reading out when I was doing the manual
testing minutes ago so first thing was
going to the index page is thrown
exception
so the next thing I did was check that
the page has title google
so I've got an assertion that I think I
can run the test now if it works
yep green bar that works click on link
images
and
kazoo
into tech text text field
click on
Watson
search images
cert at age has text because even summer
party
not sure we could have a failing test
when we do
let's get that to work
that's right
and finally let's just check that the
image name that we expect is on the page
so I meant us like they're in here so
that it has image with Europe that ends
with summer jpg
okay that's programming that
okay that part's it so that's the the
test and that's the same as the manual
test by Iran minute ago finally for it
go back to the talk I'm going to turn
off contribution so we've got English
you can read
if I switch back to the slide those
words are the same as the ones in the
code okay so what we do now is go
through features that framework house
we've seen most of them in an app demo
I'm just going to go to each in turn and
talk about what if what it is really to
get bit more detail about how to work so
those are the list of features that we
think are important in the framework and
first five were covered in that donut
last table and talk about those more in
a minute so the first thing we have our
actions actions avert and they do things
so if we love will go to the index page
will remember we're using HTML unit and
so it maintains that the safe the
browser which is connecting a temper
retrieving pages from website so go to
the index page just retrieve the first
base you are up and updates an implicit
variable called page on Robert slide
it's called the current page where that
was the previous version very much so
that's an imp is a variable because
variables on the new idea for example
jsps have a page variable that you get
when you're mighty Raju's views
JavaScript Don programming has all that
that has the same concept lee
so Paige is the most important in this
variable in framework and it furthers
obviously to the current page that the
neuron so actions update the page when
you when you navigate the second most
important interest variable is a very
variable called it now this is
linguistically is called an anaphora
which is a word that refers to something
you've already talked about so I'll give
you an example in English if I say the
sentence I've baked a cake would you
like to taste it it reverses the cake
now first reaction on hearing this idea
it would be when minute isn't that
incredibly ambiguous and the last thing
you want for introducing for programming
language and that's a that's a good
reaction to have and it's one that we
have over there are we we told that
problem by making sure the rules that
govern men it is updated a very simple
and hopefully not prone to that
ambiguity so the rule the important rule
is that whenever you do insert that the
subject of the assertion is assigned to
the it is a variable so if you look at
this example first line says assert that
box gift vouchers more harm when that's
executed the its variable is assigned to
the subject of his box get fruit so in
second line you can refer to the to the
fruit in the box and say that it has a
property color which is yelling
so the reason that's useful is because
it avoids us how you to assign a
temporary variable if you wanted to see
or two choices actually you could either
make the second line say assert that box
or get fruit again and just repeat the
reference which is ok but if more
verbose and often as we all know these
things get very long and when they do
typically assignment to Tampa variables
but this way of oysters having to
assignment MP variable and I think we
can say our experience of using this so
far hasn't caused any problems ok so the
next let's move on to another feature
matches wrought mention those are there
things on petty so the whole point of
doing is testing is that is the sort of
things about page where they want to
perform actions on bits of the page for
example clicking on a link labeled image
which is so link images is a as a matter
for all links on the page that are
labeled images what we want to assert
things about bits of the package we want
to say the page has a title which is
google so that's saying that there's a
matter for the full title element on
page that I've running Google
so it matches a nap and linguistic terms
matches can be refined and this is very
useful when as we saw in the image
example the lots of images on the
packaging we want to refine the one we
were matching so if you look on the top
line it says image that's the matter and
we're refining the matter with a with a
nano coating modifier which is the with
your role of that which takes a
constraint to say having to find the
words so there's very useful we the
other neat thing about refinements as
you can chain them so you can take with
URL that but with name and unlisted
refinement allowing you to good lots of
conditions on what you're matching in
the cage that by the way is an example
of what Martin Fowler would call it a
fluid interface
and so yeah we're saying that matches
and refinement we found our bergman
team's been fighting that that's that's
an area extensibility that the team has
exploited if they realize that matches
they want that don't exist and they've
written around which is quite easy
because it's a smallish but these are
two method interface you have
implemented Ross manchaca
so the next feature to apply these
constraints this is straight from Jay
mark so there's lots of documentation on
how to write constraints in Jay mark and
you can do exactly the same in this
framework but one that we've found most
useful i think is is the house
constraint and what that does is I said
that the match has at least one match so
the meaning of the line the first
example is a set of a page has at least
one title because it synonyms so this is
another linguistic feature that Weaver
exploited if you look at the code the
implementation of haves and have you
would be possibly surprised to see that
they were saying one thing go to the
other so they can't be exactly the same
behavior which is slightly unusual in
programming to deliberately introduced
redundancy into into your coat and
the reason we've done it is because we
think it as Robert was saying earlier
we've been trying as much as we can to
make these things as expressive as we
can so if I bring out the two sentences
you'll see the second one linked a bit
better so cert there for me sells hat at
least one link isn't romantically
correct whereas assert that all cells
have at least one link is correct the
small thing but we've done it in a few
places in the framework okay
consequences these are either this is a
fairly small feature and this is not to
do with functional testing per se it's a
by default jayma library when insertion
fails it it's very good because it can
print what what failed because it uses a
self-describing constraint the
constraint knows why failed that's
normally great and that's all you need
to do but there are a few occasions
where you need to have a bit more
control over that to understand exactly
we fly has failed to be look at this
example and ignore the otherwise clauses
then the second assertion will fail but
Jay mob will just report something like
expected true but what's false but that
doesn't give me as a developer devoting
a clue as to which sir she was the first
of a second so we've introduced a
consequence parameter into the insert a
clause which allows you to give it up
and otherwise clause and so if we ran it
as it's seen that the failure report
would say we should be true which will
last identify that
okay this is the final feature and talk
about it's probably the most complex
what what would we talk Matt so far is
always about page really we've always
focused on the whole page or call
screening of the application we found
when we were actually using the
framework that we wanted to restrict
attention to a certain part of the page
and have all of our assertions just
applying to this a small partner and
it's the example that we use so that the
place where this popped up was when we
had multiple tables on page and you want
to just focusing on one one table and
say so test certain think about that
table if you look on the screen or two
tables or two by two and three by three
table without be considering Clause the
assertions will fail because personally
it refers to the whole page in this case
and the Rose matcher so this one here
would capital number of rows or match I
should say the number of rows in the
whole page which if you're looking
imagine those two run home page that
would be five rows similarly cells would
match ourselves on page rather than just
in one table so we introduce the
considering clause which takes a matcher
to refine the thing under consideration
to the
in this case we change it to be the two
by two table and then the following two
assertions both parts now because the
rows you throw all matches use the
consideration to match against not the
whole thing so scope changing course
ok so those are the features that's a
quick review of how the framework put
together Rob's little bit now about how
we found it in practice but prety
magazine this is once again okay so yes
so once we've got this framework we
introduced it into a team working on
quadrant project there were nine
developers and a full-time business
analyst and project manager on the
project and it was a popular website in
the UK for making inquiries about trains
that trouble nationally so this was a
prodigious check for four months to
develop with all those people full time
and it was written in Java we used we
didn't start off using this primary
source of writing tests basically in the
HTML in it then after wolves are welcome
now we're drunk in this friend that can
we try this how this work out and so
trying to get to to get the team to
write the sum them some people really
like it sometimes they're a bit like the
right easy tests some people really hard
pathol is essentially turned out sort of
chatting to people seem to be quite
distinction between people from eating
heart or people who had boys programming
charcoal is fresh meat for that it looks
fine
so people that always program in Java
thought that it looks strange that
you're the most in our examples hasn't
signed statement people when I assign
these things whereas people had more of
a background may be in fashion program
expressions are written without
temporary assignment and this one
actually well I able to compose the
instance of suffocation before through
station they pop out easier is good time
so for the people who were use this so
it took a while for people to be
convinced but what we found was that
once we had some examples and so we've
written some code fragments pushing the
framework more than others I've written
some examples of how to test typical
things you could pretty much the copy a
text and adapting and you can see the
style and you could use the elements
that were present in want to writing on
it and that's it to work pretty well
once we've got your affair basic tests
that people could write that suggests
it's a bit like this once
those are family were able we don't cut
to start off with musta got home it to
expect east and the vocabulary that they
had available to to match more things or
to describe more things that they wanted
to talk rhinitis so as Tom said you know
you can extend to the matches interface
to create all things that you might want
to identify age I purchase a
particularly when we handed the
framework off to another team after a
while so what are you doing over there
are using this that they were washed to
talk about the styles CSS style being
used in the patron we don't sort of
crashing against that something oh very
hardly that what you need is a magical
place within 20 minutes that one of
those so they were really able to extend
the vocabulary of the language that they
had available to them in writing tests
to match things that they were
interested in their customer interesting
right
so I'm the other things that we found
was full support of goods come back so
you'll notice when Tom read the text in
the clips he had some completion from
case to show possible things that you
could do so much identify that you're
matching a link breathe you are ordering
out with ID you can suggest the possible
things that you could do then so that's
quite helpful a reason that we quite
liked having a statically typed language
is so something like Java can eat I'll
doing very well
so stiff so so the tool support worked
well then but the static impulse the
time so what we don't try to do knocks
have everything in a really deep
comparisons hierarchy in the Franco so
then you might possibly get to use it be
something other than changing possibly
in some way to compose things in which
meant that we decided to go with sack
a'junk put some jam five which quite
beautiful just throw out in Uzbekistan
finding another class but the tour
support is important please the topic in
the import start at the top if you have
to organize your important objectives
we're not using any closer I'll just use
the ones that use but the star so
therefore it won't suggest something had
to be a parent that I can see that
the clips but also busy it's a hard
problem to search as well as statins to
suggest so how do we get on with
actually doing the communication part so
i will show you this is one of the tests
that we took our code base this is about
selecting a particular going to occur
optical journey and picking out some
fares and purchase a ticket so this is a
sort of thing where as influencing you
have a query yoga what exactly was the
requirement so we found our full-time
business analyst attract your attention
look we're writing this text you know I
want to know is it right guy supposed to
click on this button or initial go to
this writer should go to this page about
doing the right thing and you'd be able
to use the test as a common discussion
artifact so again not being a full-time
program mentally this house have been
the program in the past but wasn't doing
every day we fit and we don't think
about particularly you can read through
the test you can talk about things are
the same test and you can agree but it's
wrong all right
based on just the word style so you
don't have to say I'll don't worry about
that but that's just a programming and
also when we have to produce report the
customer what are all the things that
are you tested they take this and doing
my straight talk shows removing two
packets just putting a few spaces
between identical items and then you can
pack them up and send them off to a
custom saying this is a list of all the
things your testes and it appears your
requirements document is the tests you
can see that we're doing recovering and
if we have to get me two things putting
the Gospels a white such an approach in
22 we just provide full point Treasury
quite amazing do you encounter case and
got some places in there as well
we also took that from annular testing
scripts so bring the answer to get some
users off the street to try out some
stuff and say okay we have to cart with
a whole all known extra manual testers
going right now back to understand
so so I talked about us doing this job
there is another reason to injure one
thing is all the people who work in our
company how to program in Java which is
useful and not very many of them not as
bromine the same other things he said
it's the common language between the
other things who wants to harness the
tools of your attacks we had changing
any other traits writing so right behind
the fields within if we were to go and
use another language right to fire
another tool these are switch characters
in for masood azhar mode switching
languages it's very much the difficult
things for two different languages in
your head once around the test and
others incremental so with all I keep
hearing the same tool set in the same
that would be a less of a cognitive
difficulty but it has been suggested
that other language it was quite
difficult when charging behave the words
of my order all that punctuation is a
bit messy so maybe Ruby might be better
certainly fewer penetration a bit
meticulously been pushed out back small
talk may be a possibility to do
something so we haven't written many
photo month Hillary quite half ago this
in advance but
so what have you done so we've shown a
jar a guide for Brighton Festival for
literacy hopefully you see how that
makes them readable program isn't
hopefully we tried to keep the style of
programming as close as possible to
natural language and the interesting
crisis that we use that sometimes with
my small things the wrong way to examine
hopefully the tests show clearly the
intention and the requirement and less
focused on the actual a page the test
and the mechanics of the test running
comparions say the HTTP unit tests
motion we've also shown how the test
itself can be a point of discussion
between different kinds of your team
customer we also found that in when one
color to another when you come back to
effect that someone else is written from
a tiny now if it says do click on base
as this page it's very easy to then
replicate that browser the hand I'm
going to trace through some lower-level
coming to work out what the test is
doing so people people was quite fun and
we try to quit up to you and say
adoption was hard work I think people
are more convinced I certainly got to
the point where has all of our texts for
the same project written in this time
and most people were happy with dating
by the enemy had 120 so what's next I
hope to open source the framework in the
next couple weeks or so got your
using council how the general problem or
but we weren't actually using many of
the Maquis featured such a rich very
good but we didn't need and luckily for
coincidentally some of the general
process of recording on a particular
hand press which pulls out the
constraint part so maybe we should just
rely on that rather than the whole game
up other languages as I said maybe Ruby
Falls or and other domains moment and
bridges testing web applications may be
good at this to test of sorts of
application of a slightly different
variant on the phone either match
different sorts of things certainly the
tie it to a different matter testing
testing in polk documents and india is
why are we doing this just for text why
we're writing nuclear tests and why i'll
be writing money clear application comes
as well the main reason my agency
command is them when you're certainly in
java you're interesting with a number of
different AP arms you're much more
constrained patiently i can transform
different things at the same time
whereas at this context you're a bit
more working with one claimant
contesting links on me which is on
you don't have to take service so many
masters so we were able to control them
a bit more so as I say we have project a
producer on the code pages of popular
search engine and currently their phones
out there but the movie in few days so
if you buy something that actually fits
our email addresses an enemy to see any
emails they may have so every or varying
cousins now is the time to answer
precious
so I have a question if javascript is
supported but first of all I would like
to say it is sing really cool and really
impressive thank you admin javascript
isn't I don't get supported but that's
probably through lack of time the the
national rail siding Roberts automat is
doesn't have any JavaScript on its
rather than a 17 / so we wasn't the
focus if we haven't thought about Ajax
but we did see reason why it couldn't
support that
I'm on the big versus with the API and
getting people adopted it will save some
time explaining that because analyst and
your customer but it'll compatible or
was it like you take glory projects to
recover that kind of effort watch what
you think is to be back so I think at
the moment probably inspect people time
clothing framework but hopefully as you
go to a new project that was funded
you're inheriting the extensions which
allow you to it ticular domain or with
particular set of requirements a few
extra a couple of hours work at least if
we went to another web project
management imagining things so hopefully
within a couple of projects so uh
question over here so one can imagine a
firefox plugin that would let you
generate these scripts by working the
browser and so forth what are the
problems with that we thought about it
and would it work or is it beneficial or
not I mean so I certainly haven't not so
great i did so one of the things with
that is you need the application but in
order to record your text one supposed
to text but
so so in that case you wouldn't have the
application to record the test so you
would want to write First Amendment
certainly if you were doing things like
tracking down bucks so you already had
the application production or something
now when I do this this business so if
you could capture that requires
yeah I've been asked to say the name
company my name is Anton marcano from
testing reflection campeon my existing
knowledge base I really like what you've
done and to respond just click into the
javascript thing you can use Javanese
rhino so if you extended this framework
with wine over that allowed to its huge
a script dynamically approaches like
this to rising tester becoming very
popular in the community behavior driven
development j mock has also been one of
those sort of leading lights of your
liking agree EE tests i recently tried
to do this yellow around writing a
similar framework for a web application
and now more recently i mistook for a
multi-platform for chatted TV
application and one of the big problems
that i've had is trying to convince the
other developers to adopt this
particular style readable test you said
that adoptions one you'll be as
challenges and I'm very very interested
to hear how you watch that problem so
basically they had some people beat up
to it we wouldn't have built this thing
you didn't think in the screen so you've
got some people who think the starts
what you obviously have some thinking
that this is something on the work
towards so what we need was reading pair
programming between people who liked it
sure and it wasn't a thing that people
didn't like you it was that they didn't
understand it wasn't the way with over
the humans they want you to be much more
procedure rather than 2kg come out well
into text and get this big it's actually
because like this if this thing so just
sort of standing back and going cooking
but what do we want to detect it what is
the requirement we must act like they're
trailing stop write it down and then
let's try and see how we can cope on
that list of these examples this fall in
that room and then when you get to the
end you can see look in four lines I've
described to that that they and people
forget to be happy with and to like it
warm process but certainly was hard for
some people because I think it is a very
different way of thinking about certain
thinking that job as I taking pending
queue from different backgrounds take
two already ice cream all no strikes are
in a function parenting style with in a
junk cars babysit draw
um
jordan dee Matson from impact medical
systems so I'm very very interesting
very very cool stuff parallels and stuff
I did when I was in Adobe Systems love
to talk to you about it have you
considered instead of time to a
programming language like Java Ruby
small talk all fine I love them all
going with a domain-specific language
and the mobility of translator to
translate to the target language
including that target language being
English I think you look like the action
keyword-based test tools or web test us
did with what they call test verbs you
might find a very nice model because
then it becomes a way for people right
anybody can write the tests even
customers surely there will be put in a
little work as opposed to a life work so
the answer is yes three we have thought
about that and I think the reason we
didn't go in that direction was because
again we had a bunch of job programmers
and we didn't want to introduce any
language we there was a little bit of
risk introducing a new framework at all
so we wanted to keep that risk as small
as possible
you have in place was just that cake
didn't gel we had more in our
programming techniques or support but it
looks like the completion whereas we had
to build that stuff just for buying the
same way boring me sweet the magnets hi
my name's Joe Warren so I work for a
search engine company I just want to
also the JavaScript question in a
different way I think your question is
actually about how do you test
JavaScript application for other eight
right these s in JavaScript and one of
the benefits of this switch pollutant
not clear is the behind the scenes HTTP
Anna was being driven burger in reality
applications and made up all sorts of
things you've got you know swing GUI
your country or maybe got their
applications you've got shell script
databases and stuff and these this kind
of automation can be plugged in very
easily in these libraries so he could
quite easily set have you know sir that
the database contains talking about that
and in particular the JavaScript there
are lots of tools there's and that's the
stinging work but so remote controller
and there's also same simple average
like to explore gay rights which
automate and browsers directly and
directs 10 APR Absalom so I didn't have
a question is hijacking see Freeman
independent couple points so what is a
commercial is that price
I have a paper in coming up slow about
how the general language came about
embedding a nice visit language in Java
the question I had was with which I
current noticed a little bit in the last
test you showed is the main language of
got it in the domain of HTML let's say
and my temptation is to start moving to
do nain language to describe which trail
train lines what it was called did you
find yourself itching up that way what
we found mostly so he didn't try and
extend the framework itself to support
that since the building up pressure but
we did find was a pretty much the last
was the test where it says we might plan
the default journey which was actually
just a java method we've wrapped a whole
bunch of other statements which we
wanted to use in a number of our texts
as you like we're going through a web
page which is and secrets of pages okay
yeah when it goes through and do the
Bristol month of journey and with
workshop bends the interesting thing so
what we found was we just ended up
writing song ends in some classes
up and you reuse that someone but we
hadn't thought about making that more
Mitchell
chosen from working productions I find
that it's wonderful to have tests that
my coders can read my testers can read
my users can read my business analyst
can read but I'll span is important
threshold so if i take for instance our
website that may in connection with
please don't say view our national rail
is particularly sensitive back but
there's a lot of tests i could generate
that talk about back buttons and those
web pages and only some of them would
really find problem i get an awful lot
of bored people around me do you have a
second set of tests particular the
negative things of the common tutorials
which don't fall into this or is this a
primary approach to testing within the
project i think this is our primary
protein testing I think what make is
that will miss out conditions and stuff
won't get tested and that's it I agree
it's a general problem or with the point
you're making also yeah that's the one
it's not vary from s3 I'm to go back to
the idea of the translating a scripting
language into it's kind of cold they
know which i doing now and we find it's
working really well because one of the
things it does is when something picks
up that language they're not right in
John any more than ever
PHP what they're doing is writing their
tests it's very much in a testing
language I think maybe that would help
with all coming some of the problems of
you and they're talking about where
people see John they're calling a job in
their idea and so they're expecting to
work in the same kind of a job we're
actually trying to do it's something
very different what standard programming
language would do you have mean if step
in where the test is just what to do
those really two top down very different
approach well what am I I think the
question I had was are you considered
having kind of a status display in the
test so you can see what web page is
doing as you're running through the test
early on you said people like it because
when there's a theory that go back to
the beginning of the testament following
through manual what about if the rig
will show you where it was at important
times when you get applications in other
title Google you can see what that p it
was very then hopefully quickly see
where the fault lies yeah I think that
would be great especially like when your
test fails for its amended the current
HTML via I couldn't figure out happily
back in the days work saying
I think I wasn't hi Curtis Pope pearl
foundation first of all I'd like to
congratulate you the stuff looks
wonderful none of the problems I
constantly had developing applications
and testing things obviously is kind of
communicating customers saying please
use the application taste of speed
bathrooms what's going on and usually
then we give them feedback about say
three thirty in the morning second sucks
now you're talking about sending this up
off your customers are they actually
reading this stuff are they actually
comedy about the actual tests are you
getting better feedback from this so we
have business analysts reading actually
supporting identify you think checking
index testicles I don't think the
customers read the whole book or
capacity I mean they were happier than
they had to report
so yeah so we haven't had to be honest
the opportunity to really work directly
the customer and developing the text i
think i would be interesting taking you
know your customer rep since you've seen
them down with a developer having the
talk about st. they can come up with the
test again and the first place would be
the be interesting and that's something
we would love to try i think the
opportunity to do hi it's Alex I think
literate programming in general is a
nice idea and Lizabeth testing is also a
good one as well other languages like
small talk operating very literal style
and also to a lesser extent at the
script it's obviously written in a very
digital way but don't you find sometimes
the programmers have a real difficult
idea of trying to work in a little style
bother than a normal programming stuff
there's the video aren't many
applescript developers because don't get
their head around how it works but those
that do find it really productive nor
wondered if you from similar thing to
your testers yeah I think that was the
theory to expect some of the Valentin
liked it oh yeah this is cool the
building is some of my Mary don't gave
Wi-Fi we drink why we've been writing it
this way because they can recover well
the Java code even perhaps better if
they understood the way so I think maybe
here's some things for some people
different things to different me I think
that between example is a good ones that
all programmers come for it and see
between 9 comet well there is a non
program we've come to its able to
actually me so I think that's that kind
of those are very important when you're
sad
actually my condo again custom
collections com aylin volume with the
slogan again I'm interested and
intrigued to know what I can see that
I'll see your primary users of this our
developers and the audience if you like
our customers and if you're leaving I'm
in Chester don't did you look at
framework like Fitz or off it and
fitness for example along with skill
Rick markridge's fun little makes it
when I talk about the fit my gram sure
did you consider using those and if so
what were the reasons for choosing this
particular car so we didn't look at it I
think that's good but immediately
looking at it in the 30s okay sheet
which wasn't grow we couldn't see how to
test everything that we wanted to text
which will see immediately have some
like testing on this web page navigate
to this one then try this thing so we
found personally doing it this way was
more flexible for us great fabulous
later how did all this up the bits but
it was taking as we found you might be a
bit constrained by the table structure
we might want to write much more in the
line in much less another or you want
watch to do things alone or do this
thing on this page and do this
differently on the southern page and
then follow it through that way so that
was our experience
enid ultimately 13 services I've noticed
that you've got basically a single
social structure reserved mat and then
anything else that you want to write you
haven't written the liquor away so I
would like to see get fit or one adult
and no children and you haven't written
by that is that because in this style
writing these sentence structures is
just too difficult I don't think it's
too difficult I think it's differently
it's more difficult so writing the
framework is hard using the framework is
hopefully easier than writing the
Franklin so writing things but in Java
the support the literal silence my heart
so some of our both straining where to
have fermer worked that won't make it
right more littering see that you need
to know how to violent words we wanted
to the jiggler avi rather than his much
go to use so from that one view it was
less clear to them how to follow the
style and I think it is doing just a bit
amazing just referring here but I think
that is possibly do have some test cases
but it was so he took longer to write
back to my head man sources technology
there's an interesting comment you had
about versa last about the scripting of
cooking fix on web page he said that you
could rotate the advanced resistors we
could write the test before the
application was written directly you
could extend this dessert right tested
from further back and say could you
extract tests from a functional
specification rather than writing the
festival award that being a bit too but
I'm sure we can do that what we did do
in this project was annotate each test
with the requirements really not quite
what you're asking but it's kind of
related so if we had a record of which
requirements we had implemented so in
this case we did have a requirements
document which isn't always true but we
found that actually useful to tell us
which bits we ended
so all my question hello future
regarding privileged access limited I'm
wondering if you've considered if
somebody wanted to use a data-driven
approach because this is very code heavy
so if you had a thousand tests were
making a good issue that ideally I think
people should have a some kind of flat
file with those tests nature in which
can then be thrown into a framework
written like this because in rather says
but then you need to be able to post
pass everything to connect could you
report change the testing the way that
you've described them so they readable
if you thought about that but I would
say that I think this is very the kind
of test the application testing is very
behavior-driven maybe wiggle for the
amount is data sets that need to be
tested I don't know but I think these
tests are very kneadable to
applications i have brought some complex
behaviors and navigations and not sure
if the kind of tests the kind of
application you're talking about fits
into that category I think was something
that's bit so you have a flat file that
you're is eventually that's not this
sort of representation there might be a
mapping from this text into the
representation by emotion there's a
single mapping Mac so my dissing it
didn't make any sense basically it was
great got a break for lunch
