morning everybody I'm really pleased to
have Kathy borner here from Indiana
University visiting us she's been doing
some really really exciting stuff with
visualizing all kinds of stuff she used
to be an eye I person but will we won't
mention that here this talk is going to
be videoed for google video so please
keep all those incredibly confidential
questions that even Kathy should not be
hearing to yourselves for now ok so I'll
turn over you guys Thank You Ella se
microphone on yet seems to be working
good morning everybody I have this a
very long title for this talk which you
probably have read in the announcement
but I thought I could just tell you the
story of science maps because this is
maybe why you are here and so I will
take you up to 10,000 feet altitude and
show you science or our scholarly
knowledge which we have so far mostly
English speaking on the maps which we
have right now from above and then I
take you behind the curtains of how we
actually create those maps and then I
bring you a little bit further down and
show you some more local maps which we
are doing for clients so many of the
clients which are working form they are
lost in space and they're lost in data
space and one reason for this is that
there are lots of scholars are there
which are producing a heck of a lot of
publications and data sets and software
and say all are out there and and people
need to make sense of them and there
used to be a time where it was possible
that one human brain could basically
capture all of mankind's knowledge could
use it and could contribute to it and so
these little bubbles here represent all
of the knowledge and then the white
bubble is one but one brain can
basically take in and they are not that
when she was one of the lucky ones which
could still do this then it started
growing and growing more and more and
then still there were few people which
could actually make major contributions
to a few areas of science today we are
very
very specialized and our brains are not
really growing and as long as we have to
fit through the best channel we are not
going to grow much more and so one neat
we have is to actually interconnect
brains and the question then becomes
what kind of towards can we provide
people with that then help them to make
sense of our collective knowledge
because otherwise we are just going to
end up reinventing the wheel and
reinventing the wheel until we reinvent
it again and we might not solve the
problems we actually are facing and of
course some people try to be clever some
people stretch their brains really sin
and wide and they also called managers
knowing nothing about a largent and the
main experts PhD students which just
because of the reputation system there
as opposed to go like needles down into
the ground and still they're stuck with
their little brains same kind of brain
and even though some of you or some
other people out so i might have hundred
times better brains to me there's nobody
out there who has a million times better
brain and yet our knowledge is growing
and growing and growing so there's
really this tidal wave of knowledge out
there and the one solution might be maps
maps have guided man kinds of
explorations for centuries and say have
helped them to find sacred places they
have helped them to avoid monsters and
so what we started doing is to bring the
knowledge which seeds 300 currently
living scientometrics have harvested and
accumulated over the many years of
scientific endeavors out to the general
public and also to other ivory towers so
it's us scientometrics which study
science by scientific means taking their
knowledge to other ivory towers out
there but also hopefully to the general
public to the people which really need
to make sense of this knowledge until we
created this exhibit places and spaces
mapping science and actually somebody
was just asking for henry small and he's
right up here don't know if i have any
kind of laser pointer here i didn't
bring any
no what's this point no the middle
person in the top right most photograph
is Henry small he's one of the pioneers
of mapping science on a large scale
never talked about this a little later
so we created an extra bit which has an
online present at presence thank yous
I'm not sure and an exhibit which has
also a physical presence and we can of
course also display those maps on large
tiled walls and we can have big globes
and projects things on there and the
exhibition is envisioned there is a ten
year ten iteration Xzibit the first
iteration of the exhibit aims to show
people the power of maps and it's always
for existing maps compared to six
potential maps of science and we do not
claim that those maps are the ultimate
maps of science instead we would like
people to think about how to chart and
map and navigate better what we
collectively know and as you might know
the first maps of our planet we are not
perfectly accurate and still they were
helpful to people people didn't get lost
anymore and it's also interesting of
course that those maps could always
abuse by people which actually paid for
them those people they looked most
prosperous they had the most gorgeous
woman laying around their land and they
had saliste monsters and devastating
events going on and it's interesting to
realize that even 300 years back in time
this was what was known about the
continents we have and you still see him
the artifact which got copied again and
again that California is an island and
you also see how incredibly honest those
map makers back then where's it just
didn't draw what they didn't know and I
appreciate honesty so how would a map of
science look like what Matt of us might
work best so the first iteration of the
exhibit which you can see down here if
you like to crouch on the floor
shows you six different matter of us
applied it's just no link diagrams three
maps for those which know them to your
spatial matter was software matter of
cross maps and galaxies metaphor used
and i will show you some apsos and
explains them in more detail and it is
not that we claim any of those might be
the best metaphor but again we want
people to think about cells so this is a
map done by a PhD student who had a very
hard time to explain to his PhD advisor
what his PhD topic thesis was about he
just couldn't communicate it and etsy
way and he gave up on this thing he went
to London to just have a nice time
forget about this saying start new and
in London he saw that you map and so he
is like oh I can represent all these
abstract lines of salt as a tube map and
he did and he it turns out that his
advisor really like tube maps and he
also now finally understood what was
going on what are the major trains of
thought in his seizes how are they
interconnected via different stations
and changing tunnels etc this is a map
done by a cartographer who mapped the
space of geography over the last ten
years based on abstract submitted to the
annual geographers conference about
22,000 abstracts in total and here you
see a self-organizing map layout of
those 22,000 abstracts where abstracts
which are very similar to each other
form mountain those are mostly more
coherent areas of research and then
there are valleys and in particular
there is this valley which is surrounded
by mountains of space research community
research woman I don't know this is
actually our best-selling map maybe and
some people think it's just nice around
other people saying no that's woman also
on the they study also migration and
population and then there's this
large area here which looks like a
valley kind of very inhomogeneous
homogeneous way a diffuse area and the
question is assess the valley of the
lost and confused researchers or is it
actually a very fruitful research
environment because the settlements from
all the mountains are now going down
there creating very very rich very
prosperous environment and to answer
this question you would have to fold in
new data and see what happens to those
people Android scooping did also very
neat overlays of life trajectories of
major Academy members and he also used
it actually for job interviews showing
what the strengths and and trajectories
of the potential employees wear this map
of all of science was up to last year up
to two thousand five actually one of the
most comprehensive maps of science has
ever generated it's based on more than
17,000 have scientific papers and their
citation patterns it's using an post
directed spring layout algorithm VX odd
which wasn't developed at Sandia
National Labs so those papers which are
they similar to each other closer and
space and those which are not so often
co-sited they're farther apart this map
is then rotated and mirrored in a way
that mathematics as the purest of all
Sciences is on the top and then there's
physics which is due to this layout
chemistry the biomedical research areas
psychology statistics and back into math
and computer science hovers underneath
mass and if you fold in is I proceedings
and you will actually get to see that
computer science becomes much more
dominant because a lot of research Sarah
is published in proceedings now if you
have such a base map and there's
actually a very nice story coming this
is me that you should read at some point
if you have a chance then you can use it
to show where certain
areas of research are such as
nanotechnology proteomics of
pharmacogenomics you can just query for
these words and they highlight according
to matching words there's no rocket
science involved you could of course
also use it to overlay major export and
import patterns between the different
sciences you can overlay funding
patterns and I will see it show you some
of those visualizations later now this
was the year number one last year we aim
to show the power of reference systems
the need for having a reference to
actually make sense of any kind of
information which you try to display so
again for existing ones contrasted with
six potential reference systems for
representing science more visually and
of course you might know that there are
lots of scientific communities which
have battled hard battles about agreeing
on standards and keeping this sem and
this is one of the more known ones
because they teach taught in school they
are geospatial reference systems they
astronomical reference systems and
imagine you have to create an
astronomical reference system where
everything rotates about everything else
it's very very tricky to actually even
think about starting to get a reference
system and yet astronomers now have a
system that they can point at any
segment of the sky and retrieve data
retrieve observation which we papers
relevant to this particular sky segment
and it's a great way of actually
organizing their data and also
collaborating communicating about data
so how might a reference system for all
of science look and how many dimension
might it have well you could start with
one dimension this is actually a
redesign of dingle fields old map of CM
all the many discoveries that led to the
watson-crick seminal paper on the DNA
structure on the left hand side
on the right-hand side we took this
seminal paper which is here all these
dots are actually papers these linkages
are citation linkages which which come
from old papers and providing input to
new discoveries this is Watson and
Crick's paper with a little copy of it
right here front page it's actually in
the IU library and down here you have
this paper again but now you have all
the follow-up research which was based
on it the most highly cited most highly
interconnected papers and back in
nineteen sixty four wen Jing Garfield
did this work he was very interested to
see if you could automatically write the
history of science and he was interested
to compare it with work by in this case
an historian of science Asimov and to
find out the differences between what
you can capture automatically and what
you cannot and as we also realized when
people from the Cold Spring Harbor lab
interpreted this new map here there are
things which are not captured in
citation linkages such as love and hate
junt and all kinds of things which don't
end up being in papers and sale in the
linkage patterns but I think you can do
still a very good job in showing
trajectories and showing the main works
and showing what is a research paper
what is a seminal paper and how they are
interconnected this is work by martine
button bag which you might be familiar
with this is the evolution of one
Wikipedia page on evolution in this case
this is the beginning of the page you
see three different colors corresponding
to three different users which started
this page and then each over time time
goes from left to right more and more is
added or sometimes also deleted
sometimes they are massive deletions
going on here and at the end you have a
page which is generated by many many
many people and it's impressive to
actually see this visually depicted like
this this is the beginning of the page
as it was in place on sixteenth of july
in 2003 at a certain time and you see
the color coding going on this is all
see by one user and this user coding is
here
next part this is a little bit of white
so the color coding that corresponds
directly to Z different layers which you
see here so this is a one and a half d
kind of representation time and length
of the page this is work which was done
in my lab in collaboration with Brad
Paley we were interested to show the
goodness-of-fit of a taxonomy or
ontology or classification hierarchy to
the underlying data and we used here in
this particular case the US patent
hierarchy which is 180 thousand
different categories in which three
million patterns are organized so
imagine you are a librarian trying to
optimize this hierarchy to the incoming
stream of patents and it's an almost
impossible task I think what we wanted
to do is to show the entire hierarchy
and then also show in how far these
patterns which are currently classified
into those different classes fits a mean
of this class and so we computed and
calculated and it turns out that you
need about 10 meter I don't know how
many foot x 3 something's filling foot
to actually just plot this patent
hierarchy with four PT type font and
over plotting this is how long how large
this class classification hierarchy is
it goes up to 15 levels deep and we
didn't have so much space so all images
in this law in this X abilities actually
30 x 24-in to see files which they are
hanging in the exhibit these are smaller
versions of them so we decided to only
plot down to the third level of the
hierarchy and to plot it in 25 neat
columns so if you count this should be
25 over here so this is the first class
major class and all these up classes and
sub sub classes is the second major
class subclasses up subclasses etc and
down to the end if you have this carpet
now you have a reference system a 25
column here
quickly intended reference system
unusual but maybe workable and you can
then zoom into certain areas here and
actually see that you can really kind of
read this if it's printed with 380 DPI
and you can also then zoom into
different areas in the interactive
version of the system you can zoom in
here and you will see that each patent
now is represented by a ball and the
height of the ball corresponds to how
good this pattern fits into this
category and obviously those four guys
don't really fit so well that kind of
nails sticking out which you might like
to have more in but you can't really
change those patterns around so maybe
you have to check them and maybe
potentially reclassify things but
everything else seems to be rather fine
in this area of the hierarchy then we
also overlaid citations to one of the
patterns this is the patent on gore-tex
and so you see that it is cited all
across the different patent classes
which is quite amazing pattern and we
also included a patent on gold
nanoshells these are these little gold
shells which you can inject in your
blood streams a cluster around tumors
and then you can activate them and they
basically destroy tumor so it may need
technique and I hope it makes it to a
human treatment also and you see that
this patent also cites patterns from
many many different classes in NZ
current holdings of the US patent office
this is a map of scientific paradigms
776 scientific paradigms which are major
communities and science and again it's
for spring embedding layered algorithm B
X or again now you actually have a
reference system kind of the dot one or
clockwise and you can now say well
analytical chemistry or let's say
organic chemistry is at three o'clock
viola G is at six o'clock and you can
actually talk and it's
at five out of the middle and you can
actually talk about this on the phone
which is very useful for those which
then help interpret those maps now we
also well this is actually worked by
Kevin boy eye candy Clarence and they
also operate the vitality scale here
vitality represents how quickly the
different Sciences incorporate new
knowledge how quickly they decide on it
and what's the average publication year
of society references are and you see
that areas which live on eprints
astrophysics and physics they have a
very high vitality with this measure
whereas other areas which live on
journals it takes a while before those
are population before the next paper
which then cites these papers are
published et cetera and the other Mary
is also of course which live on books
which are even longer in the new york
hall of science which is a children's
museum five minutes from laguardia
airport you can also currently ZZ a
physical acts a bit of the mapping
science exhibit and we have their so
called illuminated diagram display which
Bradford Radford Paley and some of his
colleagues and set up here you have
combined high-resolution printouts of
maps with projected light overlays and
what you can then do is to enjoy the
300-plus DPI of printed quality and the
interactivity of see data overlays you
can interoperate with this display wires
its touch panel and as you see here you
have a map of science and a map of the
world you can then touch any of those
areas of science and on the map of the
world you will see highlight who is
conducting this kind of research at the
same time if you click here let's say on
Howard University you will see what kind
of research they conduct overlaid on the
map of science there are also these
buttons down here for more
interdisciplinary areas such as
nanotechnology so you will see who which
area of science conduct snow no
technology and two on our plan
is conducting it and similarly of people
buttons and so if you click for instance
on Albert Einstein you will see all his
papers and the papers which site is
papers and then the papers which sites
are papers at site is papers in both
maps so you see his spreading of impact
and influence in the map of science and
on the world and it's all based on is I
datum and by the way science is also
quite beautiful and you might see that
the patterns of scholarly activity on
our planet very similar to these night
on earth images which you might have
seen this year's exhibited is all about
the power of forecasts so we are going
to contrast for existing forecasts which
six potential science weather forecasts
the ultimate goal is to really serve
daily science forecasts here you see a
very neat depiction of the movement of
our continents and actually if you see
this an animation you really get scared
that you're living on those very quickly
moving I'm leaving continent but they
also predictions way out in the future
and it's kind of interesting to see how
the substrate on which we live is going
to evolve over time of course you are
familiar with weather forecasts and by
the way people have battled up about how
to best the Pyxis and how to make it
useful form general public there's some
very amazing visualizations by NASA on
named storms and here you see for
instance Karina and Lee and you have
this black line drawn whenever there's a
touchdown of the storm and a scientific
revolution might actually look very
similar it destroys existing knowledge
frontiers it destroys existing
structures and make space for new
structures or it leaves devastation
so this is the part where I'm going to
talk a little bit more about the scene
behind the scene work which we are doing
obviously trying to graph and map
mankind scholarly knowledge is a
non-trivial Enterprise involving
terabytes of data and also involving a
lot of data integration issues that I
guess how Allen and I met well after we
also met my artificial intelligence and
it involved a lot about studying
networks and that's where network
science comes in and then of course
mapping using google maps or other
technologies so well there are cyber
infrastructure developers and there are
mapmakers right developers mapmakers
developers map makers which group do you
want to join who wants to be a developer
let's see all right now Mako maybe
somebody anybody all right one two three
all right so fortunately it's not this
way so we actually have quite
interesting portfolio of people working
on this and this is just the people in
my team whereas these are some of the
map maybe make us the maps you just have
seen on the screen in the lab Center I'm
directing we have people from Miss
computer science background of course
information science but then also AM
physicists and lots of designers you
have a lawyer which is all screwed to
have if people interested in education
and all those people have an interest in
making scholarly knowledge more
accessible to people or helping other
clients also in the biomedical area
making sense of terabytes of data so
talking about data integration as you
know many of the data set scholarly
datasets today they are kept in silos
for proprietary reasons for reasons that
is just hard to enter links them and
maybe those are hard to get resources
for it but in many cases grants are not
linked to papers and papers are not
linked to patents and in particular
there's also no unique also identifier
which is a real problem
people are interested in people so they
want to see a map of science and see
themselves in this map so you want to
see other people they know and if you as
a person have three different identities
in our database it's going to be an
issue because first of all you don't get
all your citation counts and your paper
counts and second people are not going
to find everything about you and we had
a very interesting workshop at the end
of August at Indiana University which
brought together on one table imagines a
scopus and ISI and OCLC trying to
discuss how to potentially get unique
also identify us and it would be very
useful for my kind of work but also for
their products to have such an out a way
to and identify answers now imagine it
would be solved imagine visa would be a
way to interlink grants and papers and
patterns and people then you have
networks which you can analyze and you
can use those networks to identify
highly prolific authors in terms of
papers or citations you can also
determine the strengths of kopi I or
call also who inventor relations you can
animate those networks you can show
their growth over time on top of a map
of science or on top of Google Maps or
just in a normal timeline etc there are
lots of advantages of having this what
we started to do is to create what we
call a scholarly database which tries to
federate different databases keeping
their native data format but also
providing a central document table how
we call it to query against all of sorts
and we have a unique query interface
uniform query interface where you can
select what you want to query maybe NSF
or let's say NIH funding and medline
publication let's see if all those
people which actually got the funding
also produce papers which is one of the
major outcomes of research typically and
you can also of course query for certain
name etc this is the yearly coverage of
the different datasets we have right now
and we end the process of actually
getting automatic and continuous updates
for many of
and as you see some societies have spent
quite a bit of money to get their data
into a form that can be used to tell him
and I think it is very nice to do this
and I hope many other societies are
going to follow you can also take those
data sets and you can show that your
spatial coverage here we just took the
zip codes from asses and overlaid it on
it using google maps on map of us and
though you see matt lange publications
the larger the rings and more
publications they have NIH funding you
see in Nebraska there's actually quite a
bit of funding no not many publications
and they might have done something else
with some money they might have just
saved people's lives which is a very
good thing to do but you can look at
these patterns now this is us patterns
and actually us patterns the nice thing
about all these visualizations is that
you quickly see what's what's wrong
maybe there's a ship out they are doing
a lot of patterns but i doubt it
actually so it's it's always kind of
liked it visual debugging tool for me
and i like this i think it's very
attractive to women to be able to
visually see what went wrong okay so how
come how do we actually analyze these
data sets well we build ourselves a tool
and we build it because we just had to
we had to find a way to actually analyze
so many data sets and to make use of so
many different algorithms which are
typically involved in analyzing
scholarly data so typically it's an
entire pipeline you get the data you
clean it you clean it again you've spent
eighty percent of your time cleaning the
data and integrating it because if you
don't have clean data sea maps are going
to be bad so you clean your data again
then you analyze the data then you lay
it out and you design the ultimate of
finished visualization and then
oftentimes you also want some kind of
interactivity so that you can filter and
zoom and get details on demand using
Venn Schneiderman's mantra
they're so what we realized was that we
do not want to create a big Cathedral of
a cyber infrastructure first of all of
your comparable small lab also we we
just don't believe in those big
monolithic things we wanted to have a
marketplace instead where you can plug
and play data sets as you need them and
so we started to design software glue or
we called it later on cyber
infrastructure shell or side shell for
short which allows you to integrate data
sets and algorithms written in many
different languages using very different
data formats and the idea is also that
we can actually maintain or will be able
hopefully to maintain such a little
piece of glue as opposed to am a huge
Cathedral also we realize that they
actually a lot of application holders
out there which have very good data sets
and algorithms and we don't want to
reimplement them instead we want to
provide a bridge between algorithm
developers which in many cases are
social scientists and biologists and
physicists and others which are not
computer scientist by training and those
which are using those algorithms and
data sets which in many cases are also
not computer scientists so this needs to
be bridged in a better way the side
shell is an empty shell that supports
easy integration of algorithms by
algorithm developers and easy use of
algorithms by algorithm uses and in
particular you can not only plug and
play data sets and algorithms but also
different interfaces some people like
scripting interfaces some people like
menu-driven interfaces and they are then
also a number of services which to
workflow support for those which are
needed or scheduler form jobs which run
forever and this is all financed by an
NSF so any of your developers and your
users and actually our develops don't
look like this in many cases the
developers which do the algorithm
developed
it meant say our people which are not
programmers by training and so they get
a visit driven way to integrate their
algorithms which might come in Fortran
and Java and to see and other languages
and have a way to bring them into em
sighs shell which is built on osgi and
then they are users which are also not
programmers which can't use scripting
languages they can't operate on I tried
it with my mom it just doesn't work and
there are many people out there which
which have data and needs to make sense
of these data sets and they can't work
on the command level they need
interfaces which they can operate and
then still say it's this part of scishow
where we really need the the best
programmers out Sam so I already
mentioned that satchel is spilled on
osgi so we leverage a lot of the effort
which was already done there how many of
you are familiar with osgi okay good
good so it's an industry standard which
is actually supported and contributed by
many major companies out there and it's
widely adopted in the open source realm
now also and so by being osgi compliant
and just adding another service and a
little bit more standard to the osgi
framework see hope is that we can
actually then also create a bridge
between what is created in academia to
what is potentially useful for industry
use so all the side shell algorithms
seize our social layer cake everything
is osgi compliant so you can immediately
take our side shell modules and plug
them into Austria architectures which is
a nice thing to have so here you see
different basic services and application
services and framework components and
actually there's an entire talk about
how this layer cake operates and why it
operates the way it does and this would
take another hour which I don't have so
I'm going to skip this here but please
come and I have some
and about the technical details with me
and and also look online at scishow org
nice thing so about osgi is that it also
allows that us to deploy our site shall
services either a server client or peer
to peer or standalone services which is
very useful for the different
applications we have in mind so coming
back to how we are actually using this
there's a NSF funded project on which is
called net web workbench which aims to
create a workbench for Network
scientists which like to do a network
sampling analysis and visualization
modeling and so on and use either p I
team here you see also the software team
notice that both teams are led by woman
see amount and duration is here for
those who are interested we have an
advisory board some of you might know
some of those people there and notice
also that these people come from all
different areas of science which is very
important because we really would like
to harvest the best algorithms out there
to bring them into one tool and to make
them available to those which study
networks and of course for I'm very
interested in directing this project
because I would love to benefit from the
best algorithms out saying to himself a
network sampling analysis clustering
visualization because I think I could
use some favorably for mapping mankind's
knowledge so the deliverables are the
glue which you have seen a little bit
off then there's cnet workbench tool
which you will see a little bit more
then there are the online maps of
science which are in the work and then
there's also a bio-port on which will
make these tools available to biologists
and biomedical people and of course
there's documentation and there's a
marketplace kind of community wiki which
helps people to see what kind of
resources exist this is the current
Network bench to an easy way to just use
a menu-driven way of making sense of a
lot of data that's lots of different
algorithms so you see you can load data
everything you do is locked you can
rerun these locks later on
does a schedule of where you can change
the sequence of stuff you're running or
you can set different priorities you can
select Preferences all the data models
you currently loaded show up on the
right hand side here and then you can of
course look at your data or look at
other data in different ways you can
download it and play with it yourself
these are some of the algorithms which
we have currently in the tool and it's
about 40 of them and still I'm wondering
why people are downloading it right now
I think right now the tool on the tool
is most interesting because of size
shell because of the way it interlinks
the different algorithms it's not
interesting yet so much because of the
algorithms even though some of our
collaborators they are perfectly happy
with the current filling if you wish the
community website online has more
information about the different data
formats about the different algorithms
etc and it's just a wiki you can just go
in and edit it and you can also wish for
certain algorithms and I would really
hope it really evolved into a
marketplace of scholarly data and
scholarly algorithms this is the data
conversion graph which we have right now
so is your CV integrated some young
modules and previews models and then
support some data formats which other
outside tools use so let me go over to
the third and final part of my talk a
potential future and I could also have
called it science maps in action and of
course children are first so I'm going
to talk about them first and by the way
on all these maps in large format but
also in small formats they are available
for sale and all the income we use to
actually bring those maps to schools to
print them for free and to hang them you
have seen this before this was the
display touch panel for the illuminare
diagram display we use see topic map and
see geographic map
two maps and rendered them for children
which son looks a little different so
this is the map of the world you see the
data still under laying here in greenish
and we also added inventors and
inventions and in particular we wanted
to have a set of inventions and
inventors which kind of equality
distributes over a map of science and
over a map of the world and that's
tricky because if you're open science
book in America you will get a lot of
American inventions and adventures if
you open one in Germany you get a lot of
European ones and I didn't try Asian
ones they assume as a similar effect and
then of course those invention inventors
had to also lay out on the map of
science more equally so this is actually
a slight and seek parcel a physical
puzzle where you have little riches
where you can move your puzzle pieces
around and then you have to find the
right place where they go and these are
the event was on the map of the world
kind of a mock-up offices and this is
the map of science with more information
on what is going on in the different
areas of science and these are overlays
of the puzzle pieces and you see we
tried to make it easier to have dango
dango door and another researcher /
years to make it easier also for people
to see where things go but it's still
quite a challenge for adults and for
children are like to put those places
pieces in the right place we went into a
schools with this also and it was
interesting to see that after having
heard of discoverers and actually this
was a first second grade combined class
they were familiar with Columbus and his
discovery of America and then we told
him that also discover us in that
science and they took on these maps of
science just like a map of the world so
it didn't find this strange say sodium
it's just a map and you can again map
see trajectories of nature discover us
you can map nature discard major
inventions and inventors and at the end
we actually asked them to find their
place in
ions and there was a seven-year-old
which told I want to be a nuclear
physicist and so she put a little star
right in one of those maps and I think
it's nice to have a way that little ones
can find their place in science which is
right now pretty different computing and
interviews for them in many cases they
don't even know how the different topics
they're having in the different classes
physics chemistry biology etc how they
interrelate with HS and many cases these
are just boxes they do we also had some
puzzles for them so they could color out
things and dive into a science deeper
and deeper and become an entomologist my
sponsors are next this is where money
comes from sofa this is one of the
latest base maps of science by Kevin boy
again Richard Clarence it uses one point
0 7 million papers and see 24 million
references in those to create a map of
all of science and then you can use this
as a base map and overlay funding
patterns to identify core funding for
instance so this is the US Department of
Energy this is NSF this is NIH NSF NIH
NSF so it's very interesting that there
are some areas which are funded by balls
but there are also some otherwise it's
very nicely complimentary actually and
and there are many other maps we have
generated that time is running out here
scientists are next sets me right there
sometimes I want to see how the field of
information visualization evolved over
time these notes are now people not
labeled by the last name of the answers
this is one conference out of three
infovis conferences no journals
notebooks are captured in this data
still you can see major evolution of
co-authorship relations in us because
this conference is mostly attended by US
researchers and practitioners and
educators and you see that
the color coding shows you how many
citations are people received and the
size of the node corresponds to the
number of publications so what you want
to have is a big node which is dark
don't want to have a big node which is
yellow because it just means you
published a lot but nobody really cared
decided or you just recently published a
lot and nobody had a chance to cite you
yet so this is an interpretation issue
now we also cannot quoted the edges and
all you see is that some co-authorship
linkages are rather old and others
spring green very young and you see that
people which work together in a major
research lab such as Xerox PARC called
robertson and mckinley book for the most
obsess data that at xerox parc have a
very different citation pattern from in
ben shneiderman who works in a
university setting and basically
collaborates with this incoming outgoing
stream of students and you can also
label those clusters and you see the
people which are in one place they
typically collaborate so place still
matters a lot I also sometimes signed
tools for myself for my own needs this
is a management system for our data
which pertains to all our activities in
the lab center and these are all the
different entities I have to keep track
of so of course there are people there
are research projects there are teaching
activities they're all the publications
presentations events we are organizing
or attending data sets we use or
generate software we use or generate
hardware we use funding etc now if you
organize it in this way it's a network
and you can now if you get a call on the
phone about an intern which you had four
years ago in the lab for months you can
now pull this name art and everything
associated with this person comes with
it so I get all the publications which
potentially came out of this
collaboration I get all the data sets
algorithms he touched or she touched I
get all the other things which are he or
she might have been involved in
similarly if somebody has to update
hardware our system admin he can pull it
out and he sees what kind of projects
are going to be affected what people you
might have to inform etc and there are
other usages such as writing progress
reports to all the many funding agencies
from which we are happy to receive
funding and this is also much easier now
because I can just give him a times
duration and a certain project and I get
a listing of all the many things we have
done for this project of course we can
also visualize those networks we can
show Corp I should networks or our
networks with c funding we have we can
also show students which also poured it
from different grants now we can map our
travels he again using google maps and
we can zoom into a map of us zoom in
father and so you see that DC and New
York because of the exhibit also but
then also Indianapolis and Chicago major
trajectories and you can even look at
this kind of pattern you can see where
we go most because it's color-coded in
time older ones are dog younger ones are
more light green and you might say well
maybe we need to go a little bit more
left next year because we didn't do this
so much and we need to spread it more to
the more downwards maybe geospatially
and of course you could also overlay
this on a map of science to more about
industry projects we have done this is
by a student Daniel quartz he has looked
at fast and grow slowly growing domains
in terms of patenting activity and we
have also looked at portfolios of
different companies and in particular he
was interested to identify patent Mills
people would try to make money with
patents and those people typically try
to capture and cover more more
intellectual space and hear all these
yellow areas in decay
the number of patterns which have been
made in new pattern classifications
which haven't been used for five years
by this particular person and you see
Apple Computer typically patterns in the
same areas again and again this is a
tree map layout and general mammals and
he tries to have more and more in new
areas capturing more and more
intellectual spaces when we also in the
process of mapping Indiana's
intellectual space to identify pockets
of innovation and pathways which ideas
take to become products and also we are
interested in the interplay of industry
and academia and all we did some first
visualizations and the plan is to also
serve advisees illuminated diagram
displays and that's the end thanks for
your attention and feel free to take
