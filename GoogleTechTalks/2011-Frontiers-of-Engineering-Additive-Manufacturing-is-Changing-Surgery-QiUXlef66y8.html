is Andy Kristensen I'm not Andy for a
number of years and the truly is one of
the pioneers and using additive
manufacturing for medical purposes so
I'm looking forward to hearing this
speech as well so welcome Andy good
thank you thanks everybody it's a
pleasure for me to be here today I feel
like I will definitely walk away knowing
much more than I give but hopefully to
kind of take what you've what we learned
already this morning and put a different
spin on it so I think Brent did a great
job of kind of elaborating and all the
technologies and I think for me that
makes it easier I'm not going to talk
about much of the detail of those
technologies but show some of the
applications specifically for medical
purposes I come from a company in
Colorado medical modeling doing additive
manufacturing for medical so this is
really all we always accompanied our are
doing so typical I'll go back up and
just show you a couple things too that
are more interesting to look at for what
we do and then we'll kind of back into
some of the the.you know the details of
how how we get from one place to another
and where the applications are today
that are kind of driving some quantities
in this area and then where where things
go tomorrow in terms of additive
manufacturing application to to medical
technology and specifically I think
we've seen some applications actually
talking about aligners for for dental
and orthodontics I mean there's some
really cool applications in dental that
are pushing forward all of this and I'm
mostly going to stay away from from
dental specifically because it's not my
we're more focused as a company on
medical technology so really surgical
planning and people getting hips and
knees and you know parts of their jaws
reconstructed after tumors and such so
these are you know typical applications
the past big you know big surgeries big
surgeries where we're seeing much you
know large defects and surgeons really
need something physical so a lot of the
historical use of additive manufacturing
in medicine has been creating these
facsimile models of patient data so
taking a CT scan and creating a model to
be used in surgery to physically allow
the surgeon to plan surgery and do
surgery on a model before they do
surgery on a patient I think we all
would agree we would rather the surgeon
practice on the on the model before
practicing on us and especially in
things that are very non routine and a
lot of things in the head and neck are
kind of non routine you know everybody's
a little different we
they want to reconstruct the patient so
they look right or symmetrical we get
into the hip and the knee things are
very similar you know we all have
differences but they they want to
achieve certain certain angles and
geometries so many times in the head and
neck is where we're seeing a lot of
these done and applications where you
know where you're making a model or
making guides you know so implant
supported guides are really key use and
this is kind of a pseudo surgical dental
technology but moving through I mean all
kinds of other things where you know
you're making models that that come from
some form of medical image data or
pseudo medical image data in the form of
a 3d kind of facial scan technology and
outputting that in a way that'll allow
the surgeon to either plan the procedure
better execute it more efficiently
timewise or create custom prosthetics
that really there's no other way to do
except to do in infection as it would
use additive manufacturing in some form
of the of the technique whether it be
just for the planning model or whether
it actually be for the prosthetic itself
by some additive metal or other
technique many different kinds of things
you've seen the technology so you know
many of them are used and historically
our industry in the medical side hasn't
cared about the materials as much so we
just heard about really the extreme you
know more the extreme of materials in in
aerospace and you think a medical
typically it's pretty pretty heavily
regulated by by the FDA in the US and by
other you know by other agencies in
different parts of the world and there's
a lot to be said about the materials in
terms they're biocompatible use but not
as much on you know on that widget and
whether it's going to get beat up you
know by flying it at such g-forces and
and whatever and it and that's led us to
use the full extent of a lot of the
additive manufacturing technologies to
do different things for color for
transparency for for whatever then I
think you'd see you'd see a lot of that
you'd see some of them that that would
make the news we as a company spent a
lot of time working on conjoined twins
just as a hobby really never made any
money but just donating service to those
cases you can see on the news every
couple of years that made a lot of made
a lot of splash and these cases they'd
use these physical models to really take
a very complex procedure and try to
bring it down to a level that the whole
surgical team you know of what could be
20 or 30 or 50 people could understand
to try to make these procedures
not only time-efficient in the best way
they can you know taking a procedure
that might be a hundred hours and trying
to turn it into 50 hours but as well you
know trying to save save lives
other things that are that are less I
throw this up as an interesting piece
there's there's an exhibit at the
Smithsonian actually right now showing a
lot of additive manufacturing technology
in part so if you're in DC the natural
Natural History Museum is great and
there are many other applications that
kind of a pseudo I'd say pseudo related
to medical using additive manufacturing
for for models that aren't necessarily
to be used clinically but this is a
model of a a mummy that that's still I
believe is on display here in in the San
Francisco area at a museum called the
Rosicrucian Museum so to show you some
images just to have some of what's going
on I wanted to back up and talk about
what makes you know what what's it take
to kind of get some of these things done
and the key guiding technologies that
allow us to do what we do that are
facilitating more and more surgery
like mr. deputy where law isn't how you
interact with the data and what you do
with it and how you change that raw data
into a plan that a surgeon can use to
actually guide surgeries so not just
pretty pictures but really guiding
pictures that end up guiding treatment
and then how do you get to that
treatment so we'll talk about really
where additive manufacturing comes in
it's really what we call clinical
transfer so if you've got a surgical
plan in the computer how do you take
that and apply it to the surgery
you know without just taking it in your
head and saying okay cut this bone and I
moved it around a little bit but
actually having something physical to
take that to take that to surgery sorry
metals and plastic so we'll talk about
both both of those a little bit I think
for plastics we're mostly talking about
you know models and guides and templates
and other things for surgery instruments
as well and I'm not gonna focus too much
on that but there's a lot of really
standardized instruments that are being
created and used in both additive metals
and plastics but metals will focus a
little bit on on direct you know
production of implants which is really a
key area that will continue to grow in
the medical field in the manufacturing
side which is really converting what
what are typically all the old
techniques you know the same in
aerospace you know so casting forging
machining are all used and are all very
typical in the medical area but more and
more are there things we can do
additively that you just can't do you
know and so those things are clear
indications for moving to additive metal
but they're also things that you can do
better or faster or cheaper additively
than you can with other techniques sorry
the last piece you know you still need a
skilled surgeon so this is kind of
common you know is it a meeting this
last week we're talking about all these
great physical these implements for
taking surgery and making it more
accurate and more time efficient and you
know in the end you still need the
surgeon
it doesn't dumb it down to the level
where you don't need the surgeon there
you know doing what he does or she does
very well and being trained and having
the clinical experience behind him but
you do make it so that you kind of level
out the learning curve a little bit so
you take the less experienced surgeon
and you allow them to move up maybe a
little faster than they could otherwise
because they can kind of see things in a
in a different light so movement had
medical imaging there's a lot of there's
a lot of movement going on to medical
imaging and
what you'd see just in regular hospital
based imaging everything's moving to
being higher quality better resolution
faster cheaper probably not i mean
cheaper in some ways but medical imaging
actually turns out to be fairly costly
so if you go in you know if you if
you've had going to get your knee
scanned and had an mr you know typically
those procedures are still costing a
couple thousand dollars you know for an
mr scan which is which is very costly so
there is a push to try to make that
trying to make that cheaper and in in CT
the same way there's been a there's been
a push really to reduce radiation has
been a big part of it so making machines
that are faster that can acquire more
images faster both gets a patient in and
out of the hospital faster but it is as
well a tool that they can use to to try
to reduce radiation by using more you
know smarter techniques for acquiring
the data and i don't know if many of you
would see but on the in the mainstream
media there's been quite a bit in the
last year on radiation dosage things so
things in the new york times and others
a couple of high-profile articles about
radiation and a few things that have
really you know kind of stunned that
industry and i think there's a lot going
on right now there that will continue to
push forward to get better quality data
with less radiation the other big push
is is in dental imaging so all these
scanners you know i don't know how many
been at the dentist lately but more and
more they'll start to implement these in
office scanners like this one that's
basically an in-office CT scanner so
much like you'd go to the hospital
traditionally for and lay down on the
couch and and get shoved in and out of a
regular CT you go to the dentist office
and in a 20 second acquisition they're
actually imaging your whole head and
imaging all your teeth and imaging the
bone and the soft tissue and all that
and it kind of takes the place of you
know even recently i had to go in and
get you know the the series of little
x-rays you know that they've called
bitewing x-rays historically but 20 of
those things that they're shoving in and
out of your mouth and and it's just it's
painful and it's time-consuming and it's
just inefficient in general so here
these machines that are relatively cheap
many of them going below 100 100 k but
say a hundred of 300 k machines what
used to be three or four million dollar
machines that were only you know based
in a hospital setting so this this is
pushing things a lot and really
imaging as well in the dental
specialties there's there's even you
know surface scanning wise a whole lot
going on for teeth so if we again look
at the aligner you know kind of product
where you're just moving around teeth
and you need aligners to kind of fit and
move teeth around the ability to take a
scan of the mouth digitally is a huge
push and there are technologies already
there now kind of moving moving that way
and it's still kind of in its infancy
but it's a it's a big business many
billions of dollars been spent on the
research surrounding surrounding that to
try to get away from the fact where they
have to take and put putty in your mouth
and I'm sure many of you had to do that
you know getting orthodontics or
whatever historically you know take
impressions which are again not not so
pleasant for the patient so medical
imaging is moving a lot which is guiding
the need to do you know manipulation so
the next step for what we're doing well
talk about many different things kind of
in a minute of different applications of
this but in the end you've got to take
data you know for a CT that might look
something like this you know and you've
got to extract only what you really need
to see out of that you know so here
we're seeing all kinds of things from
the spine and and the ribs and all the
internal organs and the soft tissue and
for this particular case you know maybe
you only need to see you know the kidney
or maybe we only see this vessel you
know or this nerve as it enters the
spine at this level you know or this
part of the skull
you know relating something else so
extracting out of this the useful
information that will form the basis in
3d of what you need to simulate
turns out to be a big is a is a big step
it's a very time-consuming step so kind
of the expert systems and the automation
for doing this are not yet where they
need to be to kind of make this as
efficient as it needs to be so it really
is one of the most laborious you know
steps in the process and really what I
mentioned earlier about the in-office
imaging systems for dental they've
actually taken a step backwards a little
bit the image quality while more
resolute is actually less less less
accurate in ways that allow for
automation of dealing with it so it ends
up with more information and harder to
more heartening and harder to deal with
information that turns into more time so
there's there's been some some forward
steps and some backward steps there but
automation is definitely part of the
future for where that's going and and
keeping keeping time to a minimum really
the key to a lot of these technologies
is that there to time-intensive and thus
to expensive
surgical planning would be the next step
and well we'll talk about a case or two
to kind of show what this means in in
guidance a lot of our work as a company
is spent in an orthopedics and in the
head and neck and the head and neck
historically where a lot of applications
are very specific but surgical planning
you know is done once you've got that
data you know the 3d simulation of that
data that you've either gathered from a
CT or mr scan you need to do something
to it to kind of facilitate then the
surgical procedures and a lot of what's
done now there's a big push and I'll
show some of it but a big push within
knees you know for standard total joint
replacement and knees which are done to
the tune of you know a million plus
cases a year there are there's a big
push to try to make that more efficient
and more efficient by by customizing the
way that knee fits fits you or me by use
of kind of simple guides and jigs and
we'll talk about that in a minute on the
right there's actually a case I'll show
in a second as well but the next step
once you've once you've planned out the
surgery and a lot of times we're
involved in moving bone around bones
easier to simulate there are a lot of
reconstructive you know areas in the
body that are that that relates to
moving bone around and fixing things
from either trauma or congenital
problems or joint replacement and a lot
of what we're focusing on today is joint
replacement base because it's where the
it's where the market is so things like
knees
you know once you've got a digital plan
for creating cuts in a knee for instance
you need to take that to the patient's
so you'll use you'll use guides and jigs
and different things to kind of guide
that and other times the guy you know
the guide and what the end product of
the planning is it's really the
reconstruction of a defect so a patient
that that has a defect like this or this
is going to be surgically created
designing the implement that will fit
that perfectly and then associated
associated instrumentation for doing
those things as well and again most of
the most of the tools today or plastic
most of the implants are metallic there
are many plastic implantable materials
that are used many of those not not
available yet an additive manufacturing
basis but many of them many of them I
think to come so for plastics we've seen
many of the many of the technologies
earlier so I'm glad I don't have to go
through you know showing you that but if
you can think of any
you know many of those are perfect for
for these complicated shapes that are
custom for every person you know so well
while each of us may only be a little
bit different from each other we're all
completely different and you know the
way that that instrument of guide is
going to fit you and me is is different
so this is a perfect fit for additive
manufacturing where you can have 20
objects in a build and the 20 objects
can be slightly different and the
Machine doesn't care at all and the
complexity part of it again you know you
kind of get the complexity for free so
there's there's the ability there to not
really worry about it again a lot size
of one works well and that one can be
produced in a series of five hundred at
a time you know if it fits that one can
also be produced by itself when time is
an issue and then you know materials
there's a lot of materials and many of
those that are that are made using that
the techniques we saw earlier have been
tested so this this chart isn't
all-encompassing but you know many
things to look at for kind of
applications of the main technologies
and and some of these terms aren't the
standardized terms that Brent was
talking about but you know historically
stereo lithography and laser centering
and fused deposition modeling and 3d
printing and and some of the newer
techniques like PolyJet which is one of
the the first accountable multi-material
you know you'd look for all kinds of
different factors so you'd have
materials that are better for certain
things and you know they're flexible so
you need something that's you know you
can simulate flexibility so you pick a
material there you also look for you
know biocompatibility so many of the
applications are needing kind of limited
biocompatibility so these are parts that
are going to go and be used in surgery
maybe for just for your surgery
and after that they're going to be
thrown in the trash so they just need
the ability to be sterilized and used in
that case for limited contact with your
body tissues and then they're gonna be
tossed so depending on the materials
there's some you know many of the
processes have materials that have been
tested to certain standards that there
are kind of set you know iso and ASTM
standards for materials but if you look
at that in the same way metals so if you
look at metals you know a couple of two
main technologies are kind of driving
the use of metals specifically for
implants so again I'm not talking about
instruments but talking about implants
that are directly fabricated with
additive manufacturing and most all of
it is driven by this desire to get to
something that that bone likes so many
orthopedic implants
in our made I'll show some some photos
in a minute but you know you've got an
implant that's gonna go into your hip
and really there are a couple of keys
it's got to be strong enough to kind of
withstand the forces it's got to have an
articulating surface to function against
something else but where it interacts
with your bone that bone you need that's
you need that to be a really strong fit
and if that fit isn't strong and the the
potential for the immediate fixation
there isn't isn't good that any plan
will loosen and fail and loosening of
those implants is the number one cause
of failure those implants so the tighter
and the more connected kind of
mechanically you can fit that implant
the better many times today the way
that's done is you have a solid
component and you'll adhere a porous
component or you'll spray on a porous
surface to the back of that component to
get good bone ingrowth
in additive manufacturing you can create
it all at once so you can make a solid
component where you need solid you can
make you know porous component where you
need a porous and you can actually do
things that are again not possible with
traditional techniques you know and and
the products you know in the market this
is an example of some of the you know
the spongy bone inside the trabecular
bone inside the body one of the leading
products on the market that's not made
with additive technology kind of
produces shapes that look like this and
and many companies in the market want
something that's very uniquely porous
and the body you know especially in
titanium the body loves titanium so the
bone and titanium really like each other
you know titanium bone will go right up
to right up against titanium and form
this bond that's great so if you can get
something that's very porous and kind of
tortuously porous bone will mechanically
lock to it which is which is good so
kind of getting back to you know how is
had a manufacturing changing surgery
will look a little bit at you know some
of what's going on so as I mentioned
joint replacement 3,000,000 joint
replacements done in 2010 and that's a
worldwide number but three million cases
is a lot and in the industry here is you
know I think around fifty fifty billion
dollars for the just the hardware part
of it so that's just implants and those
types of things
you know hips and knees are the primary
areas show lers and ankles and other
things you know kind of coming the US
market though is an interesting part
historically the US markets been about
half the global market and and that's
growing especially
like knees which are projected to grow a
lot over the next 5 and 10 and 20 years
and there's a lot of it today so we'll
talk about the technology for for
guidance in in knees and this number you
know turns out my guess is that we're
probably in the range of some tens of
thousand the forty thousand is a pretty
good guess for how many knees are done
today that are additive land additively
manufacturing guided procedures and
maybe where it you know something like
three percent of that which is actually
pretty good considering that it's only
been you know a few years traditionally
you know traditionally in total joints
one size fits all has been mostly you
know has pretty much been the standard
so maybe there's a small medium and
large or there's a small medium and
large for the right and small medium
large for the left but they're gonna
make those implants fit you like by
carving you you know they're gonna take
you and they're gonna make you fit the
implant as opposed to the other way
around so we're really kind of taking
taking that and turning it in a
different way we'll just say that we're
gonna we know what's on the show you
know and this is we'll talk about this
and say but we know what's on the show
we know we've got size one through eight
you know but how do we know exactly
which one of those will fit you and
exactly which way it'll fit you best to
get the most longevity out of that
implant so for the the traditional
thinking you know it's very dependent on
you being normal you know which we're
all normal in some way you know so we're
all within the the normative curve but
it's very dependent on the skill level
of surgeon and the time that it takes to
make the decisions about how to fit that
implant to you are taken during surgery
so you're you're in surgery and you're
under the knife and it's gonna take
another 15 minutes or three hours
depending on what you're doing for the
surgeon to figure out exactly how to do
that the best for you so if we can take
that time and then push it - push it to
happening before surgery that's that's I
think we as a patient what I'll see
that's great you know the surgeon as
well would find some unique reason to
find that you know what's in it for them
is to do better so that surgery really
needs to be personalized and that's a
lot of what's going on in medicine with
the use of additive manufacturing
relating to personalization we'll talk a
little bit about custom implants versus
custom kind of guides to fit implants
the concept is for a custom implant you
go through a series of steps that ends
up giving you and most times a metallic
implant so that takes a while and it's
very its time and labor-intensive and in
the end that implant that's custom may
cost five or ten times more than the
standard implants equivalent so what was
$2,000 maybe turns into ten or twenty
thousand dollars which in the scheme of
things is it turns out to be a lot the
alternative is to take the standard
implants that are off the shelf and plan
out beforehand how to fit that standard
implant to you using medical image data
for you and in the end make guides to
guide insertion of that implant and
those guides can be made within a number
of days and shipped some fraction of a
car you know hundreds of dollars instead
of thousands of dollars so taking you
know what is fairly standard procedures
for doing a knee replacement which
involved you know taking and cutting
pieces of bone to fit these implants and
working backwards from the implant to
create the the osteotomies of the bone
cuts that are needed and using plastic
guides and sometimes metal inserted
plastic guides guiding those perfectly
positioned pre-planned movements during
surgery this can not only save time but
more moreso than saving time it makes
something like a knee last longer which
really is the big the big cost you know
in the head and neck in a typical
patient this is actually a guy that has
obstructive sleep apnea so this is
somebody that that has a real challenge
with sleeping has you know episodes of
not not one not getting sleep but you
know severe oxygen deficiency some of
these patients have that a really
life-threatening over time and they and
they may get the point where it really
could
you know cause some major issues so in
this case you know in the computer we're
planning out moving things around to a
new position and guiding those things
with with templates now I did not
include a lot of bloody images today so
that you're thankful because there there
are in the field there are a lot of
things that are a little hard to look at
but in the end you know we're guiding
that these big movements of bone around
using templates and models and plates
and jigs and different ways that kind of
fitting things together and these are
typical and these are you know moving
these are things that are still in the
hundreds and lo thousands of cases but
we can take somebody like this and
predictably help the surgeon to get this
kind of a result which not only there's
a cosmetic element but there's as well a
major functional element and
the other you know an interesting piece
of all of this if we looked at the knee
or or things in the head and neck is
related to assessing surgical outcomes
which is historically have very hard to
do you know on a given patient
population if you put people into a
group and you said look we've got you
know 18 people with the same problem you
can say by and large surgery took an
hour and and you know we did this and
this and this but for you specifically
there's no if there's no plan
there's no way to assess how the surgeon
did to the plan here we now have a
baseline for 3d comparison to assess how
they did so if they have a very specific
plan it's accurate to what they're going
to do in surgery we can now compare how
they did against what what they did
which is pretty powerful and things like
you know like overlays so here you know
in blue maybe is what we planned and in
green is actually what they got by
imaging the patient afterwards you say
why you know why didn't blue in green
you know why didn't blue and green even
up in other ways of looking at points
and looking at planes and doing things
that they really are fairly interesting
from the surgeons to us because they've
never been able to actually know how
close they were getting to a plan
because they truly didn't have a plan
and their plan was to just look at a few
images and walk into surgery so talk a
little bit about metals these are parts
these are parts some of these in the
market in the US for additively created
metallic implants that are long-term
implants this is a European part as
mentioned earlier this is a part that
you know has gone into maybe fifteen or
twenty thousand patients and something
like thirty to forty thousand parts have
been created over time there's a lot of
work in metals and you know the ability
to do that on off-the-shelf components
is one thing but the ability as well to
do that on a custom basis is a super you
know it's just a great fit for additive
manufacturing we can take a patient with
a failed hip prosthesis design exactly
what the surgery needs to be to replace
that prosthesis with something that fits
better you tell the surgeon exactly
where to take off bone and then guide
the whole thing through the
instrumentation and the screws and the
rest of it all all in one place so in a
minute or so the where does this go in
the future there's a lot you know
there's a lot a lot in medicine you'll
hear you'll hear robotics thrown out
quite a bit you know I think most of us
are here about robotics I think god I
don't want to go in and have a you know
have surgery I have some
you know a hip or a knee or something
fairly common and have a robot doing the
surgery because I'm just a little
worried about you know I thought what if
that robot doesn't screw up much but
they happen to screw up on me so there's
a lot of that the interim step between
now and full automation of surgery is
actually kind of robotic assistance so
two main technologies one one related to
you know in actual robots this is called
the da Vinci system so this is fairly
widely publicized but surgeon sitting in
the corner you know basically guiding
small hands that can go in and do do
things in very tight spaces in in the
patient so this robot sitting over here
actually working in the patient with
different tools surgeon sitting in the
corner drinking a cup of coffee and
guiding this thing like a like a video
game the other is for is for kind of
robotic assistance as well as for
creating very freeform and custom bone
cuts using a haptic enabled device to
actually show them where where to go in
surgery with a with a guide you know
guiding the bone cuts on the bottom
helping helping the surgeon perform the
surgery with with some kind of built-in
stops so if he pushes too far the
machines pushing back and then I think
we're you know where it goes from there
design matching functions I talked a
little bit about this in the paper so I
won't go through it here but really to
take what today is over engineered and
really define it make it more personally
engineered to that patient for
structural purposes and the same thing
here for you know for functional
elements to really make those fit to fit
to you is an example actually from a
company UK called within you know the
very interesting company but taking you
know finite element information and
putting that into the design and and
making it way complex and based on that
being able to being able to push forward
and do some things that it haven't been
done and the same for materials this is
actually a PEC part and pecan packer
really moving into you know high fashion
within the medical area and PEC and
specifically additively manufactured
should be should be where things go so
my final thoughts today we're already
seeing many thousands of patients
benefiting in medical and dental the
same way and the trend toward more
personalization is a good fit with where
things are and I think that you know in
the future the trick is making it making
it more cost effective and that's
a lot of these technologies falters that
they cost $1,000 or $2,000 a case and
it's too much so thanks for your time
happy to entertain maybe a question now
questions Jim Weiland University of
Southern California are you seeing
better patient outcomes you know not you
personally but the field with the amp
arts versus the standard parts yeah so
it's a good question I mean typically
the standard parts for some of these
things the standard parts don't exist
alright so guidance doesn't exist but in
terms of the traditional way of doing
surgery versus the guided way of doing
surgery yeah we're finding that we're
finding surgeons talk about patients
that are leaving the hospital sooner you
know they're able to do procedures
faster so historically you know we'd see
people say on average just using a model
so if we could go back to the earliest
beginnings of just taking a CT scan and
printing a bone model by seeing that
model and kind of moving bone around and
seeing what they're gonna do in surgery
the surgeon would say on average they
could save 20% of the operating time for
a given case so 20% of time you know at
anywhere from a hundred to three hundred
dollars a minute for operating room time
turns out to be major you know savings
and we'll have surgeons tell us on
fairly routine procedures they can save
an hour to two hours which turns out to
be just a major not only cost savings
but the less time you're under
anesthesia the better for outcomes so
the quicker you can go home a little
less like you already have other other
issues that that kind of come along with
with being out and sitting in a hospital
your questions are yeah I um my name is
Eric Luthor I'm actually a neurosurgeon
at Washington University one thing you
know that I've found with kind of these
models is that you know certainly I
think for kind of you know custom-made
implants such as kind of a bone defect
they're they're very good you know but
one thing is that in terms of planning
is that your head is four or your spine
for instance is more than your bony
Anatomy and I think one of the
challenges you know for kind of you know
pre surgical planning with models is not
just the hard tissue the bone
also knowing for instance you know does
everybody's brain anatomy is quite
different you know and a soft tissue
obviously with the tumor that's
involving complex vasculature it would
be great to have the ability to have
almost a tissue consistency matched
model of that as well because that you
know can allows you to help plan for you
know if this tumor is involving you know
a major vessel or a major nerve or a
major part of the brain how do I deal
with that beyond just kind of say
reconstructing a jawbone or just
reconstructing a bony defect yeah good
observation yeah and I know in
neurosurgery there challenges some of
the traditional ways of guiding surgery
you know you can use physical templates
to guide surgery but you can well use
surgical navigation you know so right
and that's limited you know I mean like
you know because the brain shifts and
moves around with you know surgical
navigation that's why it's always
planning prior to it's always been a
challenge either with models or with the
computer rendered versions you just
can't get a sense of it yeah they both
suffer from the same technological issue
that you have to mimic those things very
well either digitally or physically
right and it's a challenge there is a
bit there's a bit of a push I mean I
think I think getting into neurosurgery
or maybe even further down the road but
for you know for major joint replacement
there's a push toward trying to get away
from cadaver work you know so learning
by cadavers and creating not only
digital digital cadavers which is you
know is is useful and there there are
ways to use that but but physical you
know kind of cadaver replacements of
models that mimic the tissues in
increasing complexity for different
types of tissues and different types of
situations where you can do that and I
think there's a there's a bit of a push
there because the cadaveric work is so
expensive that that we'll see more for
materials hopefully going forward and
some of those that will be directly
output by
additive manufacturing although the
flexible kind of materials are still
somewhat limited today I mean that would
be the thing is if you could use
additive manufacturing to create almost
kind of gelatin like consistencies of
tissues that would be extraordinarily
helpful yeah Chris loose semper Spiro
Sciences for the companies doing this
work or the FDA how do they plan to
regulate the design window that's used
to make sure as people are doing custom
designs they're not getting close to the
risk of mechanical failure or for
instance particular where they could
form during usage of orthopedics yeah
it's a good question I mean historically
in the u.s. you go back you know 10
10-15 years ago custom-made thing
custom-made devices kind of fit an
exemption of the FDA so that you could
you could sell if you had a standard
product you could sell a custom product
just say it's custom and follow whatever
your internal procedures are but in the
last 10 or 15 years many of those
products that are kind of common
products just say a hip or a knee or
something like that or cranial plate are
all have all moved into being approved
by the FDA as custom you know kind of
patient specific products with certain
design windows so for some of those for
some of those it's easier you know so
just looking at you think of a cranial
play you know there'd be a certain
minimum thickness there'd be a certain
you know way it kind of interacts with
the edge of the bone but a lot of the
rest of it would would be you know have
a fairly large window so I think you're
right when you start getting into things
like knees you know functional joints I
think is where you'd see that more and
more useful and and how I've seen the
FDA relate to that sometimes that
they'll want to see a standard component
that you're kind of basing your work
against so the interface say between the
knee you know the femur and the tibia
they'd want to make sure that you aren't
changing some geometry there that's not
proven already and that really what
you're doing is just is just customizing
the fit of the bone interface and not
customizing actually the way the
interface happens from a wear standpoint
so I think they lock that down is the
general answer that the interface for an
articulating surface they really try to
lock down both materials as well as you
know surface great talk whether I have a
more basic question has the industry
looked at prosthetics I mean coming from
a third world country land mines have
created more problems for lost limbs and
lost body parts and I was just curious
if the industry as a whole has looked at
cup additive manufacturing for
prosthetic limbs or sure I'm sure yeah
yeah the answer is yes there's a bit of
that being done now it's been a it's
been a bit of a step I don't know if too
many that are directly fabricated so
there has been some work in the past
actually make strong enough components
that you could use is the socket itself
say for a lower limb prosthetic but many
of them today are using techniques that
are kind of hybrid so they're they're
scanning you know taking a taking a
residual limb either
scanning it digitally or taking a cast
of it and scanning that digitally
designing the prosthetic kind of
interface maybe looking at taking it as
far as looking at the bone structure
underneath it maybe scanning the patient
as well looking at the loads and how to
design that socket so that it you know
when it feels good it's functionally in
the right place but using additive
manufacturing itself to manufacture it
hasn't yet kind of reached a great
hasn't done a lot it's the same in
prosthetics for like ears and noses and
eyes which are done quite a bit you know
they're quite of there's an industry
surrounding for you know many of them
congenital deformities but you know
missing ears and there's still even
though we can get to some some materials
that are that are fairly pliable they're
fairly they go through it's pretty
rigorous you know so the materials need
to be very very strong in the same way
for prosthetic limbs there's a lot of
wear and tear and directly
manufacturable parts just aren't
commonly used yet one more question I'm
major Coryell with Motorola Solutions
and my question is if you can comment on
the state of the art of using this type
of techniques for example for for tissue
and in organ growth and things like that
where do you see a feasibility yeah
there's a lot going on there in groups
groups focusing a lot on that I think
others in the room actually may know a
little bit more about that than I do but
a lot of what you'd say for kind of
tissue regeneration so in the future you
know one of the slides I at the end
skipped over kind of briefly but you
know where things go today the materials
are either plastics or metals and
they're either put in and they stay in
the same way forever or in some of the
cases for the plastics you know in
neurosurgery used quite a bit plastics
that are resorbing you know plastics
that'll stay there awhile give some
strength and go away neither one of
those really solved the issue of
replacing a piece of anatomy whether it
be hard tissue like bone or soft tissue
like some part of a an organ with that
with a like tissue so there's a lot of
work on using things that will turn into
that specific tissue and in the future
and many of those are using additive
techniques at least to make the scaffold
- to then impregnate with something some
of the material that will you know
either attract or or you know promote
growth of those different types of cells
I think in the future you know
- what you'd see if you you know if you
google organ growing or something like
that you'd find videos I mean there's a
there are a few well-known groups out
there doing this work and you can see
you know the conceptual way to make a
kidney you know for instance would
you've got all kinds of different
tissues working together in very
complicated ways so it makes sense to
most that additive manufacturing is the
way to create those because in one one
given cross-section you can have you
know 30 different things going on and
you can build that three dimensionally
which this doesn't exist in many other
techniques so there is a lot going on
there there aren't there aren't
therapies or many therapies on the
market there is some there is some work
I think for a skin graft actually at
some point I think there's very few
commercial applications yet but much
research going on thank you very much
