pleasure to Dayton to introduce to you
Eli nebosh who is an associate professor
of robotics and head of the robotics
master's program at the robotics
Institute at Colleen Carnegie Mellon
University I just want to remind
everyone that this is a can be published
on google video so keep your
confidential questions to the end after
we've stopped recording so without
further ado please join me in welcoming
ela thank you very much thank you for
the introduction I was here 10 months
ago describing the beginnings of a
program in educational robotics and we
had a certain attitude about what it
means for humans and robots to work
together for learning and discovery and
I'm back because the two things I
announced 10 months ago or on their way
and have actually carried some
significant mileage forward so I think
it's fun to share with you the results
of those programs I'm here to unveil
some new technology that you can use and
there's been a significant attitude
shift in my lab which i think is
interesting and educational for you to
know about so I want to tell you about
the attitude shift we've had about what
it means to use robots in community and
exploration now I'm going to take you
back a little ways first I started my
talk last time by talking about Wonder
and learning and what it means to create
systems in an Aristotelian sense that
engage people in discovery so I want to
give you an example that's really early
this is a cabinet of curiosity for those
of you who don't know this is a
victorian-era device that you might fill
up with relics from myths or legends or
travels that you've taken around the
world with things that you find
fascinating there are things that launch
for you a sense of excitement about the
world some of them are real some of the
actual devices like the little shrunken
head that you got in Tanzania other ones
are our links really they're a model of
something that's far too big to put in
the device but what happens is you make
this cabinet and as two things are
really interesting about this cabinet
that I want to tell you about one of the
things that's interesting about the
cabinet is it's inherently social the
reason you make a cabinet of curiosities
is because you want to invite your
friends over to your home to visit you
and see it and you want to share with
them everything that's in there and
filled them with a sense of wonder and
curiosity about the places you've been
and they do the same thing to you by the
way and you can
it's a bit of an arms race everybody has
to have the coolest cabinet on the block
that's one reason you make a cabinet and
that fact that is entirely social I
think almost none of you are old enough
to get the metaphor i'm about to provide
you but i'll try anyway if you're old
enough to remember mosaic what we used
to do in the days of mosaic is
bookmarking we would create a collection
of bookmarks to the most interesting
other places to see using mosaic and
then we share them with our friends so
in a very interesting and odd way the
victorian cabinet of curiosities is the
predecessor to the kind of social
bookmarking that took off 15 years ago
and has obviously become pretty
important these days that's one reason
that this is really interesting the
second reason i start with this slide is
because there's something very special
about the cabinet of curiosities it's
all tangible artifacts it's physical
tangible things that you hold in your
hand and touch and manipulate and that
idea of tangible artifact as bookmarks
and as links becomes a very important
aspects of the kind of learning that
we've been seeing happen in middle
school girls high school boys and fifty
year old african american adults that
have been part of our program so the
idea of the tangible product has become
really important to us and to replay
that for you you know i keep talking
about wonder and delight and those
passions are to me very important in our
work this is an old robot but it's in a
way the purest form i found that
captures for people wonder and delight
it's a mob gyroscopically stabilized
salad bowl called the gyro ver designed
by ben brown and others at Carnegie
Mellon and I was lucky enough to be
involved in the project but what I was
lucky enough to do is observe how kids
and adults interacted with it what kind
of questions had caused in their heads
how it changed their perspective on
mechanism and technology and their
interactions with mechanism kids would
run around with this at full speed as
you can imagine playing sprinting games
it was a device that for me captured the
essence of robotics the physical
embodiment of a robot provides a
platform upon which you have an
incredible potential for causing delight
and wonder and curiosity in a very
natural way in people and where you take
that with people is a very exciting next
step now can we make more devices that
instill Wonder and delight that cause
people to kind of attend to something
and find it exciting sure that's
not hard and we've done that you do it
by taking great designers and you do it
by taking great cognitive psychologists
and great roboticists and putting them
in one room and having them design and
experience so it's a professional robot
if you will designed for Wonder and
we've done that the juxtaposition
between this robot and being very new
device and the dinosaurs being 75
million years old is really interesting
and kids love to follow it around adults
like to laugh at that irony this is
another example of that kind of ironic
juxtaposition that causes the light in
people insect telepresence let's take
the smallest of creatures I Madagascan
hissing Roach and create a large trestle
type robot that actually allows a tiny
camera to be moved around in that colony
in that terrarium I can tell you from
firsthand experience that being chased
around the terrarium by the Madagascan
hissing rotated full speed is
invigorating it is delightful and it's
kind of like a video game but better
because it's real and designing
experience like that and then watching
the kind of learning that goes on in the
kids has been really fantastic I'll give
you one more example in move on this is
a personal exploration rover scale model
of the Mars rover that actually looks at
rocks and exploratorium and looks for
signs of biofluorescent life which we've
sprayed onto the rocks so you're going
out and doing discovery and all of a
sudden the robot is making you
physically feel like a scientist you're
not a roboticist mind you you're a
scientist you're discovering facts about
the world using the robot as a vessel
for doing that discovery again it's not
that hard to design these professional
exhibits but there is something lacking
in them that's really important and it's
the line of influence that is the
problem here as with most technology
here the problem is that we're designing
a technology that influences people and
that can buy you something right it can
buy you people that are excited by the
technology it can buy you people that
change behavior to some degree because
of the technology but this is broken in
my opinion and the shift in values that
we've had in my group has to do with
turning this problem around on its head
what can we do so that in a much more
basic and pure way people are
influencing technology how can we allow
people who are not technologists to have
a role influencing the technology of
tomorrow maybe it's that question and
that aspect of wonder and learning that
could really dry
an ability to shape the future not by us
technologists but the people in general
so that's a direction that we've been
going and where how do we do that is a
question I want to try and answer for
you today but to do that I have to start
a little bit on a personal side so I
have to start with how I've arrived at
this and this won't take long but it's
worth doing I think so my personal path
toward that point starts with where I
began being a roboticist I was not a
roboticist I was an artificial
intelligence guy studying logic and
reasoning I made planning systems for
little robots that had twin powerbook
140s on top running Macintosh Common
Lisp doing reasoning that's what I did
now we happen to use that robot for my
planning and reasoning work just because
we thought it was an interesting
demonstrator for the logic that we were
building that's all it was merely a
demonstration vehicle what we discovered
was that those early robots this is
serial number two from the medic
technologies so I was lucky enough to
use serial number one and two from that
company many years past we discovered
that these early robots didn't have the
perceptual richness and effect Terry
richness that we would want from
something that's instantiated in the
real world so guess what happened we
became engineers we started trying to
make the robots better and in so doing
we added perceptual richness to the
robots like a vision system but when we
added perceptual richness when the
robots became better able to comprehend
the world and behave in a rich way with
the people of the world then we stumbled
into an unknown space and that was a
very interesting unknown space we
watched children interacting with our
robot in meaningful ways for hours at a
time this was a robot in the quad at
Stanford University wandering around
just trying not to die and fall down the
staircase and kids were given candy for
trying to get it to go down the
staircase but that's not what they did
you know what they did they played with
the robot start to build their own
cognitive model of how the robot behaves
and they designed games around the robot
and they started playing games with each
other using the robot again as an
interactive vessel for playing games
with each other it caused child to child
communication and model making and to us
this was huge and it was a resounding
failure in our ability to understand how
the robot would behave with people and
more importantly how it'd be people
behave in view of the robot so the
problem that we faced which is really
interesting problem is that we it became
clear to us had completely reap frog the
question of
robot human ecology what is the natural
ecology between robots and humans how
should humans and robots behave with one
another and how do we design robots so
that that ecology is appropriate and
socially positive we missed that boat
completely we were just engineers
building engineering technology and that
was fascinating that we had missed that
now once we got that what did we do well
the only thing we could do is become
cognitive psychologists right so we put
on cognitive science hats and got them
on our team and surly try and understand
what are the models that are being built
in people's heads as they use these
unknown technology artifacts how are
they reasoning about the world around
them and how does it change the way they
represent their relationship to other
people in the world deep interesting
questions and just to give you a few
examples from that and why it became
important to go that direction when we
did ethnographic observation when we
really studied how people behave and
turn the camera away from the robot and
toward the people we start to see really
interesting things here's a group of
people at one of our exhibits of the San
Francisco exploratorium it's an extended
family a couple of friends and
grandparents and parents they sat at
this exhibit for more than half an hour
they let each person in the group every
one of them young and old take a turn
using the interface and exploring with
the robot and then when they were all
done observing each other do this they
all huddled talked about the robot and
watched other people use it so you were
managing to capture on film and in our
analysis a kind of family communication
a kind of discourse that occurred as a
result of their interactions with that
robot which if we were to really hope
well we even hope that maybe that night
at the dinner table maybe they were
actually talking about that interaction
and what it means about technology maybe
they were talking about the Mars rovers
and how the Mars rovers work and what
the scientists do when they collude to
decide whether Mars rover should go so
we were changing conversation and that
was very deep for us I'll give you one
other example three girls in a class we
taught at NASA Ames Moffett Field in
robotic autonomy we had them learned a
program using robots that this gentleman
right here helped program so you have
you have somebody right here who's
actually built our robots what happened
in this course that was interesting is
again we looked at the graphically at
what are the models that these kids are
making and how are they learning we
interviewed them and we had them journal
and blog
breakthroughs here's some example quotes
just to give you a sense of the depth
with which we were seeing transformation
in these girls they did not know how to
program they were from underprivileged
neighborhoods in san jose and they say
teamwork is hard with varying levels of
skill and different personalities can be
rewarding only through compromise this
is high school students tenth graders
able to grasp the most important things
about teamwork that you can possibly
grasp how you deal with it and what the
problems are with it this is another one
that again shows a depth of
understanding that we thought was kind
of stunning right make active decisions
have the attitude if I don't do it
nobody will and remember that if you
choose to do something you're choosing
not to do other things I didn't get this
till I was in college and Terry Winograd
lectured me because I went to him and
said I'm really concerned about this AI
field in the department defense and he
said that I didn't get that till college
and these kids have it and we didn't
tell it to them they figured this out we
thought that that was really exciting so
those kinds of results made us feel that
we're in an interesting crossroads the
average university research project is
supposed to make incremental research so
you improve next year on what you did
last year and you keep doing this and
then you get tenure and then you keep
doing this okay that's that's life
that's University world we were at a
funny crossroads we were thinking well
we're getting results that are really
interesting they're not really robotics
results they're human community results
their education results should we just
keep making incremental progress we make
the curriculum a little bit better or
should we kind of stopped and scale up
so we decided to stop and scale up we
decide to take a big left turn and as
much as we can scalar effort up this is
where the word community comes into play
we can't teach a thousand courses around
the country what we can do is create
dissemination packages and create the
opportunity for people around the
country to start teaching a thousand
courses or start using robots and
creative ways so I want to give you two
examples of that one in which i
mentioned last time and i can show you
some results from that i forgot my
little CMU cam let me see if I have it
here
there it is okay okay so one kind of
community that we created was all about
creativity with robots but a particular
kind of creativity now another gentleman
in this room I think chuck is actually
the principal inventor of this so you'll
see that we have this weird pattern in a
lab of having people do good things and
then they leave us for this big company
in the bay area I don't understand it
but anyway so the idea here was we want
the Hobby robotics community to be able
to be creative with something that is
all about wonder vision one of the most
wondrous things you can do for children
and adults alike is show them a robot
that has vision they can track a red
ball and move it to gaze around and go
chase after and pick it up and throw it
and laugh when you give them a robot
that can do that there's kind of magic
that the vision shows a magic sort of
invisible connection between the robot
and an awareness of the world that it's
imbued with and that's really powerful
so we've been working on CMU kames over
the years but in the most recent
incarnation it really has morphed into a
sense of community robotics that I think
has been quite powerful I'll pass around
the CMU cam 3 this just came out a
couple of months ago what's different
about this from the previous versions of
any of you are CMU cam entrepreneurs is
that it has an SD card slot on it and a
fat 16 file system so you can just save
JPEGs to it right there and then go look
at them and that it's an arm nine core
running not running Linux it's an online
course you just program it you cross
compiler for it in GCC so the beauty is
you can now write code for this you
don't have to use a predetermined set of
semantic libraries that we give you
although we still have that sort of
library so I'll pass it around it's kind
of fun to see how small it is and it's
for sale on several continents already
so that's exciting what I want to show
you is the sense of community that has
developed around that very briefly so i
rebooted my computer in the hopes that
everything will now work because as we
know rebooting things fixes all problems
so let's see if I can actually have an
internet connection now
maybe maybe not Google guess that's good
that's good okay so this is a track
based site on the CM you can see me cam
3 you're welcome to go here this is
completely public and you know first of
all what happens is we and our friends
have developed software for it that we
think is really fascinating so just as
an example you know there's simple hello
world programs there's a security cam
this is kind of fun you put the camera
anywhere you want and turn it on and
whatever it's these people moving around
it takes a picture and saves it to the
SD card so you put it somewhere a week
later you pulled out the card and you
have kind of a picture of people moving
in the area another fun one is a viola
Jones face detector which is simple
phase detector on board the camera and
that's interesting because now the
camera is spitting out meaningful
information it's telling you where all
the faces are and another fun one if any
of you remember Polly the robot so this
is you know Horrible's Polly implemented
and we have a better version implemented
to that he helped us with a little bit
so again Polly the robot on this camera
all of a sudden bang you can move around
an environment with a some kind of
uniform textured floor and avoid the
chairs and the banisters and avoid going
down to your death down the stairs
what's really exciting about this though
is the community if I look at projects
I'm astounded by how many projects that
were now this is absurd this is a
research project pushed out just a few
months ago and what we're seeing is a
massive number of groups who have used
the camera in interesting ways around
the country in the world that was great
for for us because we felt like you can
push technologies out and with today's
internet you can really make it
available to people to be creative with
but the other thing I need to show you
is a project that's for more than the
sort of a knowledgeable computer hacker
and that's Turk when I was here last
time i talked about Turk because we were
trying to figure out a way for people in
general to be able to be creative with
robots for educational purposes how can
we let people really design and build
their own robots and one with us how can
you make that problem really easy and we
decided that there were two major
problems to solve actually three major
problems to solve one was you needed a
killer robot box you needed a box that
does all the power manipulation that
controls motors control servos has USB
to point out connectors for cameras and
does 802 11 g
it has ethernet and has serial ports
that has everything you could possibly
want 12 big analog 12-bit analog inputs
and digital outlets and digital ins and
of course lots of LEDs for the kids so
we created such a thing called quark
that's sold and designed by charmed labs
a good friend of ours named rich Legrand
runs that company and I'll pass that
around this is version 2 this just came
out what's exciting about it is it has
10 LEDs and it's anodized and I can't
tell you how important being energized
is the kids they love the fact that it's
blue and it's anodized so one part of it
was that hardware the other two parts
were recipes can you create a set of
recipes that anybody can build can you
test them that way and can they just
like kitchen recipes be things that
people can riff on and expand and then
share back so I'll show you some of
those recipes just for fun now this is a
web site so let's go back to the web
Turk RI CMU edu you can just Google on
Turkey you'll get right to it you know a
year ago when I was here we started with
some simple recipes of these pan tilt
robots that one took two hours to build
and cost about 500 bucks we graduated to
the flour robot that's been extremely
popular so a lot of people have been
building this flower and what's
interesting about it is when they build
the flour which is basically a weekend
project for a mother and daughter or
father and son once it's built you can
connect it to any RSS feed so it's fun
people connected to let's say the stock
market ticker so that blooms &amp;amp; wilts
depending on what whether they're
capitalists or not or connect it to the
weather tomorrow to take a look at the
flower and see if it's going to be good
weather or bad weather tomorrow the
other one that's turned out to be quite
popular is this create create recipe our
lab is called create community robotics
education and technology empowerment so
we have to do something with the create
robot from my robot of course so it's a
vacuum cleaner without the vacuuming
bits instead it has a cork on it and
it's internet connected so you build
this thing turn it on and bang it's on
the Internet so now you can program it
using our iconic interfaces you can
program it in java or microsoft visual c
or you can actually control it using
direct operation clients and such and
that's again turned out to be quite
successful in fact this is being used
right here at ohlone college and santa
clara college to teach intro to see now
which is a your neighbors
but probably the most important thing
that started happening over the last
couple of months which shows beginnings
of success has to do with projects from
members and i'm just going to dive into
two of them for fun one of them very
briefly is grok it's in England and he
wanted to use our telepresence interface
but he really wanted a robot at human
height because he's wandering around his
kitchen in his living room with this
robot so he built a robot that's about
that high and turns out the robot works
pretty well let me see if I have
pictures it's a tripod on a little
tractor style robot the other one that I
think is hilarious is sport oh this is
great this is physical manifestation
meets quality of life technology he
wanted to build an elastomeric robot
that grows and shrinks based on how much
exercise you get during the day it's a
good idea right so you walk by this
thing in your kitchen on the way to the
chocolate chip cookie box and it's just
huge will that have impact on your
behavior during the day if you place it
in the right positions in your house
it's a beautiful idea he's made this
little mechanism that he's going to open
source on the site so people can build
them and again really interesting idea
of what happens when the community
starts to build robots so they're not
roboticists anymore right there people
and they have interesting projects that
they want to share with the world now
for fun I was going to run one piece of
software because this idea of wonder and
delight relates white very closely to
telepresence that insect telepresence
robot that we built was very successful
people love telepresence they like to be
in a different scale or a different
space and we have a lot of applications
on here there's a robot universal remote
and yes or you are also stands for
restrooms Universal robots I know that
was on purpose there's a dance studio
that a lot of people have been using to
create dances for their robots there's a
flower power iconic programming language
that we use in middle school girl
programs and there's my first robot
program which is a java environment for
programming your robot all you want
everything open source of course but let
me just run one of these tell op
interfaces to show you just to give you
a feel for what it's like to use these
kinds of things they're all java web
starts so people just click on them and
run them they don't have to install
anything per se but
one thing we've added recently is as you
build a robot and turn it on it
immediately connects to the internet but
you can put it into either relay motor
direct connect mode so you can build a
robot put it in your house and either
tempt fate and allow anybody in the
world to connect to it as long as they
know your passwords or you can not tempt
fate and keep it in direct connect mode
so that they can't all connect to it I'm
going to go ahead and connect with the
relay and I think I set this up so that
there's a couple of robots at CMU that
are actually running now I got to tell
you my passwords nice and long here I
have a story too short with you my
password used to be four alpha numeric
digits long and I'm going to tell you
what happened because I gave this talk
in England okay and I give this talk
there and I got home to my kitchen in
Pittsburgh and I had a stack of dishes
on the kitchen table next to the robot
that I had them out in England the stack
of dishes was on the floor broken and
the robot was on the floor also broken
this was scary so we went back and
looked with all the logs my password was
four digits long right somebody had
managed to hack into the robot and drive
it around my house four times while I
was on the airplane back from England
now on the fourth try they managed to
launch themselves and the dishes off the
table so that may be the first example
of a certain kind of interaction now
what do you think my password was the
project's called Turk right yeah it was
that bad they I think they made two
guesses they got a right on the second
guess they probably misspelled it the
first time right so there's a dog it's
being very slow here right now it's
usually got faster update than that you
can see me controlling the little
joystick on the right but I don't know
my kids usually have a sense of humor in
the lab so we'll see if they put
anything else that's funny in here it's
just the dog wearing sunglasses oh
there's a per check this out
yeah that's being too slow to respond or
I'm being too too sudden in my emotions
let me try to get to the prayer for you
so usually if i'm not having odd network
problems i'm getting about 10 frames a
second out of the system so it's not bad
and the latency is about a second so
you're a second behind the real world
time but I just wanted you to get an
idea of these kinds of interfaces and
the kind of telepresence that people
tend to create with them ok back to the
talk
now I'm going to tell you what's wrong
with all this work we've been
concentrating on creativity using robots
on people creating robots anybody able
to create robots and we're excited we've
got thousands of users of Turk we've got
three or four thousand CMU cams being
sold every quarter now so these things
are really out there and people are
using them but there's no growth for
this this is not going to take over the
world in a really exciting way and as a
fundamental reason for that that's
really important and this is the shift
that we've had which i think is really
important and worth telling you about we
as a community of engineers care about
the engineering we care about the
currency of engineering itself the
technology so long as our currency is
about the technology even if i'm
creating creativity sites but they're
about the technology itself they're
about make your own robot but does
anything you want a robot to do we're
not going to grow we're not going to
change the world all we're going to do
is make life better for a certain subset
of people who care about that currency
so that has to change and this is where
our perspective has changed over the
last few months we think this is the
wrong approach now again you're too
young for this but some of you might
remember in the 60s and 70s late 60s so
that helps the topical music movement
right so topical songs I think we need
topical robotics so really what we're
missing is that our currency is utterly
wrong it's about technology and instead
it has to be at everything that matters
to people so topos the greek word comes
from the idea of finding a place where
there are arguments it's a rhetorical
device it's about finding places where
you can be compelling in your rhetoric
in convincing somebody of what you know
to be true and care about deeply so we
need topical robotics we need robots not
to be about robots at all but to be
about what you care about now that means
it should all be about content and not
about infrastructure the robot is mere
infrastructure and what matters is what
you're doing with it not how you use the
robot but the message you intend to
convey well what is content and message
it's media so what I'm really asking for
is I'm asking for us to view robotics no
longer as robotics but is a tangible
media what we actually care about is
we want people to create new media it
just happens to be that I media are
going to have arms and legs sometimes
they're going to flail wildly and
they're going to convey their message
that way to us so think about robotics
no longer as robotics think about
topical robotics as tangible media and
then what do you get what does it mean
to make a really powerful statement and
happen to use embodied technology to
make that statement it means you're
making a statement it means the
technology is not that important anymore
and if it's a something that allows you
to make that statement that's really
exciting i'm going to give you an
example from one of my favorite pieces
of work Natalie Jeremy genco is an
artist and a professor and she did some
fantastic work this one was called the
feral dog projects it's a how to cite
this is a piece of art in as much as
it's also useful ok so don't view this
is something you can do today but it
took poochie's and other robotic toy
dogs and converted them with a volatile
organic compound sensor into something
that could sense where industry has made
dumps toxic dumps in the backyard of
people's homes so it's a feral dog out
in the neighborhood looking for
capturing and going toward toxicity it
likes toxicity and then she had urban
kids in New York City used these robot
dogs to find all the toxic dumps in
urban areas in New York City and she
invited the press and they loved it was
a bonanza they loved it because it's a
juxtaposition of kids with technology
making a message making a statement
about where we have plasticity what's
wrong with our world that is new media
it's not robotics anymore it's new media
and that I find very exciting we've been
going down that path to neighborhood
Nets is a program that Intel funded
incredible to me that a corporation so
technically apt is also this interested
in community but the question was can we
take new technology and allow people in
a neighborhood to paint messages that
they wouldn't have been able to paint
for using this new media so did of
technology project where we had groups
of people in a neighborhood called
Lawrenceville in
burgh wander the neighborhood we gave
them Polaroid cameras and we gave them
new kinds of toxicity sensors air
pollution sensors humidity sensors and
they map their neighborhood they would
go and see what the sewer reads and take
a picture of the readings of the sewer
together with a Polaroid camera they
would take a picture in exhaust of a car
and in so doing end up having a
collaboration in a conversation with the
driver of that car that was really
fascinating to watch and model then they
go back in a collaborative map on the
wall a collaborative map that shows
their neighborhood the sense of values
that they got what was going on that was
really fascinating is that the robotic
technologies were simply a window into
the unobservable they were allowing them
to capture pollution values carbon
monoxide values sulfur dioxide values
and captured the neighborhood in a way
that they weren't used to capturing then
we asked them for the city planners to
make exhibits what if you could design
an exhibit that actually improved your
city what would you make so this is
great this woman was really concerned
about sound pollution on her road so she
connected one of our sensor systems to a
servo and it pushes down and takes a
picture with a Polaroid camera and she
actually put this on her on her front
stoop and was taking pictures of the
noisiest cars going by to Boy Scouts
worried about the fact that on the
residential area the cars drive too fast
they made a sign because the city's been
refusing to put speed bumps on that road
that comes down and says slow down
whenever you go too fast and it worked
you could move the car and down comes
the sign 3 12 year olds make a model of
the bakery deli on their neighborhood
block connected to an RSS feed that
counts the number of occurrences of
violence in post-gazette stories about
the neighborhood and pointers move up
and down and jangle a bunch of nuts and
bolts whenever there's occurrences of
the word violence in press releases this
is nine and ten-year-olds sketching an
idea about the sensors they want to use
creating a physical rendering of there
any box sketch and then building a robot
that actually moves based on humidity
temperature and air pressure in the room
it actually works nine and ten-year-olds
built this and then you interview them
in asking what
they learned and they say yeah we didn't
know it could really help people and
animals it technology we just figured it
was just something that could help you
put on their house rumba of course we
didn't know it could do a bunch of other
things in the world you know and this is
beautiful it was nothing nothing here
and then we created something of our own
they've got a sense of authorship and
empowerment over technology that they
didn't have before in telling a
statement in making a message and that
to us was a very exciting direction to
be going ok I'm going to show you a
couple more really fast just for fun
because these are so much fun to share
with you these are from this educational
program we just had these gallery shows
this weekend last week so this is very
fresh this is a this is an exquisite
corpse they took pictures of people in
the mexican war streets neighborhood at
pittsburgh interviewed the people cut
him up in the head torso and foot and
made a device that you stand by and as
you stamp on the floor of the feet move
as you shout into it the heads move and
as you flail the middle of your body the
body moves so it reconfigures the people
in two different kind of combinations he
made a mood bench model and he's
actually going to build a full-size mood
bench it's a public park bench that
becomes a gathering place for the public
where umbrellas open and close depending
on the humidity in the weather tomorrow
this is kind of scary if you take a
cucumber and you not not cut all the
skin off and do is just the right thing
you can make tendons out of the skin and
so this is a cucumber hand with a piece
of gouda on top that moves depending on
how much sound you put into the device
you thought that was crazy nano Krispies
a warning about the futures of
technology he produced carefully all
size of this box a nano Krispies cereal
box and made a model rice krispies man
using the invisible the visible man as a
mold made a rice krispies man stuck it
in milk with rice krispies stuck our
servers in the bottom and it moves when
you approach it yes it moves when you
approaching and the story on here is all
about the idea that nanobots are going
to take over the world it's beautiful
it's a piece of art it's real art that
you could put it in a modern gallery and
this guy made this
and all these robots were made in to our
segments over the course of four weeks
that's eight hours total for kinetic art
pieces that to them tell messages that
they care about so we had them use the
Turk but I want to tell you about one
other technology that we had them use
because it's kind of an exciting new one
so this is brand-new since last time I
talked here it's called the canary we
just took standard sensors on the market
that are really cheap and effective
light sensor a humidity sensor
barometric pressure sensor sound sensor
my favorite one is a volatile organic
compound sulfur dioxide and carbon
monoxide sensor and made a little box
out of it produce 50 of the boards now
it has several plugs on it and you'll
see why because that's kind of where
this gets fun but first we have to ask
the question what's the right forum for
such a device that we want the public to
use and feel comfortable with well we
surveyed that we looked at a lot of
different things off the shelf because
we wanted people to be able to build
these themselves and we tried all sorts
of stuff this is a crystallite container
with all their goodies in it this is a
pencil case from ikea we settled on
something that people can build at home
with pieces of plastic from an art store
so we provide that mold to people we
provide that model as a PDF document to
people they print it out they slap it on
the plastic cut it out and voila they
have a canary now I don't know if you
have a good guess as to why it's called
a canary you probably do I'll turn on
and pass it around and put it in a mode
where it just goes through all the
various chemical indices and and other
values for this room so just pass it
around and check it up the what's on the
screen what was exciting about this
device is it was all about exploration
and wonder kids and adults wanted
desperately to take this home and check
their floor out is my room better with
the windows open or closed on an ozone
action day is my school okay they just
installed installed new carpeting and I
read that VOCs causing asthma I wonder
if there's a lot of using my school now
and or we all gonna get asthma this is
stuff people actually care about its
media its content they collected with
the device but there's more you're going
to see as this passes around little
wires connected to it the reason for
that is we gave them craft parts they
built whatever they want to join servos
whatnot as soon as you build something
if you plug it into that device then
depending on which mode you put the
screen in it'll move so we have any
programming you can immediately make a
kinetic art piece you can make something
that drops balls whenever there's a lot
of noise or something that draws in sand
whenever there's a lot of pollution and
you can put two joints on it right so it
draws in sandy this way when there's a
lot of pollution during the day and this
way when this a lot of pollution at
night and so now you get a piece of art
over time that tells you about the
day/night difference between pollution
levels so that turned out to be an
extremely effective tool for humidity by
the way if you blow into the fins you'll
actually see it pop up just use the
right and left buttons to play where
that if you like so to us that canary
was an aha and it was an aha because if
you go back to my top 10 months ago we
care about wonder because that really
motivates people to learn but the way we
do that with things like Turk is by
getting there via the path of ingenuity
which is well known that way engineering
the route engineer its ingenuity it's
all about the idea of being creative and
building something that hasn't existed
but there's another path to underwrite
discovery the Natural Sciences seeing
and representing and appreciating what's
in the world and how cool that is so
that path is turn out to be very
important and the canary combines them
because you explore the real world and
you're billed for it now last time I
talked when I got to the global
connection project i started with this
slide which is completely valid to start
with again because it is wonder right
this is the most popular fixture from
apollo ironic because that was the moon
mission and as you know there's this
little thing we used to play with called
keyhole that's now here called Google
Earth which is a fantastic element of
wonder it's a way of exploring the
universe and revealing detail and one of
the things that I'm really proud of is
that our global connection project added
National Geographic stories to that
Google Earth so that you can really read
about places so now you're exploring but
there's depth to the information right
you go there and you explore and you
uncover more depth of course this has
become a very popular concept on Google
Earth now interesting that in his prime
when we were first doing it it was novel
the idea that you're really adding
cultural content and depth to that image
of the earth
now let me talk about where we're going
next and i'll start with this picture to
make that clearer this was a picture
where community started to play a major
role because it was no longer about
simple professional content that you
provide for people to learn that
technology to human unitech directional
arrow here we were talking about
flipping that error around a little bit
because in fact disasters were
recruiting the kashmir earthquake in
this case the new orleans hurricane
hurricane katrina and in both cases what
happened is you could see communities of
rescuers and people who care sharing
information using google earth with
overlays like these that we provided and
that was really exciting because the
community was deciding how to use the
technology to support rescue services
the problem that we felt needed to be
overcome that was exciting to us was the
question of community control what if
people could really control everything
about the perspective that they have on
this explorable shareable image so i'll
put the question out there first right
if you think about topic about the
ability of people to be able to argue
whatever they believe in and do that
with technology then what we really want
isn't one Google Earth we want and this
is metaphorical I don't mean to have
multiple Google Earth's per se but
perspective what we really want is for
people to be able to create their own
perspective de novo of what they care
about visually and share that so the
resolution you have in the Google Earth
is fantastic because you can unroot you
can reveal detail I want that for
anything that you care about whether
it's a wetland in San Francisco or
whether it's indigenous population in
northern Alaska not starting with the
globe but starting at the human
perspective of that world why is this
interesting this is interesting because
if you can do this people will be
authors people will be able to annotate
theirs and other peoples new worlds and
they'll be able to have discovery inside
of that it's also interesting because if
you do this right then people develop a
power of rhetoric and more importantly
of cross cultural interaction and
empowerment that I think can go very far
so this is a way of maybe going
disruptive and so there's two things we
have to do to pull this off and I'll
talk about those in the remaining time
if we want people to be able to create
their own perspective
with if infinite resolution with enough
resolution to be able to reveal detail
and tell a story about a place or a
thing as much as they want right new
media if you want people to be able to
that they need to have two tools one
tool is what we call Gigot pans or
gigapixel panoramas have to be available
for everyone everybody has to be able to
be an author now let's redefine everyone
a little bit let's say everybody who can
buy a digital camera even a cheap
digital camera should be able to be an
author of these so we have to have an
acquisition device that's so cheap that
people can really buy it it can't be a
twelve thousand dollar device because
it's all about scale what we're talking
about here the second thing is we have
to have a way using the internet for
people to collaborate about these worlds
so they have to have a way to share and
have a collaboration I back and forth
about the annotations and about the
story behind why they care about that
place so you have to have a website and
you have to have an acquisition system
those are the two things we've been
working on and this is the first talk
where I'm actually kind of talking about
the two things so this is a new talk
that way this is the GigaPan camera
robot developed by number of people I
need to embarrass Randy sergeant who's
the copious work so he plays a principal
role in all of this together with a
large team actually including people
here at NASA Ames CM us CMU etc and I
think the right thing to do at this
point is to show you a little bit of a
demo and talk to you about the camera so
let me bring this over so here is the
robot device simple pan tilt mechanism
but now it gets kind of interesting if
we want people to be able to use their
camera you can't custom make this for a
ten-thousand-dollar camera that has a
USB connection that's specially designed
to take pictures right so this is where
the robotics comes in you need to make a
device that any camera can be dropped
into so how do you make the picture get
taken this is an interesting question
USB doesn't work on cheap cameras these
days so that's where robotics comes in
there's a robotic finger on this the
pressures on the shutter so what you do
is you have a device here that soon as I
figure out how to turn it on there
we'll turn it on you zoom it in all the
way so it's fully zoomed right and then
you turn on the bottom half of the
system which is the GigaPan camera part
and what this allows you to do now is
allows you to adjust the finger so that
you're pushing down on the shutter no
big deal there but very important and it
has to work extremely reliably set up
your camera
so
sorry while I set up the camera here
there we go ok so then what you do is
you have this ability to take a picture
let's say I want to take a panorama from
up there to over there
so I set the parameters of that camera
panorama
and then off it goes to take a panorama
so what's exciting is that the robotic
technology here is making it possible to
do something that people don't have as
much patience to be able to pull off
themselves cameras today have fantastic
optical zooms as you can imagine and
very good megapixel ratings into his
resolution if you could zoom it in all
the way like that you're getting a
little spotlight of image right you're
getting a tiny bit of a picture of the
world in each of those pictures now you
could stand here with your camera and
try and do this very carefully by hand
but can you take 500 pictures that way
and get the right amount of overlap
between the pictures no that's not
possible so that's what despise you but
that's something else it buys you we
know they can't imagine to the device we
know that you have the same equal angle
between the camera pictures and the
order in which the pictures were taken
so we can provide free software so that
once you have the device you can
actually stitch it all together and make
an extreme resolution panorama one
gigapixel or more so that's the first
part of the problem is having such a
thing now the exciting thing that I have
to share with you today we got the
production protest for this we've got
hard tooling in China we're starting
mass production efforts and we'll be
announcing sales and the ability for
people to buy these in September but you
have one here that you can borrow so I
just trained up Alan Eustace so Randy
network with visiting with him we gave
him one and he's willing for anybody to
borrow it so if you want to borrow it
and take lots of panorama with it and
upload it on this site please feel free
to contact alan and you can get your
hands on this so that's the kind of a
fun unit to use and play with now i
mentioned that there were two pillars
let me go back to slides for a second
now donate slides I said that there were
two pillars right one is people have to
be able to be offers in a very
fundamental sense anybody has to be able
to take these pictures the other thing
is people have to be able to share them
with each other as you can imagine
there's just too much resolution at hand
here too many big pixels in too much
memory for your average laptop to deal
with you can't have 50 of these on your
computer it's not going to fit and so
what you need is a website but the
website gets really interesting because
you start to wonder to yourself what
does it take what's the interaction
design and what's the kind of workflow
that will occur when people try and
share these images with each other and
share detail inside of them
some people are going to take these
panorama and put them on a website and
they're going to want to talk about
specific things in them so you have to
make that facility possible other people
are going to look at it and see
something else that the first person
didn't even notice there's a butterfly
sipping nectar in that corner here's
somebody who is really really
interesting headgear what does that add
what is that notte what kind of tribe
were they from so you're going to have
authors boasts in the sense of authoring
panoramas and in the sense of authoring
content discussion discourse about the
panoramas whether it's the person who
took it or not so the site is GigaPan
and I think three days ago it was
released so you're welcome to try it out
gigapan org will take you there and we
already have a number of pictures there
because we have some cameras and people
have started using it so it's in a fun
way kind of this very early stages thing
my internet's being slow again hopefully
not slow enough for you to get just an
idea what we're talking about there's a
San Francisco Golden Gate area and this
is the site and it's all about searching
and being able to find the discourses
that have been occurring on the site
it's about browsing and it's about
contributing you uploading pictures
which you may have taken with this
GigaPan or not there's some great
professional artists who can take
panorama is anyway and they're welcome
to upload it as well so let me show you
a few pictures just for fun I'm going to
go to choose a user popular when
Guatemala markets just to show you the
kind of things that happen when you have
images of this nature so i'll let that
load up
and for those of you concerned about
time I'm only to take four or five more
minutes so it won't be too bad I won't
be running you too late during your day
so there's the biggest flea market in
actually I believe Central and South
America and this was taken by one of the
people on our team named layla hassan
and let me go the most popular snapshots
taken in here you know these are
snapshots these are pictures you can see
the little white squares occurring
pictures about which people have been
snapping and making comments about them
there's some fun ones in here actually
before I do that let me try and prove
that it's Guatemala you see that they
kept track there and the edge it has a
license plate and a dog and half a human
look so let me keep going toward the
license plate and you can probably read
it by now what I'm Allah 2004 here's
another picture that I think is really
exciting one of the things that happens
when you cured a picture like this is it
generates massive numbers of questions
no matter what the author intended
people start to notice in the picture
things that they have questions about we
noticed in this picture two things that
we thought were really interesting one
is half the women are wearing something
on their head balancing something on
their head like that and in fact we
talked to somebody from Guatemala and I
said oh yeah all of the women that are
aboriginal in ancestry can balance on
their heads no problem and all the women
who have a Spanish origin can't and you
can tell them apart that way and then we
notice the thing on the right there look
at the rope that guy has on his forehead
so we asked what's that for they said oh
well that's how we carry things what do
you mean and that's how it can be really
heavy things you put the rope on your
forehead and you tie it behind you
that's how you carry heavy things you
don't use your hands because you want
your hands-free so we said well what
kind of things would you carry here like
that and so just look up in the picture
if you look up to the right there's
exactly the kinds of things you carry
that way televisions so it's a fantastic
example here's another accidental
discovery will zoom out and go in on
this guy's a badge but it's always
interesting to find you know members of
your own government somewhere so this
guy's belt says FBI on it
again completely utterly accidental
discovery right but a couple of other
kinds of wonder that often happened i'm
going to show you the waffle and then
i'll move right on obviously since this
is a public site now you're totally
welcome to explore it and to contribute
to it yourself so i don't really need to
show you very much of it but this is a
kind of a fun thing to show you is the
juxtaposition between the satellite and
the than the local perspective this is
from burning man how many people have
actually seen this live anybody here
anybody went to Burning Man last year
man okay good scaring me there I'm
thinking nobody from google went to
Burning Man that's a terrible so this is
a this is a two by four by eight these
are two by fours folks this is a massive
structure and it's got you know great
signage to let me see french fries
mystery object here's an interesting one
so look at the resolution on that sign
don't look yet and what I wanted to show
you that's kind of exciting about the
site it's having trouble loading that
what it says is no climbing on structure
well we'll wait and see if it gets the
resolution going here's a google view
from above so first of all if you didn't
know this about well this makes me feel
better I'm having just a slow time here
if you didn't know this about burning
man this is kind of cool look at how
regular the pattern is how well laid out
it is and if you pull back you can
actually see earlier versions of burning
man in the sand but here's the structure
look at that there's the arm and if you
go to the device there's the resolution
we wanted but in fact the arm is there
if I pull it out and dressed it to the
left there's the arm that's really
exciting because you start to see this
juxtaposition between an overhead view
and an internal view I'm going to let
you explore that site yourself and let
me provide you with some closing remarks
given time not that fast first of all
there's something special about not
being a company about being a university
and being able to be master of who uses
the technology when you have a company
that's trying to make a cool camera like
that who are your early adopters their
technology geeks they're people who have
really cool cameras and the tricked-out
systems and they're going to go and do
great things with it our early adopters
were completely and utterly different
set of people that I find really
exciting our early adopters and this is
not a theoretical list this is who's
actually using us right now it's
families exploring local neighborhoods
in Pittsburgh its twenty elderly
african-americans in a blown-up
neighborhood called Braddock who are
trying to capture what's wrong and
what's right about their neighborhood
right now it's high school friend groups
that are documenting history and
heritage using the architecture of
Pittsburgh right now it's more hall and
mattress factory resident artists who
rarely have access to this kind of
technology and then it's UNESCO we have
program in UNESCO where we're going to
be starting with schools in the
affiliated schools program in South
Africa and Central America having kids
share pictures of how food is made
harvested grown and eaten into their
part of the world and then sharing
cultural information back
fourth we have Alaskan nunu PX who have
a language that's disappearing and they
want to do language elicitation using
giga pants so that the Giga pans of the
elders home and then the elder talks
about everything in their home and so
the illicit all the words in our
language that are hard to capture when
you show the pictures of New York City
and that's what they do today so that's
the kind of early adopters we talk about
this is another exciting aspect of it
when your educational mission scales
well together with Turk and canary and
GigaPan this is just the places where
there's workshops going on by teachers
we've trained this ball in this summer
so that number of places each one 20 to
40 kids are actually having experiences
with the technologies today and that
means we're going to be able to learn
that much more about how to scale it up
to other cities but basically the city
of Pittsburgh is going to be in a sense
transformed by discourse about robotics
and about topic and that's something
that we find exciting so let me finish
now last two slides I started my talk 10
months ago by talking about learning and
by defining it in terms of wonder the
edge between what people know and don't
know it's a beautiful definition from
Aristotle because it's the idea that
learning only occurs that boundary you
can't learn recursion by programming the
Fibonacci sequence when you're clueless
about math by the way we do that to our
kids in high school you learn by taking
what you do know what you don't know in
crossing that edge by giving them
something they care about but if it's
really something they care about and if
this idea of new media and tangible
media makes sense then I'm going to
claim there's kind of a resolution we
can make of the definition which is
really learning is I think the edge
between what people are passionate about
and what they don't know so we can make
technologies available to them so they
can have discovery right around the
periphery of what they actually are
passionate about that's how I think we
can have real social impact in the world
that's what technologies I think should
do so last slide I want to welcome you
to our community I would like you to
login to gigapan org try it out and let
us know what you think I would like you
to find a mission find something you
care about and GigaPan it upload it I'd
like you to build a robot mature with a
Turk website and probably most
importantly and for the most extra
credit I would like you to think about
how you can create a technology
empowerment program in part of your
community we're doing this in three
communities 40 venues right now
if you have a place a community center
if you have a Boys and Girls Club a
youth places a YMCA anywhere that you
have access and you believed they could
benefit from a technology empowerment
program we have curriculum we can just
give you and we can fund robots for you
and give them to you for free so we can
give you all the parts you need to
create this kind of topical robot
program anywhere you want to create it
and that's something I'd be love to see
us collaborate with anybody on last
thing I should do is acknowledge
everybody I have two people who kopi I
everything and I'm a COPI I along with
them there's a lot of labs are connected
with this both in Pittsburgh and here in
the west coast and there's a lot of
people who were lucky enough to get
funding from not least of all of course
Google Corporation and it's interesting
to note that all these books give us
unrestricted gift funding so they're not
looking for technology back out from us
they're just looking for us to change
discourse about technology and
empowerment so thanks for attention I
think we have time for a couple of
questions yes
this is going to when it comes out in
September it will cost two hundred and
eighty dollars so that's cool because
the camera is about that price point so
basically for the price of your camera
you'll buy I could get banned assuming
you have a small format camera I'm
hoping that when they build them in the
millions it'll be coming up coming down
in price but we can't bet bench on that
your head was a pristine
say again
yes the the the question was what's
available on site and how is it
available the quark processor is
available if you just Google quark
you'll go to our site and we'll take
your arm labs where you can buy it the
CMU camp is available on a number of
companies and again our site points you
to them the GigaPan camera is not
available yet you have one at Google
right now that you can borrow however
it'll be will it be announcing
availability in September at the end of
September and at that point you can put
post orders the place will be posting
orders will probably be trunk labs and
if you go there then there'll be a forum
where you can post your order and get
one last question yes is the slow is the
slow speed of the time it takes to take
a gigapixel image a problem for your
algorithm that's a good question the
short answer is no it's not a problem
for the algorithm but it's caused some
really fun artwork to results so it's
taking the picture and going to the next
position and you can tell it with the
buttons how much delay you want between
pictures so you can speed it up or slow
down a little bit and when I take a good
GigaPan it'll take me 15 or 20 minutes
to take one one that has lots of
resolution in a large large breadth of
area what happens is kind of fun is for
instance last week I was on a ship in
the sea in seattle in a lock and as the
lock lowered me 30 feet I took the
GigaPan and started it and the ship came
out of the lock as it came around the
sunset and I continued the gigapan as we
went around Seattle so the picture is
really neat it's not a picture of the
real world it's a fourth dimensional
picture is a picture of the real world
over time as you look left to right so
this interesting effects you can get
like that there's a dance company that
we're talking to the ballet theatre
actually is the ballet dance company in
Pittsburgh and they're interested in
doing some art work with the robots so
I'm interested to see what happens when
people on purpose take advantage of the
fact that it takes time to take the
picture
okay great thanks ela and yeah please

exciting talk Thanks thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
