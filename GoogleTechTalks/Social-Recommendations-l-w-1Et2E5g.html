today are our CTO ryan Mortensen and CEO
sarah buck words are here with me and we
all feel very lucky to to have this this
opportunity to speak with you about
social recommendations today we think
that social recommendations will change
both the lens through which we see the
world and the manner in which we
experience it everything from the media
that we consume to the events that we
attend are going to be influenced by
hyper relevant results delivered through
hierarchical social relationships this
is a is a fairly bold topic to speak
about and the heck at the headquarters
of what's arguably the most widely used
recommendation engine in the world but
our team and I feel pretty lucky that
the social web is a pretty rapidly
developing place and that innovation is
is it is still open I'm going to talk a
little bit today about the the idea that
the information age isn't just about
access although clearly that's an
important piece of the puzzle but it's
but that it's also about experience we
live in a time in no small part thanks
to Google where all of the world's
information pretty much is online and we
have a great way to to gain access to it
but the access paradigm leaves two
questions open which is it assumes that
you already know what you're looking for
and that you're willing to take the time
to find it and we think that social
recommendation
is going to both add a layer of
expertise to that access but that it's
also going to provide an experience
level that doesn't necessarily assume
both of those two conditions I'll talk
just a little bit here but then speak a
little more later about the design
principles that we use we think that the
because of the experience impact that
it's going to have on people that the
designers of application social networks
websites and of course the algorithms
need to really focus on the human impact
that these kind of recommendations can
have so we're going to focus we're going
to focus a little bit on on wire
recommendations are at today pretty
broadly speaking we're going to look at
some of their benefits and limitations
cover a few general concepts about
social recommendations and then we'll
dive into the meat of why it's important
what some of the opportunities we see
are of course some of the challenges
ahead and then we'll also look at who's
working in the field a little bit and
then talk specifically about the
solution that we've developed in this
field and then of course wound with some
question and answer from from you so as
I was saying before we think
recommendation engines today are experts
at providing access to information again
if you know what you're looking for you
can certainly find it they've begun to
in some of these cases move over to
provide some of the experience levels
and in case that there was any question
about the effect of the role that they
have in our lives I we paste it up here
a few of the ones that you're probably
familiar with they already impact what
we read what we hear of course what we
watch they impact the news that we're
getting they help us decide where to go
eat they find us jobs they find us dates
and many cases recommendations are
already helping us decide who we may
marry it's pretty heavy stuff what works
so we took the liberty of calling Google
recommendation engine I hope nobody
minds but clearly this is Google's had
tremendous success at pinpointing the
number one recommendation or the top ten
recommendations for a search term so
where there is spidered data and where
there and where you have a request for
information Google is the best fit at
giving you that that answer what also
works groups like Netflix iTunes and
Amazon have done a wonderful job of
utilizing a collaborative filtering and
many of the better-known techniques some
of which have been around for quite some
time and have had a an opportunity to
really to really develop the the this
what doesn't work here is actually not
in reference to the two things that I
mentioned that does work so what a lot
of the groups who are using
recommendation engines today are doing
fall into a couple of pitfalls they they
tend to employ a couple strategies that
I think are are fairly troubling one is
an idea from a guy named Bill Goldsmith
called tyranny of the board this is one
that you see a lot of places including
YouTube which is where we pull this from
if if the masses of your audience if out
of the mass of your audience the most
active users are 15 year old girls this
is this is what
you wind up with and that's all right
you know there is a place for that but
the reason that this video became one of
the most all-time popular videos on on
YouTube is because it is largely because
the people that were able to spend or
willing to spend the most time on on
YouTube happen to fall into a certain
category the other one that happens a
lot today in recommending recommender
systems is what i'm calling monotony of
the masses so clearly there's been a lot
of great work and a lot of a lot of
people have spent a bunch of times
talking about the benefits of crowd
sourcing and crab think but we think
that there are a few pieces where this
actually doesn't lead to a great result
this is a little hard to see and I
apologize this is from another
presentation as well these are the top
recommended tracks for the week for
last.fm and all 10 are Radiohead and I
like Radiohead but I don't like it this
much and it clearly something has gone
wrong here when when all 10 are from the
same band the other way that this
happens often today is even when you
look at recommenders where where you
have mass think and sort of popular
voting and you get AOL music or itunes
music or some of the other popular
engines all of the top 10 are the same
bands they may be in different order but
they're all almost always the this the
same band and while this also has a
place it certainly doesn't speak to to
you as a person and you and your group
of friends so we will get to a little
bit of that later the one that I
actually find the most troubling and the
one that I I strenuous
Liam encouraging the designers of these
new algorithms and applications to focus
on is is what we call at our office the
pigeonhole effect and when if you follow
my thinking about social recommendation
leading to experience the the impact of
the algorithms that exist today as I was
saying they focus you they get you down
to a point and they sick and they
suggest that single point as the most
highly recommended item when it comes to
an experience when it comes to the next
song that you should listen to the next
five videos that you should watch the
next 10 news articles that you that you
should read that experience really needs
to start to broaden it needs to do
actually the exact opposite have the
exact opposite effect in some cases it
needs to look at and we'll talk about
this in a little bit the complexity of
your personal or the diversity that is
you and your your groups of friends a
couple of other examples staying with
the pigeon Hall effect what a lot of
applications in facebook especially
facebook but but some of the other
applications are doing today is they
capture your profile or your
presentation of yourself at a point in
time i got a facebook page five years
ago or three years ago or however long
ago and i put in a matchbox 20 as an
artist that I liked and now like some
high school groundhog day I get
recommendations for matchbox 20 or
matchbox 20 like bands and this is
troubling in that if the experiences
that we have are limited by the the
breadth of choices that were presented
we simply can't be kept in a place and
time where where where we may have liked
thing at a certain point but no longer
like it so this gets us to social
recommendations and really where we
start to weigh in we think that social
recommendations have the answers to too
many of the problems that i just
described and they also that they also
present some other opportunities as well
they don't necessarily solve all of
these problems though and in fact in
some cases they can actually make them
quite quite a bit worse so I want to
discuss a few of those pieces in depth
and the social recommendation itself is
a very it's a fairly simple concept
right it assumes that friends and other
connections other associations of yours
are or can be trusted sources of
information you are literally just going
to be able to trust somebody that you
know or are connected to to provide you
with your information or experience it
also assumes that social relevancy how
closely related you are to someone or
how closely related you are to them
given a certain topic or genre can
provide a better experience for you
within that within that space so why is
this important who cares this this is a
cute baby I know this is a cute baby
because i went to flickr and i typed in
cute baby and this is the image that I
got the only problem with this is that
this isn't my cute baby that this is my
cute baby and had I been using had
flickr been using a social
recommendation engine it would have
known or at least had a pretty good idea
that this was the cute baby that I was
looking for so or let's say at least
of the options for what I was looking
for should have been this while we're on
the topic while I'm on the topic of my
cute baby I want to take a minute here
to talk about the level of seriousness
that I think is involved in in this kind
of development we we truly believe that
the developers who are in this area and
are using these techniques are designing
the future experiences for for future
generations it's not that they'll holy
control them it's not that it's it's not
that it's everything but it is going to
play a significant role in the things
that people do and see and we want to
make sure that these systems are being
developed with that level of respect for
for the for the human experience so some
assumptions here taking you fairly
quickly through a few of these we talked
a little bit about access based
recommenders and your willingness to
take the time to find what you're
looking for additionally the kinds of
experiences that can be enhanced by
social recommendation a few of the a few
of the challenges before we focus in on
what some of the opportunities look like
the biggest the buzz word of the day and
and certainly one of the biggest
challenges out there right now is
privacy particularly when it comes I
think to social recommendation there are
there are a lot of people who can speak
more eloquently about this issue than i
can but i'll show you an example in just
a minute about a location-based
recommendation engine that actually
showcases your
your physical location and the ability
for you can imagine a widget on my space
that is now literally showcasing to
friends and friends of friends and maybe
outside parties the physical location of
your teenager and just as the tip of the
iceberg on where the privacy lines are
and privacy questions are going to be we
think this is a very serious area I do
want to say so with that in mind and
with our respect for privacy foremost I
do also want to make one point on this
on this issue that we as a part of the
discussion we need to be mindful of what
we risk losing by tying the hands of
creators and users too tight in this
field that if if you're willing to go
with me on social recommendations
helping to create new experiences that
the limits that we place on those
creations will in turn limit or could
limit the kinds of experiences that
people might be exposed to so just
something to note in terms of control we
think this may be one of the answers in
a four for the privacy question placing
hands and control into the hands of the
user and and there's also been a lot of
good work their relevance versus
permanence this speaks a little bit to
the issue of how far are we willing to
go to provide an individual with the
precise answer that we think will be
right a hundred percent of the time
versus something that we versus the kind
of pigeonhole effect that I spoke about
which places them they may have liked or
they used to like this item but now
we've sort of kept them within that
within that exact same field for too
long so some of those
those challenges ahead a couple of the
current efforts I have YouTube up here
and even though YouTube isn't really
necessarily weighing in on social
recommendation I wanted to at least
highlight them primarily for the work
that they are doing currently with with
filtering they really have been able to
to push the boundaries I think of what
people experience and what people are
recommended given particularly
collaborative filtering techniques and
and their ability to to recommend in
that area so it's some really
interesting work the the rest of these
the rest of these that are on the list
here sort of speak to a couple of the
different types of efforts that are
being made Facebook's friend recommender
is probably one of the most widely
recognized truly social recommendation
engines at this point if you have a
Facebook page you know that when you
show up there are some choices on the
right-hand side of your page where a
couple of people who you likely know are
recommended as somebody that could be
your friend they're using you know one
of the simplest algorithms to create
that so it simply looks at you and your
friends and the people who are connected
to the most of those people are
suggested as somebody who could possibly
be your friend that effect is the kind
of gateway into social recommendations
it's the first technique that people
usually use to start generating social
social recommendations each of these
other groups either do a variation of
that or a combination of some of the
different explicit or implicit
techniques that exists so
particularly I'll just highlight
stumbleupon and my strands summer puns
probably a little better known at this
point but a couple of groups that are
really innovating one around largely
around websites and the other around
products but I won't spend much time
talking about them but some good some
good groups to to check out so what's
next we I've talked a little I spoken a
little bit about the the curated
experience that can be created by social
recommendations and as we get into the
work that we're currently doing I'll
actually illustrate a few points of what
I mean socializing the web one of the
reasons that this is so critical at this
time is that it we're entering this
phase where social no longer means an
email social no longer means a social
network social now is becoming the net
the web itself is becoming a social
place thanks in no small part to to some
of the work that's being done in the
OpenSocial project as this happens we
think that the social your social
relationships are very quickly going to
jump outside of these social networks
and start to play a role in every web
experience that you have we've
Illustrated a couple of places where
this where this may have an impact and
we just mock these up so for full
disclosure this doesn't exist this is
some photoshop magic so that's it but
let me point out here what what some of
the very basic first step things that we
think we're going to see in the very
near future so here we have Amazon here
we have a place right there where it
just says your friends liked this combo
so it's selling you more books or
selling you in this case more DVDs but
it's simply
takes your friend data and an offers you
a better shopping experience based on
the results this this one is interesting
i think that there's tremendous extreme
end essential with the ability to
provide a login experience which we've
Illustrated up here and tie it to your
your social web experience on whatever
page you may be on so in this case again
just just photoshopping here we've given
the ability to login username password
and the login of the social network that
you're a part of we have facebook and
myspace featured here but this could be
this could be any of your contact lists
or social networks that you may be a
part of the effect here would be now
you're not just on Yelp you're not just
looking at what the mass of humanity
thinks about what restaurant you should
go to your now seeing that and some
version of what your friends and your
friends friends think is good but not
only what your friends think is good the
friends whose tastes you share as
determined by an evolving algorithm that
friends whose taste you share in
restaurants get highlighted the most so
I think the possibilities for this kind
of this kind of work are a really
extensive here's a simple one we've got
up here we've got your friends videos
again social relevancy would say that I
probably like roses taste the most and
then Sarah's and then Ryan's or at least
maybe this is a five-star video from
Sarah and even though I like Ryan's
taste the most that's the three-star
video so
so it didn't come up quite as quite as
high in the rankings this is really what
we with this is really tip of the
iceberg the kind of stuff but just some
practical ways that this could be
implemented now there are a couple of
missing pieces to do simple from a
technology standpoint I think missing
pieces to do what we what I just
Illustrated a couple of those pieces are
that there needs to be an initiative to
tie together the social graph and
relationship data from close social
networks and content identifiers we we
are talking we're actively talking with
people from different content providers
and from different social networks and
other companies we want to be a part of
this effort and we plan to have the
results of whatever we do in this field
be open sourced so we don't think this
should really be in the hands of one
company but should really be opened for
use by the by the development community
at large the benefit of those of this
work would be that person to person
relationships and person to content
relationships would be able to follow us
throughout the sites that we visit it
would give us the ability to do those
things that I just Illustrated but it
would also give us the ability from
within the context of the sites that you
that I was showcasing to feed content
and data back to the the social network
or your chosen repository for that data
as well so it's it's not just a benefit
for the sites at large it's also benefit
for you personally and the social
networks as well so danette summer org
if you are interested in working on this
project or talking to me about how to
get this done
I'm going to switch gears just a little
bit here and talk about the specific
opportunity that our team sees in this
field we think that the utilization of
friend friend data to make intelligent
recommendations it is is immense and in
order to create these curated
experiences and also to deliver more
hyper relevant results on top of current
recommendation engines we've we've
created summer or social media
recommendation it's an API that is open
you can go to summer org and and apply
for or just tell us that you're ready to
work with us it's an algorithm that
generates recommendations based on
social relevancy given most most of the
things that I've been speaking about I
think that that should be pretty clear
this web service delivers superior
content and advertising and it does so
using a couple of the factors that I was
speaking about before it it has a few
technical principles that I'll that I'll
get into and I think that'll give you a
little more insight into what went into
creating this social recommendation but
beyond just a superior result for access
to information it also creates I think
new opportunities for experiences at
particularly media experiences so what
do I mean by that maybe maybe I will
well that's right I'll just skip it this
is live if you have facebook or orchid
account you are you will be able to see
a project that we put up it's called in
video it effectively is that YouTube
example that I gave of your friends
favorite videos except that it's within
the social context so
in this case Facebook and plus YouTube
plus summer or social media
recommendations gives you the experience
that your friends video who you think is
you like his taste and you like the
videos that he or she keeps sending you
they show up first and in that way
you're able to essentially playthrough
hours and hours of videos that are more
closely related to you than if you've
even with all of the great work that you
to YouTube has done it ends up being
more simply more relevant to you because
it's able to take in the context of your
relationships one of the ways I'll give
you a little insight into our artwork
but i'll try to tread lightly one of the
ways that it can provide the superior
experience it without just giving you
what your friends are watching is as an
algorithm it clusters your your friend
relationships and your friend data and
so in stint and then goes out and
searches the the field for what else you
might like to see so instead of just
taking your individual set of things
that you like it actually incorporates
your friend relationships as a piece of
that puzzle and therefore is able to get
a more full view of who you are through
your friend relationships there's a some
people know of course about the fire
eagle project from Yahoo we think that
that is an example of some of the
exciting new work that that is going to
make social relevancy that much more
important
we are putting out we put out a couple
sample applications just to kind of
battle test some of our algorithm the
YouTube one that I just described is one
of them and and this is one that's
that's just coming out it it takes it
look at your friends your social network
and it begins tube through the social
recommendation peace through our
algorithm it begins to determine who
you're better friends with based on how
often you are close to somebody and how
much you communicate with that with that
person um and in this very simple
application it it starts to enlarge the
pictures of the people that you are
closer to and just as a sort of tip of
the iceberg for geolocation it also
means that geolocation is going to be a
genre within this field that we're going
to be able to use this kind of data and
that lots of other people are going to
start using this kind of data to help
determine the recommended media and
other experiences that that that you
should be having this is a version of it
that incorporates Yelp so you can see
that now it's not just about where
you're at and who you're closest to it
now is combining who you're close to
both who you like to hang out with but
also who you're close to in terms of
your tastes in in in restaurants in and
other locations
I said a bit before that we take that we
take this very seriously and that we
think that because of the impact that
it's going to have on on the experiences
of people that in turn the development
of these types of projects should be
done with an eye towards people as well
and so we have a couple of design
principles and then I'll talk about a
couple of the technical principles that
we use we we put up beauty because there
we do think that there this is a little
bit ethereal but we think that people
should be focused on the the kinds of
possibilities that people that that
people hold just just as part of their
nature we also think that the ability to
view humans as innately able to hold to
juxtaposing positions in terms of
complexity and their ability to like
lots of different things in terms of
diversity and the fact that they're
constantly evolving really really is
critical if you're going to start
weighing in on the kinds of experiences
that you think they should be having
both either in a media sense or in an
active activity or event since some of
the work that we do or at least on the
algorithm all the work that we do is it
is influenced by some of these texts
technical design elements
that we have a primary metric that that
has really been instrumental in our
ability to to create the kind of results
that that we've given it makes it means
that we have x influence it means that
we have a single metric for success that
can be calculated across all areas of
our work so every time a video is viewed
every time a piece of music is played
every time an advertisement is clicked
that is an influence we have influenced
someone's behavior and therefore have a
have a single metric by which we can
judge our success it's a dynamic formula
we really struggled for a little while
when we were building this in trying to
apply the exact same algorithm to to a
lot of the work that people were doing
we we brought once we broke out of that
once we started to say okay things are
going to be weighted differently sonra
zar going to be used differently it
really helped us to solve some of the
problems that we were looking at the in
this field we we use every type this is
a little bit of a Miss later we use
every type of data that's that's
available to us so at one point we we
were really focused on want a specific
strain but as you probably know or may
know anytime you can incorporate just
more information into it the better
results your you're going to to find so
we use social social relationships of
course first and second-degree
relationships and as well as the
combination with their activity and in
both cases relationships and activity we
use implicit and explicit metrics or
actions in the explicit relationship
with the explicit relationships that we
use one of the techniques that are that
i'll reiterate a little bit that that
has been extremely helpful to us is is
the clustering technique that we use
that really gives you the ability to
bring in more of the attributes of your
friends to help provide a diverse image
more complex image of the of the
individual the final one that's been
important to us is that this is
substitutional sorry that this is
supplemental not substitutional that
we're not we didn't go into this saying
we are going to replace this
recommendations one to one we don't
think Amazon should tear down its work
and put in social relationships as
social recommendations as a replacement
instead adding a social layer adding a
little bit of social context onto
existing recommendations and existing
work can simply provide a better a more
full experience clearly where some of
our work is used for instance in the
some of the media examples or the
YouTube within Facebook example that I
was using it's the only recommendation
but where there is a recommendation
engine that already exists we think that
this can be effectively used as a as a
supplement so really quickly on our on
what it does so obviously I showed you
some applications we think there are a
lot of possibilities here and we're
interested in hearing from people about
what what they're interested in building
we are actively working with advertising
networks to provide lift or to provide
increased enhanced results for how
actively users are willing to engage
with their with their media lift in
terms of clicks acts
so forth and then some of the work that
we're starting to do with other groups
at large is to bring social relevancy
into existing applications and platforms
as well as sites so I'm going to end
here with a little appeal just to say
that if you are working on these kinds
of projects if you are one if you're
interested in building something with us
please let us know of course but if
you're just working on these types of
projects we we encourage you to think
about the human side of it first and
that you you make sure that the
individual stays as the focus of it
we're really excited about the
possibilities that exist in social
recommendation and and we really
appreciate you taking the time today to
to listen to where we think it's where
we think it's going to go so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
