and who's come to speak to us about
being multilingual in a world that
thinks everyone's monolingual stephanie
is a social software consultant who's
worked in the US and the UK and and
Switzerland has been bilingual all her
life one thing i should say is that this
this talk is being recorded for the
public presentation so if you're going
to ask questions make sure you ask bill
secrets in the questions thanks very
much Stephanie
la voz alta moda shahama des le petit
anse innotek nikla come same
presentation song written language most
relevan officer ok who understood all
that a few french knickers in the room
ok don't worry I'll continue in English
I was just apologizing for the technical
glitch I stupidly forgot my vga adapter
at home so there we go I assume that
most of you are familiar with the works
of Douglas Adams who wrote The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy and so
therefore you know that the Babel Fish
depicted up here is a little fish that
you place in your ear and it allows you
to telepathically understand what is
said to you in any language so it's
really really useful little animal and
it's actually a literary device that
Douglas Adams came up with because he
had a character who would be you know
exploring the universe and it seemed a
bit preposterous to him to imagine that
everybody in the universe spoke English
so he invented the Babel Fish to get
around that problem now
okay how am I supposed to need to move
the next slide okay okay so to me the
internet which I like to imagine as a
big space cruncher puts us in a
situation quite similar to after dent
Douglas Adams hero when he suddenly
discovers that there's a whole huge
universe out there filled with strange
beings who have you know very different
eating habits and speak different
languages so what the internet does for
us is that it puts us in touch very
easily with people from other cultures I
think that's an important characteristic
of the internet if you look at it from a
cultural point of view and if you if you
look at the history of human beings
before the internet and space travel if
you wanted to get in touch with people
from other cultures the first thing you
had to do was go there or wait for them
to come here space was the first
obstacle upon your way to meeting other
cultures now this has changed we have
our form of space travel and the first
obstacle along our way to meeting
different people is often language
so the the basis of this talk is that I
think it's important to be able to get
in touch with people from other cultures
this is I'm not questioning that okay so
people might disagree then this will be
of no interest for them but assuming
that getting in touch with people from
other cultures is something we want to
do then we need to be aware that the
borders on the internet are linguistic
I've got one example of this I come from
Switzerland which is a multilingual
country in Switzerland we have four
official languages German which is the
majority language French Italian and a
small language spoken in some valleys
called romance well one day somebody
decided to organize Swiss blogging a
Swiss blog contest or Swiss blog awards
ok to single out the best swiss blogs
well this initiative broke down because
of language questions because
switzerland on the internet doesn't
really exist and from the french
speaking part of switzerland and i have
much more in common I know much more
about what's being done in France or in
french-speaking Quebec then what's being
done in my country but in German because
my German is really bad and anyway Swiss
German people don't speak German they
speak Swiss German which I haven't
learned so countries aren't really
relevant they are in some situations we
see why but very often the most
important thing is language and so there
are some multilingual people who act as
bridges to help us cross these
linguistic borders and some of what I'm
going to tell you today comes from my
experience as being a bridge person i
was born in england
Swiss mother English father so I learned
English and French happily and so I've
always been you know one foot in one
culture one foot in another one foot in
language one language one foot in
another and in my experience as a bridge
person I've noticed that the tools we
use on the internet don't help me do my
job actually they get in the way simple
example I'm a blogger to start with and
blog tools assume almost all of them
that you're blogging in one language
that doesn't help somebody your bridge a
linguistic bridge between two linguistic
groups so I'm going to talk first about
localization and then try to move beyond
localization to what really interests me
and which is what i call multilingualism
online so to start with I'd like to
address two common misconceptions about
languages on the internet can anybody
tell me which flag this is Australian
okay so first misconception is but
everybody speaks English and the people
I often hear saying that and I do hear
people saying that so it's not something
i've invented our English speakers who
have traveled the world a bit they say
but you know I've been to Europe and
Asia and you know these people speak
English so well my answer well of course
the people you've interacted with speak
English those who haven't interacted
with many many times do not speak
english so i think that at Google people
are convinced of this google is really
rather good on localization side so I'm
not not going to make big speeches about
this but it's important to realize that
for a lot of people this is not an it's
not an evidence okay
and the other misconception which is a
bit more tricky is that country equals
language so I'm going to look at this
one a bit more closely
ok so this message slide is about what i
call geographical abuse you have an IP
address somebody connecting to your
website so that tells you which country
they're in and logically that tells you
which language they're speaking right
not so right actually this breaks down
in multilingual countries to start with
I'll give you a few examples afterwards
of what happens when you're a minority
speaker in french-speaking Switzerland
not fun it doesn't work for people who
are traveling if I am traveling to
Denmark it doesn't mean that I suddenly
learned to speak Danish and it doesn't
work for expats I have a lot of
english-speaking friends in Switzerland
who do not speak French and who do not
speak German so it's clearly an
insufficient way of doing things and if
localization is about creating a version
of your website or service in another
language and then looking at what
country people are in to serve them the
right language that is in my opinion bad
localization so few examples of the
guilty frost guilty company amazon if
you live in Switzerland like I do in
french-speaking Switzerland and you type
amazon CH you are redirected to
amazon.de where you are served a website
made for Jan speaking people are than
German and you know one of the nice
things about ordering from amazon in
your country is that you get free
shipping so to get free shipping I need
to use the german website I can't use
the French website I don't get free
shipping if I use a French website and
of course if i want to buy french books
on the german site they're going to be a
lot harder to find
second guilty company ebay if i type
ebay.ca CH I am served German ok
although nothing on my computer tells
people that I speak German and I am in
the Swiss in the french-speaking part of
the country and well here it's written
back leave of course a clique ici so if
I am one of these few little miserable
unimportant French speaking people i can
click on the link and get a website in
my language but it really feels like an
afterthought one of the worst offenders
is paypal if you want to be able to sell
things through paypal in switzerland and
well first of all you get a site in
german then you create an account and
you can change your language to english
if you want to so I had the case of a
friend who is selling a book in French
for French speakers and with the choice
between using paypal in German or paypal
in English he couldn't use the French
paypal site unless he had a banking
address in France and I can feel a few
of you breathing sighs of relief but
don't be relieved too long Google is
guilty too I haven't dug in detail in
Google but I have at least two stories
the first one is of course if you type
Google Docs eh Google assumes that
you're speaking German which is not
always the case
you can click on the links but what I'm
interested in here is the assumption the
basic assumption is you type Google Docs
eh you want it in German the thing the
fact is when you type google docs eh you
can make an assumption that the person
is going to want it either in german or
in french or in italian or maybe in
english or maybe even in danish if it's
an expat dane but you can't single out
one language and say this is the one the
person wants yes question I don't have
them off the top of my head but German
is a rather large majority I think it's
two thirds or something like that French
is a good quarter italian is much less
you can find those on wikipedia if you
want the exact numbers but don't have
them in my head yes pardon you have to
put it in some language yes good point
you have to put it in someone in some
language we get there another Google
incident happened to a friend of mine
who is British she was in Paris for the
weekend she logged into her blogger
account and was presented with blogger
in french because she was in Paris and
that's even worse because she has an
account she is a logged in person and
she served French
another example I don't have a slide for
is Apple I've been told that iWeb
assumes that you are using your blogging
or publishing in the language free for
which your keyboard input is set so if I
type things with a an English layout I'm
speaking English or if I'm using a
french keyboard layout and speaking
French yeah so enough with the bad
examples here are some of the things
that I tell tool builders often little
startups not big companies the first
piece of advice is plan for non English
versions from the start you might not be
developing them but if you code
something all in English and then you
know some months or years later I think
oh we should do you know transform this
into localized versions you're going to
have people breaking code by trying to
insert localization so planet from the
start there are also issues like some
languages have very different
grammatical constructs okay so
localizing localization is not just
taking you know little groups of words
or even worse words and translating them
a word like cut in English CU t is can
be a noun can be a verb can be a
conjugated verb in French all these are
different different words okay which
I'll spelled differently I'm not even
speaking about Chinese or Japanese
second thing as we've seen don't assume
that the country the person is
connecting from is a very good
indication of the language the person
wants the service in allow for regional
variations this is an issue that came up
on wordpress com which is a blogging
platform which is quite well localized
it's
outsourced its localization efforts to
the community so people can log into a
site and contribute to the translations
and in French while there are people in
France speaking French people in
Switzerland speaking French people in
Quebec speaking French people in Belgium
too and there are differences for
example in Quebec French speakers are
usually quite feel quite strongly
against the inclusion of English words
in the French language so they will
really translate or create French words
for blog for example whereas in
Switzerland which is a multilingual
country to start with which doesn't have
the history of being a linguistic
minority against English like the French
in Quebec have where we use English a
lot to communicate with the Swiss German
people because they'll understand a word
of what they're saying we include
English words in our French quite
happily so when you have people from
Quebec and people from Switzerland
collaborating to try to write to reach
one translation one localized version in
French it doesn't work out well so
localization is to go further than just
the language but also assume that there
are regional variations English speakers
know that there is UK English and
American English and it's often the same
thing in other languages crowd source
yeah that's I think that localization if
you want to do it correctly well if your
google maybe you can hire enough people
to do it in all the languages if you're
not Google you need help from the
community I'll come to your questions
straight away having an in-house
linguist is also a good idea having
somebody in the team who is not a
developer or programmer but understands
something about languages and culture
that can help and smart user language
detection which I'll talk more about
just in a moment yes
smart on here and I don't I'm not very
good at javascript so technically and
not even one hundred percent sure it can
be done no actually I'm sure it can be
done because sometimes you visit web
pages and they tell you what your OS
languages and what your browser
languages so let me get on the next
slide just a little there we are so how
would you detect use language because as
you said earlier you need to display the
page in one language I mean you have to
choose how are you going to this side so
this is what I would recommend as a
preferred order for picking language to
present a user the first would be the
users profile or if the prisoners had to
sign up for the service the person might
have said you know I want my interface
in French I want my interface in Hindi
so this is the most important thing
should override all the rest what the
user has said he wanted then there is
another source of language preferences
which are the browser preferences
browsers like Firefox I've put a
screenshot there allow you to say what
is your preferred order for languages
for being served content so I say okay
one UK english first then I went other
English I put it in because I wasn't
sure how this sounds like hit work then
I went French and then okay I put up
with a bit of German if there's nothing
else or even Italian if I have to but I
can tell the browser this is my
preferred preferred order so when I'm
visiting a web page and it exists in
French English and German why the heck
am I served German if I have things like
browser preferences which tell me which
tell who wants to hear that I want
english first then if that doesn't exist
or is not available then you could look
at the OS language or the browser
language if somebody is connecting to a
website from a computer which is
all in French with browser in French and
everything in French chances are he'll
be happier with French than with German
even if he's typing google CH and most
people in ch are going to want German
and last optional last thing that comes
into line in my opinion will be
geographical location so it's not simple
it's it's a it's a mix I don't know what
the best recipe is ok it still needs to
be found but just looking at where
somebody is connecting from is clearly
not sufficient and then there are
questions like do I show my user one
language more than one language I'm
happy with French or English I don't
care I could have both so I've got stuff
in French you don't have an English how
am I going to be able to express that
with the little little you know list
like that also what we're going to have
to know is how proficient are people in
the languages that were interested in
yes Oh language at some point
we have to choose to show this stuff how
do you avoid that same discrimination
against minority languages and things
like that when you need to give them
instructions for how to choose the
language they want like that's how to be
presented English sure it's got to be
presented in German before we even know
anything about this well for example
this if I go and download firefox
firefox actually rather smartly
recognizes that i'm using a mac and that
my own anguish is French and it tells me
and it presents me directly with firefox
for Mac in French without me having to
do anything it just recognizes my OS
language so if you know if you can do
that for browser download why can't you
do that for presenting a localized
version of a web page it's not more
complicated
so little detour by geography and
spatial localization because I mean I've
been complaining against using IP
addresses for you know imagining what
language I want actually if you look at
what country the person is in its one
factor among several when it comes to
deciding what language or guessing what
language this person is speaking but for
laws it's very important okay anything
that has to do with taxes censorship for
example if you're going to be shipping
stuff you're going to be showing porn
for example in quite a few countries you
are not allowed to show porn to
under-18s but in Austria for example
which is just next to Switzerland the
legal age for being able to view porn is
14 and it is even the legal age for
being allowed to act in porn movies so
if you're in Austria you can show porn
movies with 15 year olds in it and it's
legal and in the US its statutory rape
and kiddie porn okay so you need to know
what country people are in but those are
two different issues the language in
which you're going to talk to somebody
and the laws that you're going to use to
decide what content you're going to
serve them or how you're going to shape
or what that what taxes you're going to
pay is another problem and I think that
they've often been stuck together
because well it's more practical so back
to trying to define user languages or
user language preferences I'd like to
run a little survey in the room who here
considers that they are perfectly on
your perfectly bilingual or multilingual
okay of course a survey is skewed
because you're here because you're
interested in the topic so you're
probably interested in languages who
knows more than one language
maha who hesitated before raising their
hand when I asked that question only two
okay and it's intentionally vague right
because what does knowing a language
mean does it no does it mean you can
have a conversation in that language
does it mean that you can read in that
language and even reading in that
language does it mean you can read a
blog post does it mean you can read
simple instructions does it mean you can
read a book does it mean that you can
write a letter or write a book or give a
talk in that language you know I'm
perfectly capable of reading a short
blog post in German if I have to with
automatic translation to help me with
the missing vocabulary I find my way but
there is no way I'm going to be giving a
talk in German ever but on the other
hand I'm perfectly comfortable both in
French and in English for giving a talk
writing a book whatever so this is much
more subtle than the no don't know check
box like thing you're supposed to fill
in when somebody is interested in
knowing which languages you went to
search in or which languages you want to
view content in we need to move beyond
that and I don't know maybe someone
somewhere will come up with a maybe
microformat or something where people
can give detailed information on what
they can do in which languages and then
we can use that somewhere have kind of a
universal language profile that can be
used by various applications or services
I think that the the very important
distinction if we don't want to go into
that much detail is passive and active
language skills you know that if you
know a foreign language you are usually
much better understanding it and reading
it then you are at speaking it okay
expressing yourself is more difficult
than understanding that's already
starting point so yes to church the
church she was
it's basically not too late to visit
yes who is your chew
and so okay it's like a Chinese other
languages are the same issue so does
English the whole but everybody speaks
English that I here yes in Switzerland
everybody almost everybody has learned
English at school but it doesn't mean
that comfortable enough in English to
learn to use a strange web application
or two in that language so I think
language skills and to know what
people's language skills are and be able
to cater to them is very important so
this is a quote much honorees I don't
know if it's very readable being human
among humans means living in a state of
ever incomplete multilingualism actually
I chose this quote because it seems that
more people in the world are
multilingual than monolingual this can
come as a surprise because when we think
multilingual we think perfect bilingual
or perfect trilingual but if you think
of multilingual as has some skills in
more than one language then almost
everybody is to some extent multilingual
so why don't we use that okay instead
at least on the internet we keep pushing
people back into monolingual silos if I
want my website in French it's going to
be one hundred percent in French so i
often get misunderstood when i say that
my interests are multilingualism on the
internet because people say oh the
internet is multilingual you know we've
got all these localized versions of
everything but the fact that a community
is multilingual does not mean that the
individuals inside that community are
necessarily multilingual right afternoon
multilingual countries you have less
multilingual speakers than in
monolingual countries so the fact that
we have multiple monolingual spaces on
the internet does not mean that we are
mixing languages does not mean that we
have spaces which are we in which people
can be happily multilingual and play
their part as bridge people where can we
fit in as multilingual beings online
that's important question so
localization is a translation of the
interface into another language ok so
it's making your site monolingual in
various languages it's nice but it's not
enough multilingual ization if you've
got a prettier word please tell me
because it's really ugly would be having
spaces online where people can mix
languages which can manage code
switching if you put me in the room with
another perfectly bilingual French
English speaker we are going to code
switch we are going to jump from one
language to another because some things
are better said in one language or we're
more comfortable in certain topics in
one language than another the stud the
subjects i studied at university in
French I'm not actually that comfortable
speaking about them in English I don't
have the skills for that so we're also
going to have to find a way to manage
different language combinations I speak
English and French somebody else in the
same space might speak French and German
how are we going to manage that how we
going to create a space where everybody
can be happily multilingual that's kind
of my M hope so two examples to start
talking about this one is WordPress a
blogging tool the other is Twitter a
present service so as I said I come from
the blogging scene ok I started blogging
long time ago and very quickly I wanted
to be able to blog in French and in
English and translation translating
everything just doesn't work at least
not for a blogger because it's too much
work and bloggers are lazy people you
know they start writing they hit publish
and then it's on there it's online and
they don't go back to it so if you look
at the tool WordPress it's well
localized it exists in many many
languages language is a blog level
attribute so your blog is in French or
your blog is in German
it assumes you've log in one language
like many tools and there aren't any
built-in strategies for mixing languages
in one installation a block or blog so
there are solutions so this is a
solution I've come up with others will
have other solutions I insert excerpts
on the top of my posts in the language
i'm not writing in so for example if i
write a blog post in french i'm going to
write a short blurb on top in english
say what it's about and i do the
opposite when i'm writing in English
because translation is way too hard to
do it keeps my monolingual and
multilingual audience happy it even
helps some of them got one sitting right
here improve their linguistic skills in
french because i'm not sure Kevin would
have been reading my blog had it been
only in French but as it was you know
sometimes English sometimes French well
he plowed his way through the French
every now and again and it more
importantly it keeps the bloggers very
happy okay it's a good solution for the
person who is publishing
so this is Twitter who knows what
Twitter is okay basically twitter is a
service where you can send short
messages saying what you're doing some
say it's microblogging some say it's I
am Status Messages it's all sorts of
things that's a pretty it's become
pretty popular in the last months and
it's an interesting case because it is
not localized so one could think that
this would hinder its adoption by
non-english speaking communities but
actually if you look there are lots of
people using Twitter in non-english
languages got one example here you can
see when Twitter here in Italian I think
that's because the cyst the tool itself
is rather simple and you don't need the
interface that much once you've figured
out how it works it's very basic filling
a text area and press submit and that's
it each other South exponentially but
now this raises questions about language
filtering because for example I actually
like seeing languages I don't understand
because with my linguistic background
even if you show me something in Spanish
which I've never never studied I can
make I can guess what it's about but
there are other people who really don't
like seeing things in languages they
don't know they say I just want to see
English I don't want to see all the
bloody French or German or whatever so
maybe as a service like this could
introduce some kind of language
filtering detect what language the
Twitter's are in okay that's not that
difficult we've got language recognition
algorithm which which work more or less
especially if the tool knows that I
Stephanie I'm going to be sending
Twitter's in either English or French
not that hard to make out if it's French
or English
okay so is one example of something that
could become a nice multilingual space
if we add a few features to cater to
everybody's Center sensitivities so
going multilingual is quite a challenge
you need to create a space which is good
for monolingual people but also good for
multilingual people actually the
opposite you need to create a space
which is good for multilingual people
but which is also good for monolingual
people or people who don't have the
right multilingual skills how do we keep
everybody happy monolingual Scott silos
in my opinion do not keep everybody
happy they they are a solution but I
think that it's not very difficult to
find a better solution
so if we think about going multilingual
there are really two sets of problems
okay it's a strategic and a technical
issue and the first bit is really the
strategic part how are we going to allow
languages to mix okay how are we going
to manage that how we're going to do it
really are we going to translate certain
bits and not others how are we going to
translate them how are we going to keep
the translations current what are we
going to do when we've got content in
one language and not in the others what
are we going to show people how are we
going to know what people want us to
show them how do people define their
language skills okay all these questions
need to be solved before people start
writing code and then from a technical
point of view you have design issues
different people who do localization
know this different languages take up
different screen real estate encoding
and lots of things on the technical side
are today in today's web way more broken
than they should be I bump into encoding
problems all the time because I use
tools which are made by english-speaking
people for english-speaking people to
write French well encoding problems just
whoo show up you know and in HTML you
can define the language of any element
using the language attribute you can
define the language of a destination
link using the hreflang attribute people
don't use them people don't use them
because there are no tools which take
advantage of them I have a blog which is
marked up correctly in which there are
bits of French bits of English I stick
that in an automatic translator the
automatic translator tries to translate
everything from English to French or
everything from French to English
technologically we should be smart
enough to be able to detect what
languages are on the page without me
telling the translator and being able to
say oh oh wait there's a language
attribute here it says I've got a little
island of French in the middle of all
this English oh so I'm not going to try
to translate that little island of
French back into French little things
like that which if soft will already
make the web a nicer multilingual space
then there's all the question of
language detection and automatic
translation automatic translation is fun
it's nice if you know some of the source
language it can actually really help but
i mean if i use the japanese automatic
translator japanese to english I've done
it once it gives me a vague idea what
the thing is the source is about but not
more
so they're roughly reached the end of
the slide presentation some photo
credits which are not very visible
because of the light but the
presentation will be online so you can
find them there my cat who is a actually
a multilingual cat as he was born and
raised in india and then moved to
Switzerland so he had to learn to speak
with the French cats he managed and I'd
be very interested to know if you've got
questions or ideas or issues you want to
raise or things you want me to talk
about again because it I went too fast
and it wasn't here junya
so if with translation
well the thing is of you if you really
if I understood you correctly you're
talking about using automatic
translation to provide a translated
version of the blog yes I did that
sample quite a few years ago there was a
little toggle thing on my blog you could
say I went only English or only French
and that is actually really important I
haven't done it because I'm lazy but as
I said some people really resent being
shown languages they don't understand so
I think it's important if you're
creating a multilingual or bilingual
space to allow people to make it
monolingual okay is that what you're
asking yeah yeah I did it with a bit of
JavaScript and is not very difficult the
code is out there it's been done it just
needs to be implemented yes
yep
see
well if the language for butte is not
present at least trying to recognize the
language so that when i went to
translate a page the default languages
source language is not always english
always you know english to spanish truly
annoying and the other thing would be
presenting source and translation side
by side in two columns because as i said
i think automatic translation is most
useful when you already know the source
language so typically for me and german
i did nine years of german at school so
theoretically I'm supposed to know it
but I never used it I was bad at it at
school I don't know the vocabulary
anymore so if I could display German on
the left english or french strands
automatic translation on the right i
would be able to read through the german
which I more or less understand and use
the automatic translation to help ok so
that would be kind of layout which would
be really useful yeah yes there is this
basic assumption on the internet that
one language one page equals one
language just like the other basic
assumption that one country one language
it's just not correct yes
technology
reach out I feel like it's a big factor
of less crazy
yes
what special remaining given up in
English like minority like what are you
suggesting clients
yeah i would i would just start by
instead of using geographical location i
would use the OS language i think it's a
much better bet because if people are
using english as their OS language they
understand enough English to use the
website in English too and and then at
least Google already has the option for
the user to change the language and of
course if the user changes the language
set a cookie or whatever to remember it
that which is also something which is
not technologically new but I say that
OS language or browser language is a
much safer bet than location yes
Oh
but how
we
Oh
although we decide what they
mm-hmm well I think that one thing that
could help there is having a kind of
universal language profile for people so
that I could define somewhere these are
my language preferences and then any any
two or website could go and pick them
out the the thing about being more
comfortable in certain languages with
certain topics i think is well riya head
of where we are I haven't actually
thought about that yeah you could have
multilingual interfaces for example I
was talking with a friend of mine who
has learned Welsh and she said well you
know Microsoft has made a Welsh version
of Windows but even the Welsh were Welsh
people don't use it because Microsoft
have gone so far as they translated all
the error messages and the Welsh people
don't understand the error messages
because they've had to kind of invent
technical words in Welsh okay what
you're saying that if there was good
gmail in Welsh if it was 100% in wash
she wouldn't be able to use it because
it would be too confusing but you could
imagine raided mixes of languages for
example Welsh with English tooltips or
you could have you know a bit of
Japanese and I mean then you can start
dreaming about you know using interfaces
as learning tools for learning foreign
languages if you're going to be going in
Japan in a year you could slowly move
your OS over to Japanese every month
having a few a bit more you know things
like that but he'll be creative yes
he talked about the censorship is you
like I know specifically what
which is e mais restrict
viewing items like Nazi memorabilia
they do that based on your language I
didn't know about that so you're telling
me about it I don't think I think that
in general the bonds between language
and country is is overrated okay so it
goes both ways assuming that I speak
this language because I'm in this
country or assuming that I'm in this
country because I speak this language is
not the smartest move sometimes you
can't do otherwise sometimes you're left
with it's the only thing you've got but
you should try the other solutions first
yes sir lucious all the various ways to
detect language is none of those work
for the person whose travel
you see any solution that I mean I don't
let me present
um I didn't understand your question
none of the examples I gave yeah you're
travelin yes I'll go to Japan and
Superman internet kiosk yes right ah ok
if I'm not traveling with my computer
yeah yeah travel with your laptop first
if you can that would be my best
solution especially if you're going to
Japan ha that I'd say that if you're
traveling to Japan have to work on a
Japanese computer and you don't know
enough Japanese define you in the
computer you're in a mess anyway so I I
don't know if it really happens a lot I
guess it will but yeah yeah like issue
your duties Kenya where like arresting
friends of friends
there you go
all you see you
so that's an issue
but that would be that's a problem which
is on the OS level okay because the
problem is a computer to start with so
so you know the OS would need a nice
little switch now you say who's changed
us to English please but that is it's
not for me it's less of a web issue than
an OS issue yes yes yes we got feeling I
was on
I find the browser and I could type
blogger com right and if one side logged
in I can probably hear that even if
another management class the ones who
did that well yeah well the present
situation now is that you're in Japan so
anyway you're going to see Japanese
whatever you log on so there are I know
that wordpress com does this the
localized versions are available on you
do fr wordpress com and you have the
French version so you can ask for the
language version of a site directly by
by just adding the language code in the
URL which is really rather simple so
when I give talks in Switzerland I tell
people go and look at wordpress com I
tell them go to Fr wordpress com because
I know they're French speakers and they
won't be put off by landing on an
English page to start with
yeah other questions
I don't know what time it is actually
real ah that's why the computer
disappeared okay right well if you've
got more questions or ideas I want to
talk about this more my details were on
the screen they're not anymore but I've
got little cards with my email address
on them if you want them and thank you
for your attention it's nice to have you
