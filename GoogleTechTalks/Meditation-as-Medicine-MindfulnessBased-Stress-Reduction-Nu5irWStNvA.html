I think that's it with that please
welcome my friend and our friend Bob
store thank you you all hear me okay
so very nice to be here and thank you
for making some time out of your workday
to come and hear about mindfulness which
is what I'll be speaking about today and
maybe I'll just start Y by sharing a
little bit about my own personal journey
how did I end up becoming a mindfulness
based stress reduction teacher and my
actual journey began quite young in life
when I had an experience when I was four
years old I was riding in the backseat
of my parents car and I had this
realization that I or anyone could die
at any moment it was a very powerful
realization at four years old and I
brought this up to my mother and father
and they said to me very lovingly don't
worry Bobby it's called Bobby then don't
worry Bobby it's not going to happen for
a long long long long time and I
actually could tell by the sound of
their voice that they were being very
loving and they were trying to protect
me
but I knew what I knew and what I knew
was that they were not telling me the
truth because what I knew was that death
could come at any moment to anyone and
that was a very shocking realization at
four years old to realize this and
unfortunately to say by the time I was
eight nine years old I lost a younger
brother who died of a disease my best
friend
Ellen who lived across the street from
me I played with her every day went into
a diabetic coma and passed away one
evening and downstairs in a two family
house said I was living in my
grandfather had died of a heart attack
and so growing up I experienced a lot of
confusion and despair what is this life
and this also coincided with the the
1960s and as you know the times were
a-changin and the beatles grew their
hair long and there was social unrest
there was lots happening
I grew up outside of the Boston area
well after graduating high school and my
my sole purpose was to get out of high
school because school didn't make any
sense to me and I decided that I needed
to do something after discovering that
my friends had all gone to college and
thought well maybe I should go to
college and so I ended up going to
school in the Northeast Kingdom of
Vermont a small State College I was
really into downhill skiing and I
thought well this would be a good place
to go right near a ski area and started
school there and was having a good old
time partying and after flunking out in
my sophomore year and being ready to be
mitad back on warning I decided well
maybe I should take a look at what's
actually on the course catalog and see
if there's anything interesting there
that I would like to take and for
whatever reason very funny enough
there's this course called Hinduism
Buddhism Taoism and Zen I had never
taken a class like this ever before in
my life and I figured that I had nothing
to lose I've had experiences growing up
in Boston with the Orient Chinese
restaurants ironically enough and there
was a very different feel there and I
was alert to the east in many ways not
only with the food but with the art and
so I took this class Hinduism Buddhism
Taoism and Zen and when I went into the
class I was shocked to discover that my
professor was sitting on top of his desk
in a full lotus position now I had never
seen a professor like this before most
of them had suit jackets and ties and
they were pretty straight and pretty
uptight but this guy was sitting on top
of his desk in a full Lotus and he began
talking and when I listening to him I
realize and sensed that he knew
something that I didn't know and I
wanted to know what he knew there was
something about him I never met a person
like him ever before
and we began studying the daodejing
bilats ooh the way of life and I just
fell in love with the Dow and I never
realized that people thought about life
in this way my education thus far was
about reading and writing and arithmetic
and it made really no sense to me
because and when I look back on this I
was really in a place of a lot of
despair and confusion I was very lost
and didn't even know that I was lost
that's how lost I was well after reading
the Dao de Jing and coming across
epigram number 47 where it said there's
no need to look outside your window for
everything that you need to know is
inside you
and when I read that it was this almost
like a redwood tree hit me over the head
and woke me up and I recognized that I
had been spending most of my life
looking outside of myself for answers
and that if I wanted to know anything I
needed to begin to look inside here and
that really began my journey of
meditation which is now over 35 years
ago kind of amazing when I look back at
it at this point that class began a
journey a spiritual journey if you will
for me and ended up moving to San
Francisco and getting a going to
graduate school and Counseling
Psychology and getting introduced more
formally to focus on a-- or mindfulness
meditation from there that led me to
studying with a teacher and she said why
don't you come with me to burma and meet
my teacher venerable Tunku Lucero who
was a terrified and Forrest monk Burma
is now called Myanmar and so on November
9th 1980 I embarked on a plane to
Southeast Asia to Burma to become a
forest monk for a temporary period of
time life is very different in Burma and
the life of a forest monk is a lonely
life but it's a very powerful life of
very intensive meditation practice and I
really loved that life for the time that
I was there then we moved we were
invited to come back to the United
States and we brought our teacher Tunku
Lucero and we founded with a group of us
a monastery in Boulder Creek right here
in Santa Cruz County not too far away
and started a monastery by Big Basin
State Park called Tunku Luka by a
monastery
and I ended up living there for over
eight and a half years practicing very
intensively after leaving the monastery
entering into the advanced practice
getting married having two children
makes the monastery look easy I needed
to get a job and I was fortunate enough
to get a job working at the Cabrillo
College Stroke Center in Santa Cruz
working with people with strokes in
Parkinson's disease multiple sclerosis
other orthopedic and neurological
conditions and my job being hard there
as a counselor was to teach meditation
relaxation as well as interviewing
prospective new students and so forth
assessing students and I began to teach
mindfulness at the stroke center and I
used to get feedback from various
students saying this mindfulness is
really helping me and I remember this
one old lady saying yeah this
mindfulness is really keeping me out of
a nursing home and I said what do you
mean just cuz look at me I'm an old lady
I got a pee in the middle of the night
you know and every night I have to get
up and I have to walk to the toilet and
so when I walk to the toilet I'm mindful
lifting my foot up moving it forward
placing it down I'm being mindful of
each step because if I'm not mindful I'm
going to end up falling and breaking my
hip and ending up in a nursing home
she'd had a stroke so she was very
unsure on her feet and I would hear many
other very practical aspects of
mindfulness bringing it into one's life
for health and well-being while I was at
the stroke center I was sharing some of
my work with an ex-monk
friend of mine that sent me eventually a
book called full catastrophe living by
dr. Jon kabat-zinn
and I read this book and I said I can't
believe it somebodies created a whole
program based on mindfulness and
working with stress pain and illness I
want to do this and I wrote John a
letter this was back in 1990 and a
couple of weeks later John called me on
the phone and thanked me for writing him
the letter and inviting me to come to
UMass Medical Center to meet with him
and see the center and as my family's
from the Massachusetts area was actually
in a couple months later I was I came to
the UMass Medical Center this was all
before John became much more famous in
1993 when healing in the mind was
featured with Bill Moyers that he's got
very busy since then but it was
wonderful to meet John back in the early
1990s and he was very supportive in me
starting a program and so I was very
fortunate when I came back to Santa Cruz
that I began a program in 1991 at the
Cabrillo College Stroke Center and then
later at El Camino Hospital here in
Mountain View and Santa Cruz Medical
Foundation we were actually involved in
starting the first my phone space stress
reduction programs in California and
I've been teaching at these medical
centers and more ever since so I feel
very grateful to John kabat-zinn and
this work of mindfulness and bringing it
into mainstream America and I really
appreciate the genius of this practice
in how we can here I am now at Google
speaking about something that I went off
to Asia for many years ago and and how
that my fulness is proliferated in our
culture and it's so amazing that we hear
about mindfulness effects with this
research in neuroscience and education
and psychology mindfulness is spreading
its wings in many different areas and
it's currently well it's kind of a hot
item mindfulness I understand that
mindfulness is also offered here at
Google I'm very happy to hear about that
I understand there's a new eight-week
crap class starting this Thursday with
my colleague Renee Burkhart and I
understand the class is full and a
waiting list but don't worry there's
going to be more classes so if you're
interested you can you'll hear about
them
but as a working definition I want to
maybe just speak a little bit about
mindfulness what is it how does it
relate to stress reduction and I'd also
would like to do some practice and and I
think that this is a perfect place to do
practice right here in the midst of the
of the workday but first I'll just begin
with what is mindfulness and so we've
heard of this word a lot and I trust if
I how many of us here are familiar with
mindfulness practice so there's a quite
a number of hearings up this is
wonderful if I ask this question about
15 years ago I might find one person so
this is very wonderful but so perhaps
some of this will be a you will hear
some of what I have said before but may
you take it as in a new way because
mindfulness really teaches us about
beginner's mind seeing things fresh and
new and in the moment and when we speak
of mindfulness we're really speaking
about learning to be more present in our
moment-to-moment day-to-day life and
when you consider the only moment that
we actually ever really live in is the
present moment which is right now you're
listening to me we're here in this room
this is what's happening yet at times
and I trust they will probably see it in
the workings of our own mind that it's
difficult to actually stay present we
might be thinking I really hope this guy
gets down at two o'clock because I got
to go back to work and got to do this
and that or maybe it's thinking about
what happened earlier in the morning
maybe it's no coincidence that John
Lennon once said life is what happens
while you're busy making other plants
it's a very funny wonderful statement
but sometimes if we take a look at the
workings of our mind we see that it's
often occupied in future thinking and
past memories and often missing what's
happening in the moment a psychologist
friend of mine once remarked after
beginning her mindfulness training that
her mind often worked in two modes of
operation and I said what do you mean
because yeah my mind is either
rehearsing or it's rehashing rehashing
or rehearsing I love that and when you
think about all of the energy
that we put into rehearsing about future
rehashing about the past if we could
actually bottle that as an energy source
we would have no energy crisis we are so
much of the time living somewhere else
other than this present moment so in
mindfulness training we're training
ourselves to be more present in our
moment-to-moment day to day life for
those of us that are perfectionists you
can forget about it right now about
being mindful every single moment and if
you approach it that way it'd probably
be maddening and you'd probably end up
quitting but if we can bring more
mindfulness into the moments that we
have and make it a practice we'll find
that our mindfulness will begin to grow
mindfulness again is this quality of
being present there is actually two
types of practices in mindfulness but
even before the two practices we would
say it's a way of life but it can be
practiced formally or informally
formally is taking time out whether it's
5 15 20 45 minutes of doing a very
formal practice the mindfulness of
breathing or a body scan meditation or a
sitting meditation that expands the
field of awareness to listening to
sounds body sensations mind states these
are all formal practices of mindfulness
where we're still and we're really going
into the body in mind the informal
practices of mindfulness is learning how
to be more mindful in our everyday life
there's so many moments that we you know
different activities of day-to-day
living that we're doing everyday that
are often doing unmindful eh so for
example like when we're eating let's be
mindful that we're chewing and tasting
and swallowing when we're showering or
sitting on the toilet let's be present
to that when we're having conversation
with someone why not actually really be
there and listen to what it is that
they're saying and if we're walking down
the road being aware that we're walking
down the road if we're driving being
whether we're driving so many different
activities of day-to-day living are
often going unnoticed because we're so
much thinking ahead about the future
are going back in the past and so in our
mindfulness training developing as a way
of life we're working trying to be more
mindful of what we're doing from moment
to moment as well as the formal
practices we may find that practicing
this mindfulness in our day to day life
can really in many ways helped to build
our efficiency of work and also some
precision and also learning how to take
care of ourselves sometimes I have a
little acronym and I actually put it on
the board behind me and it's the acronym
is called stop and we invite people
during the day to practice this so S
stands to stop for a moment even in the
midst of your workday I have a friend of
mine that has a computer on a desk like
probably many of us and she has a
program for once an hour all of a sudden
will come the word stop and in that
moment she'll take one minute she'll
stop and the T stands to take a breath
breath in and a breath out maybe we can
do that right now stopping taking a
breath in and a breath out observing for
a moment how're you feeling physically
mentally and emotionally and
acknowledging what's present
and P proceeding on with what you're
doing
many people discover in that moment of
stopping taking a breath and observing
that perhaps their shoulders were up
higher than their ears and in that
moment that you see it you can let them
down
maybe you've been playing the email what
I like to call the email urination game
just one more email one more email one
more email and ride that bladder and to
so many times perhaps that we might be
working on a project and we're going
nowhere and all of a sudden we need to
stop and take a breath and realize we
haven't eaten
we haven't stretched and then we take
care of ourselves and those brief
moments recalibrating taking a snack
going for a walk going to the toilet
whatever it is that we need to do and
all of a sudden we're feeling refreshed
again we're feeling more clear more
centered so our practices of mindfulness
can be very very helpful to help
recalibrate us during the day so it
really would invite you all even in in
your work days here can you take a few
moments every now and again to stop to
take a breath in and a breath out
observe and acknowledge how you're
feeling physically mentally emotionally
how am i feeling in my body my thoughts
my feelings in acknowledging what's
present and then P proceeding on with
what it is that we're doing remember an
engineer at El Camino once remarked that
when he first began the class he was
going to work every day at 6:00 in the
morning and coming home at 8:00 at night
not liking it and his family was not
liking it and by the end of the
eight-week class he was going to work at
8:00 and getting home at 6:00 that was a
four hour differential and yet he was
feeling like he was getting just as much
work done and he attributed to being
more mindful on the job recognizing when
he was going off on tangents recognizing
more earlier than being able to come
back into center that it was really
helping his efficiency and precision
so we're hearing a lot about mindfulness
and how it can help but maybe I'd like
to just spell out a little bit more
about this as far as how does
mindfulness work with stress reduction
or stress management and in the last 25
30 40 years there's growing interest in
the mind-body connection we hear these
words a lot mind-body connection
neuroscientists are very interested in
the mind-body connection in that what is
this connection between our thoughts and
our emotions and our physiology our
bodies and it turns out that
neuroscientists have begun to chart out
various neural pathways connections
between our thoughts and emotions in our
bodies and that our thoughts and
emotions of course are made of chemicals
electrical aspects that begin there's a
communication between our thoughts and
emotions in our body these are found in
the neuro pathways there's actually a
very interesting book called molecules
of emotions by Candace pert that goes
into some of this is quite interesting
but the evidence appears to be very
overwhelming of this mind-body
connection that our thoughts and
emotions are connected with our body now
if I did something perhaps very
embarrassing up here perhaps your faces
might begin to blush and turn red if I
got kind of psycho and kind of crazy
they may be here we begin to stand up on
edge and be ready in this fight flight
or freeze mode there's different
physiological changes that are beginning
to happen well I guess I'll catch that
on the video later what he did and
anyways this different type there and
now you're will laughing you're hearing
me say something and all of a sudden
there's laughter if I said something
very sad maybe water starts coming out
of our eyes so we understand there's a
mind-body connection that our thoughts
and emotions are affected to our bodies
this is the evidence is overwhelmingly
clear and what's important is that if
indeed our thoughts and emotions affect
our bodies then it would serve
us all very well to be more mindful of
the thoughts that we're thinking and the
emotions that we're feeling if indeed
these do affect our body then practicing
mindfulness could be very very important
to help us to become aware of what's
going on now there's times we may not be
aware of the different reactivities that
we're engaging in for example we live
here in the valley and you know maybe
we're riding on 101 and we're trying to
get to work and it's a traffic jam and
it's like oh my gosh I'm not going to
get here on time I have a meeting at
nine o'clock what am I going to do and
then that's going to snowball the whole
day and so we might become aware that
we're in a traffic jam and that what am
I going to do but we might not be aware
of actually how that stress is affecting
us inside our own body in mind we often
are getting so caught in the story of
our lateness and what am I going to do
that we neglect to become mindful of how
it is affecting us on the inside and
this is where mindfulness can play such
a strategic role in helping us to come
back into balance we may unbeknownst to
us begin to react to this stressful
event by beginning to hold the steering
wheel so tightly that our knuckles are
turning white and this is causing all
this muscle skeletal tension within our
bodies and because of that increased
stress there's an anxiety or irritation
and often our pulmonary our lung system
begins to react by breathing more
rapidly more irregularly and of course
our lungs are connected to our heart and
because of this increased respiration
our heart rate and blood pressure
temperature of our body begins to
elevate we're in a stress reactivity and
we're often not even mindful that this
is going on because we're so consumed in
the story of our lateness so where it's
so important about mindfulness is that
once we become aware that we're holding
tightly we can release the grip it's
that simple and yet that far away but
once we become aware that we're holding
tightly we can release the grip once we
become aware that we're breathing more
rapidly and more irregularly that's
forcing our heart rate and blood
pressure to elevate we can begin to
practice
for breathing often trying to bring our
breath into our belly area and as a as a
breathing begins to regulate naturally
our heart rate and blood pressure
temperature for our body begins to come
back into balance and so this is a very
very important aspect of mindfulness is
that it's helping us to recognize where
it is that we are so I'm going to get up
and just show you this on the board a
little illustration this is very
low-tech but what for those that I don't
know if you can read but it says read
this far but says whoops unawareness
with an arrow to disconnection and
disconnection there's an arrow to add a
balance when we're unaware of what's
actually happening to us we're
disconnected from our experience and
when we get disconnected from our
experience we potentially can spin out
of balance and so the example of getting
stuck on the highway and 101 we're
unaware we're disconnected we've begun
to hold the steering wheel so tightly
that our knuckles are turning white our
body is spinning out of balance how do
we get out of this mess first thing is
we become aware and as soon as this
awareness I'm connected again I'm back
I'm here I'm present and now I'm seeing
much more clearly I'm holding tightly my
body's spinning out of balance and I
begin to soften the grip I begin to do
some mindful breathing to get my body
and gradually I come back into balance
so what we can say is that awareness
promotes connection and connection
promotes balance conversely when we're
unaware we're disconnected from our
experience and we can spin out of
balance
it's difficult to change our ways our
patterns often we become habituated in
certain ways of reacting to stresses or
different events that become conditioned
responses conditioned reactions I should
say if we've had experiences in the past
of getting stuck in highway 101 and
getting annoyed and irritated the
probabilities of that happening later
today if you were there are very great
and life goes on
once we become mindful we recognize that
there may be some choice and we can
begin to respond differently this is
very empowering about mindfulness and
there's actually an incredibly beautiful
quote by Viktor Frankl who was a
concentration camp survivor psychiatrist
and author of logos therapy man's search
for meaning but he says this he says
that between the stimulus and the
response there is a space and in that
space lies our freedom between the
stimulus in the response there is a
space and in that space lies our freedom
if we are not mindful we are not aware
of any spaces between our stimulus and
response we are reacting in an impulsive
reactivity if we become aware we have a
choice to respond differently so perhaps
I will say that there's a separation
between impulsive reactivity and
mindfully responding to a situation so
there's a big difference between
impulsive reactivity and mindfully
responding there's actually a very
clever and beautiful poem by petition
Nelson that speaks to this and it's
called autobiography in five short
chapters in Chapter one she says I'm
walking down the street there's a deep
hole and the sidewalk and I fall in and
I'm helpless and it takes a long time
but I finally do get out in Chapter two
I'm walked down the same street there's
a deep hole and the sidewalk and I fall
in again and I know where I am it's my
fault and I get out quickly this time
Chapter three I'm walking down the same
street there's a deep hole and the
sidewalk I fall in again it's a habit
you know this is kind of what I do many
of us can live in Chapter three for a
long time but remembering that quote
again from Viktor Frankl between the
stimulus and the response there is a
space and in that space lies my freedom
to choose this chapter for I'm walking
down the same street there's a deep hole
and the sidewalk and I walk around the
hull Chapter five even better news
I walk down another Street so there's
the potentials of changing our behaviors
our responses through awareness but we
have kind of these strong default
buttons just when we're not looking we
may be impulsively reacting to game to
familiar situations but when our
awareness grows we can begin to change
and possibly develop more constructive
ways if you will of dealing with stress
rather than destructive ways and the
destructive ways again are more
associated with the impulsive reactivity
and constructive ways or when we have a
mindful response when we can recognize
what's here and choose another way so
I've been speaking for bet and I thought
it might be nice to do a little bit of
practice if you're all up for that will
you be will that be alright
like a baby about 5-10 minutes ok so I
maybe invite you if you want to just
stand up and stretch for a second and
get yourself if you feel your body needs
to stretch a bit feel free to do that
then whenever you're ready to come back
into a sitting position
and so let's just begin by just taking a
moment to just acknowledge that we're
going to take some time here just to be
present with ourselves in the midst of
the workday
and I think I'll begin with a beautiful
poem by Mary Oliver that speaks to the
importance of taking care of ourselves
is called the journey one day you
finally knew what you had to do and
began and though the voices around you
kept shouting they're bad advice
and though the whole house trembled in
each voice cried out to you mend my life
mend my life mend my life each voice
cried this time you didn't stop and you
knew what you had to do and though the
wind pried with the stiff fingers and
The Melancholy was terrible it was
already late enough and it was a wild
night and the road was full of fallen
branches and stones and little by little
as you left their voices behind the
stars began to burn through the sheets
of the clouds and there was a new voice
you slowly recognised was your own in a
kept you company as you strode deeper
and deeper into the world determined to
do the only thing you could do
determined to save the only life you
could save and there was a new voice
that you slowly recognized as your own
and it kept you company as you stroll
deeper and deeper into the world
determined to do the only thing you
could do
determined to save the only life you
could save I'm taking some moments now
to come mindful and just began to check
in feeling your body sitting in the
chair feet on the floor coming connected
to the body
and begin to just acknowledge what
you're feeling in the body physically
lightness heaviness any aches itches
tingles tiredness maybe fullness from
lunch checking in with the body and
acknowledging what's present physically
gradually as you feel into your body and
acknowledging any of the physical
sensations feel into the physical
sensation of your breath you might feel
it in your abdomen in your ballet or
your chest expanding as you breathe in
contracting as you breathe out or
perhaps feeling and being mindful of the
breath and the nose feeling the coolness
of the breath as it enters into the nose
and the warmth of it coming out finding
a place in your body we become mindful
of the breath where the breath feels
prominent and distinct and then just
begin to rest your awareness at that
point whether it's in the nose the chest
the ballet or perhaps another place and
just becoming mindful that when you're
breathing in that you're aware that
you're breathing in and as you breathe
out you're aware that you're breathing
out there's no need to manipulate your
breath or counted or visualize it or
analyze it just breathing normally and
naturally breathing in with awareness
and breathing out being present
and it's inevitable that our minds may
wander off into some future thoughts or
past memories and when you become aware
of that acknowledged we went and with
great patience and kindness coming back
to the breath in and the breath out so
easy does it taking our lives one
inhalation and one exhalation at a time
being present
you
you're welcome also if it seems like the
sounds are becoming prominent to let
that be part of the meditation and you
can just shift to hearing just listening
to the different sounds in this room and
noticing their ephemeral nature that
they arise and they pass away so
including sounds if those become
prominent and if not then just stay with
the breath being present
and now letting your awareness begin to
expand to just the sense of checking in
with yourself so we've been feeling into
the body the breath and sounds and
letting yourself just begin to
acknowledge any thoughts and emotions
that are coming in awareness we'll call
this a mindful check-in just
acknowledging what's coming up for you
physically mentally emotionally maybe
there's memories of what happened
earlier today or concerns about what's
going to happen later in the day and
just taking some moment to acknowledge
your different thoughts and emotions any
physical sensations being present
checking in with yourself with awareness
and letting be you don't have to fix
anything or analyze just acknowledging
in the body and thoughts emotions being
present
you
now as we come towards the end of this
meditation bringing awareness into the
chest and into the heart area and we'll
do just a little bit of some
loving-kindness in our mindfulness
practice we work with two types of
meditations insight practices of
mindfulness and the heart practices of
loving-kindness
one of the insights that we sometimes
get when we're practicing mindfulness is
how hard we can be on ourselves and
judgmental to ourselves and to others
so the loving-kindness is a beautiful
practice it softens the hardened heart
such as taking some moments in just
feeling into your own heart with a sense
of kindness and compassion I know we all
understand these words from a dictionary
point of view and it may be another
thing to open into our hearts to
experience these words just feeling into
our own hearts
wishing for our own health and
well-being
may there be reconciliation with our
past that meets the present moment it's
all led us into this moment maybe be at
peace
and letting this goodwill extend
outwards to those of us here in this
room and in this building into this
Google campus everyone here at times
experiences the ten thousand Joy's the
ten thousand sorrows of life spreading
this goodwill to all of our fellow human
beings throughout this world may all
beings be at peace
spreading this goodwill above and below
in all directions from here and
throughout this universe may all beings
without exception be safe and at peace
and Jess is we've extended it outwards
bringing it back inwards into our skin
and flesh and bones to the organs into
the molecules that make up the cells
into the atoms
bathing ourselves in the heart of
loving-kindness may we be at peace may
all beings everywhere be at peace
and now very gently beginning to wiggle
the fingers and toes and opening the
eyes and just being fully present awake
here and now thank you very much so we
have a little bit of time for any
questions that you may have so we'll
have a little period here and maybe to
help work your vocal chords again after
having some silence for a bit maybe
taking a breath in and stretching up and
giving a nice inhalation and a sigh hear
your voice hah
so I don't know if there's another
microphone or if there's I can surely
hear it but if it needs to be recorded
we can yeah that's going to really get a
whole bunch of people up here actually I
can yeah I can just repeat the question
thank you or a comment please
so the question is how do I teach
mindfulness to my kids so there's an old
saying don't be a Buddhist to be a
Buddha and so I say that in the sense
that that my wife and I try to live by
example so we don't necessarily try to
force-feed them
meditation and mindfulness but live by
the example of living it and and also of
course they have to find their own way
in life and so they're familiar with
some of the practices of mindfulness use
what feels appropriate to them and we
essentially give them space but we want
we have a strong value in our family of
living trying to live with kindness and
with integrity and may they find their
way this is going to sound kind of funny
to say but I think there's a threat of
truth to this and I don't say it's the
whole truth my kids also haven't
suffered enough yet and as not that I
wish for them to suffer but I'm sorry to
say that from my path it took a lot of
suffering for me to finally turn deeply
inwards and and you know and I don't
wish my kids a lot of suffering but you
know growing up we'll get we'll have our
own share of suffering with whether it's
not being seen and accepted and being
picked on and so forth and yeah
anyone else or please
great thank you very much I'll see if I
can repeat that in a summarized version
but as a programmer you're using your
mind to really focus very deeply on a
project but not on a broad way of
knowing what's going on around you is
that is that with that and so the and
any ricans concealing with that if you
will you know in some ways we speak
about mindfulness that it can be
practiced and like a laser beam and a
floodlight and so there is certain types
of practices where we are really using
our laser beam of concentration to
absorb our mindfulness on the object
that we're bringing attention to so that
we can begin to sustain it for longer
and longer periods of time till
potentially we almost become at one with
it this is some of the prescriptions for
concentration meditation where you enter
into levels of absorption and Pali the
called jhana and but these are very
concentrated States where you become at
one with the object and there's a lot of
benefits to that type of a practice
where you're getting very concentrated
at the same time to help ease the
practice we work with concentration but
we also can work with the floodlight and
becoming aware of the greater
surroundings of things and you know I
can appreciate as a programmer really
the least distractions and the more
absorption into what you're doing beers
good fortune good results and you know I
think what we would say is can you
remember from time to time that you that
there is a body here and it may need to
stretch go to the toilet need to eat
needs to do what it needs to do and can
they be times where we can mindfully
like okay I'm really working on this
budget can I stop for a moment and take
a breath and observe and then I
proceeded on with what I'm doing so is
there ways to work with both and of
course when you're working with that
concentration you do in the
concentration and when you're not doing
that can you be mindful of whatever else
that you're doing when you're doing it
but I think it could be helpful in the
spirit of self-care
to check in with yourself from time to
time when you're in that real incredible
phase of you know really in your project
- every now and again to stop for a
moment just kind of you know like a
meteorologist kind of check the weather
you know like what's the temperature was
the wind coming from this absence of
getting a sense of what's going on in
your own body of mind you might find in
the long run that's going to be a
greater recalibration to even go further
into your pressures because your mind is
more sharp and more clear and more
refreshed
how was it to do the meditation for a
few minutes any before after comments in
the midst of Google
please
absolutely many many people and I think
what's very powerful is the recognition
that there is another way of seeing one
of the things that we teach about an
MBSR the question is when we get stuck
in chapter 3 and we're just in this
strong habitual pattern of non changing
and one of the things that we like to
try to challenge people is being open to
seeing from another perspective and it's
very difficult when we get really rooted
in the way that we see things so
sometimes if I say I won't do this to
you but there's probably about 50 chairs
here and so we can start switching
chairs and begin to see that every chair
we sit and there's going to be a
different view but yet we get very stuck
in in the chair that we're sitting and
thinking this is the only way of seeing
it and so we'll work with with really
helping people to expand beyond their
perceptions of how they see things and
actually I love John kabat-zinn has a
very beautiful definition for healing
and it's to come in to terms with the
way things are and and so we can say
some ways is the difference between
healing and curing so that some people
that will have a stroke that may not
necessarily have a lot of improvement
with their ability to regain some
movement however one can begin to heal
and come in to terms with the way things
are and be able to live with themselves
in their lives in a way that is much
more meaningful and feel less than a
curse it's going to involve though
really being willing to embrace and
acknowledge the parts of ourselves that
we're having our time with in one of the
gateways in it when I'm teaching MBSR
working with people with stress pain and
illness you know mindfulness isn't
doesn't mean developing a positive mind
so that's something that's very
important we want to understand
mindfulness is about seeing things as
they are in acknowledging what's present
and so sometimes with the Gateway for
the beginning of the healing work is for
people to first begin to acknowledge how
much they hate the situation that
they're in how much anger that they're
feeling how much sadness how much fear
of what's going on and as we begin to
develop a relationship with our pain by
acknowledge
we can begin to transform it there's a
wonderful saying that whatever you flee
from it will pursue you whatever you
welcome will begin to transform you and
one of the principles that we work with
mindfulness is that when we have
resistance to what's here we will
inevitably increase our suffering
suffering when we can learn how to go
with what's happening our suffering can
begin to dissipate so there's actually a
very powerful line from a Dan of Falls
poem that says resisting the tides will
sweep you off your feet allow and grace
will carry you to higher ground and so
we're working within this practice to
recognize when the resistance is there
acknowledging the resistance and see if
there's a way that we can begin to work
with that begin to open to it so our
time just about here one more please
oh I the question is I'm not sure with
question quite about about productivity
in the West and like you know and then
finding that the mindfulness class is
very helpful in applying to the rest of
one's life but what would it be like to
be in a monastery and yeah well actually
so what's my view between both worlds
and to actually to be very honest as
time has gone on the my life is the
monastery and whatever comes up in my
life is the practice and that I don't
feel as much personally any separation
between the monastery life and my
householder life I can no doubt find a
lot of different dual reasons what why
one should be better than the other but
ultimately speaking I really recognize
it's really one of the same is actually
another one of junk habits in this book
is wherever you go there you are and so
wherever I go there I am no matter
whether I'm in the monastery or sitting
here in Google or driving on highway 101
I'm this is it
Here I am and how can I work with this
practice to be present to wherever it is
that I am that to me is where the rubber
meets the road and there is times in my
life where I have spent no doubt many
years in intensive meditation practice
and that has been incredibly beneficial
something that I feel so immensely
grateful that I had that time to do that
I hope actually again to take off for
about a year and do a year-long retreat
I feel like that you know there's these
times of going in and times of going out
but ultimately speaking our life is the
practice and when we get that then
everything that comes up in our life is
part of the practice and so that is
wonderful so a and I'm not saying
wonderful and the peachy cushy way
because sometimes we come across things
that are very difficult actually about
13 years ago I nearly died of
flesh-eating bacteria in necrotic
fasciitis and
was incredibly grateful that I had this
practice to to open-toe to work with
that as as it was arising and so we find
we can bring this practice to all types
of situations well I want to honor our
time it's just about it is to 201 to be
exact at least on my watch so I don't
want to keep you I want to thank you so
much for your time and interest in
listening and heart here and I wish you
well and I want to personally invite you
