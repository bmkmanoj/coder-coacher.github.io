to introduce less que les is abbot of
the Canon doe tempo here in Mountain
View and a master in the Soto Zen
lineage of shouldnt reuses uki Roshi
many of you probably know less his
teacher through the wonderful book Zen
mind beginner's mind many of you
probably don't realize that the lectures
collected in this this beautiful book
were given by Suzuki Roshi here in
Silicon Valley at the small sitting
group that ultimately grew to become the
same canon doe temple that less now
leads in the introduction to less his
own book zenit work my friend Misha
Merrill describes less as unique place
in our local Zen history in this way
less was profoundly affected by Suzuki
Roshi and his teachings and within a few
years he was a Zen monk practicing with
a small group in Los Altos California
where Suzuki Roshi came to speak once a
week now this may not seem so odd
considering the times plenty of people
in the San Francisco area were doing
some pretty exotic things during the 60s
and early 70s Zen practice was just one
item on the menu but imagine if you can
a neatly dressed IBM manager sitting in
the midst of all this craziness someone
who continued to have an ordinary home
life and drive to work every day nine to
five that was something else indeed
after more than 30 years at IBM less
eventually retired in 1990 to devote
himself to Zen teaching and practice at
canon dough and beyond he has long taken
a special interest in the integration of
meditation practice and working life so
he has a wonderful guest to join us here
at Google where so many are trying to do
the same please join me in welcoming
less k
good afternoon it's exciting for me to
be here and it's an honor because you
have had some terrific guest speakers
did in the last over the last several
months and thanks to Maine I've had a
chance to review the videos of two of
your most recent speakers Jon kabat-zinn
and Matthew Mac you ricard how you say
it Matthew that's good Matthew record
and they were very inspiring and very
touching talks that they gave the videos
were were wonderful and I was very moved
by their their presence the presence of
these two men to me they exhibited can't
see if I do that these men exhibited for
outstanding qualities first of all they
were very smart the very intelligent men
they showed dedication and sincerity to
the work that they were doing on on
behalf of others they were very wise and
finally they were just nice guys just
and if any any of you see see them
either of them if you did I think you'll
agree those are qualities that that they
displayed now today you have me now my
intelligence doesn't come near there's
they have their PhDs from very well
respected universities in very difficult
scientific topics and me I'm just
grateful that I have my my bachelor of
science my intelligence doesn't match
theirs I don't know where we get our
intelligence from is it genetic do we
get it in the first few years of our
life I don't know where we get it from
but at some point you know you realize
you can't really do much about enhancing
your intelligence you you got what you
got it at some point in your life
I can't do anything about my
intelligence but these three other
factors i have some choices and we all
have choices about those other factors
about being dedicated and sincere about
being wise and about being nice people
to have those qualities in buddhism
that's called selflessness it's called
selflessness to be selfless and we can
all make that kind of effort if that's
the way we want to be in our life we can
make that kind of effort that effort is
called spiritual practice not religion
that's something else but spiritual
practice so what I would like to what I
hope to convey to you today is the
relevance of spiritual practice to our
daily lives and how it can bring us
balance in a busy and stressful world
for the past hundred years or so our
society American Society has slowly
become overwhelmed by the rapid growth
of Technology and I think you think
you'll sets there's some truth in that
the rapid growth of Technology and the
increasing abundance of material goods
that's what the 20th century brought us
technology and material goods you bring
us many advantages in our lives they
make us safe they protect our health
they increase our comfort
and they overall in crew improve our
quality of life technology and
materialism they do those things for us
but the problem is over the past century
or so we have allowed them to create an
environment that conditions us to be
concerned mainly with what we can do and
what we can possess and we slowly start
to lose our concern for who we really
are what we really are that's the
unintended consequences of technology
and of material abundance the unintended
consequences so for the past two or
three generations we have become more
and more excited about consumer goods I
think the first Sears Roebuck catalog
came out in like 1898 and it became
extremely popular because now you had
pictures of the stuff that you could you
could get and over the century that kind
of advertising got more and more
sophisticated so we became slowly
condition to getting more things newer
things bigger things better things were
more entertaining things inherently
that's not bad but there are unintended
consequences because we slowly become
conditioned to the feeling that I must
have it I have to have it I give or open
the newspaper the back of the first
section of the Mercury News has this
huge fries add you know and you look and
say oh I gotta have that you know you
get we becoming conditioned that way
it's not because we're bad people but
that's what's happening
when we become overwhelmed by
materialism our spiritual life
diminishes because people become not so
concerned who they are and how they are
to be in this world or what is helpful
in this world or what is the best way to
understand other people and what is the
best way to be with other people we
start to become concerned with our own
personal well-being that's just what
happens doesn't mean we're bad people
but that's what happens we become
conditioned by the society we're in it's
what happens so the fundamental insight
of Buddhism in your past two speakers
were Buddhists me to the fundamental
insight of Buddhism is that suffering
human suffering comes from desire if you
know anything about Buddhism that's the
first thing you read suffering comes
from desire a desire that is based on
ignorance of the real nature of the
phenomenal world but now this ignorance
that Buddhism talks about has nothing to
do with not being smart it has nothing
to do with lack of intelligence or
having a small limited mental capacity
the ignorance that Buddhism talks about
is the result of having a narrow
worldview a narrow world view as if we
were living in a tunnel in our worldview
that comes from living in a tunnel so so
that we cannot see or be aware of the
world around us and we cannot feel our
intimacy and our connection with our
world and so therefore we are unable to
recognize the nature of things
that's what a narrow world view does to
us we can't recognize the nature of
things and we lose our intimacy it's
like living in a dream world which in
turn causes us to think and behave
foolishly and create suffering even
though we may be very smart even though
intelligence may be there we think then
behave foolishly let me give you an
example of that I think you're all
familiar with the story of Genesis story
of Genesis Adam and Eve lived in Eden
and they had everything everything they
could possibly need and so they were
perfectly happy and content no problems
anywhere they had everything but they
were tempted and they had a desire for
one more thing they gave in to their
desire for one more thing even though
they didn't need it they give in to a
desire for one more thing and that
created suffering that's the story of
the Bible now the Bible tells you that
that's original sin Buddhism says that's
original foolishness that has nothing to
do with being sinful it means being
foolish so when we give in to our
desires for something we really don't
need it's acting foolishly and that
creates suffering to me that's the
that's the meaning of the Genesis story
that's the Buddhist interpretation of
the Genesis story so the antidote to
desire and the antidote to suffering is
spiritual practice now it's not about
religion spiritual practice is not about
religion because there's no Dogma
connected with it there's no worship
and there's no belief system you don't
have to believe in anything to engage in
spiritual practice spiritual practice is
about having our life express our
inherent human qualities are inherent
human qualities generosity patience
energy caring wisdom those are our
inherent spiritual qualities we are not
originally sinful we are originally like
your previous two speakers who were
really nice guys and really cared that's
who we are fundamentally this what
spiritual practice is about helping us
manifest those qualities we are
inherently selfless we are inherently
unselfish however it that quality that
quality gets too often obscured by our
desires this is the point of Buddhism
desires get in the way of who you are so
when we have spiritual practice in our
lives when we can act selflessly we have
a feeling of satisfaction and joy
despite any difficulties that may occur
in our life despite any suffering it may
occur we feel okay and feel joy in our
life we feel connected with each other
we feel friendly and warm we're not
jealous we're not defensive we're not
competitive we're not judgmental that
spiritual practice and it all starts
with meditation and you have a
meditation program here in your
workplace and you're blessed because of
it spiritual practice starts with
meditation which really is when you look
at meditation when you look at what
you're doing in meditation
really is the practice of awareness
awareness awareness is not a religious
term is it emphasizing awareness and
practicing awareness is the basis of
spiritual practice nothing to do with
religion the practice of awareness means
we are continually present not
distracted or at least we're trying to
be present and we're trying not to be
distracted can't do it 100 percent we
can't be perfect at it we get distracted
but we try we're making our best effort
to be aware to be present so spiritual
practice enables us to understand things
beyond their appearances and beyond what
common sense may tell us about something
or someone we see beyond all that and we
see to the truth of things this is what
spiritual practice does for us
a short story about awareness and
attention awareness a paying attention
it seems like a very very ordinary
activity you know something you do all
the time but actually it is the
foundation like I say it's the
foundation of spiritual practice now a
long time ago once upon a time say in
the 9th century in China there was a man
who was a a counselor to the Emperor and
he went to see the local Zen master and
he said in this kingdom people are very
difficult to govern they are so unruly
they it's really hard to to manage them
it's really hard to govern them they're
so unruly please give me a word of
wisdom to help govern them so the Zen
master picked up his his brush and he
dipped it in the ink and he wrote the
calligraphy for attention and maybe you
can show me later with that looks like
so this the counselor got very angry he
said hey I asked you to help me I asked
you for some wisdom and you give me this
give me a word of wisdom so the Sun
teacher took his brush dipped in ink and
he then wrote attention attention
what does this mean why does attention
equate to wisdom how does attention
govern the unruly now we believe we
assume that we're always giving our
attention I'm aware I know what's going
on we believe that but it's not always
so because we're very easily distracted
and when you do meditation you notice
that you can come aware that when you
sit in meditation you notice how your
mind likes to go and do some other
things we are easily distracted and we
are always letting our awareness stray
and we multitask on purpose don't we we
let our attention straight so that Zen
teacher said try to illustrate to this
man attention is the most important
thing there are many there are many
different ways are many different things
that we should pay our attention to
there are three first of all we should
pay attention to what we do in our daily
life and to the things of our daily life
and when we do this completely we can
understand we can deeply understand how
things exist in this world and this is
important to understand how things are
in the daily world a world made up of
temporary shapes forms colors sounds
that are constantly changing everything
is constantly changing and when we pay
attention to the things of this world we
finally start to recognize that that
things are not permanent so when we give
our attention to the ordinary things of
the world we see their into their true
nature and we see that all things have
the same fundamental qualities without
exception
and this is an important dimension of
wisdom understanding the nature of the
things of the everyday world the second
thing we should pay attention to is each
other to people how we are how we are
the same how we are different from each
other how we react how people create
things how people find comfort how they
are helpful to each other and how they
suffer with awareness we come to
understand with awareness of each other
with awareness of people we come to
understand how we should be with each
other and thereby come into harmony
rather than isolation and finally the
third thing that we should give our
attention to and constantly be aware of
is our self we should be aware of our
activities and how we do them how we do
things we should be aware of how we do
things do we do them with a calm mind or
a frantic mind with anxiety or with
peace we should pay attention to
ourselves especially when we get clumsy
and make a mistake that's the most
important time to be aware of ourselves
because when we make a mistake our
awareness can alert us I didn't pay
attention just then I made a mistake i
got clumsy i didn't pay attention just
then and as we know attention attention
awareness can tell us oh i didn't pay
attention just then then we can pay
attention to any feelings that arise
because we made a mistake look at my
response to that look at my reaction to
that
painful feelings can arise when we do
something clumsy when we make a mistake
we painful feelings just can arise in us
and that's a form of suffering those
painful feelings and from that suffering
we then we can make a vow to be more
mindful and to pay attention in that way
a mistake can be helpful if we pay
attention to it and open to it not push
it away it can be helpful because it
causes us to suffer a little bit and out
of that suffering we say I don't want
that to happen again I'm going to pay
attention mistakes can be helpful then
they can help us be creative if we're
willing to pay attention to them so when
if we don't have awareness practice
continually life gets mixed up we make
all kinds of mistakes we don't pay any
attention to him and life keeps getting
crazy life gets mixed up in our view of
life becomes narrow like as if we're
looking at the world from inside of a
tunnel and without awareness without
paying attention to the way things are
and to the way people are and to the way
we are without paying attention to that
we can become fooled by appearances you
become fooled by appearances we can't
tell the difference between something
that's good and something that appears
to be good we get all mixed up and we
become a slave to our desires to our
preferences to fashions and to our
unexamined values we all carry around a
set of values about what we think is the
truth of things and the way things
should be but have we really examined
them to see if they're valid without
awareness we don't examine our own
values and who knows they could be way
off base
when we become a slave to our desires
and our preferences our reflection and
our selflessness selflessness it gets
short-circuited
however there is a feeling emerging in
our society it's just starting to emerge
that fulfilling our desires is not
enough to provide us meaning the fact
that you have a meditation program here
is evidence that something's happening
something is emerging in our culture
that says there's materialism mmm this
technology you know it's maybe not
enough people are beginning to ask to
think this way people are beginning to
recognize that emphasizing putting the
emphasis on consuming leaves an empty
feeling there is a sense that there must
be more to life than possessions more
and more people are beginning to feel
this way when we recognize that pursuing
happiness pursuing happiness is a
superficial way to live we start to ask
ourselves what should be my true
orientation in life if that doesn't work
if that gives me an empty feeling what
should I be doing what's my true
orientation and we look around for other
choices and some are beginning to emerge
we ask ourselves what's the point of my
life how should I live in what is
happiness anyhow what is it after all
these are spiritual questions these are
spiritual questions they're like every
their everyday questions but they're
really spiritual questions because it
means we are seeking we want to know
what it is that's real when we start
asking those kinds of questions
this is the start of spiritual practice
so practice starts with recognizing that
pleasures are not enough and that
attaching to them robs us of
understanding and distracts us from
living an authentic life at bottom
that's what we want we want to know
what's real what's true and we want to
live our life authentically if we get
caught up pursuing possessions it covers
over this fundamental desire when we
finally get fed up with possessions we
say wait a minute I have some questions
here I need to explore an answer and I
really believe that's what's starting to
happen it's been starting to happen for
the last 50 years these things have a
very slow momentum but that's what's
happening now many people are very
skeptical of the notion or the idea of
spiritual practice they think spiritual
practice means you have to drop out of
society if to go live on a mountain or
you have to live in the desert or a cave
or something or they say well it's too
demanding for me an ordinary person I
can't do that they feel that spiritual
practice will interfere with having
normal everyday life and that you have
we have to live in some kind of steer
ascetic
and it's the other word I'm thinking
about
I'll think about it later
but you know I just lost the word what
is it when you're when you're not
married when you don't have relations
with another celibate they think
spiritual life means you have to be
celibate ascetic and austere you have to
live in isolation oh oh oh that's it
he's going to program me right out of
here it's not true it's not so it's not
so material and physical comforts are
okay they're inherently not bad fun is
okay right fun is okay satisfaction is
okay having friends is okay having a
family life is okay working the problems
with your friends and solving these
problems and making progress it's okay
there's nothing wrong with it it's not a
sin but it is true that we as human
beings are easily overwhelmed with
pleasures and possessions material
things surround us everywhere you go and
they encourage our desires and the
encouraged attachments and they
interfere with our understanding and
with wisdom they need to fear with our
relationships and the interfere with our
peace of mind if we let it go too far
now when we recognize the limitation
limitations of possessions and comforts
then we start to seek balance in our
lives few people very small percentage
of people say I'm dropping out of all
this it's too much I'm going to go live
on a mountain too much I give it up most
of us say you know this stuff isn't
isn't isn't sinful by itself but I got
to find a balance I gotta find a balance
so we seek balance in our lives when we
recognize that there is a limitation to
pursuing possessions and we turn to
spiritual practice to understand we turn
to spiritual practice to understand who
we are fundamentally and what life
should be beyond having possessions and
what life is like beyond the appearance
of things material greatness is not the
true measure of a society you know we
think about some previous empires the
Roman Empire or the Empire of Alexander
the Great hey the great the great Roman
Empire the great Babylonian Empire
whatever it may be usually we measure
that greatness based on the material
accomplishments but the true measure of
greatness of a society or of an
individual is in non material
relationships to greatness is in our non
material relationships such as how we
support each other how we care for each
other how we encourage each other how we
create things together and our openness
with each other this is the true measure
of greatness not
how material well off we were or are so
our awareness our practice of awareness
our spiritual practice encourages us to
reflect on ourselves and how we are in
the world and how we relate to people
into things are we careful of what we do
and what we say do we take care with
that are we attentive are we accepting
or we respectful of each other and of
what the world offers or are we
interested only in what pleases us and
do we simply ignore what we don't like
and therefore do we become careless
spiritual practice our awareness
practice encouraged us to read Courage's
us to reflect on those aspects of our
life now despite all of our efforts to
create a trouble free world unpleasant
things arise difficulties do arise and
it's beyond our control most of the time
because things just change but if we
react to these difficulties by
complaining and pushing things away we
simply create problems remember
something that I experienced when I was
really small when I must have been three
or four years old I'll never forget this
episode I was a kid really a little kid
and I was at a friend's house playing
playing with a friend at his house and
his his mother said come on here's lunch
so we went and sat down at the table for
lunch and his mother prepared had
prepared something presented to gave
each of us a plate of which he prepared
and my friend pick up the plight knee
threw it across the room because clearly
he wasn't happy with what his mother had
prepared
amateur mind doesn't do that amateur
mind is grateful and accept accepts
whatever is offered by the world the
immature mind says the heck with it and
throws it across the room we don't do
that we try not to do that but your mind
doesn't do that so the most important
thing that we can do for ourselves is
observe ourselves and the various ways
that we have as human beings of creating
problems because we all have the
capacity to create problems and we do
from time to time when we become aware
of the difficulties that we ourselves
create we learn from them we learn from
them and we learn how it is that we
create them and then through that
education we can learn to avoid the
traps that we fall into like Adam and
Eve they didn't get a second chance but
if they had a chance to reflect on what
they did they wouldn't reach out for one
more thing when we learn how we create
problems and learn how to avoid the
traps we can reorient our mind so that
we understand ourselves and our life
I'd like to tell you a story now mm-hmm
or relate something that i read that
illustrates what I've been trying to to
say for the last half hour occasionally
there is a real-life story that
demonstrates how people devise their own
suffering I read an article in the San
Francisco magazine back in it's December
of 2003 already an old article but it
really struck me and so I brought it I
brought the experience of it here today
to share with you the the article was
titled larger than death and it
documents traces the suicide of a woman
named Ella King Tori who had been the
president of the San Francisco Art
Institute she took her own life when she
was 45 years old no she took the job as
president of the art institute which is
a very challenging job in 1995 she took
the job she took over a very
well-respected school but the school was
underfunded and needed some energy and
some vision now Ella King Tori was a
supercharged woman she had overwhelming
enthusiasm she had infinite number of
ideas she was very focused in her
ambition and on her work she delighted
meeting creative and intelligent people
and bringing them together she loved
putting together innovative and
ingenious networks of people she was
very good at that and she was inspired
by making things new and creating
something out of nothing that's the way
she was described she'd love to create
something out of nothing she was really
charged up much in the same way that you
are creating something and making
something out of nothing
she was a terrific fundraiser I don't
know if you're terrific fundraisers she
was a great fundraiser she knew all
these influential people and she could
do that she increased the donations to
the San Francisco Art Institute fourfold
while she was president from five
hundred thousand dollars a year to two
and a half million dollars a year he was
great but but she also spent very
lavishly she spent on visiting artists
on building projects on exhibitions of
art and on providing grants to
struggling artists and she also spent a
lot of money on expanding the library of
the Institute now when the dot-com
bubble dried up and the donations to the
Institute dried up the board of
directors discovered a huge deficit
because she was the president she took
the blame she got fired in April of 2002
after seven years on the job she got
fired because of this deficit and it was
a year later that she took her own life
she committed suicide without leaving a
note her friends and her colleagues were
absolutely dumbfounded absolutely
bewildered they couldn't comprehend how
this woman who had such purpose and such
an appetite for the exciting life you
know she loved fine food in San
Francisco she loved the wine and she
loved the beautiful things and the
fashions she loved dressing up in color
she loved to laugh she loved her friends
how could such a person take her own
life nobody could figure it out
I think that the source of this tragedy
of this tragedy can be traced to how she
saw herself in a limited way as if she
saw herself from inside a tunnel she saw
herself in a limited way she saw herself
strictly as a glamorous and successful
person constantly in the limelight doing
terrific things and being
enthusiastically applauded by her
successes this the firing when she got
fired it destroyed this image she had of
herself this desperate image she had of
herself her firing destroyed that it was
an image that caused her to believe it's
an image that that defined who she was
an image that defined that
there was an image of what she believed
she had obtained and what she felt she
had to obtain it was an image it was an
image of herself it wasn't her true self
it was an image defined by what she did
in her everyday life but it wasn't her
true self it was an image of herself it
was an image that depended on her
grasping for and holding on to the
things of this world which have no
permanency and which by their constantly
changing nature they can't be held on to
so something changed in the economic
world the donations dried up she got
fired things changed and this change
destroyed her image of herself I like to
I see her I think she saw herself in a
kind of chess game how many of you play
chess okay if you play chess you know
that the most powerful piece on the
chessboard is the White Queen the white
queen she saw herself as the White Queen
being in charge having the capacity to
make very powerful moves now when in
chess sometimes the game takes a very
surprising turn and the Queen has to be
sacrificed for some other advantage it's
pretty rare but it's part of a chess
players strategy sometimes to sacrifice
the Queen that's what happened here
the game continued but she could no
longer play that's how she saw herself
the game still going on but she wasn't
in it anymore it was no longer in it as
the white queen so because she did not
have an inner vision of who she was
because her belief was that she was in
the game as the white queen and that's
all there was for her not being
president of the San Francisco Art
Institute left her with an empty feeling
and without purpose or any meaning in
life in other words her life very
successful life that she had up to a
point was lived externally very exciting
it was a very exciting life but it
didn't have intimacy and didn't have
reflection so her tragedy was her
inability to her inability or her
unwillingness to stop the rush to grasp
what is out there that's where all her
energy came from she was in a rush to
grasp what was out there now this rush
probably fueled her creativity but her
story should warn us and that we put
ourselves at risk for suffering and for
tragedy when the rush is all we know
whoops okay all right when the rush is
all we know we set ourselves up and we
put ourselves at risk now the the
founder of Zen Buddhism in Japan was a
zen priest named ogen and he wrote a lot
and gave a lot of talks and one of the
most memorable things he said in one of
his talks goes like this to study
Buddhism is to study the self to study
the self as to forget the self to forget
the self as to be enlightened by all
things now this woman lr King Tory was
unable to study herself she was unable
to contemplate the purpose of her life
beyond the everyday successes of the
daily world the transient successes of
the daily world she was unable to
contemplate her life beyond that she
didn't realize that her inherent true
self was not diminished because she got
fired she didn't know who she really was
beyond the image he had of herself and
when that image was destroyed she
couldn't take it she was unable to allow
herself to be enlightened by all things
rather than grasping for them if she
could have done that
she would have had a balanced life that
did not end in a self-inflicted tragedy
awareness practice spiritual practice
meditation practice say it any way you
like it quiets the mind so that we can
come back to calmness and to balance so
we can come back to balance when our
mind is noisy it means it's in a kind of
panic and what do I do next where are my
glass I put my glasses somewhere where
are they we're going to panic how do I
get out of this busyness that I'm in
that's not a quiet line that's a noisy
mind the noisy mind does not understand
the need to go back to before the
beginning to before step one for example
when you're given a problem when you
come across a problem to solve in your
life or your work you don't start
solving it immediately somebody says
here's a problem you don't say step one
to the solution is this you don't do
that what you do first is you try to
fully understand the nature of the
problem you become in with intimate with
a problem itself before you start coming
up with solutions in other words before
you do something you need to understand
the point of doing when you start
rushing to solve a problem before you
understand it it wasn't work and in your
own experience you well you probably
have done that and you learn from it and
you don't do that anymore but before we
do something about a problem we go back
before step one we go back to zero
through awareness practice we learn how
to bring our mind back to zero and back
to balance before we do something to
solve a problem or before we do
something with our life
we come to balance this is the point of
meditation practice come back to balance
come back to balance come back to a mind
that isn't noisy before jumping out
there and trying to solve some problem
before doing something before we note it
is we're doing so to solve a problem or
to live in the very next moment we first
have to prepare our mind to come back to
0 through awareness practice spiritual
practice then our problems can be seen
through the perspective of our true
nature rather than through panic or
through our emotions so awareness
practice meditation practice will train
our mind
to bring our awareness and our balance
to everyday affairs so if we become
troubled by some emotion or feeling
during the day we will we can recognize
Oh anger is starting to arise in me or
fear is starting to arise in me or
sadness or grief or some some feeling
some emotion when we recognize and
accept the feeling that's happening the
mind can return to balance and this is
what's called starting from zero the
emotion may not go away but it won't be
troublesome
it's natural ok
ok
and spiritually in in Zen spiritual
practice has always been associated with
work let me try to illustrate that
a saying from back in the ninth century
by Zen laymen my magical power my
spiritual exercise consists in carrying
water and gathering firewood what does
this mean it means that the everyday
world the relative everyday world is not
different from the spiritual world
another story that goes along with that
the abbot of a Zen monastery in the
fourth century always worked out in the
fields with his monks and he became when
it was into his 80s he still worked out
there and they become became concerned
that he was still working at this
advanced age and they told him to stop
he said no so they hid his garden tools
his tools and with that he stopped
eating so they gave back his tools and
then one night in a talk he said a day
of no work is a day of no food point of
trying to make his spiritual practice in
the Zen tradition anyhow has always been
associated with work how we do our work
is our spiritual practice
let's see if I can get to the next slide
Oh nope
okay okay when there is spiritual
practice in the workplace there are
benefits to the individual there's
increase increased ability to focus on a
task or a relationship there's more
energy during the day and assets of
buoyancy at the end of the day rather
than stress at the end the day you feel
point and confident there is increased
confidence in our own ability to respond
positively to whatever may arise there's
better capacity to listen and to
emphasize with others there's more
patience and tolerance and complex
situations and there is reduce stress in
the midst of continual distractions and
demands these are the benefits to the
individual to the workplace as a whole
there are benefits as people learn to
accept and work with change we become
rather than feeling threatened by change
we become more enterprising and
thoughtful and we expand the total
creative capacity of our workplace when
we become open to new ideas and to
risk-taking but we do become open to new
ideas and risk-taking because fear and
stress diminish as we pursue our
spiritual practice we communicate ideas
more effectively because we become more
focused as listeners and more persuasive
as speakers because our ideas become
clearer than the depth of our commitment
becomes clearer this happens when you do
spiritual practice and you practice
awareness we have higher productivity
higher efficiency quality of work
improves morale improves because of our
improvement in interpersonal
relationships problems are solved in a
more comprehensive manner because we see
things in a broader scale not through a
tunnel and our decision-making
is improved because we focus on creative
choices rather than personal concerns
well
okay i want to i want to close with a
story a real-life story that indicates
that expresses how simple meditation
practice can totally change a life
spiritual practice i'm going to read you
this story rather than just related to
you i took the trouble to write it out
as a story and it got published so I
just want I'm just going to read it to
you if you don't mind you'd read like a
piece of fiction
crawl and stop crawl and stopped even by
nine-thirty the manic commute into the
city had not yet settled itself into a
smooth trajectory patients remained
essential on this dome on this doe damp
November morning we were making our 10th
consecutive daily trip into San
Francisco to teach the final hour of
meditation at work Shelly broke the
silence of the city as the city skyline
came into view the sun's starting to
show through the thinning fog how do you
think the class is going her voice
betrayed a tinge of concern it's hard to
say this group is so different from the
others Shelly had offered to help me
teach meditation at work to a unique
group of students in a unique training
program called step ahead step ahead was
a 28 week welfare-to-work program
co-sponsored by PG&amp;amp;E the San Francisco
Department of Human Services City
College of San Francisco and the women's
foundation of San Francisco the students
mostly women including many single
mothers all experiencing stress and
uncertain in their lives were being
taught marketable workplace skills
including word processing spreadsheet
preparation and database maintenance pge
guaranteed a job for at least six months
to successful graduates I was asked to
teach meditation at work as part of the
step ahead curriculum to offer the
students a way to reduce stress and
maintain composure as they struggled to
master new technical skills and to learn
how to swim upstream in the daunting
often turbulent corporate world it's not
easy for them to sit still Shelly said
there's a lot of fidgeting going on
part of it may be that it's not
voluntary they have to attend it's part
of the whole program Mary and I said
keeping my eye on the on-again off-again
taillights in front of us that's right I
wouldn't want to be told that I had to
meditate I sure would have a lot of
resistance is something you have to come
to on your own the conversation paused
as we turned off the freeway and headed
into downtown after a few minutes Shelly
spoke up again I think one of the
biggest difficulties for them is the
subtleness of meditation they don't get
any feedback it's hard for them to tell
if they're getting anything from it for
sure that must be discouraging shelly is
a marriage and family therapist
especially in addiction and recovery
working with high risk teens and their
families she is intimately familiar with
the mountainous work she's intimately
familiar with the mountainous world of
lifelong frustration and discouragement
of the frightening slippery cold
feelings of hopelessness and isolation
over the past two weeks she and I had
listened to the stories of our students
trying to find ways to encourage them to
sit quietly with an alert posture and to
stay aware of their breathing during the
meditation part of the class sessions
many gave up immediately unable to find
a minimum of self-discipline slumping in
their chairs with their arms folded
waiting for the 20 minutes to end even
for those that were giving the practice
a chance and making their best effort I
knew it must be frustrating I wondered
if we had done any good if all the
commuting and the effort had been worth
it at the end of the class on this final
friday the food the students thanked us
as we in turn wish them well with their
studies and their new careers then
something happened
then something happened that erased all
my doubts the last woman to leave the
classroom took me by the arm and drew me
aside in her tearful voice barely
audible I heard relief and gratitude mr.
K she said I don't hit my little boy
anymore that always happens to me when I
tell that story
you have any questions about anything
that I tried to convey to you today
yes please this is a stage spiritual
practice it doesn't mean other religions
have their way of spiritual practices or
so when you say both parameters let me
medication it means the whole crime
different paths virtual offices when you
press box
so let let me try to say your question
okay thank you so my question was when
you say spiritual practice you said it's
not it doesn't concern religion it you
just means virtual practice and I know a
lot of people who doesn't meditate but
they think they're doing special process
because their religious movies right do
you also include that in when you say
abroad when you mean by spiritual
problem no a spiritual practice to me is
based on awareness paying attention to
ourselves paying attention to the world
around us having an open mind and being
ready to accept whatever the world tells
us not having a closed mind this is
spiritual practice paying attention and
the second question was about meditation
do you have a way to meditate or just
sitting down and calming down like is
there a specific way that you should
meditate what do you endorse a such a
meditation technique or eat well I think
we're going to be doing that in in a few
minutes we're going to be having a
meditation session oh there's all
different kinds of meditation techniques
or different ways and so do you sort of
convey one over the other word i'll show
you one but let me say something you you
you know you use the word technique
somebody one at once I was present when
somebody in an interview a radio
interview asked a Zen teacher what
technique do you use in meditation what
technique do you use to encourage
people's meditation and he said we use
the most important technique people's
own sincerity this is this is the basis
of spiritual practice so that was
basically my question so there is no
technique rights just how you go about
what you just said yes the technique
is not important it's our attitude
that's important
well okay one more question if there is
one yes
I'm not sure if this is more an
observation than a question I found a
bit of what I'd call cognitive
dissonance on your adam and eve analogy
which i think i think this drum I
understand your message from that but I
think that particular story may not be
the best match for the point you were
trying to make because the classical
interpretation of Adam and Eve or if the
exact reading is that originally when
they were happy they were ignorant and
what they thought it was the the tree of
knowledge the dome what they the fruit
was from the tree of knowledge and so
basically they took the bite and in
effect they became aware of how the
world really was which you know which
end and suddenly became unhappy which i
think is at odds with the message that
you're carrying which is that what we're
actually seeking is and aware a greater
awareness of the world as it really is
too to achieve our to it to achieve our
happiness or awareness or and in a
spiritual I don't use the word
enlightenment but just my point my point
is that the story I I understand the
point that you are making with the story
but I think it's probably not the best
one to use I'm not this I think that's
probably not the best story to use
because there is a second contradictory
message that's classically brought along
with that one when they bit the Apple
they saw how the world wasn't um right
well yeah I don't know i think the
wording is is that the tree on kids it's
the the fruit of the tree of knowledge
and so am Angus signaling that we
actually need to go but um thank you for
your talk it was um thank you
enlightening and informative thank you
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
