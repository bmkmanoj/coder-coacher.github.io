Switzerland he'll be talking about agile
C++ development great thank you this is
a little bit about me to get some
background where I'm coming from I am a
peasant boy let's say in the 90s i
co-authored a couple of paedon's book or
let's say 90 s md 2000s and my kratos
people create software and I want to
make writing software simpler or making
software simplest simpler better okay
it's not the work by me alone it's a
whole team that stands behind me that's
the Institute for software team five
professors and about a thousand
assistants who are employed by us the
big thing about software quality sorry
yes but it's kind of an elephant in the
room everybody knows it's bad but nobody
actually confirms that it's bad as long
as software is used it's somehow usable
and very often even badly written
software is used much longer than it
ever intended so we have to do something
about that and that's one of my
long-term goals improve software quality
over time and the classic approach is we
have manual testing that's kind of
hoping that everything will be good or
you're worried you had ants and to
actually know what's ignoring what's
going on and I know people and companies
were actually work or live like no
Strich ignoring the problem completely
and not doing anything about it and
that's why I'm here I want to do
something about it especially because
these little cute things that looks nice
can become big problems in the end
now we do a lot of things especially in
the context of eclipse or eclipse CDT
plugin so we are working on interactive
tool for developers giving them feedback
that's one part of the a gel thing like
integrating static code analysis to get
immediate feedback in your IDE to
actually see what pieces of code might
not be optimal we are working in unit
testing or developer testing and today I
will show you a little bit about the
things we are doing there and we even
try something that also Google is trying
with include what you use we do it try
to do it more interactively with the
tool called include eight ER and we also
look for other HR things like scrum we
have a support for scrum in a in an
interactive way and if you use your
favorite search engine you can easily
figure out what's going on behind that
and also we did refactoring in the past
for many languages with eclipse the most
current ones is still C++ and Scala is
what we actively employ and that's one
of the things we try to do a lot of
things but it requires effort and money
to actually continue doing them and with
frequent releases of the platform you
somehow had to have to stop supporting
something unless you have in our
sponsoring doing so so the first part i
will show is the c++ unit testing with
the framework i created that's the only
thing that i program myself is acute
unit testing framework in c++ for c++
and i will show you how we support test
room development with eclipse CDT and
you can use it if you want to use it on
europe and what are the design goes i
know google has their own unit testing
framework for c++ and the thing we
started out with cute we wanted to make
it as simple to use as it's possible and
it should be usable even if it's written
in c plus also for C programmers so
instead of having to instantiate classes
or right classes to write your test
cases it
cases include a simple function but it
can even be a let's say a member
function everything that you where you
can put code and can be come a test case
and cute and it's deliberately designed
with IDE support one thing about C++ and
unit testing it lacks the reflection
support to actually gather pieces of
code together programmatically so what
people are doing and google has is no
exception you right clever macros for
registering tests automatically by the
compiler when you're compiling the code
that those macros tend to be have
interesting effects because they
requires a very good static
initialization and in C++ across
compilation units the sequence is not
well defined especially when you work
with shared libraries or maybe input
test cases and shared libraries that you
can get very interesting effects with
dependencies of those static
initializers and that was one of the
main reasons why cued uses a different
approach and an ide like eclipse we can
actually ensure that developer gets
feedback if you he or she forgets to
register test and we I can show you soon
how to how that is automated and also
what's always if you're come from an IDE
C++ is a horrible language to work with
the biggest problem is a seat C++ or C
preprocessor because what you actually
see on the screen in your editor is not
what the compiler sees and that gives a
big problems to all tool builders using
our supporting C++ is set especially if
it's about interactive tools and
therefore one design goal of cute was to
actually minimize macro usage we cannot
get rid of macros at all because
otherwise it would be very hard to get
those meta information we actually get
from the pre process of that like the
source file and source line of our test
cases into the test results
but I want to talk about if you look at
the test driven development cycle we
start with a failing test then we make
that test actually run so we have a
green bar in our unit testing
visualization we refactor our code to
make it simpler we integrate that and
I'm talking today a bit about a magenta
arrow to that where we have put in
automation to actually get some tests
written and also making the tests pass
and one the first thing to make a
failing unit test pass if you do test
from development is actually make it
compile and that can be a lot of mean a
lot of things in C++ for example if you
write a test to test the new class first
the class has to be defined the
corresponding member functions have to
be defined and on and on and on you have
to provide a lot of syntax to actually
make the stuff compile and I hope we
provided some interesting features for
eclipse CDT that will make that actually
a satisfying the compiler simpler even
though the language is C++ that is
inherently with it i would say
inherently interesting syntax but i'm
just now on what i want to you to show
with the td's board now i will just
switch soon to the eclipse CDT I all the
stuff I show you now can be used for
free it's available on the given a side
it's called cute minus test calm and
then with you're an experienced Eclipse
user you know they're always things like
called an update side that you have to
configure in your Eclipse environment to
get the plugins so we create a cute test
project I've done that for you we I will
show you how to create a test function
and I will try to use the manual most of
the time to show you where things are
but for most of the stuff you've got a
shortcut so it's not that slow that i
will show you but i would
to have you follow what I'm doing and
especially on the Mac it's always hard
to have all the shortcuts because and
that comes across so usually I have my
own shortcuts that are not the same as
other people have with eclipse CDT and
therefore I try to use a menu to do not
confuse you so we will do a very brief
test driven development session and we
will do something very simple just not
to get problems in implementing it so I
want to simulate a switch that can be
turned on and turned off so you might
consider your girlfriend turning on and
turning off but we do it it's not a
girlfriend as a switch so now let's
switch to as we told you to eclipse here
we are and that is what you get when you
we are now in this project that is just
freshly created and we see this is a
unit test and we have a certain macros
and we have some infrastructures oops
sorry for the pop-up to actually collect
our tests in this test suite and all
that code is generated for you and all
the collection of test is generated for
you and then we have a little simple
main program to run the test suite you
might wonder what these little markers
are that's just to show of another tool
that we implemented it's a integration
of eclipse of the one of the lint tools
it's flex aligned by Gimple so we
integrated that into eclipse as well but
that's not available for free because we
try to make some money to actually fund
our free stuff so if you buy the
licenses to that tool from now on we
might be happy to give you even more
free stuff so we get some problem
markers here and if i try to size the
screen after we reset the screen size
you can even
see we've got these messages and we got
some other messages of where you get the
explanation what the problem is and I
don't want to show you more details
about that thing so now how can we write
a test so a test development a switch so
the thing is when you do test-driven
development we you actually start with
the test case and we actually start a
test case usually with the assertion so
what a surgeon is if you look back to
our was we create a switch object we get
the state and that they should be off so
the assertion would be that the get
state function returns what is off false
i guess so we replace our assert macro
with an sorry for the pop ups
Oh
so we expect false and then we need a
switch so now we have a whole bunch of
code and we get some that's a pink bag
it's not a piglet on the left hand side
but we have several things that the
compiler or at least eclipse the parser
doesn't understand we have an object
that isn't existing a variable and we
have a member function that isn't
existing so the first thing is we can
use now I press the hotkey it's on lives
is control 1 and here it's a command one
on the Mac and I get some options to
actually fix that so we create a local
variable that has wrong type because we
wanted to make a new class call it
switch again we get that little pink
back and again with control one is we
can create that type of switch because
it's a new time we want to create we
create that type now i can select if I
wanted to be a struct the class or an
enumeration time I stick with struct
just to avoid typing too many public
things now we have another problem we
got that variable but that state member
funk is still missing and again we can
use that quick fix to create that member
function and it will be even infer the
correct time because we ask for a bool
and we get that get state member
function and I believe that's almost
enough to get things compiled and we
will try to figure out with the hammer
if that's true
and now we can actually run our test
case and we see the cute plugin comes
with nice test case viewer and the first
thing that we observe is that the test
case still has a very bad name naming is
important to have readable code so this
is a test is not a very splendid name
for a good test case we can navigate to
that and again we can figure out do
something about it and as with other
languages we can actually reflect with
that and rename that so test new switch
is off and that rename actually will all
so rename the usage of that test
function here so we don't get things
wrong out of sync let's rerun the test
we just changed the code it will
recompile and rerun the test and
hopefully everything stays green it
looks like that now we need to write a
new test case because we're done with
that one and if we go back to our list
of things it should be turn on and then
the get state should be on one important
thing to understand about developer
testing or unit testing is that the test
cases remain independent so that they
actually can run in any order and
switching back we need to run to create
a new test case and actually the four
that we have also some code generation
support so we can just usually you do
that with the hotkey that's option
command F so we can create a new test
function for that and it will give us a
new test function I can immediately test
turn on switch is on
we start with the assert equal true my
switch get state again we can use our
hot key to actually create the local
variable now we have the time and what
we are trying to do is now to actually
call a function called turn on well I
should use outer completion
almost everything looks fine except for
that missing turn on function in our
switch class and again we can try that's
not where I wanted to activate that we
create that member function and that's
actually all we need to do to make the
code compile let's see safe and compile
and now we get an interesting effect we
get a failing test case and we can even
just to show off see the expected wall
value was one that's true and we got
actually zero that if you is something
we get almost for free from eclipse and
that's very convenient especially if you
compare strings and things look quite
equal but aren't especially if you
develop code and multiple platforms
align the separators or sometimes bases
are very interesting effects that you
get from that so you might know that
from Java and you can actually jump to
the problem we've got and now we have to
do something about that turn on and one
thing was we is we can cheat and just
return true here but that would make our
other test case fail so now now actual
design has to go on we need to invent
something so we better return some state
from here and again that is missing so
we can create that well it doesn't get
as good the type of that and we better
let's move that down here and make it
private so some features are still
missing that you might guess so with
that
somehow we need to get that you can say
turn on sets that state to true will
that be sufficient
well actually what's missing might be a
constructor that initialized so variable
to a good value so but just let's see
what happens if you do it well
everything looks okay but that's a
little bit coincidental so you can now
cheat a little bit to actually enforce
that we get that constructor again so
let's default constructor see plasmas
object and I use C++ 11 syntax for that
because I hope I got the compiler
settings right I know let's use the
other one we don't get the automatic
conversion here oh we still can write
code from ourselves
okay I didn't at least I didn't break
anything let's go back to our list okay
the third test cases if you turn it off
the state should be off the interesting
thing is there might be several
situations when we turn the state off
because somehow we might want to
actually change that leads to it if it
has been turned on and then turned off
it should be off if it has been off it
turned off it should be off and so on so
maybe the list is a little bit too short
but I don't want to change the slide now
just let's go in let's write a new test
case and let's try that to show you test
turn off switch
you
okay let's
you turn that off and may be implemented
immediately now something interesting
might have happened now we get a message
because I wrote that function without
the latke we get that function the
feedback okay there is a bark the fun
test functions not yet registered we
might have recognized that from running
the test that our list of tests that
shown here has not increased so what we
need to is actually fix that and again
there's a fix for that we can automate
that adding the test of the suite and if
we rerun the tests you should go to at
that additional test case so that are
more or less the most important features
of our test room development support and
if there are any questions be please
feel free to ask now or later no
questions very kind so let's head back
what we've seen as we well I didn't show
you actually the grading of the cube
project I prepared that we created the
test function definition from a call we
created a type definition from usage or
what we I forgot something that's moving
the type definition until you had a far
so actually we created a new class here
in line within the context of the test
cases and that's a kind of a problem
because the good C++ style would mean
that we actually move that into a
separate file
and again that is something where we
have some support for you extract to a
new header file again that's something
we can just oh I select the wrong thing
okay we get a new head of far with our
switch class and all the stuff is in
here now another thing we might know
from let's say some programming
conventions that in line implementations
of member functions not something you
should do with non template classes at
least there are some guidelines to
saying so and especially if you want to
extend that by inheritance we might
actually move things away from the
header for separate compilation or even
hiding our implementation details so
even that can be done automatically we
have something implemented that's
already part of eclipse CDT intern in
the plane CDT it's the toggle the
function definition that not only comes
out full when moving function
definitions from the header file to the
implementation file but also if you want
to change the signature of function
definition because usually you have to
do it in two places and that's quite
annoying we try to implement that with a
wizard like for example in Java
refactoring you get this wizard to
change method signature but writing a
good visit for that and use it making it
usable turned out to be quite hard or
almost impossible because there are so
many possibilities of sleep last on
defining parameters that's very tedious
and so we better let the developer in
charge and is that by just toggling the
definition into one place change the
signature and toggling it back and I
will show you in
and so the let's just toggle that first
thing that happens we only have the
remaining declaration here the first
position for the toggling is actually an
inline function definition out of the
side of the class in the same header and
if we toggle that again we get a third
place and that it will be a new CPP file
and we actually create that and that's
not open yet automatically but we can
see the kernel function actually is
implemented now in that CPP file and see
if everything compiles and runs still
sanely okay everything looks okay see ya
actually we you can do that on a few
keystrokes and we didn't want to do that
much at once and maybe that's also a
little bit of my person side when I
create a new type I might just explore
designs and if that's closely really
related within the same editor it's much
easier to let's say make bigger changes
up front and then only when I'm almost
done i move things away especially in
TDD it's better to have the same context
and it also helps you to make smaller
things not put everything in a big chunk
and so it's maybe it's a five key
strokes to get everything separated I
believe the toggling will also work on
all of the member function at once if
you use it on a class but I haven't
tried it and I don't want to promise it
now because i'm not sure if it actually
works that way but while we can try it
can be brave so if you go for the select
the class let's see if we can actually
toggle all member function there
no that doesn't work so it's one by one
only but maybe next next time you get
that feature if you ask for it more
questions okay let's head back to the
things that I showed you all the stuff
we've seen here i showed you already so
back to our over you there's a second
thing i wanted to show you that's brand
new it's based on what is it it's what
we call mercator so you get some naming
schema from linda cater include ater
locator unfortunately when we invented
huge we didn't have that naming scheme i
yet so everything that Ryan's on
alligator is fine with us today and it's
about see one thing about writing unit
tests you know you don't always start
fresh very often you have existing code
and the biggest problem with the
existing code you have dependencies that
you might that might influence you
testing or you want to actually check
the usage of these dependencies and
that's where Mark objects or testicles
actually play a role and its ongoing
work it will be finished let's say in
the second quarter of this year it's
also an eclipse plugin that automates
introducing so-called seams where you
actually cut off the dependency and
replace it with a testable or remark
object in all code and locator actually
automates all the boilerplate code
generation for you and it even comes
with its own mock object support that is
a bit more c++ seizure than google mark
and we would be happy to actually
implement mercator for a google test and
Google mark as well but that would
require some money from some sources and
that's always the universe University we
can't go to the stock market to ask for
the money that's a big problem
so I I prepared some demo to actually
show you how to do this seam integration
and let's switch back to eclipse close
that small project and let's start with
compile seem start here we have a
project with the simple library that
contains of two classes and one classes
actually it's a very simple game you
roll the die and if he gets to actually
the rule is if you get a four you want
otherwise you lost that's a very simple
game but we have interesting property of
it this class if we want to test that it
relies on another class and we can see
here that actually depends on some
random number generation well some
people might know ok rant is actually
you can cheat you is pseudo-random so
you can actually cheat with that and
figure out the sequence of random
numbers you get so you might figure out
if you give a given a seed you can
figure out what the numbers are but
writing tests for that is not very
obvious and a different implementation
might give you different results with
the same seed and so we want to get rid
of that dependency of the dye class and
there several options to do so and one
thing is actually something that we
started out with is actually use that
died as a template parameter so that way
you don't need inheritance for doing
that like with Google mark you don't
need adaption to the usage of that the
only thing we need is having all the
member functions of the game four winds
class being in line so that we can
actually employ the template mechanism
correctly so what we actually can do we
use our total function definition pull
up the implementation into the header
nor these little things in the moment
that's it and now we can another
refactoring that we implemented extract
a template and we don't need that one
and maybe we give better name for that
the die and that's actually what we want
to do you get a new class definition of
that game four winds class if everything
works out and I've nawl ready ever made
the title that's a demo effect let's try
again
so what we actually see that's also
something you get for free in Eclipse is
a refactoring preview so we change that
game four winds class may actually be
named game four winds tea and to be able
to not to actually need to change all
code that uses that class we give a type
that with the original glass tile that
we are using now back to our tests we
want to test that thing now so what we
actually need to test if you remember we
had this Oh stream and we can pass a
string stream to actually collect the
result and compare the result for that
so let's write an assert equal
and we have no stream
and our game that's wrong name
Oh
okay we run that now as a test case
we get a problem we expected to win but
we lost actually what we wanted to do is
actually to have not the generate die
class that use ran but winning the I as
our template parameter to the templated
class and now we can actually create
that compile seem winning die that's
where we actually do the dependency
injection by template argument and we
can do that as a class and actually that
shouldn't compile yet
so we don't have that net net missing
member function and actually I expect it
to be able to have that automatically
generated I'm lost a little bit
hmm
it's a demo effect so there there should
be an option to actually create that
member function that we have that's what
our own
ah I was just too quick the index isn't
ready
we see that little pink back here and it
somehow doesn't show up again
interesting
that's what I wanted to show you to
generate actually the role function
and this should allow us to run our
tests now and we actually won our thing
that's the first thing to actually do is
to have a test stop so we replace our
die with the tests top-class the winning
die we we have support for generating
the missing member faction functions
from the actual calling context of the
play function so if you have a larger
class where you have mock introduction
it will try to figure out which things
have actually been called and you only
have to implement those that's a benefit
of using the compile seems instead of
the object seems where you use
inheritance and with the that's the
first thing and the other thing is Matt
we might want to actually like with a
real mock object so we want to
understand if someone is cheating and
rolling the dice more than allowed set
of just one time want to make figures
the game actually rolls the dice only
one time and that would require to
actually record what's going on and we
have an infrastructure for doing that as
well sorry I miss you is not touch pad
we can vote convert that test doable
that just provides a bare minimum of
member functions to a mock object that
actually the red records all functions
that have been called and this is a lot
of stuff that's going on so I enlarge my
screen a little bit we add it again some
ugly macro and we can get rid of that we
added a structure collecting calls and
that's just a vector of coral objects
and you see in the second that these
coal objects are quite simple it's more
or less strings and we added the
constructor a default constructor that
will actually record the number of times
how many objects are accentuated and we
might actually ignore how often that
constructor has been called and now what
we actually can do in the end
we can expect that that role member
function has been called only once
now let's see if our test case still
works I made some typos now we have an
interesting effect
that's interesting work yesterday night
no idea what well actually let's get
over that we are running out of time
anyway so that's how it's expected to
work you get this infrastructure to to
collect the calls and then record the
calls and then assert the all calls with
the expected staff we have more features
in mah cater like using a preprocessor
to provide seems that's very convenient
to actually provide tracing to system
functions like for example malach and
that's done on a key press so you can
add your tracing code where the comment
says so we have the link seems that's
something that's supported with the GCC
linker but unfortunately not on Mac OS
oh well it works with shared libraries
but there's also a wrapping of functions
that only works on linux are not on Mako
s where you can even have a system
functions replaced by rappers and
delegate to to those wrapping functions
and all that a cogeneration with the
delegation to a specific shared library
and redirection of that name is the code
is generated by Mercator and that's it
get a glimpse it's too short to actually
show you all the features of Mercator
and it's but you can try for yourself
and again cute s is free you can it will
integrate Mercator once it's done and we
have other things like if you use the
sconce bill to less consolidator who
will actually integrates cons with
eclipse CDT in both directions so if
have if you use sconce as a bill tool
that's also thing to look at and all the
other stuff we have it's available and
by the way that's our campus so it's
almost as beautiful as here not as big
but a some of your colleagues have been
there and will be able to tell you how
nice it is
and any questions yes yeah the the
question was we shown some features that
aren't existing yet in CDT if we will
contribute that those utility to CDT we
contributed a lot of things to eclipse
CDT already for example all the
refactoring mechanics within CDT have
been created by us we have one minor
problem that we currently lack a CVT
committer so it's not as easy as it used
to be to actually contribute directly
and some of the things it's we because
CT has or eclipse itself has this
release cycle of yearly major releases
it sometimes a catch-22 to actually be
able to be finished on time because when
you rely on CDT internals you might just
not with the capacity so we contributed
some of the stuff for example the tester
the toggling the meta the functions
between header and cpp are already part
of CDT we won't contribute some of the
things because we with a known plugin we
still have some leeway of the released
cycle and that's one of the reasons why
we haven't contributed everything to the
unity and also we use our plugins a
little bit as advertisement of what we
are doing and that's also one of the
reason why we don't put everything into
it if you would get and we spend Swiss
taxpayers money on most of it so our
headmaster sometimes asked us to make
money from that to actually refund our
work and that's also one of the reason
whenever we have the capacity and if
it's a feature that is valuable for many
of the CDT people we try to integrate
that maybe it will take another year or
so to actually have it into the CDT
official release before usually we we
have some kind of preview in
our plugin separately so you can try and
we get user feedback would wear hard to
integrate something without enough user
feedback because sometimes the features
that we think of our cool and that cool
to others well actually what what's
what's what's happening was what's
happening that actually we are well
aware of that a unit testing viewer work
that's going on and we are actually
contributed part to that so that cued is
working with that but we proved but that
work doesn't include all the features of
cogeneration and we don't want to lose
them therefore we still provide our own
plugin but whenever you use QT unit
testing when that other plugin is
actually released it's still not part of
the CDT it it will become a CD the
optional features as far as I know but
it's not part yet so we actually
contributed our cute parts of our cute
plug into that already but they will not
actually implement all the cogeneration
features that we provide for 4q that's
that's the tie we are in and we we have
still a separate plug-in with additional
features so we are working with them to
actually and even we get we will get
some additional features for cute as
well like running individual test cases
that's what we don't provide today with
that version of the plug-in i showed you
that does it does it answer your
question and we would be very happy to
actually provide the cogeneration for
google test and google market as well
you just didn't have the capacity for
now
we we do a lot and contribute it to CDT
the problem is we have a harder time
because we instead of just checking in
to the CVS now we have to ask someone
else to do so and that's much more
tedious and the reason I know we do that
for a long time we contributed to
refactoring five years ago in in C++ the
point is we lost our committer the do
because he wanted to become a priest and
we know and he no longer wanted to work
for a fee for a company for open source
projects that actually contribute I used
by militaries the companies and that's
one of the reasons why we lost our
country our direct line into eclipse CDT
and we contribute a lot and there are
some things we are not providing
immediately especially because we want
to make it sure that it actually works I
don't want to commit something to the
open source to the public or to
everybody that just doesn't work and
that happens in some open source
projects as well therefore that's the
reason and I know Google doesn't provide
everything open source as well so you
have fewer secrets as well and if we
have a big pot of money that will allow
us to do so we would be happy to
actually contribute everything for free
but we don't sorry not now maybe in the
future more questions okay that's what
it was all about thank you very much for
your attention and thank you for the
questions
