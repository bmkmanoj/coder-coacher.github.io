this point probably all the tickets are
gone for today I'm not sure about
tomorrow but you can certainly check in
the lobby during the break times to get
a tour of the office here it is a super
cool office and I'll tell you some
details about it in a minute each talk
we will be doing a set of questions so
we have a Dory set up here's the link to
jump on the Dory you can vote up or vote
down questions feel free to add new
questions we will also try to take some
live questions as time allows so here's
the link here so go ahead and you can
and grab this and sort of jump in and
take a look at the moderator attendees
we're going to at lunchtime we're going
to do some roundtable discussions these
are all of you many of you have asked to
you know host a topic or a topic table
or have discussion we have very
intentionally you know offered to bring
in all the smartest people we know um
that would be all of you so please join
into the topic tables generally these
you know these are sort of participatory
if you jump at a table it's not
interesting to you it's certainly fine
to get up and go to another table so
nobody will be upset it's just everybody
is trying to optimize for things that
they're interested in lunch I guess
dinner is going to be on the fifth floor
today which is up I'm in the water tower
cafe it's a very cool cafe it actually
has a water tower that came from New
York City here so you can actually sit
in a water tower if you've never done
that any time you were anywhere in the
building even going up and down the
elevators please make sure you have a
Googler with you somebody in one of
these brightly colored shirts or maybe
that you know you'll see like a Google
badge on them just this is this is a
workspace for Google and so we just need
to make sure that everybody you know has
a host at all times so a little bit
about the the New York City office here
so this office started in two thousand
it actually started in a coffee shop
much like many of the offices for google
so thanks to Starbucks where I guess
having all these great you know
places that we can all go work this is
the second largest office
internationally and a shout out to my
own office which is Seattle Kirkland I
believe we're either the third of the
fourth so this is a fantastic office it
encompasses the whole port authority
building here one thing I wanted to to
mention to all of you if you hear a
giant bang sometime today I highlighted
this on the slide there is a elevator
that can fit an 18-wheeler literally in
this building so this building was
designed to drive trucks around it so
now we just run scooters all around this
building but there are trucks right
behind me is actually the elevator for
the 18-wheeler every now and then you'll
hear the bang I just didn't want you to
be surprised if you hear this and
sometimes it can even vibrate the floor
so just heads up it's probably nothing
is if you hear the bang coming from this
direction so we do take up an entire
city block here in fact we actually have
two parts we have this office we also
have a section across over towards the
Chelsea Market area you know as you go
looking around you go out you can go
into the Chelsea Market the whole bottom
part is actually still a market that's a
fun place to go visit there are lots of
different products here in this office
everything from ads to google drive to
you know maps and finance google cloud
is here so really engineers that are
working on the products that you know
and love are all here in this building
we also have you know marketing and
sales and engagement and and support and
so it really takes a big team to to
deliver fantastic products a little bit
about the new york city culture here we
have many different deemed cafeterias i
guess we serve like somewhere around you
know a million plus meals a year here in
this office just gives you an idea of
the scope we have these great scooters
that we can run up and down the halls
for you probably unless you go on the
tour you won't be able to do this but if
i guess if you on the tour you can grab
one we tried this last night i duly
impressed my my friend I took my luggage
and my bag and everything I dropped it
on a scooter and we raced across the
building I think in about 45 seconds so
the scooters really get us around this
building fast we have game rooms and
break rooms all over the place you'll
see this on the tour which is which is
great
we are definitely a very diverse company
we support all you know diversity in all
of its glory and so we have lots of
internal groups to you know sort of
communicate and share our thoughts with
everybody which is fantastic i love this
a lot about google so a little bit about
what we've done in the Greater New York
area so one of the things we do at
Google is we try to be great corporate
citizens and great citizens of the areas
in which we are and in this area here
just late last year we lit up literally
the Chelsea neighborhood I think it's
like six city blocks that we give free
Wi-Fi so if you're enjoying the free
Wi-Fi when you're out and about that's
you know from google here so it should
say google Wi-Fi or something like that
so hopefully everybody has access
internal to the office here google guest
but we've done this and it was really
important to us to do this around here
to give the access that just wasn't
quite ubiquitous in terms of other
interesting things about Google I think
I lost like 60 class for all points or
something when I joined Google previous
companies didn't take my health as
seriously as Google um so you know when
I'm when I'm walking around the office I
have lots of healthy choices of things
to eat I still have a lot more work to
do on that front some fun facts about
New York this is a fantastic City if you
have not had a chance to explore
hopefully you've you know book time
whether you've lived here your whole
life whether you just came in last night
and I heard some people flew in this
morning this is definitely a great area
New York is rich in history it has many
different markets you know this is the
Chelsea neighborhood this was where a
lot of the the sort of import export
into the city happen for a long time
that's why this building was called the
Port Authority building it was you know
attached to the port some of the you
know fun facts you'll find her on the
city the Empire State Building is a it's
an amazing building what's interesting
about this is this is the most expensive
elevator ride I've ever had in my life I
did not know an elevator could cost that
much and it was only like 60 seconds but
if you get to the top and you're brave
enough to walk to the edge it's a very
it's a very interesting experience both
the Empire State Building and the
Rockefeller Center both have these
spectacular views from the top of the
building and you can see all around the
whole city it's fantastic Empire State
Building was the world's tallest
building for 40 years and then everybody
started to figure out that if you put in
antenna on your building you could get
the tallest building so i don't know if
that's sort of cheating or not a little
known fact the Oreo cookie was actually
invented here in New York City and it
was actually invented right across the
street in the Chelsea Market and the ode
to the Oreo cookie is a small plaque
that says the Oreo cookie was invented
here so if you do get a chance to walk
across the street you know today or
tomorrow you can go find out where the
Oreo cookie was invented invented here
in 1912 and I guess they had a bunch of
cream and a bunch of biscuits and they
were trying to figure out what to do
with him so they mash them together and
came with this iconic cookie that pretty
much I think everybody around the world
knows so with that I'm going to hand
this off to our ace Amash who's going to
kick us off with the keynote after
immediately after the keynote we're
going to go into the next talk one of
the things I'm going to do is between
each talk after the speaker's finish I'm
going to come on stage as time allows
will take you know the questions you
know from the the moderator that you saw
there the link earlier and I will sort
of host the questions is we run out of
time we'll just sort of move on but the
speakers I believe are all very excited
to talk to all of you so you can grab
them at lunch you can grab them it
breaks they'll generally be around most
of them will be around you know for the
two days some will only be around for
the day that they're here so if you do
want to grab that make sure you try to
grab them on the same day that they
speak with that I'd like to kick it off
and hand it off to re so all right thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
