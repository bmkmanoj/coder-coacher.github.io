came on water and a couple of years ago
dams wife sent me an email and
self-published a novel and asked if I
would read it I had few readers in my
blog and had and was happy to read a
techy novel without really any
expectation fortunately for me it was
right and I proceeded to introduce Dan
to a couple of folks and things kind of
snowballed from there about a year later
Wired magazine wrote about Dan's
underground sensation that is kind of
capturing the imagination of a lot of
geeks and soon thereafter the best
possible thing happened which was
Penguin Books bought the rights to both
the book and the sequel which I hope is
and I'm sure we'll hear more about that
and Paramount has bought the movie
rights the hardback came out a couple of
weeks ago it's now on the New York Times
bestseller list and it was just open to
rave reviews dan and I have become very
good friends it's been just an absolute
pleasure over the last couple years to
kind of follow his success and track
from trying to get people to read about
the book and hear about the book to now
being a very much in demand novelist
with a breakout success of its Anna so
I'm very excited to welcome to Google
we're gonna keep this very informal but
have just asked Dan to talk a little bit
about the process of writing the book
where the idea for demon came from in
the process of now having it be a major
release on a major publishers imprint
and an answer our questions about the
technology involved for those of you who
have read it
I'm sure you'll share my feelings that
it's a pretty scary thank you Rick
appreciate it thank you guys for coming
out I really appreciate it I'm thrilled
to be here actually I'm sort of here to
say thank you to all of you I can tick
through all of the things that Google
made possible on this book and including
the success of this book I don't think
it would have been possible without
Google I'm just gonna talk for about 15
20 minutes about that also about the
process of self-publishing and how I
came up with a story I don't typically
do readings because I'm not a thespian
and I don't want to butcher my
characters I think some authors are
great at that I'm not one of them but
first of all let me talk a little bit
about the parts of the book that Google
made possible when we self-published
this book Michelle and I originally you
have to go out and reach the world
somehow and be found and of course this
is not news to you guys this is what you
do let me think
Google AdWords Google Analytics Google
Alerts search term I chose my pen name
Leonid zeros for the self-published to
book because it was a great Google
search term I I might be the first
author ever to have done that but a lot
of gamers got that immediately they
reversed the characters it's just what
gamers tend to do so that was also a
defining thing but I would own well you
said like the first 15 pages of Google
search results so if anybody wanted to
find me they could find me immediately
and that says once again thanks to you
guys I think it would have been damn
near impossible to get noticed without a
central search hub like Google making
that possible
so my personal thanks to you all what
you do made a very big difference in my
life so I want to thank you for that now
this is my first novel I'm not a
professional writer although I guess I
am now but it worked out very well I
originally wrote this I wanted to write
a nonfiction book called the case for
inefficiency you know there was kind of
addressing some of my concerns about the
fragility of our modern infrastructure
but I thought about it and realized
nobody would read that because it's
gonna be good you'd read it I'd sell one
and and I could probably convince my
wife to buy it too but I decided instead
to write a book a thriller that didn't
pull any punches I didn't want to dumb
it down and I thought I'd read enough
techno thrillers that sort of ticked me
off you know he'd read them he say
that's that's ridiculous and I wanted to
really stay to real technology combine
existing technologies and new ways and
once again this was coming and my
feelings about this book that made me
want to write it came from the 17 years
I was a systems analyst designing
relational database systems and
algorithms for load balancing deployment
and networks things like that for big
corporations and the trend I'd seen over
the last decade or so was increasing
centralization and uniformity and also a
real push to automate things and of
course this was made possible by the web
and it was cost effective and highly
efficient but it also increases bless
you it also increases the susceptibility
of these networks to shocks sudden
shocks and that was really the driving
reason for me to write this book I felt
that most people in the street were not
technical enough to really understand
what these issues were and the goal of
this book was to try to make it an
exciting story that would bring people
through all of the the issues I think so
that once they were done reading it
they'd also had they'd read a good story
but also would know a bit more about the
the underpinnings of the modern world
and that was my goal
hopefully I succeeded in that but for
those who's read the book by the way I
don't want to put anybody on the spot so
ok I'm back third of it folks so for
those of you who haven't read it I'll
give you the high concept that I gave
the Hollywood folks that seemed to work
ok
it is the story of a highly successful
online game designer who creates a
program that monitors the web for the
appearance of his own obituary and when
that appears this program activates and
cascades in activating other programs
that begin to tear apart the systems
supporting the modern world it's not a
comedy obviously and once again I I
didn't use a story where there's this
super intelligent computer one of the
characteristics of this story is that
these are fairly dumb BOTS web bots that
are reacting to this and I think that's
one of the big changes for most of these
stories about computers taking over the
world is one of my chief concerns is
that we can create systems that are not
self-aware that can nonetheless Corral
us pretty well as a society and also
without us even knowing it because a lot
of people in daily lives they do what
the screen tells them so that was one of
my concerns now let's see I'm gonna flip
through my notes here I did not write
this book to stoke a fear in some of the
interviews I've done that is the first
question like oh are we all going to die
and that's not why I wrote the book I
wrote the book to try to inform the
public about these issues so that we can
make some changes I'm very optimistic
about technology obviously I'm a
technologist I think there's great
things on the horizon as long as we're
aware of some potential pitfalls and I
really hope I'm wrong about all this I
hope this does not move to the
nonfiction section anytime soon and yeah
I think when the sequel comes out you
will see that I'm actually very
optimistic about the future No
how did I get this book published as
Rick indicated I self-published it
initially there's a bit of a stigma to
that obviously I tried to get this
published the mainstream way I sent out
248 agents and I know the number exactly
I wrote customized letters to each one
of them query letters and I got three to
write me back and they indicated that
the book was too long the logistics of
the modern publishing distribution
business are that they don't want a
first-time author to be over 90 thousand
words
because if you make it longer than that
it will take up more than one slot in
the retail channel that's just the
reality of the business so I didn't want
to shorten it because it was a hundred
and forty thousand words the way I wrote
it and so that would be a good 40
percent cut that was too much
so I did self-publish it with a company
called Lightning Source and I don't know
if anybody's ever heard of that but
there's a number of different print on
demand services that give you access to
Ingram distribution network throughout
the world well throughout the North
America the UK anyway and it was a
surprisingly easy process that just left
us the marketing of the book which is a
huge task I would indicate and Michelle
came up with a great grassroots campaign
we did not spam everybody about the
existence of this book what we did was
we chose about two dozen people who were
people bloggers tech journalists people
who I'd read and whose work I was
familiar with and we approached them
personally and it was a much more scaled
down a bit labor-intensive because he
had to write personal letters to these
folks indicating you knew who they were
and what they did and that you really
thought that they would enjoy your book
and we got a great return rate and Rick
cloud was one of those last you again
virus going around what that enabled us
to do was to leverage those people they
started handing it to other people and
as late as probably a year into this
process we had only sold about a hundred
and fifty books and for anybody who has
a book in them
I know it's amazing I I think back and
it's like it was a long long Hill to go
up but it really started snowballing
after a certain point and suddenly
suddenly we realized we were not the
ones pushing it it was starting to
accelerate on its own and that was after
the wired article came out but that was
fully a year later so for anybody who
wants to self publish a book don't be
discouraged if after a great deal of
effort you've only sold a few hundred
books because I believe the average is
about 150 for a self-published book the
critical point for us was at about 3500
copies which occurred I think
several months after the wired article
buzz was building on the web and that
was really when the floodgates opened
and major mainstream publishers came to
me Hollywood came to me and I suddenly
found myself in a very good situation
for those of you who are very supportive
of self-publishing and the grassroots
idea of sort of a democratizing
literature some of those folks were a
little upset at me that I chose a
mainstream contract at that point but I
will say that mainstream publishing
really does have a role still even
though print-on-demand technology is out
there and that's because to get a book
in stores the logistics of that really
requires a major organization right now
and until there's a time where there's
print-on-demand machines in every Barnes
and Noble and borders and so forth I
don't see that changing
so I do see self-publishing as a new
farm system for literature where instead
of sending your manuscript into agents
you might self publish and these
agencies would instead monitor all these
self-published books to see which ones
are rising and I think that's a much
more of a meritocracy everybody get a
chance to say what they want to say and
if they find an audience they can
establish that they have an audience
they will get published and I firmly
believe that that was certainly my
experience so I guess the the buzzword
there is crowd sourcing the book
selection process I the very first job
by the way I had out of college was that
a publishing company was Dodd made in
New York and I worked a slush pile and
they would just bring truckloads of
these manuscripts in every day I know
what how much work that is
matter of fact I used to write the flat
copies of nonfiction books I wrote the
flap copy for psychic cats this was my
first one so you've read it that's good
also secrets of successful insurance
sales that was another another big
favorite but it was helpful for me to
work in the publishing industry because
I could see behind that curtain I didn't
take rejection personally also
self-publishing does more closely
aligned your awareness of publishing
realities with that of a publisher
because when I started talking to the
mainstream publishers they were I think
a little shocked that I was realistic
about what was necessary so that's
another thing I would recommend about
self-publishing is it as an artist you
have some different priorities but they
can be tempered somewhat by the
realities of self-publishing and trying
to print that book and make it available
at a profit so that you don't lose money
on every book yourself now that's really
about all I have to say on that I'm very
happy to take any questions anybody has
at this point okay sure
see that's something that I get from
some of these interviews the question
was going to talk a bit about my work as
an IT security consultant I wasn't an IT
security consultant if you look at some
of the interviews what I was is I
designed relational database systems and
algorithms yeah
part of that is securing your systems if
I put code into a major corporation that
they that becomes a mission-critical
system I definitely don't want any holes
in it so that was my exposure to
security when I created systems I would
often at the resistance of the client
spend time securing it because you know
how that goes they create something and
they want it in place and I would say
well hang on we got to secure this some
clients were great about that other
clients really wanted to get things
moving quickly so that's why I became
aware of it because if they didn't
already have somebody focusing on the
whole security picture I would make sure
my my part was okay so that's where that
came from anybody else any questions all
yes yeah I that's where I would have
gone the the question is did I look at
Creative Commons licensing had I not
been able to sell this book I would have
done that I was determined to get the
book out there I also wanted to be able
to to make a good play at this it seemed
like a good time for me to start
thinking of a change so I wanted to see
if I could succeed commercially with it
first had I not done so I would have I
would have put it out there with a
Creative Commons license definitely so
please don't be timid
I'm very timid and I'm standing up here
so
ask some questions feel free anybody
yeah that's another question I get where
any of the characters based on people I
know thankfully not because otherwise
you get pigeonholed by somebody and I'm
not a good liar and then they'd be like
why would you betray me like that the
closest I would get is the character of
Ross who is a composite of a person that
I met who was probably the most gifted
coder I'd ever met in my life
could look at a screen of code and then
walk across the room and reproduce it on
his screen to make you know a point
really sharp guy but the other folks
really I think are just symbolic
individuals and I steered clear
especially of portraying anybody in my
family that seems like a really bad idea
so anybody else yes
yeah well we are videotaping this on our
way no I'm not I'm not as considers one
of the reasons why I chose the folks I
did it's Walter Parks as the producer he
was the co-writer of wargames fairly
technical guy he takes the story from
the characters and understands generally
what it's about there were other
producers who were interested in I don't
think that they were approaching it from
that point of view they were approaching
it more as a big action picture only and
you know if I'm beating on Farah that's
that was the perception I had at the
time and I think Walter you know Walter
Park Zoo and Lauren McDonald his wife
that they really get the story the other
thing is they're involving me in it to
the extent that we're sitting down and
talking I mean I'm not writing the
script I'm not a screenwriter but they
are at least asking me what I think
about things no I
doesn't mean they're gonna do it that
way but that's a good start and I'm
pretty confident they're gonna do a good
job so there's a new experience it's
pretty cool there's another one Rick
yeah so not so much relating to the book
but I think kind of building off of it
the thing that resonated for me very
early on is how well you explained
technical subjects without sounding too
technical so I mean from my favorite of
those scenes was when Ross is in the
hotel and the demon is hacking into the
unsecured web server of the hotel to get
his identity and he's desperately trying
to shut the computer down before that
happens because he recognizes that
that's happening it's been fun in
reading some of the reviews of people
who are not technical that they
appreciate how well they understand all
the moving parts of the book which
amazes me I'm glad because I was trying
to do that but the fact that I appeared
to have pulled it off well so and that's
I guess my question is at Google we deal
with a lot of people who are not
particularly technical and it's
incumbent upon us to explain what we do
and how we do it
to this audience is there a process you
go through where you try and put
yourself in the shoes of someone else
yeah and you know I think this comes
from my work actually because part of
what I would do is serve as a liaison
very often between coders or teams of
coders and corner office guys and I
think having a names of English
literature background I guess I have a
somewhat of a gift for gab I'm able to
translate between these people and try
to relate to these decision-makers what
the issues are it's what I was trying to
do and I'm still amazed when you know
folks who have absolutely no technical
background get in touch with me and say
oh thank you so much for doing this now
I understand online games you know and
what my kids are doing you know I get it
now
also enthusiasm I had a lot of
enthusiasm for portraying hitters really
this book really was a labor of love in
that sense so I took the time to figure
it out if you saw all the words that did
not make it on the page it's several
orders of magnitude and and that you
know I'll go into the sequel a little
little here this originally was going to
be one long story and I think it was on
page eleven hundred and thirty five you
know and I'm like yeah we gotta tone
this down because you're trying to sell
a four hundred and fifty page
self-published novel imagine trying to
sell it eleven hundred or thousand page
one it just wouldn't work so I chopped
it in two restructured it a bit and the
second book really is a very integral
part of the first it was mostly written
and then I was gonna release it last
November and then when when Dutton which
is an imprint of penguin they picked up
the book of course they reset the clock
so they released the hardcover and they
always wait a year because they want to
do a paperback of the hardcover so yeah
I apologize to anybody who read the book
is on my website I said it's coming out
in November but you know they changed it
and I realized that but the one good
thing about that is you might have
noticed there's been a few changes out
in the world recently some of the things
that seemed outlandish that I had in the
sequel are now like you know news from a
month ago so it's you know I gives me a
chance to respond to that somewhat I I
do think most of it will hold up very
well in terms of technological looking
forward some of the social circumstances
that I had originally had in the sequel
I I now have a chance to update them
which is good but yeah I'm very very
eager to get that out there and I do
feel very bad for those people who read
this book like you know year and a half
ago or like dude where is it
well anyway any other question is it yes
probably great as a suspension of
disbelief was I consider myself
extremely fortunate if I could write a
one-page program which would run
unattended production without me ever
touching me yes yes this is what I say
the question I don't know we have audio
on the question the questions but it was
basically if I can paraphrase you do you
expect me to believe this rather large
system runs without a single bug and how
many people died in beta testing the
answer to that is I actually had scenes
and chapters where and I don't I'm gonna
be careful not to give away some of the
stories of those who haven't ready where
somebody would go to interact with the
demon and it would fail because it's so
distributed that we look at a bell curve
and all we need is that sweet spot in
the mid a critical mass of people
succeeding through it but it really
disrupted this story it in an undermined
it I know what you're saying it would
have to fail in so many ways I think it
will become more clear in the sequel how
it heals itself how it reacts to failure
but that is that is how I envisioned it
that that there are failures but you
didn't see them in the book and if that
sounds like a weaselly answer that that
was actually what I was thinking so was
there a particular point in it that you
thought was just the complexity of it
and the fact that it ran well yeah
okay you know what I love that that's a
great idea
I'll bring it up to and we'll see if
they go for that but it's the old hey
wait a minute you know I think what you
said blue screen of death
yeah maybe that would be funny actually
well I I wouldn't do the production of
it but oh you mean the text the text
that's interesting yeah I'd have to
clean it up but I promise I'll deliver
the sequel first cuz I'm starting to do
it errata people are like dude get the
work my wife is asking you couldn't ask
me in the car you have to ask me like
times are changing man we see the
question but she knows the answer to was
is there any difference between the
self-published edition and the and the
Dutton hardcover Edition and there is
that's actually a good point of you're
steering me back to this Dutton was
amazingly cool I was shocked that I did
this self-published book and about 97%
of it is exactly the way I wrote it
which amazes me that it survived and
been severe is one of the best editors
in New York great the only wanted me to
change the first chapter because my
first chapter in the self-published of
the Nina dear House edition was somewhat
technical it took place in a server room
people talking about machines they said
well we'd like to make this a mainstream
commercial thriller could we possibly
have it start some other way and I
already had a different beginning that I
had abandoned put it back in place that
was much more well the non-technical
reader wouldn't have to climb over a
barbed wire fence to get into the story
basically that was one change another
words they wanted to add a chapter
somewhere around the middle which I'd
also written so I knew that that was we
were thinking in the same way but those
are only the only changes really which
once again shocked me to go through a
main stream publishing company almost
entirely intact in what I was trying to
say
was great so yes yes no no a self edited
I I like to think I have a stainless
steel ego so I can be honest with myself
I what I would do is I would write this
put it down for a month come back to it
and then I could realistically look at
it without being emotionally attached to
any sentence and say that's crap that's
crap
I write big and then sort of sculpt the
ultimate book out of it you know I
overwrite and that really requires some
cutting like I said I was on page eleven
hundred and thirty five at one point I
got rid of whole storylines whole
characters which seemed like great ideas
at the time but just didn't pan out but
yeah it's a lot of self editing yeah
there's another one over here yes that's
a good question that's a very good
question the question was if I was born
seventy-five years earlier what would I
be reading about Wow I don't know steam
engines on ships or something I'm I'm
interested in technology and its effect
on society it's transformative effect on
society I suspect it would be something
like that I don't know if it would be as
fun because I might be far more obscure
I feel very fortunate with what's
happened in this and how this blew up
was largely because of Technology how
instantly information can move but I
would still be doing this type of thing
I think at this point in my life because
I was ready for a change I spent a lot
of time really in server rooms writing a
lot of code and I just you know I was
ready for change and fortunately this
came along so I don't know if it was
1870 and I was at that point and still
alive by the way because I guess I'd be
what we supposed to the average lifespan
in 1870s I apparently not high so I'd be
preparing to retire and die probably at
this point I don't think people had
second careers too much in those days
there was another one over there anybody
yes
okay am i full-time writer now for
probably the next couple of years yeah I
will never leave technology entirely I
want to do some technology
entrepreneurship now do some other
things I I could never leave it alone
pretty much I always start to get
involved in things and I find myself
tinkering with machines again and again
but I also have this desire to write
I've always had it my entire life I've
written a lot and I like to think this
is really the only time anybody's
noticed that I write
and so I'll trade off between those III
don't necessarily want to be a person
who produces a book a year no matter
what like if I don't have something to
say but on if something you say I won't
do a book so right now I'm a
professional writer that's probably
going to change you know it's not
entirely true there's Jeff self editing
I do have friends writers who I respect
who will viciously attack what I write
and I would much rather that because I
know that they're doing it from a good
point because you only have that one
chance to throw it out there but I will
do my best at self editing it and it's I
don't know I just tend to know it if I
put it down several times and come back
to it and nothing in it jars me or takes
me out of it basically if it suspends
disbelief for me if it kind of weaves
that spell that brings you into a story
where you forget you're reading then
that works for me and then somebody else
will really tear into it you know and I
won't necessarily agree with some of the
comments but no I I've been fortunate so
far that I think I've agreed where I
needed to I don't know how I arrived at
that but I just seemed to so again
well first of all work in publishing and
realize how much they pay no just
kidding I was you know production
assistant so I'd always been interested
in technology and you know not to offend
anybody at all III probably won't but I
think there is an art in some ways to
technology to look at systems very often
I would be able to make rapid progress
on a system because I sort of understood
all of the parties involved in what they
were trying to achieve and I mean that's
a big part of making good technology is
yeah tight code is good but having it
meet the needs of what people want
being able to adequately communicate to
them and with them and understand what
it is they're trying to achieve I think
having an English literature written
word background helped me a lot there so
I think that's how it is and of course I
got certs and other things like that
later on no computer engineering degree
but you know that turned out not to be
as necessary as a good decade or so of
experience especially at that very
formulated stage in early 90s going all
the way up from there that was a big big
time for people just grabbing tools and
working with them getting search true
but you know I would never design
hardware never attempt to do that but by
doing ok or to do you feel any
responsibility for sewing tabs you know
I thought about that pretty hard some of
those hacks I actually made a tweak to
so that I could clearly demonstrate that
I it was a real one but it wouldn't give
you enough information without you going
to pursue it to achieve it you'd also
have to have some considerable knowledge
already
I like to think that adversaries of
civilization people who want to sow
chaos already know these things who have
the technological been to be hackers
what I was trying to do was make people
aware of these vulnerabilities commonly
so that people can realize the fragility
of the modern world that was really what
I was going for I don't think I created
or enabled any new enemies of the system
so to speak and where I thought it might
be too easy like for instance the sequel
injection attack this is yeah I sound
elitist like this but you know if you
have an entry form on your web page
that's susceptible to a sequel injection
attack god no that's that's a pretty
common one and I chose the most common
sequel injection attack in that cut in
the text so you know that's you should
already have fixed that and I know I was
also very careful I know it's like
that's it you get what you deserve now I
I also was careful in my descriptions of
machines to talk about unpatched
machines people who were using pirated
code who weren't maintaining I didn't
want to give a false impression that no
matter what you did that you could you
were helpless so you know some cake
there's some capable systems maintenance
and would solve almost all of that and I
didn't choose things that were commonly
known already I'm not like for instance
a NetBIOS attack that's going back a
ways almost all machines are going to be
protected against that now but it did
help to communicate that there are ports
in a machine you know and you get people
who are non techie to say really and
they look on the back of the machine you
know for ports it's like no it's not
like that and hopefully that helped them
a little to understand that there are
code ports in your machine that you have
to be concerned about if not exactly
NetBIOS assault something like that type
of attack so I hope that answered your
question yeah I'm not trying to sow
anarchy all right yes
hello boy what part of the book did I
have most fun ready would it upset
anyone if I said it's fun to write for
Greg who's the character who's he's very
stirring actually that's what the
Hollywood people told me to was your
heroes are kind of bland but your
villains are great it's like what does
that say about you
Wow I don't know but no he was an
interesting character to write for
because I didn't I tried not to make
anybody black or white in terms of their
evil or goodness I tried to make this
shades of grey certainly he is a very
bad person but he has his reasons that I
don't necessarily agree with but he does
have his reasons so it would be Greg yes
Michelle what was the inspiration behind
demon what you know stated audience here
my wife feeding me another question what
was the inspiration behind the story
actually it's true I forgot this uh it
was a program that I wrote actually in
1999 and it was not a program to take
over the world it was it was a program
called weather master which created
fictional weather for fictional worlds
it was for role playing game errs if you
didn't know there was a market for such
a thing
there is and I wrote it as a sideline
because at the time I was doing some
really dry database design work and I
wanted a challenge so I created this
program it had a really cool orbital
mechanics module into two so you could
create a custom world with a you know
axis tilt orbital eccentricity and it
would determine when the Sun would rise
and set anywhere on that world in any
day of the year
then it would create weather and all
that stuff so I wrapped it in a
licensing control like a polymorphic and
crisp encryption wrapper made it
available over to the web so you could
pull it down try it for 30 days and if
you liked it you bought it the money
went automatically into this merchant
account and the merchant account was
swept to pay for the website and
advertising and things like that's
completely automated system and I went
away I got busy on some client projects
and I came back a couple months later
and there's this money in this account
you know and I sold into 38 countries
that was probably the first time I
realize the power of the web like oh my
god it's like I don't even have to be
alive for this thing to keep running and
then I started thinking what else I
could do if I was dead and I realized
like I could do most of what I do
already if I was dead because most of
our communications are not personal
they're very impersonal we communicate
with sort of an avatar of ourselves
email your you go on to a web page to do
your online banking or to order things
and I started ticking off this list of
all this stuff and then I realized well
if I was also a corporation and I paid
my bills you know you could continue
especially if you start to have
adherents that start to work for you so
that's how this story this story grew
out of that so actually that was good to
feed me that I forgot to bring that up
but anyway I thought I had another one
here Riki
introduced the possibility okay about
the demon as a platform where so will
anticipates other platforms emerging one
of the things that I was a little
surprised by was that in a world where
open-source communities basically create
themselves around certain platforms that
we didn't see a group recognize the
demon for what it was and try and
exploit it themselves
okay outside of the demon zone control
yes that's good because see when you
read the sequel no because yes that is
very true that's such a system that's so
pervasive would start to have people
tugging in different directions and
putting it to use is that the Creator
could not have ever anticipated any
sufficiently useful tool would be like
that and yeah you're you're dead on
right and that's much of what the sequel
deals with it's I'm not trying to evade
that's really the truth so yes
social networking is interesting to me
the power of that and also how it a
grits information about real-time human
activity I think is fascinating III
talked about this a little in the long
now presentation I did there was a study
at MIT called reality mining I think it
was called where they studied the
movements of cellphones for instance and
this isn't strictly social networking
but it's tracking the movements of
people and seeing how they connect and
then they wrote an algorithm and this is
after about a month they wrote an
algorithm that could predict with 85%
accuracy what someone was gonna do next
anybody in that study I thought that's
really powerful that type of thing is
very interesting to me and I I'm at
civil liberties and a guy but at the
same time I also understand the need to
collect information to make movement of
goods and services efficient so it's
balancing that I think that balancing
act and how we preserve democracy while
doing it that is right at this center of
what I'm interested in so yes no no I am
working on the sequel still like I said
I was mostly done with it and then a way
when I made the deal with Dutton I went
back and revisited it towards the
structure apart a bit because there was
been a lot of things in recent months
that have changed that I wanted to
incorporate I'm not gonna keep writing a
series of demon books right now I I
don't want to continue the story
basically I'm gonna finish what it was
that I wanted to say if in the future
there's something that I think is good
to add to it sure I might do that but I
have a third book that I want to do
completely separate subject and then
also like I said get involved in
technology there's some some ideas some
technologies I'm very interested in but
that type of thing yes what is it like
no expectations
yeah that's right
okay you know once again I'm sorry for
not repeating these questions because I
don't know that we we have a mic that
will detect the questions but the
question was now that this book is
appears to be successful is the pressure
on not to suck and on the next one yeah
you know it is but what's helpful here
is that I knew what I wanted to do from
the beginning so I'm just gonna do that
and damn the torpedoes that type of
thing I can't really worry about that I
think I just have to write the book that
I want to read which is what I did with
the first one and whoever finds that
interesting will find it interesting and
that's all I can do yes demons of Neil
Stevenson Andre Norton Isaac Asimov
foundation trilogy things like that a
lot of nonfiction also John Dos Passos
anybody know John Dos Passos portuguese
writer the the america trilogy he's
great from the 1920s I've really
wide-ranging interests
lately though because of research I've
been reading a ton of nonfiction almost
all of the authors I cannot think of oh
well no Jared Diamond people like that
what is it Michael Pollan know that you
know things like that I really I read a
lot of different stuff which is great
love books yeah you know I probably
should put a list on my website
Peter be your singers another another
guy who writes for like a think-tank and
he writes these really incisive books
about corporate military and technology
really yeah I'll do that I'll do that so
I'm not gonna make a note now but okay
yes with these last few months
yeah in other places and things like the
glory house and other things yes we're
playing those attacks what what's your
thing on that about countries trying to
block those things yeah basically trying
to control the web after the fact that
sort of it goes along the lines of what
I was saying Erica about you know front
center my concern about information how
it's gathering used who uses it I think
there's a real risk not just from
terrorists or other people using this
information but also from governments
tugging it in the other direction to
control and become gatekeepers of
information I don't know I I'm really of
the opinion that right about in the
middle is is a nice balancing point
between security and openness is the
best we can do is you look at nature it
said you know how many hundreds of
millions of years to evolve systems to
try to survive attacked by external
forces and it is not perfect even so the
immune system works by and large but it
can still be defeated so we still walk
around not in bubble suits we accept
some risk and I think that to be a free
person you have to just accept some
risks you're right to say we shouldn't
make it easy we should build in some
safeguards but I think in coming years
we will find that balance I don't know
exactly how we'll do it but having a
conversation like this is probably a
good start
anyone else yes
how do you decide to self-publish on
paper instead yeah actually uh okay the
question is being a technologist why did
I decide to publish this on paper this
goes into some of my feelings about
e-readers you know I'm having just
recently purchased a Kindle I mean I can
see that and and I think Rick and I
talked about this it's like you want to
read a twelve hundred page book
biography of Abraham Lincoln but you're
getting on a plane you know it's good to
be able to combine it into a digital
format it's easy to carry some of the
arguments about e-readers being better
for the environment I'm not sure I buy
that I mean you've got what is it girly
Neum arsenide circuit boards I think
that's the name of it led solder you got
the plastic here the LCD screens how
many years are you gonna keep it how
much energy was required to make it
versus a book so the Technic the
environmental concerns I'm not sure I
buy exactly I don't know if it's a wash
if one is better than the other also
having a proprietary format electronic
format that our literature the corpus of
our society is stored in that concerns
me a little too it's not necessarily
heading in that direction just now but I
would be concerned if 3040 years from
now we have some of our literature on
this standard some of it on that
standard I would want to see it all
pardon me all open so I don't know I I
thought my favorite way to read a book
is physically pick it up off a shelf
read it as I start to become more
comfortable with e-readers that might
change but for right now I did it
because that's the way I like to read a
book and that's all even though I'm a
technologist you know Oh Andrew in
Pittsburgh hello
- sure so you touch up a lot of
different disciplines you know sometimes
the great heated barrel sometimes just
hanging out and cover a lot of
everything from from from CS and all the
disciplines that were then to hardware
engineering - you know Electrical
Engineering and even mechanical
engineering in different portions um how
much of this technology if you have to
retains on experience on you will draw
from and how much did you research
enough to sort of feel comfortable
writing about it okay you know it's
certainly not an expert and all the
things you talk about but you know the
thing that struck me is so much of it
seemed plausible and a handful of things
that you know I've had a chance to see
or do that were mentioned in the book on
my boss seems pretty dead-on and not
everyone's got a champion C background
stuff yeah well okay that's a good
question yeah I'm one of those people
who I'd like to think I know what I know
and I'm not afraid to say I don't know
something you know when you're in a
meeting with somebody and they just will
not admit that they don't know something
drives me crazy I don't know for
instance what is in the utility belts of
the fbi's elite hostage rescue unit or
what explosives they carry so I read a
lot of books to find out what they do I
read a lot of bamford on the NSA how
they talk to each other how their
systems work when it comes to database
systems networks I was fairly
comfortable with that also oddly
commercial real estate for instance when
they're going through the plenum of that
building I used to be a commercial real
estate manager so I knew that but
anything I didn't know just the way I am
I wanted to know more about it and get
it right and so I went through the very
enjoyable process by the way of reading
books about it I loved that it would
give me an excuse to read a book about a
subject I really might not have covered
otherwise so reading lots that
abbreviated reading list that the back
of the book is indeed abbreviated
there's probably about four or five
dozen books that I read to write this
book so it's actually interesting if you
think about it it's like how literature
builds one on another nonfiction feeding
fiction and so on yeah I think that's
that's what I did yes Erika
did I write anything before demon yeah I
used to write stories just to amuse
myself I did write some screenplays but
I think everyone does that they're
around and I should destroy them as soon
as possible I have a feeling same thing
with my first novel that I never
finished in college which man I tried to
read that recently I was really
self-indulgent and full of myself you
know I was like a 20 year old guy
writing a book and I know everything you
know so I got to destroy that - thank
you for bringing that up
unless they died and somebody tried to
publish it so yeah I've written a lot of
things but I never really got serious
about getting a publisher getting it out
there let's say until this one I have
some short stories flown around as I
have always wondered what is the market
for short stories I mean I know there is
one and maybe that's changing so I don't
mean to offend anybody who writes short
stories but I don't know I just wanted
to i felt really passionate about this
and it's not like i had a lot of free
time so when I took this amount of time
that I was gonna take I wanted to see
that it would reach a broad audience so
I wrote this really mainstream
commercial thriller to try to get all
these people thinking about it it would
what I consider releasing my short
stories in an open format on a website I
haven't read them in so long if they're
good I think some of them probably
because you know we most of those I
wrote 10 years or more ago and about
some pretty bizarre subjects so yeah you
know I'm not I'm not somebody who
absolutely has to make money on
everything I write certainly if it's
interesting anything is relevant
especially to this to like for instance
if I'm a techno-thriller author now and
I'm putting out rhyming couplets about
squirrels that that will disappoint some
folks it's like wow that guy's weird oh
sorry
so anybody else any other questions of
why why what just what type I know a lot
of people ask this question now since
you were a consultant worked a lot I
mean when did you write what did you
carve out time you're very disciplinary
you know weight and how did you
summarize trying to get me to talk about
how I wrote this thank you I wrote this
book in the evenings sometimes in the
middle of the night and usually after
something happened that that got me back
to it like some sort of technological
event either a release of a worm or
something like that or something that I
saw that really spurred me to do it so
there were a lot of catalytic moments
for me that got me moving on it but it
was in the in the Twilight hours or on
weekends then I wrote the book I wrote
it on a computer I'm trying to think
here now you guys offer a word processor
so I'll be guarded as this is but
honestly I wrote it in word because
that's what I used with my clients to
exchange data and then I typeset it in
Word and then eventually that was used
to create the physical book by Dutton I
was really surprised but it was a very
efficient process just out it went Rick
we one more one more
yeah yeah okay so the question is
talking about techno thrillers and
science fiction and what that
demarcation might be this book demon has
been described as science fiction by
some people and I sort of bridle when
they do that and it's not because I
perceive science fiction to some sort of
literary ghetto it's because I think
it's much closer to reality than that I
yeah you could say it's science fiction
but it wouldn't be science fiction for
very long I would anticipate because
what I've done is combine some very real
technologies in just new ways I haven't
said there's a fusion energy drive that
goes to the stars that type of thing so
that's how I think of science fiction I
don't know I wouldn't say that this is
science fiction and some people might
disagree but I don't
imitation is the most sincere form of
flattery that's empathy well you know as
long as they do a good job I suppose
you know I don't want it to change such
that what it was basically the more
people who are thinking about these
issues and if it starts a public
discussion a public discussion a
mainstream discussion about the
reliability and the sustainability of
our infrastructure the way we're
building and balancing efficiency with
survivability great I'm happy man
besides it's been wonderful so far I've
been very fortunate I've been able to
take a couple years now to write
I would not be crestfallen I know what's
going to happen hopefully it's not you
know for a bad purpose I would be very
upset if my book was somehow changed or
people used it for a bad purpose as
Andrew from Pittsburgh might have
mentioned that it would upset me if
something bad happened but at the same
time those openings were already there
and are already publicized in many many
places where people look for such
information so you know I I don't think
I would be responsible so here I'll hold
vacate my post neck stakes are stated a
whine Matt Cutts is on his way to a
conference so he sends his regards the
other is Chris DiBona who manages our
open source initiatives at Google cool
and he was all excited he had read the
self-published version I was really
excited to be here but is on a plane but
he he wanted to give a thank-you gift
which is a one of the Android dev Punk's
so you get to so coolly get to hack
around with oh man I tell you I didn't
expect this oh I'm safe oh thank you my
god Chris definitely wanted you to know
that he was he was a big fan and was
very successful and be great and now we
won't have any time to spend together
because I'm never playing with it
so Dan thank you again thank you for
thank you so much for thank you
