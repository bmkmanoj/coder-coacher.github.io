I'm Yasmin and so tonight along with
Paris and sana me we're going to tell
you a bit about our special category of
user at Google ideas and but first
things first how many people here have
heard of Google ideas before this meetup
by show of hands I tell you third maybe
half and so for the rest of you Google
ideas and one person that changed at my
last minute you did know about google it
is thanks thanks for having that your
boat recorded and so Google ideas is
Google's think / do tank so our user is
the one that's having kind of the
hardest time uses in distress and people
who are living through conflict or
repression for me that's particularly
meaningful because I'm from a country
that is squarely in the repression
bucket which is Iran so in countries
like Iran and Syria and North Korea and
people are in threat not just because
they might be you know persecuted for
being part of religious minorities or
ethnic minorities but also because of
their sexual preferences and really for
having independent thought and for
people in these countries they might
have their internet password and it
might be torture for the internet
password or imprison their families
might be harassed or hacked and when you
think about users in these types of
environments you and you probably think
that it sounds pretty bad but like
really far away and not a problem that
affects me at all and but when we think
about the next three billion people that
are coming online to there are three
billion people online today in the next
decade we think that numbers going to
more than double this is the heat map of
Internet near the rate of change of
Internet penetration when we think about
where the next few million people are
coming online we we see that it's
exactly the same areas where conflict is
common and where repression is rife it's
pretty dramatic not to trivialize the
content of oppression but you know these
these these challenges have been
it's the beginning of time and the thing
that's different now is of course the
internet so the thing that we think
about is the fact that over the next
decade it's not just that conflict and
repression are going to persist in the
physical world they're going to take on
entirely new forms online so as a
company we are doing a lot to bring
access to the next three billion to get
the world online and you may have heard
of this is a picture of a loon balloons
he may have heard of Project loon or a
project fiber for example and but our
team is asking the question what happens
once access is there who's thinking
about delivering kind of safe and
free-flowing information to the world so
we get the privilege of Google ideas of
kind of looking at a challenge that is
really complex that probably will be
mainstream and for users tomorrow so I
wanted to introduce you to one of our
users and this is door shard Othman so
when you think about hockey stick growth
you can kind of look at the death toll
in Syria there are more than 220,000
people who have died and 7 million
people who were displaced and the
country's war torn there's a brutal
dictator a monstrous Islamist group and
who are winning territory and this long
tale of kind of armed rival militia soda
shard is one of the refugees and he
before the conflict in 2011 he could led
a technology movement to help the
opposition and he fled in 2013 and he
noticed and once he'd come to Maggie
noticed a tweet from a man he knew in
Damascus about a scud missile having
been fired and Arshad served in the
military in Syria and he knew a little
bit about Scud missiles he knew that
they were slow heavy short-range
ballistic missiles and he actually knew
where this missile was headed and how
long it would take to land eight minutes
and he thought about those eight minutes
and he obviously knew that he couldn't
change the course of this garden missile
but he wondered if he could still change
the course of events so he developed an
online Ernie warning system for
God missiles called empty the input was
eyewitness testimonies of Scud missiles
being fired the site plotted and the
course of the the trajectory of the scud
missile and where it would land and the
output was phone calls SMS and emails to
20 civilians in the strike zone so
within its first 24 hours 16,000 people
had signed up to the site and including
two news stations and this is in a
country where you know there are regular
power outages so empty is a really cool
example of how information in powers you
know even if it's just to tell people to
get the hell out of somewhere it saves
lives and there are also some other
takeaways firstly that necessity drives
innovation certainly that in these
horrible places we hear about in the
news there are developers and they have
time to work on these these problems and
thirdly that innovation in these types
of circumstances them is literally the
difference between life and death so
developers plus necessity plus time
equals innovation that saves lives empty
a why MTA and okay so what does this
mean in practice for Google ideas to
missile this is our moon shot by show of
hands has anyone heard the term moonshot
before okay more people than hope Google
ideas not everyone that so moonshot is a
kind of attempt to use a lot that Google
ideas that Google sorry that that refers
to a very audacious goal that you think
like going to the moon that you think
you can achieve within a decade so ours
is to end repressive censorship within a
decade and we're going to share with you
some concrete examples tonight about you
know some of the projects that we think
can help get us there and you proxy and
an initiative called project shield let
me paint a picture for you before I
handover so this is the same map that I
showed before it's a heat map of
repression online and the darker the
color the greater the extent of
repression so black is
most repressive countries in the world
and one of them in the middle is around
where I mentioned that I was from so
Iran and I think it's six from the
bottom of the rankings of freedom it
also has more than has like an Islamist
government more than half of its
population are connected to the internet
so it's really kind of trailblazing in
terms of developing the digital
repression toolkit and websites are
blocked in Iran as you might imagine
they're also throttled and there was
also types of attacks that aren't even
obvious to users like man-in-the-middle
attacks but you really have to use your
imagination to understand what it's like
to be a user of the internet in a
country like Iran I kind of my cousin
isn't running I left a run when I was
young I still have friends and family
who are there and you know I talk to my
cousin a lot and I asked him about his
experience using the internet I asked
him if he isn't scared this is a kind of
quote from him but he says of course I'm
scared but what can I do I have no other
options and just in the last month there
were five users 45 Iranians that were
sentenced to 20 20 years in prison just
for using Facebook bloggers are
routinely imprisoned and tortured and
die and the cyber police as they have
come to be known in Iran and have really
aren't their reputation for being really
scary and ruthless and so people don't
run have in countries like Iran have to
choose either don't be online be offline
or be online but be unsafe and these
types of challenges are the ones that we
think about a lot at Google ideas and
I'm going to hand over to Solomon to
kind of tell you how technology can help
address them you proxy is a open source
project developed by university of
washington and seeded by Google ideas
and I'm a software engineering at this
project so in addition to use these
points i want to show you one example so
i want to go to a new york times website
and beautiful it loads it it's not
blocked right scrolling down does anyone
see anything suspicious here
what does it say so obviously New York
Times is not writing about this meetup
being canceled and this is a malicious
content injected by some third parties
written by evil it so I think this is
one of the scariest examples right we
trust the source and someone can just
randomly inject something that that it's
now coming actually from New York Times
so what is the first thing that comes to
our mind when we go to a country where
something is blocked so first thing is
proxy servers here on the picture we
have users in a restricted or unsafe
environments and we have some content
that's in some others in the free world
and access to it is blocked so we find
that proxy server and we connect to the
content through a proxy server what are
the known challenges for this scenario
there are two two problems with this one
is scale so once the proxy server
becomes very popular the adversary can
can just block proxy server in one click
of a button and it wouldn't even cost
them anything the second problem is
trust who runs this proxy server are
they malicious themselves are they
stealing any information are they
monitoring the content the the websites
that you're visiting so there's a really
a big problem of trust so how do we
solve this we solve this by building a
distributed proxy we have users in a
restricted or unsafe environments and we
have users in safe environments so let's
go back to the arm yeah this point so
initial hands like does anyone know
anybody who's either in orange red or
black country and are you willing to
give them access to the information
that's blocked for them
right so this is this is actually a
remodel right so everyone seems to know
someone and people who are in these
countries tend to have some relatives or
someone in this country who experience
the freedom and they want to share this
freedom to that to their relatives so we
have so the model is the users in the
Indus unsafe environments connected to
their friends in a safe environment and
they access content through them and
those googly eyes the adversary that is
trying to find a way to block the
content but they can't because there's
no one centralized proxy server that
they can taking card they either have to
plug the whole internet or just access
to the outside world which we think they
will not do so i would like to demo how
um your proxy works so I sign it using
facebook you can sign it either Facebook
or Google or both um and I have lists of
friends this on top by the way is myself
I can also proxy through other instances
of myself so for example if you're
traveling outside of the country you can
leave your computer on here in New York
and then proxy through your yourself
anytime so right now i will proxy
through my friend Lucas
okay took a few seconds but it worked so
now we can try to go on York Times again
and the malicious content is gone it's
actual actual New York Times what
actually happens when when I click start
processing what actually happens there
so initially this is the most simplified
V or what we do and we have Alice and
Bob on two sides um so initially they
exchanged the delimit the the very
little information on Facebook or Google
like we're usually Facebook or Google
because we so far we only have these two
social networks they've changed the
information about the IP address and
port and very minimal information via
social networks and once they have that
they can establish a peer-to-peer a
connection using WebRTC API and from now
then on we actually don't use social
networks for anything so initial
basically we only need social networks
to find or discover your friends and to
exchange the as a signaling challenge
for initial exchange of information so
once we establish the connection what
happens so suppose I type the new york
times in my browser so when you type in
york time something in your browser it
goes to arm your local socks5 our proxy
server and the requester redirected to
arm Bob via using WebRTC API Bob Mapes
makes a request to in this case youtube
or York Times gets the contact and sends
all the contacts back to dallas in
magical shows up on the analysis browser
so the cloud and the malicious weird
eyes on the page is the adversary who's
either trying to block this content or
who is trying to find out what your what
are you doing
and the reason why they can't do that
because all the content is encrypted and
obfuscate it in so we mentioned that the
traffic between Alice and Bob is
encrypted and my favorite part about
your proxy is that it's a Fisk ated we
can make this traffic look like random
UDP traffic and this is already in works
but we are trying to work on improving
it and trying to make it look like any
other traffic something that looks
absolutely benign and something that
adversary is not willing to block for
example if all these traffic look like
you're just skyping with your friend
outside of your country probably the
government would not want to block that
because that means that would have to
block all they like outside coming
communications like all the skype
traffic as well there's another point of
metric collections um we do so the whole
slide is about this security um the
mattress collection is done using report
tool I don't know if any of you know
what Roberto is and I want dive into
this too much but basically first of all
it is absolutely opt-in so you don't
have to obtain if you don't feel
comfortable but even if you do the
report that the mattress collection is
done in a way that we don't know and if
any individual reports something we
don't know where the value is true or
false like we don't know whether it's
correct but overall statistically it
yells the correct data in addition to
that are in a submit feedback we also
have I don't have this only slide but we
also have an option to submit feedback
and will be very appreciated if you do
um and all the feedback all the logs are
anonymized and we remove all the
personal information
from the locks and if you're willing to
get involved you can insult your proxy
at you proxy dot org oh and try your
friends share it with your friends and
submit feedback please um or contribute
to the it's absolutely open source so
contribute to it how do they get la
github link or join mailing list on your
proxy discuss that's it so basically by
doing this we think that we can solve
the problem of you being able to access
any server but what if every study could
bring the server down and my teammate
various we'll talk about if there how to
solve that issue well thank you so my
settlement that was a great explanation
of you proxy I'd like to talk to you
about project shield in project shield
we're aiming at protecting freedom of
speech from denial of service attacks
very important by the way let me
introduce myself very quickly I'm very
strict cell I've been working at Google
ideas for about a year now and this is
my seventh here at Google I worked at
Maps and Google search before and this
is by far the most exciting project that
I worked on and its most impactful it's
fantastic to see people who benefit from
our artwork so denial of service attack
we're at 187 1118 avenue or 97 ninth
avenue this is our webpage we put it on
the on the map we start a web server
let's assume that we start a web server
you know we're just an independent
newspaper
and we're going to just talk about
what's happening in the office around
the office so then we put up our web
server let's say we put up a patchy and
then we put it up on the internet and
all of a sudden we start getting traffic
from Europe hey that's great we have
some European readers and then you know
we're getting these these users you know
analytics looks good but then all of a
sudden Africa gets on the map and we get
some traffic from Africa and before we
know it Latin America gets on the map
and before we know it United States gets
on the map and all of a sudden we get so
much traffic that our web admin gets
this blue screen this is a DDoS attack
so what happened is we got a denial of
service attack essentially when we set
up our website we set up we set up a
small website we expected maybe a
hundred users per second 100 QPS but
then what happened is we started getting
all this traffic from all around the
world all of a sudden maybe at the QPS
level that's 10 times a hundred times
the capacity that we had the way DDoS
attacks work is the traffic originates
from computers that are infected mostly
by viruses that don't do anything to
your computer so it goes undetected but
it's controlled by a person a black hat
hacker who's got a button in his hand
and he can control all of these
computers to go to a certain website
whenever he wants and since the virus is
distributed uniformly across the globe
all of these computers are across the
globe and then they can create traffic
for your website not necessarily to read
the content just to create traffic so
that the real users cannot access the
real content
so with that let me give you a little
demo it's called digital attack mobs my
teammates builded this shows the real
details traffic around the globe if it
loads so this is the real traffic the
the traffic is anonymized and it's being
pulled from around 270 ISPs from around
the world it's pulled every hour we get
the data from arbor networks and we put
this data into this visualization so
that we can show the world and the
people the size of the DDoS attacks
that's happening at the time real time
at the bottom we have this graph which
shows you the size so you can see how
much details traffic every day we get in
the world and the I don't know if you
can see it very well but the direction
of the animation shows you where the
traffic is originating from one where
it's going to you cannot always tell
where the deed OHS traffic is coming
from but for the ones that we can tell
we show you the origin and the
destination it's our experience at
Google that DDoS attacks are becoming
more of the norm than an exception
unfortunately going forward any website
commercial or non-commercial will have
to take a note of those attacks
especially if you have something to say
that some people don't want it to be
heard you will have more of it than any
other website I want to show you a
particularly bad day earlier today I was
playing with it and I found this day
which is August 25th around August 25th
so if you look at it this is this is the
deed OHS traffic that the United States
has has received
there is nothing specific happening on
that day but sometimes does traffic
correlates with some laws are you know
passed by the lawmakers controversial
laws mostly or some country making a
decision about acting on some other
country cool so let's go back to our
slide and then let's take a look at how
if we wanted to create some of those
traffic let's say that we're a hacker
how we can find this does traffic if we
can play the video
so this is a real video I search this on
youtube I said by D does and this is
what came up unfortunately their website
doesn't work so maybe it's being details
by other people but this is this is how
easy it is on an on ebay we found
instances of d dos services that you can
buy for a hundred bucks we checked it up
earlier today it was not there so ebay
had taken it down but that's that's the
case so the question is this there are
services some people give DDoS attack
but who actually attacks this is from
akamai's website and I'm just going to
read you without any further comment
what they say right here these types of
attacks can originate from a variety of
sources including hacktivists for profit
hackers state sponsored hacking groups
and others in many cases DDoS attacks
leverage the force of multiplication etc
it goes on this is a real threat and
this is a real threat for year for the
news that you're trying to consume and
for the freedom of speech with that I
would like to give you a little bit
technical background on this how do you
do if you want it to be a black hat
hacker and if you wanted to do a DOS
attack how do you do this there is a
particularly interesting one called slow
loris attack this came about in 2012 it
was unrevealed in 2012 we don't know
whether it was used before hand but it
was we've figured out that it was being
used in 2012 usually when you do a DDoS
attack you need a lot of machines as the
map that I showed you it's all around
the world and then you just send a lot
of traffic from all these machines in
this case you need only one machine to
take down the web server the machine
opens many connections but it doesn't
close the connections to the web
so the the program that runs on on your
computer let's say that you're the
attacker the goal of the attacker is to
go to a web server and an open a
connection saying hey I want to get this
this resource this web page but then
send some parameters and never really
close like keep the connection open with
some junk with that you can easily make
sure that the web server is running out
of connections so the web servers
usually have a limited number of
connections if the web server is engine
X for example it keeps the connections
as a file on the file system and a file
system has usually by default 65k limit
you know it comes from the operating
system so you can run out of that that
limit and you can get to that blue
screen easily if you want to try this
you can go to github and under is this
awesome slow loris implementation in go
which is the language that Google
implemented and then these are the
features fantastic features users as low
of network battery as possible what that
means is you can be dos attacks on
website and still read the news online
and if you want to learn more about it
go on youtube and search for slaughter
is attack d dos and there are a lot of
EdTech videos that will teach you how to
do slow learners attack so it's easy to
do d dos and there are a lot of websites
out there who are started usually from
by the default parameters of apache or
nginx web servers which actually make
them quite vulnerable to DDoS attacks
this is a command by one of the websites
that we protected during the conflict
times Sergei said i was working
twenty-four/seven i did not leave home I
was sleeping near my desk with the
monitors running with statistics grab
analyzers and reports about our anti-d
those tools it's a big deal when you
have something that you want to put up
on your on your newspapers side and
you're getting attacked and we can
protect you and we can make your voice
heard our biggest value added besides
protecting these websites is to actually
help these web admins to set up their
web servers in the correct way most of
the time they may not know what the most
recent technology out there to protect
their own website so what is project
shield this is the Strommen definitional
project shield here is the internet as a
big big cloud and we have a bunch of VMs
that run a reverse proxy for our
customers meaning that we can use all
sorts of algorithms and in addition to
our network bandwidth to protect the
content of our customers the one thing I
can tell you about it in in this graph
is we we launched project shield about
six months ago as a beta test and after
running it for a little while we rewrote
the whole thing and and we're about to
relaunch our version 2 in the upcoming
weeks months and we're very excited
about it in our beta program we were
able to protect quite a few websites
about 250 users including election
websites election websites gets d dust
it's a it's a phenomenon of the of the
modern world if you go to if you search
project shield Google ideas this is the
website that you're going to get
can apply to be on project shield this
application goes to our beloved product
manager CJ Adams and then we go through
the web sites and we verify that you
stand for freedom of speech and you're
an independent newspaper or you're an
NGO that is in need of details
protection and now once we sign you up
on our side you're protected by Google
against ddos attacks so with that I like
to pass the microphone to Jasmine one
microphone too many for me and so thanks
so much we just and thanks for kind of
coming tonight and hearing us talk about
our work at Google ideas we spoke about
you proxy which is a browser extension
to help friends kind of share their
internet experience and shield which is
our effort to give independent media
human rights advocates and election
monitoring sites a first line of defense
against ddos attacks and we do have ways
for you to get involved we saw earlier
that you can contribute directly to you
proxy because the snow open-source
project or if you have friends or family
in one of those countries I think want
to see it's like 100 plus countries in
the world where there's some type of
repression and then please do try and
install you proxy it's kind of an alpha
so it's buggy and so really be grateful
for you to test it and give us some
feedback and if you know any websites
that fall into those categories again
that's independent media human rights
advocacy or election monitoring please
you know let them know about project
shield because we'd like to protect them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
