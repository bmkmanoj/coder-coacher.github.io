today we're very happy to have a
professor Eleanor Bokashi from whose
associate professor robotics at the
robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon
University he was on leave in 2004 at
NASA Ames where he served as the
robotics group lead he received his PhD
in computer science from Stanford
University 1996 he's co-founder of the
toy robotics initiative at the robotics
Institute at Carnegie Mellon today his
talk is on robotics and community for
learning and exploration in his talk he
will describe two major community
building projects at the toy robotics
initiative at Carnegie Mellon robotics
Institute yellow thank thank you Jeff
well thank you for coming and let's see
let me just begin and jump into it and
explain to you what I'll be doing
actually let me go back one slide first
so I'm come for the robotics Institute
and for those of you who are aware what
the references it is it's kind of
interesting it's a full-fledged
apartment in the Carnegie Mellon
University so it's a degree-granting
program just like the computer science
department language technologies
Institute and human-computer interaction
Institute and it's 70 faculty large so
there's 70 professors in just robotics
so it's a bit of an absurd place if you
find yourself in Pittsburgh you should
visit there are more robots there than
you can possibly imagine and there are
many here who can vouch for that
actually what I'm going to talk about
today are two projects that are partly
funded by Google so thank you to google
and by others and there are examples of
the direction we've been going into most
recently we have been working on
educational robotics we're really
talking about the educational value of a
robot and a person working together more
recently we've been interested in the
idea of educational robotics where in
fact it is through the glue of robotics
that we create communities of expertise
and communities of practice so we're
very interested in the idea of creating
communities of human beings where
robotics is really just a motivational
technological tool Thank You Alec we
have robots naturally a robotics talk
with unreal robots is like a fish
without a bicycle so here's two robots
so I mean it's like these two projects
let me jump right into global connection
project which is the one that has had
much more visibility thus far and so if
you've probably heard of that one
then I'll talk about telepresence robot
kit which is a new project this is the
first real public address on it and the
interesting thing is we have a major
release coming up in March where you can
actually build your own robot as part of
that so let's start with global
connection Global Connections started
with a very very feel good and
incredibly broad vision right the idea
of getting people to understand each
other better but doing it using
technology and doing it by creating
community and sharing across people of
different cultures now the place that
this came from sort of the thing that
inspired us was the work we were doing
on Mars at the time so the Mars rovers
were landing and some of the people in
my group at NASA Ames Research Center
we're actually helping the scientists
and what they noticed in helping a
scientist was that it was the images
that were drawing the scientist together
and causing really good community
building and communication across a
diverse group of scientists so in a way
images were becoming highly explorable
and very interesting phenomena for group
education and the other picture I'll
show you and before I go back two words
is kind of interesting because this is
the single most popular picture ever
taken during the Apollo missions this is
the last picture taken during Apollo
missions and the irony of course is that
this is a picture not of the moon so the
most popular picture taken during that
whole set of missions was a picture of
us and so the idea of turning the camera
inward right of being able to explore
and understand the earth itself is
something that's always been magical for
people and this was the beginning of the
global connection project the idea was
one way of and if you read Gagarin's
Diaries or if you eat Armstrong's
Diaries or just about anybody else who's
been in space from either side of the
fence what they say is that once they're
in space and the go over that the earth
they see the earth in a different light
and they feel for the oneness of the
earth and the idea that political
boundaries are somewhat transient so
what idea we had was okay so maybe we
should just fundraise and take everybody
that it makes political decisions say
and send them into space for a while
have them orbit the earth and that might
actually increase global understanding
significantly now there's a downside to
that because we computed that the amount
of carbon dioxide and ozone that you
release by doing that would accelerate
global warming
difficult Lee so that's actually a bad
idea so we can't that everybody in orbit
for a while that's a bad idea so the
next next thing is can we create
visualization tools that help people to
understand the earth better by giving
them a new more explorable view of the
earth as a whole so we wanted images to
be the center of this and we launched
three specific initiatives last year
which have paid off pretty well the
first to have paid off of really well
and I'm going to tell you about the
motivation of the bottom there by the
way I'm going to talk fast and go
through the slides quickly because I
want you to be done by 350 for obvious
reasons so first of all create content
what we wanted to do is start by having
really compelling professional content
something that people could really get
into because it's professionally done
content that they want to see throw that
in a spatial browser in a format that
they can see it and explore it and learn
more about the world through it and that
would be kind of a catalyst for learning
more second thing is we wanted to create
a technology for hyper-realistic imaging
so in a way if you think about digital
cameras and where they are going to turn
the gain weight way up on that so that
you have far better spatial resolution
for battle temporal resolution in other
words being able to go back and forth in
time and much much better dynamic range
so you can have pictures with lots of
resolution and yet the ability to see
across a very broad range of brightness
values and then third we want to start
to build specific communities and create
communities that are self-sustaining
around all of these topics of interest
so those are kind of the first three
steps and this is here because if you
think about the driver behind this
project and the other project i'll tell
you about Aristotelian passions sort of
start with imagination and creativity
the idea that what drives humans and
makes them human is to imagine and to
wonder what the world is like well
there's two kinds of imagination that
our style talks about right one is
imagination of the natural world
imagining and wondering what the world
is like and what's cool about the world
and the other one is imagination of the
creative world imagine what you could do
to the world how could you change things
how could you invent something new we're
trying to do both of these and so this
first project tries to hit on the
question of wondering about the real
world so what we want to happen to
people in the way we want communities to
build is we want people to wonder right
because you create tools that help them
become wondrous about how rich the world
is and you want them
by using those tools to explore the
world and discover things that they
didn't know before and you want them to
discover things that are so compelling
and rich and interesting that then they
feel compelled to share and so that's
kind of one trajectory to a
self-sustaining community you'll see a
different three sort of couple in the
case of the telepresence robot jet
project so the project we did long story
very short is that we talked to National
Geographic and got them excited about it
we talked to google earth or keyhole at
the time and got them excited about it
and thanks to many many many people who
said yes and helped out and provided
funding we managed to take hundreds of
articles in Africa and geocode them onto
Google Earth for Africa so that when you
spin the globe in nash in google earth
to africa and zoom in you can see little
boxes and of course when you click on
the boxes and zoom in further you can
see articles that are on National
Geographic online so those leads to
articles the other thing we did has to
do with these little red dots and this
is kind of interesting Mike Fay is an
incredible guy he's raised actually
billions of dollars for world hunger
relief now he flew a cessna 182 over
africa and collected about 90,000 images
with gps coordinates that were rough not
very good because they were coming
asynchronously off a gps receiver well
we took that data and we geocoded it as
well and a lot of that is now available
to when you zoom in on those airplanes
you'll see his pictures so you'll see
things like oh this is interesting this
is the only structure that's man-made
that is visible from space which is a
giant conveyor belt it turns out the
Great Wall is not visible in space as
those of you who know about some
websites have have found out and you'll
see things like spice trading bars where
people are actually trading spices and
looking up at the airplane wondering why
there's an airplane flying overhead and
the level of zooming is pretty pretty
astounding if you zoom into one of these
airplanes on Google Earth you'll see a
super results section within Google
Earth right that super results section
is there because our team did such a
great job of lining up the
high-resolution image with the Google
Earth satellite data and when you zoom
in of course you see really good data
like that and if those of you who've
played with this note that you can get
to the point where you can see people
carrying a baby on the pack walking with
a shadow cast by a sunset moon or sunset
sun setting sun that's the word
this is viagra stuff led to somewhere
interesting which is that the technology
that was developed to make this kind of
thing facile to not to be very useful
when you were started and talked about
disasters and so when the hurricanes
Katrina and Rita happen and again when
the earthquake happened it was a great
time and we were very lucky to be in a
position to actually take thousands of
images that were much more recent images
post disaster and overlay them onto
Google Earth and that's turned out the
revealing useful tool these are examples
of some apps that we've overlaid onto
google earth that are recent maps and
helped disaster relief workers and
logisticians in pakistan plan routes and
figure out which villages they can go to
and how and i guess there is a story I
wanted to tell about disaster aid that
very very briefly the story that's
interesting to me is that there was real
demand so federal agencies were coming
after Google and then coming after us
and saying look please do this overlay
for us and there was supply it turns out
there's a whole network of people who
wanted to be part of a community helping
with disaster relief so a lot of people
who are looking at the television during
the newspapers learning the disaster
we're reading this going i want to help
in some way how can I possibly help and
so it turns out a number of people were
actually acting as clearing houses
collecting data from various sources and
creating a fusion of data from several
sources such as a map from here and a
word description of a problem in a
specific village and then locating that
using world wind or using google earth
or any other tools and so and the last
thing but at least there was a set of
eager technology that we've noticed so
just as an example very recently we've
been approached by the biggest cell
phone company in the world and what they
say is we have and I forgot the number
now 15 million users who have video
cameras and very very high bandwidth
connections how can we make sure that
whenever there's a disaster anybody with
those cell phones can snap pictures and
overlay them automatically into your
system because we can triangulate within
10 meters using the radio towers that's
a really nice idea right and something
that we can definitely do by doing some
really interesting image image work on
the images that they snap and the
satellite images that we have so
disaster date seems to be one really
good example of community that has been
born completely asynchronously
chaotically and will definitely last now
those are all sort of detours from the
general task which was we wanted to use
images to explore but we wanted to
create tools so that images are hyper
realistic so right images to be in a way
much more realistic than they are today
so let me tell you kind of picture this
ID and then show you the results so the
idea is we want images to contain so
much information that as I showed you
that kind of Aristotelian passion
direction we want your act of looking at
the image to be filled with Wonder and
we want you to spend so much time with
the image that you discover things in
the image nobody else has seen yet so
imagine an image that's so rich that it
could do that and then we want that
discovery to be the thing that meets to
sharing the desire to share with other
people so that's what I do and the thing
that we started doing and again like
everything I'm talking about today none
of this is actually crediting me this is
all the students and other other
colleagues that i have i just get to
talk about it gigapan is this really
neat thing that meant sergeant came up
with on our team so the idea is it's two
very inexpensive stepper motors that in
a very clever way our micro step using a
very inexpensive chipset that's off the
shelf and the result of this is you can
take any old digital camera attach it to
this base and then over a USB connection
the computer and commands the USB camera
to fully zoom in optically and then take
hundreds of pictures and stitch them
together and do this many many times so
if you can put this on tripod put it
outside and do this over and over again
for the period of a year and we have
done this and what's exciting about this
is the chipset that we have the board
that we have fabbed and evaluated and
the micro stepper stepper motors and the
mechanism itself all add up to about 40
bucks now if you look at michael jones
gigapixel imager which he has two or
three of here at Google those are from
u-2 spy planes and they each cost about
twelve thousand dollars and there's very
very few of those in the world so the
idea here is this is also a good you
pixel imager it's not as high quality is
that but it's a lot less than twelve
thousand dollars and we can publish an
open recipe so that anybody can build
this and that's kind of exciting let me
show you a quick demo just to give you a
feel for what it means to have this kind
of exploitable image
so this is an example of an image that's
taken by this thing and this is pre
stitching so there is no stitching
technology yet that's run on this and
you can see that there's a lot of data
there explore ability in a sense means
that you have sort of hyper resolution
what I'm interested in is the idea that
you cannot just zoom in but you can zoom
in to a degree that's kind of unheard of
with a regular picture this happens to
be about a 1gb pixel image and so you
can really go in and see the leaves here
and you get a level of resolution it's
kind of fun so you get the idea with
that and doing that in all different
directions even in this backyard or
Randy sergeants in Palo Alto it's kind
of fun because you'll find blueberries
and such now remember i talked about
temporal resolution I want the idea that
pictures we come explorable in space but
also in time and so if i can get over
there that's see my screen i have one
little example to show you a temporal
resolution over the course of about nine
months of data well this is hard without
looking the right way and playing a
mapping game here
they're so when I show you that lemon
now let's roll back in time and so what
you're seeing is the passage of time in
reverse and you'll see the lemon become
I guess it's not called the lime
whatever you call an unripe lemon a
green lemon and it's kind of fun because
as you go through this with greater
detail with greater temporal resolution
you end up seeing some morning glory
weeds you can see the right there in the
quarter top right and then the neighbor
pulls the weed out and the leaves all
the sudden wilt you see that on the top
right anyway that's the kind of thing
where we think it gets exciting to be
able to explore and to be able to put a
camera like this into all sorts of
places you can probably imagine for
yourself several places you could put a
camera like this right now and collect
really interesting data we're working on
the stitching technology now it turns
out you need to do some stitching that's
a little unusual compared to the kind of
stitching people normally do to make
this work right mainly because we want
to work really really quickly we want
people to be able to do this with
massive amounts of data so that's the
end of a brief introduction to global
connection let me tell you what it up to
next so you know how to track this for
those of you who've been at NASA before
and there's several in the room we're at
NASA before they came here you can
appreciate how hard this is but we got a
space act agreement on this which is
kind of cool is this collaboration now
between National Geographic google
seeing you and nasa that officially
allows nasa to give us resources images
data servers and people so that's kind
of as for free one exciting thing that's
happening is we've done Africa as as you
can see if you go to Google Earth today
and spin there and by the way something
that blew us away was the idea that
Michael Jones and Allen and and Matt and
everybody on Google Earth team made it
the default layer on so so everybody
that has Google Earth immediately when
they spun to Africa could see this stuff
and we're really proud of that and
that's just a really neat thing but the
good news is that's being expanded so
you'll be able to see other parts of the
world geocoded and you'll be able to see
other kinds of data other than the
National Geographic data geocoded the
other thing we're trying to do is we're
trying to launch an inn for
international infrastructure for date
for disaster visualization it turns out
the disaster stuff has worked really
well and you know we had a period of
time where a major flood hit Pittsburgh
the building in which our server is
housed
which is serving I think a terabyte of
this data to international relief
workers now a day and it turns out that
this was a big problem because we start
getting phone calls from Pakistan and
that comes kind of eat right because
that sounds okay they're actually using
this stuff so now we're going to go
after the idea of creating
infrastructure for this kinda zasto
visualization the exciting thing we're
doing is hopefully in about three months
is we're going to do an open recipe
release of gigapan so that you can build
one so the list of digital cameras that
are supported all the source code will
be there for the driving it and the
stitching software and the directions
for how to build yourself one by going
and buying parts from various hardware
stores then we're going to give a bunch
of geeky pants to photographers we
actually have a bunch of yoga pants
right now we have 15 or building 50 more
so if you're a professional photographer
and you want a big event up to me and
then we're going to create a bunch of
different themed activities that create
focused communities just like the
disaster relief community that's global
connection now let me tell you about the
other projects and what you're going to
see is how the other project is kind of
a compliments to that project that
project is about wonder and discovery of
the natural world in a way and cultures
in the natural world this project is
about invention and here's why we're
doing this project the problem that
exists first of all this is kind of neat
science and engineering Ramones are
dropping in the US and only in the u.s.
so welcome to the one place in the world
where a science and engineering or
becoming less desirable every year and
this is for real the data here by the
way is from a CR and from the Girl
Scouts national report which is an
excellent and document and from the CRA
recent report now there's a women
problem in the US as you may be aware we
have a very small proportion of women in
technology engineering fields and in
fact in CS they're actually decreasing
so this is interesting this is one of
the only areas in engineering where the
amount of participation for women is
going down and what happens I'll let you
read this yourself but what happens in
narrative form is that some of the
analysis that's been done in this area
indicates the following concept is that
women are really excited about
technology in so far as technology is a
tool for something that they deeply care
about men seem to be satisfied often
this is a rash stereotyping of course
man seems to be stereotyped
stereotypically happy to
and create technology for the sake of
the technology itself and so a lot of
time what will happen is in middle
school women are actually perfectly
happy using technology such as instant
messaging and blogging but by the time
you get to high school they're asking
about what is this for if I'm going to
take intro to CS why bother with intro
to CS what kind of tool is that for the
things I care about and so what we've
been working on as an idea that in fact
what you need is the ability to create a
sense of purpose for the technology and
robotics turns out to be really nice way
to do that because the concrete grounded
object which you can actually program to
do interesting physical things with you
it can interact with your sister can
interact with your brother it can take
environmental readings for your report
on the pollution levels over the course
of the day so two sensing an actuation
device and when I say robot I mean much
more than a Mars rover like device but
in fact any device that sensors from the
real world and actuates into the real
world again so we've done a lot of
testing now we've got more than 200,000
children using these robots at museums
across the world and the results of
those testings have been somewhat
promising the things we've seen that are
interesting in class work with these
kinds of robots as gender attention
we're having people come in with
statistically significant reports of
lack of confidence in using computers
and the rate at which they increase
their confidence in using computers is
statistically significantly higher than
the men why is this happening you might
ask well what's happening and this is
kind of funny but in many of these
courses the women are programming the
robot to do a task such as navigating
the building and getting somewhere and
delivering message to somebody well the
way they do it is they talk as a team
good at talking they come up with
solution they run it and as it fails
they run it again and they look at it
and I scratch their heads and psycho
analyze the situation and do better
because they understand how the robot is
interacting with this complex real-time
world the real world what do the boys do
well they program the robot together
they run it and as soon as it turns the
wrong direction and crashes into
something they stop it and change the
color in three places and then run it
again so they just keep trying to change
the code to see what will happen and
although this may work for simple
computer programming assignments it
doesn't work in robotics because the
system is too complex and too deeply
embedded in the physical world and so
observation and the ability to take on
the robots point of view turn out to be
incredibly important so
this is not really gender specific and
the point is that you want everybody who
doesn't have a sense of empowerment over
technology to feel much more empowered
toward technology but having said that
just looking at statistical analysis of
words when we interview people and have
them at tell us what do you expect to
learn this week when you ask them this
question and say your computer science
robotics class they report programming a
mechanism which makes a lot of sense
after all robots are computational
systems programming and mechanism week
after week if you ask them what things
they learned that week and code that
what you get is teamwork problem-solving
identification of technology robot point
of view far far higher ratings than you
originally would have expected this is
exciting because this means that there
are lifelong learning lessons that have
are to be had in interacting with this
particular robotic complex system and so
it's much more than just learning how to
use a robot it's it's about learning how
a complex system works and learning how
to put yourself in this point of view so
that's the introduction what we're doing
with Turk I'm doing good ok we're doing
with kurt Turk is trying to create a new
way for throughout the educational
pipeline middle school high school
community college college and adult a
new way for people to be creative with
embedded technologies so we want you to
be able to dream up something that you
want a system to do that has sensors and
actuators and to be able to build it
with great ease we want to be really
easy for you to build this thing and
realize your vision and then share it
with others so it's about community
building but it's also about you being
able to do some absurdly cool creative
things that you can't do today unless
you know a whole lot about thick
programming and about sensors and about
how to connect something to the internet
say so if you think about the
Aristotelian passions what we're getting
at is the complement of wonder ingenuity
and ingenuity of the root of engineer is
all about the idea that you start with
creativity you start with the idea that
I want to do something different to them
but I can do today and so first of all I
need to give you an intuition for what's
possible what could you do that's
creative and different from what you can
do today then I want you to be able to
actually realize it so it has to be easy
enough to use you can actually build it
and then share it and so what we're
expecting is you can create a different
kind of come
now in a way this is like saying we want
to create the ultimate Lego Mindstorms
kit yes like oh my sims just announced a
new kit and it has the same problems the
old kid hat it doesn't have vision they
can't see the world and it's not
wireless so what we really want to do we
want to create a Lego Mindstorms
that you can build with but you're not
building out of Legos you're building
out of stuff that can last so if you
want to make something that lasts all
week or all month you can and we want to
have vision we want to see the world and
react to the world appropriately and we
wanted it to not have a ceiling want you
to be able to get as sophisticated as
you want on it so this is a very very
ambitious goal and there's a lot of
thrusts in this work and so we have very
large consortium of funders and people
who work with us honest the first thing
we've been doing for a long time now is
a national survey of computer science
one courses actually 0 and 1 courses
across the u.s. and a survey all the
textbooks that are used or rather the
top 15 textbooks that are used in intro
to CS another thing we're doing is
developing a new kind of electronics
package that the project's called twerk
so naturally the electronics package is
called quark the electronics package is
actually about to be released so that's
something to spend a lot of time telling
you about another thing we're doing is
creating a reference design library it's
a set of recipes like a cookbook on the
web the recipes are step-by-step
instructions for how you can buy
off-the-shelf parts of places like Home
Depot and in about four to five hours
build a robot it's a series of recipes
that are reference design so that once
you've done two or three of these you
can be very creative and feel empowered
about building any kind or about you
want again the word robot is used
loosely here I mean any device that
sends us from the physical world and
actually it's based on that and we're
doing a lot of curriculum design and
then pilots throughout the educational
pipeline across the country so the
national survey just to show you a feel
of spread those are the schools across
the country that we're surveying in
terms of recipes we're doing a lot of
different recipes right now we're doing
test builds of students of CMU so we're
taking students who don't have
mechanical aptitude and having them
actually built the robots and we're
having them build this robot right now
which is the base of a large fingered
robot that's about human human height
robot it's fun to have them build these
kinds of robots because we do interviews
with them along the way and what we're
discovering which is exciting is it
during this five hour project of
building using just hand tools
actually going from a I'm not sure I can
build this I've never built something
before two at about our 2.5 this is fun
I wonder if I could build something else
that uses this mechanism and that's in
such way that's exactly we're going to
see and luckily we're seeing that really
really simple for those mechana
mechanical people amongst you for
instance you want the gear train to be
easy but you want to teach people
something about mechanical elegance and
simplicity so it's a friction drive
mechanism their motors that have an
eccentric axis so you just put a hole in
a piece of wood and not by spinning the
motor you can offset the axis exactly
the right amount to get the right thrust
against the wheel so really simple
things like that now let me tell you
about the controller and this is the
latter part of the talk I'm just trying
to finish early so that before 350
people can actually ask some questions
so the challenge and this is the hardest
part okay just be clear curriculum is
really hard putting this into the
pipeline is hard but the good news is we
have friends across the world that are
interested in this kind of thing if you
could pull it off but how do you build a
really affordable processor you want it
to be 32-bit you wanted to have floating
point so you can do lots of cool things
on it you want it to be Wireless find
out the about the about the boot and you
want to have a webcam on it obviously
you want digital analog inputs and
outputs now it gets a little tricky we
want you to be able to take any motor
and hook it up to the system so that
means it's not good enough for you to
have to use a pitman motor this one
hundred and twenty dollars of the
special encoder we want you to be able
to buy a drill from Home Depot take the
motor out and just use it as is no
encoder and that's possible using
something called back EMF that we've
been working on we want you to be able
to control lots of servos so that you
can make a face if you want to and have
the face smile or a multi-legged
intersected walks and we want the thing
to be incredibly power efficient so that
it lasts for 12 to 15 hours on a charge
okay anyone to be about a hundred
dollars bill of materials so that's the
goal one way you could go about this as
you could say okay cool we're going to
use sort of a commercial off-the-shelf
approach of a mini-itx sort of an
embedded pc the problem with that
approach is that's not a robot
controller that's just a pc so even if
you do this and you have your me
TX you still don't have analog inputs
and outputs all done you can't control
the servos without putting massive
numbers of timers on this thing you sure
i don't have the vacuum of control or
the power switching regulation system or
the MOSFETs that amplify for the motors
so you're missing a whole bunch of
things that allow your box to connect to
the physical world and that's the part
we care about so first of all I'm gonna
argue an arm is much more attractive
than this mini-itx kind of solution it
turns out arm nine core is very good
they can run Linux the entire arm line
solution we have is fifty dollars so
that's an online running linux with
everything else that you need except for
the robot input and output and it
consumes far less power than the ITX so
the idea of running all day is entirely
possible but you silly di o it arm is
the processor in cell phones it's a
microprocessor so yes
we are assuming that maybe we'll have
laptops we want the robot but they have
their laptop on it so I'm like evolution
we don't want you to risk your laptop on
your robot we want to roll it so cheap
that it can talk to your laptop and
nvidia else's laptop in fact let me spin
you the story of how you use this I
didn't say this part in this parts kind
of important so here's how the average
person hears how Alec will build his
first robot she will go to the website
and there's a choice amongst some
recipes he'll order one of these black
boxes this costs about two hundred
dollars retail if you order the black
box throw the website get the recipe
build it takes about four hours once
he's built the recipe he plugs in plug
into the into the black box turns it on
once he turns it on green light comes on
on the black box and at this point he
goes to a web browser and goes to our
website at seeing you and he can now see
his robot from controller he can write
iconic program for it or he can just
drive it around till out tello
operationally so the idea is that in
fact the thing is on the internet but is
using a micro president that's very low
power much much less much longer than
your laptop well but you can talk to
from any computer anywhere so that's
that's the goal and it's pretty exciting
it connects to pull that off well let me
jump to the solution what robots really
need in a way is something that can do
the closed-loop motor control something
they can deal with the power management
and the problem is when you think about
what a robot does and what a robot
contains the mistake people make is
often they end up doing a lot of what
could be done in Hardware in software
for the robots sake and this is
unnecessary and expensive so the
solution we propose is use an online
which is much less powerful in the mini
ITX and you add a robot ASIC now what's
a robot basic what's a great ASIC for
robot the answer the thing that is
interesting about robotics is that we
can use something that is really
customizable as you reconfigure the
robot so you don't want an ASIC for a
standard robot but rather something they
can customize to any robot that you
build so our solutions in FPGA so a
proposal is in fact if you can have an
FPGA that implements all the robot
specific options and
is the thing that you in real time can
reconfigure as you need to as we change
the number of motor than your robot say
then you have incredible flexibility and
it's about five bucks in quantity so
very very cheap in fact better than that
xilinx has donated them all to me so I
have a lot of it silex FPGAs and just to
show an example this is something that
which Allah granted at charmed labs with
with my help and this is the launching
up and what we did this was the game boy
robot controller chip that had a gameboy
processor and you an ex pc and you
plugged in an fpga into the gameboy the
fpga took care of all the robot I own so
it had to watch dog timer as it did the
the servo controllers and it had the you
arts bluetooth interface all those good
things all on the fpga what we're doing
is this and the good news i can report
today's this is actually working now so
i'll show you how much of it is working
but as an arm nine with floating point
it's got the 300,000 gate fpga from site
links it's got USB 2.0 Wi-Fi webcam is a
kind of a story that's worth telling
Wi-Fi is easy there's several lunatics
patches that make Wi-Fi work just fine
on our arm9 webcams is a tough one if
we're get the recipes on the web right
we want the recipe to say you can use
any of these five webcams but if you
look at the webcams on sourceforge that
there are patches for for linux they're
all webcams at our end of life because
get that min around awhile so people
could actually hack them so we talked a
logitech and we got from logitech copies
of the cameras they haven't salt yet so
these are next to his cameras logitech
well this year now is 2006 so they'll be
on marketing company couple months so we
got these from logitech last month and
then we found one of the hackers that
very nice guy me michelle's are in
france and so he agreed to roll the
patch for us for these webcams so we
gave him the webcams gave in the process
of work and he rolled the patch for us
which is really kind of a neat story of
collaboration across the ocean and
there's lots of other good stuff on this
it does mp3 of course got to do that
these days it's got 12 min analog inputs
it controls 16 servos it has a switching
power supply into which you can plug in
any number of radio
7.2 volt battery packs and it switches
between them appropriately for the
motors and everything else and right now
we're at about one hundred and twelve
dollars the limit serials so that's
exciting and that includes enclose your
manufacturer it's got temperature
sensing it's also got current size
amount every line through the FPGA so we
can tell exactly how much Kurt is being
drawn what motor which is really fun so
as of last week it's running to 68 we've
got Vince yet back EMF working with 12
and 24 volt motors be right with you and
we got wireless up and running so we're
very close and that's kind of an
exciting point because if you can get
this thing if it's only a hundred and
ten pm and if rich agrees to sell it for
about 2 X so if you can get this out the
door for let's say two hundred and fifty
dollars then that means you're behind
something for two hundred fifty dollars
that once our firmware is done you can
literally build various robots plugging
all the wires turn it on and now go to a
wireless connection and talk to it and
what's more it can do vision on board so
you can really have a kind of an
intelligent robot the question
you can do it you can do it right when
the other night if you configure right
there so here's the next steps on Turk
there's going to be a tech report this
month on the intro to CS curriculum
evaluation and the good news by the way
on the textbook and on the teachers that
we've interviewed is that they all seem
to agree and recognize that introduced
es sucks and that they want to change
and that they change textbooks have a
couple of years so changing isn't
particularly hard bureaucratically
speaking in fact as an interesting thing
that they point out they themselves
point out they say well our exercises
are things like write the Fibonacci
sequence right 99 bottles of beer on the
wall and our students don't seem to
connect to these especially the women
and we go huh that's exactly what a Girl
Scout report says ensure the cs
assignments which are so incredibly
abstract are not that exciting for
people and i find that stunning that so
many of the assignments are like this in
some of the textbooks i see when in fact
we have the internets we have sound we
have light we have so many interesting
ways to imagine writing introduced es
assignments to connect your process to
the outside world and read interesting
values we're doing a Chatham College
deployment this month will be at 6c
we're running a workshop and the birds
of a feather seminar there so we'll be
introducing this to a whole lot of
computer science professionals there the
public release is in March so hopefully
in March if you go to the Turk website
you'll be able to download code and
download a recipe and go to your local
home depot and build one home depot is a
group we're talking to you right now
because they want to be one of the
sponsors to they'd like to make kiosks
in Home Depot where they accumulate all
the various parts from Home Depot that
you need to build one of several robots
it's only kind of fun because you can go
there and buy all the parts and Bob's
your uncle will great also be running
the Grace Hopper Saturday workshop so if
you're going to the enemy's aboard
foundations Grace Hopper series will be
there and we'll be doing a full clinic
on this and giving away Turks there as
well and then we'll be launching at five
schools in September and we already are
running curriculum it's at Columbia CMU
and Verona Carl DeSalvo is an
interesting fellow he's in robotics an
art guy he's going to be going to art
workshops art as you may know our
serious early adopters
technology and so the art community is
really excited in this kind of thing
because you can imagine what they can do
with something that's internet-connected
and controls all their motors buzzing
and last but not least I'll tell you
very briefly about these two things
they're in brackets because we're still
in the middle of getting funding for
those the good news is the rest will
happen so we have enough funding for it
but those two are interesting if you
look at what 60 seconds if you look at
what girls undergo in middle school
versus high school in middle school it's
about identity of self so they're really
interesting the question of who am i and
in fact journal writing and blogging are
somewhere that people put a lot of
emphasis if you look at high school it's
my identity with respect to my community
how can I be a member of a friend group
and how come my friend group have impact
on something I care about like the
environment like politics so we're doing
for middle school girls in 10 seconds is
we're creating a robot diary system so
it's a set of recipes for home depot
that build a robotic flower as you write
your blog or journal the emotional
content causes your flower to do various
kinds of choreographed dances play music
and do light shows and you can share
this with your friends you design all
the choreography and you design how it
shares with your friends so that they
can see how you feel today for high
school we're doing a sensor net programs
so the same black box becomes a sensor
that reads carbon dioxide ozone a number
of other fluids and you connect these in
a network in a city and your challenge
not only diffuse the data together but
to create public pieces of art that are
kinetic sculptures that demonstrate to
the public what's going on with
environmental quality in their area so
that's kind of a fun idea too so the
last slide is to thank you slide all the
real work on global connection is done
by Randy sergeant and company all the
real work on Turk is done by Emily
hammering company and we have a lot of
collaborators right now around the
country and the funding as you can see
comes from diverse sources and keeps
growing which is great for us ok thank
you for your attention you have two
minutes before 350 and you're welcome to
ask questions now
thank you I forgot to tell you one very
important thing March is when the Turk
gets released before march these are
here now these are personal exploration
Rovers that are programmable in the same
way the Turk will be programmable so if
you want to program a robot for any
reason whatsoever these have cameras on
them they have range finders they move
four times faster than the Mars rovers
on Mars so they even faster than those
robots these are her turbo is
technically speaking we provided them
here today fancy so he had access to
them here and if you want to program a
robot just email me and we'll get you
set up with one of these and you can
program away you can take it home and
program at all you watch and it has
wireless on board everything so you're
free food use these they're on
indefinite loan to Google yes
will be available in marches you'll be
able to buy the controllers from Charlie
laughs calm and probably a couple other
companies you will be able to go at
download recipes that show you what
parts to buy to build robots and I will
be at least three recipes are robotic
flower which is kind of a desk art piece
the quick bot which is very simple robot
enclosure that fits onto the processor
itself so the process it becomes a
desktop robot with a camera on top of it
and Shen bot which is a tallish robot
with a prismatic arm they can push
buttons in the elevator so you can use
an elevator when you're not there a very
useful thing to do right with a large
large two-wheel platform on the bottom
that's a more of a human walking speed
cell robot we are so our litmus test was
we want a robot that's good enough they
can use an elevator because that
required simple manipulation and vision
and if you can tell operate it and do
that that's kind of fun right because
you can travel around and visit people
when you're not there
I can build 40 of these at a time for a
hundred and sixty thousand dollars so
these are much more expensive it is
2,000 bucks apiece when 4,000 bucks
apiece this is the problem with robotics
in general robots that are sophisticated
cost a whole lot the amazing thing is
the quark bot parts will cost you 80
bucks plus the board which will cost you
about 250 bucks and yet it's got vision
it's wirelessly connected to the outside
world so it's because of the arm nine
and because of the fpga that we're
achieving such a price these have a
Stargate processor in them the Intel
gave us for free so it will give us 160
circuit processors that's why these
exists but thats target processor is a
it's an arm it's a it's an arm core but
that start getting more alone which you
can buy from crossbow costs I think nine
hundred dollars and that's without the
power modulation and of course that's
just a board it doesn't have the robot
stuff on it right it doesn't have circle
control or motor control
once there they claimed at this time
around they're not going to be secret
Ligety open right if they give us an
open architecture I will make this
compatible right away because it's a no
writer that way people can also build
out of Lego and control it from the
quark controller instead of the Lego
Mindstorms controller
yeah basically put your leg over a lot
on the web with camera
this
there's one good would be found there's
actually two because one is called
something like a hands-on approach to
cso one it's by to researchers at Sun we
put it together they write it a million
books together this was the best one one
thing we're leaders have pushed them and
see if they're willing to run a new
version with Turk in their book or on a
companion black life but even if you
don't do that we're going to be doing is
publishing on the web a series of
exercises that go with various CSL one
looks so we've looked at the modules it
exists it turns out intellectually the
presentation materials pretty consistent
so we can very easily come in in a
surgical way and propose certain
exercises with Turk along the way that
we think you can get a much more
exciting class especially food
we've considered it we want to start
with something surgical and then if it
catches on good evaluation results with
our educational board then yeah we're
going to
but we should find a salad entree do
with that that's the missus vinegar
