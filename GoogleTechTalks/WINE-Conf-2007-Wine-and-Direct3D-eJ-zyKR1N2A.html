rendering was looking quite nice and
even most any games are still in still
on the youth debt and last year we had
some direct to the it support shader
model 1 dot x that that work sometimes
sometimes it fails and support for
shader model 2 and 3 was starting and
also support for glsl shaders done so it
should Tamara Voss what was done
you
hello good so shada sup an improvement
and cleanup of the state management
which also dead by last year we set each
state pretty much every drawer so the
program the game called that did at roll
call and we just reset everything and
nowadays we only set the change state
recent in the recent weeks Roderick has
what at the hour types who decodes two
windows I will outline its dead later
why this was done and how it works and
we also have better support for Mike
McCoy's nowadays I call it up what it's
not really a port but support for this
bedroom is much better we have
multi-threaded drawing support now and a
few extra features were added also we
had this tire to do some that will
attend some of code project I will uh di
will go into detail here later also
already mentioned by the I know six
Tests doc we have some better automated
testing now for performance and also to
the test in wine itself improved and we
have support for accelerated to the--to
the drawing of open shell know so some
details some new features shown with the
games they use them this is a screenshot
of FF 2 episode 1 and the high dynamic
range rendering enabled and what you can
see what is in use here are floating
point textures support for the high-end
filtered o'shea ders gamma corrected
textures and chemical acted color a
frame buffer writing and also off-screen
rendering with frame buffer objects the
game runs a exception of a small fuck
back it isn't visibly nerd screenshot
the game runs array knows correctly but
it is it is still quite slow it isn't
really fast
windows ADA but it's some ten frames per
second on a high end system admit the
medium class system now it is it used up
your high didn't system last year hmm
here you can see the high dynamic range
when the ring quite nice actually the
projectors it works better on a real
monitor and head anemic range images
can't be taught properly in standing
screenshots a part of it is how the
lightning changes when you move from
bright areas to dark areas but it can be
seen pretty nice this is a pretty old
game it's a creditor game I started
hacking online for and it uses a
different bit to draw the mouse pointer
and this sort of this works a bit better
it just works now more or less it still
runs into driver packs on ati cards and
in some runs into trader pattinson
nvidia cards but the game still isn't
variable although i hacked online for
two years now because the drawing of the
text is very very slow and probably you
changed my priorities a bit this is
Supreme Commander and featured uses is
instancing this allows the game to draw
multiple it draw it allows the droids
but it uses it for the units it draws
five or ten units with one draw call and
it gives quite a bit of improvement in
Windows we only emulate it because
instancing isn't really needed in that
way an open shell because draw cores are
much cheaper and open Sheldon on Windows
but it gives a bit of improvement to so
unfortunately I when I caught the
screenshots or unit so I gun again just
shut down so this screenshot has a
demonstrate instancing really but the
game uses it this is a hdmi from nvidia
it uses it about the vertex shader reach
the texture and this is a feature which
isn't even available on high-end windows
boxes on or ati cards do not support it
so it is a really optional feature but
Henry has implemented support for it and
it works quite nice so this is just a
vertex texture fetch it this is a
texture it drained us in off-screen in a
graphics card and it reads it in the
vertex shader classically textures we
only use in a pixel pipeline which are
done well Pixar by pixel on the screen
and here it can they sent what is it
what is essentially does is that you can
that the game can do something on the
graphics cuts toyed and use the
generated data in the vertex shader so
it can generate some data and put it
high up into the pipeline and use it on
all the process down again this is the
Volta so this is a halogen high dynamic
is it the genomic geometry so they need
you see it when the game runs to the
water waves are simulated i don't i can
run it here but not pretty well on this
resolution i'll try later or Henry runs
it may be a stupid so it's used by the
new directives night Eric extend games
is disused Bioshock kind Unreal Engine 3
but it isn't even supported on all
windows cards Oh the game is slower
admitted some traffic's what is slower
but it it runs without even but it is oh
it is quite him it gets quite important
i wrote x10 later this is a even much
older game i think this game is sold 10
years older but it shows how to
accelerate the direct draw
which mine used to have a long time back
the direct memory access but it was
removed from linux distributions due to
security concerns so basically if you
had this enabled the root pass what it's
like giving your root password to
everyone enabling the game direct access
to the whole memory and this is drawn
using OpenGL and totally corn brenda is
done quite a bit of work on it was it
and the nice thing about the director of
work is that it was essentially the
start of direct extent work to do to the
way he changed the texture upload which
uses the directivity 10 memory model
more or less this is commanding conquer
3 nothing special really about this game
but we had a pretty nice success with it
because when it hit the stores it ran
from day one without any extra patches
so it was a shiny new game that just ran
without any modifications to mine uh
there are a few minor flaws and there
were a few regressions later but ok copy
protection possibly but I don't stuff
this no it's I don't think you how did
you run it yeah ok so the usual way to
get past it the only one that used the
juices to work combined and this is a f1
yield came approximately and it also
uses quite a few not advanced features
and it looks quite nice elected in my
opinion settlers to was one of the games
that start to take i started to play
computer games with yeah yeah so I don't
have any comparisons creatures of the
oldsters game that is 15 yards no I
think Apple aided in 1996 then 10 years
I think somebody I remember 1984 but I'm
not sure it's a tall skim so not really
interested in irvine and now have some
screenshots of really shiny new games
one month old but take them with a grain
of salt so they do not it doesn't work
properly well but what is bioshock it
starts it crashes on many computers it
pressures on just hard kernel panics
more or less my laptop go to a graphics
driver back and it is it is said to run
pretty bad on windows too but anna
statues for got it running on this
computer no kernel panic there and it
rains slow but it rained out pretty I
don't know how it's supposed to look
like on Windows but it looks pretty nice
on wine too and for this really cool
about this too is that from Terry 2g
point of view I only had to put one a
one-line hiking or get it started and it
pretty much worked out of the box
without the head so an a new game that
is one month old so it pretty much it
that's quite nice already you see in a
that's worked a few fix me scrolling
around so it's not perfect yet and it's
pretty slow but I think it's a quite
nice success this is a screenshot my
some of code student sent me the main
menu isn't really interesting but he
says the game fails later due to network
stuff it just fails to connect to the
server but it starts up at least crisis
is more letter factory successor
but we're working on the now but it's
kind of really hard to get good output
from users on that is there what will
they install the new update and it works
with those kind of funny patches I'd
right so one of those without yeah I
know all that stuff yeah they may I
think what it renders here isn't really
interesting once we get in game we will
have lots of failures on the under
graphics side so it would be really
surprised if it runs properly so after
showing some screenshots but yeah so the
non screenshot stuff is like we have the
reported type CD code to windows and the
motivation of this vast to test it as a
separate component and split it up from
problems in the rest of the vine code
and it also allows us to verify it
against the conformance test from
Microsoft foreign part having this as a
windows program I'll be up in this code
is it is a legal requirement and they
said the kinky requirement to because we
need a reference rasterizer running and
it does this will never work in wine
because the interface is not documented
and mine is ready now uses our OpenGL
the open shell interface implemented in
vine so it uses which edges which L
instead of glx directly this will allow
us later to add support for the
appropriate library and there are some
if def tricks in the headers and the
codes to avoid the performance penalty
of going through open shell of tiny
thanks functions which are just call the
library so it binded to the users which
I'll to set up the frame buffer entered
stuff but it later on calls directly
to the Linux code so we had today we
have texture abstraction layer without
any performance ballad penalty I
mentioned a necklace but it isn't there
it is in a real part really because it
it just works with the next to other but
I have added a support for a few micro
specific extensions for one part to work
around bugs in the code but we also get
a few advanced there are few advanced of
this so there's a one feature the event
queries which we implement with dead and
so on and also I got rid of a few linux
specific assumptions in the code when
the coach was just written for one
platform and thanks for hard-coded that
shouldn't be hard coded and there will
be much more work needed partly from a
bus maybe but also apple should fix ya
drivers so f1 driver this is the
cheapest eight driver and my question i
just described it if the word hopeless
so yeah a lot of fun with this stuff
also we have the testing was already
mentioned it's mainly for performance
and this is a picture generated from a
heck a PHP script it I have a computer
running through gmat tests every day
every day or whenever done it on there
was a you to skip during some time and
we also devote some performance relation
which I have to find an investigate but
basically we get a nice graph how the
performance develops and it should stay
at least on the same level and not go
downwards and preferably increase so the
problem if the test is that I've started
them and once ahead then working some
sort of just clues lost interests ok it
works so move on to the next program but
someone I think I've
so that it is to move all of this over
to CX test instead of my hickie script
and get someone test at data and you
also need many more games to test if
just to the map 2000 isn't really
interest isn't really conclusive so yeah
the direct3d some of code project us
number and the scotch and I'm not
entirely happy with the results so the
idea was to start the fundamental of
type 2 d 10 this neither of us knew
diversity header then a stop library
just to have the function entry points
there and what we also wanted to do is
to add is to make sure that debugging is
starting for debugging support said it's
mainly just traced lines which write out
the function halls and the parameter
names because stab to the eight and nine
have a big problem there mind if Rudy
can write the stuff out but debugging a
tie to the eight and nine is quite nice
because we only get the call to the
application does and we don't have all
the garbage that mind it would be
internal causes so we have a application
voice this was mine called debug there
so we have to head up and was his
witness the thank you sent it to find
every yesterday and I have to room
review it when I'm back and what was
also part of the of the sum of code
project which wasn't which isn't done
yet is writing some initial tests just
to show that we can compile a direct
5010 application the deprecation runs on
Windows and that our primitive
application runs on wines that we just
enjoy okay at least it's working for
primitive thing and that's that mainly
the DVD tender dll library and you have
also seen a few preparations
for direct3d 10 in 10 30 so direct
direct role stuff the problematic draw
is that we have fit it's soft
accelerated mainly it runs on any same a
recent computer but at higher
resolutions only with low framerate so
the edgy was always to move some of the
work into OpenGL and the nice side the
main problem with director orange to
debug is that applications just load
loads and loads of beta and we used some
we needed something more efficient than
the plane open shell functions so how
did I people use pics above objects
weight and the nice side effect is the
pixel before checked allow us to
implement the type to retain memory
management model where a vertex buffer
and a texture essentially the same thing
or less and what we hope to do is to
provide how to accelerate the director
on windows vista because microsoft
removes hard to acceleration there and
some games are slower than they should
be a word about the game performance we
have nowadays is that perspective
formats depends on two main factors one
is the driver so when you have an idea i
can't forget about the performance
although i hope the new driver gets
better and the other thing is the
application behavior if an application
is rude to us then we run at a few
frames per second only if it is nice we
get up there up to eighty percent of
windows performance is realistic in a
nice application some games are fast
faster than windows but the only one I
have seen so far was half left one and
with that runs on five hundred frames
per second of 100 is pretty irrelevant
but 75% of Windows performance are
realistic
and yeah but yeah yet the memory
management is much better but from a
graphics point of view where the fuck
off is still noticeably slower but they
have to add that windows drivers have a
huge game database where they play
application specific performance cheats
some some some optimizations but some
things are plain sheets where they lower
their graphics quality that is rendered
so they gain a few more frames per
second because usually gamers only see
oh nice frame rate I have everything to
and on but that the graphics ever just
doesn't honor the nice graphics options
they don't see it so like on vine we
have people who say oh nice I have eight
times full screen anti-aliasing it works
nice nice performance but the
tantalizing just doesn't work on wine
it's just ignore what many people don't
see that so graphics drivers cheat in
that regard we have a few performance
kill a few known performance killers and
we have I'll try to swim try to sort
them out in the future but some of them
are pretty hearts like yet to see which
kills my empire earth game just started
taking online for and there I made sure
some of them have really mature major
issues when we try to map tired Judy to
OpenGL so now what do we want to do in
the future of 41 touch continue to work
on directdraw to get a proper director
performance in old games and old
computers so it's in the best case I
want to be able to play a 12 year old
game on red field area of course the
game age of empires 2 runs on two days
satya although it's still slow but
preferably I want to run it on
the heart rate it was usual when the
game shipped also find if you need
stabilization and clean up in a few
parts and a big project will be directly
to 10 direct stabilization is mainly
debug the drivers find the packs and
report them to the driver vendors and if
you do not respond find a heckuva to
work around or just tell you so to get a
better driver so the problem is that
only nvidia cards work on Windows and
Linux really and we have major problems
with ati driver and mac OS is a hit or
miss thing too and i can i do not know
how the int'l drivers perform with fine
so I have some yeah I've never taste
I've never played with them myself may
our Foreman part due to the lack of time
and I don't have any hard we are
standing in a room with that so if I
want to test it i can just go to
university and STTR but I've never done
so so far yeah I card for this so we
don't have much failure failure reports
about them and there aren't a very very
few back reports for clothes over two so
they might work quite well or the cards
are just used really for gaming because
they are slow but the work for a simple
game so i came to chant
graphics-intensive so stuff like Vetrov
try vocal tree looks quite nice with
them but Bioshock rather not and we have
a yeah EF a huge number of peril eight
packs and usually people say a TI scales
given the driver doesn't work but I have
found that the three cases of bugs some
of them are in value 13 just specific
code paths of
of wine which just which are only used
on ati cards sometimes we abuse nvidia
bugs where the nvidia driver doesn't
complain about in kiev actuators where
other drivers say a it's a problem
that's a problem in here and some
problems are really a plane driver bugs
and they have you Alec cleanups needed
blue like the xserver looking is pretty
messed up it was abused for a long time
for synchronization of internal data
structures and parts of the cold cold
chilly I functions while holding the
lock and dead-looking am a different
application so we need some clean up
there the blends for directivity then
are too did the first question without
to detain is when we wanted because
starting to actually then now somewhat
collides with divine 10 blends so
perhaps will just delay this plant but
there's one thing about when we have a
direct will attend implementation we can
provide directory then support on
windows XP and Windows versions and I
think this would have quite a bit of an
impact so we should discuss me what this
could cause it could just be what but it
could also make game vendors compact us
and help us to improve the director did
support for game windows take our code
and heck around bucks we have in there
and this would mess up the whole
activity stuff pretty much because think
but when games are paki because they
work around parts in our application
then also Microsoft can't really who are
completely change title 2d because they
have the game bugs and when they changed
echoed they break the games so its
application what would happen if we have
directed attend in say no for months
although i think four months is only
realistic way if i start working on it
now and i work full time on it
because we need the terrace wall at the
external interface of minority has to be
changed a bit to reflect the changes in
direct3d 10 and we need a shader compile
and trader sampler and we need to add
support for marche de instructions and
at some point we should look how to deal
with opengl three although the problem
of open carry is that the interface
isn't finalized yet so we don't really
know what it will look like so i don't
know if we in the worst case we just
have to reach that or whether than you
find in 3d for the new opengl functions
but i think it should be possible
without major problems to just use as
object orientated inheritance future the
wine if it is object oriented so we have
the base class which does the management
in an opengl peg open shell to pack and
open shell three back end and the
abstraction layers are there they are
there already so it would it won't even
add a performance penalty so it is a
dimension of questions when do we start
this so what some problems which we
expect one dose discussed already the
documentation of diuretics but I think
we just continue the way we used to do
it now and just find games that are
broken find out five idea broken and
then write tests we did that for years
so we can continue it that way and also
we always miss our self our deadlines
which we would like to F so it all takes
more time than we hope initially there
is a huge problem in in divine co-op
with with games it isn't a delta T
specific specific but just it it applies
to all games essentially I don't know
all the details so Alexandra
have my infant will know that bed
toasted better but basically vine blocks
a huge range of the four gigabyte
address range of a 32-bit process this
is to load the building libraries to a
specific address and in the end only
about 500 megabytes think it's right ok
but only a pretty small address range is
available to the Linux libraries to
allocate memory and many drivers are
just mmm apt with your memory into the
address space of the application and
then run out of well Phaedra space and
in the end we end up with a limitation
of 100 to 200 to 300 megabytes of video
memory depending on the application and
the driver and this problem are already
affection ati drivers quite badly which
is when you run a game on a on an ati
card a complex game like with the
photographed it just freezes the whole
computer summon this because the driver
runs out of address space doesn't check
the result and then get some exception
somewhere and freezes the XO and dead
and mac OS has that problem on mac OS we
have a bachelor work around the GL apple
can torture George extension which
allows 9030 to take over part of the
memory management so we can move the
texture pick up out of the rather
limited address range to this available
to the driver and a proper fix we don't
owe any really Alexandra says that one
fix might be to write our own dynamic
linker for linux libraries so we can
just keep all the memory free and load
the libraries ourselves to the address
we want them but it's all it's a bit
it's a pretty bad problem
yeah uh depends on the driver the
extension like client storage yet the
problem is that can store only fixes
half of the thing because usually when
you create an xti a texture in opengl
then the texture memory is used twice
once for mapping the video memory and
storing it in the graphics card and once
the driver keeps a backup of it in in a
system memory so it need video memories
rather limited and if it has to update a
new texture it just H still he'll step
back up and it doesn't lose the texture
it entirely and with care and storage
people relate the paralympic
implementation with the memory for the
backup so we we fix have the problem but
you still don't do not fix the video
memory that is mapped in so it we don't
we use less memory from that limited
place but vine can use the blocked range
for HIPAA locked memory and so on but
it's a it's a pretty messy problem and
yeah one hope was to that 64 win64
support would fix that but selects and
rotate win64 support isn't there any
bassoon and had a vendor still shipped
32-bit windows and all games are 32-bit
so even if we have 64-bit support
tomorrow it won't help us because the
applications are still don't use it it
with very few exceptions
so the problem isn't relevant really
nowadays it can be worked around of JT I
travel it can be worked around on a per
and I looked at Half Life 2 and we have
about 80 megabytes of address space left
so it will get pretty died soon yeah and
with the part of 1932 windows relief
found out that many games that are
broken on vine run without major issues
on windows with our code so as
Alexandra's already said minded hoodies
in the block anymore for most games the
main issue is copy protection and direct
input I'm mention this shortly later on
also network support some when
encryption libraries it's not only
crisis but also games like if online I a
phone that works since quite some time
but it used to be broken you doing wind
restore something like that and last
year's not used to be an issue but
nothing fixed it quite nice so I don't
think sound is a block kinda made so by
delta T is directed is just one part of
the whole issue some sign of tamales Oh
Roderick asked me to mention open shell
but Alexandra did that already so one
problem we had with Alima golden tries
to fix direct input support but there
are some problems with x11 doesn't
report relative mouse movements so we
can only get relative mouse movements by
checking where wall stickers the last
time and where is it now and if the
crisis on the edge it can't move upwards
anymore so many lot of games are broken
because you can't move 8 at the mouse is
stuck in the middle because vine
opposite back to get relative movements
or the mouse or take aim goodnight
relative movements but the game is not
Oh police so you can turn a bit and then
they call the real pix 11 cursor hits
the screen edge and then you can't do
and again but like this happens in
annual tournament for example or in i
think in quake was too that's something
like that okay and timber tip in the
last a tidge it looked like it looks
like this problem is of its of the
difficulty of the window top vinod
opengl problem too but i do not know all
the details about that stuff with the
least expert on that or x android knows
it yeah i think up yeah i think that's
that's the only real way to get that
going to add some code some supports two
weeks exact to report relative movements
with a literate to read the events
device note from the mouse and it was
working for getting proper mouse
movements events but it it was an
architecture problem and Alexandrov used
it and it also brings some problems into
wine which the XO a tails with like
support from our multiple mouse devices
on depth ops with the code like i could
play with my external mouse but i
couldn't leave the touchpad and stuff
like that and i'm also not sure if our
mouse types report the format in the
same data type so by a touchpad doesn't
have an event device know that also
there even if the de menthe device
driver wouldn't work with my touchpad so
all in all we still need to have to use
x 11 but exists to limited so we have to
extend it the samba
no not yet really it did holder like has
some contacts to X developers and said
he could talk to them too but we have to
find out just what we really need there
yeah it's it's not it's easy to say but
in detail when you're going to implement
it and you I think the exactly opposite
will need more information probably from
and there are other issues to like
foreclosed management and so and yeah
this is one of the main blockers
nowadays for games that you can't move
the mouse properly so i just wanted to
mention it I do not really know these
areas I just wanted to bring them up
because neither order ignore with alia
here today so yeah that's it pretty much
just some summary I think mine has a
pretty solid and high performance direct
with the implementation nowadays but it
still needs some buds to be cleaned out
and they are still vaccinated it's not
perfect yet but it's pretty solid and
the next big problem before I mind at
all after we don't know yet will be
direct3d 10 of course really we have
almost everything for direct g9c the
only thing that this missing is those
are predict heads in pixel shaders but
we haven't found a game yet which uses
them and there's also something called
displacement maps but I do not really
know honestly what this exactly is and I
haven't found a game using the invader
so those are two things that are just
just unused and oh one other feature is
f is in my tree which have on their very
heck a patch for
so what is also is on the used by DC T
so we are pretty much direct to do 90
complete nowadays but the problem is
that many drivers do not support many
are some features in Linux although they
do it in windows so it the high end
stuff only works on nvidia cards
business as usual so that's so far
pretty much my status update any
questions oh I didn't have her ok the
still works I didn't have any resolution
changing box recently they used to be
some one year ago especially if vintage
game changed resolutions in game or when
the game had some window decoration set
so we have to remove the middle
decorations and there's one problem in
direct bra because director on Windows
always draws to the screen so if the
game goes full screen Ross told
directdraw and puts a window in front of
its director diet window the direct role
drawing still appears on the window
because it just draws everything so and
we draw to the window to get x 11
clipping properly there are some
problems to do the two screen drawing in
windows through which can be shown that
some demo applications
okay so Henry tests are still some
problems of resolution changes I
personally I person 11th seen any such
problems lately yeah yeah yeah there
were some frame of objects performance
revisions lately and I cost a
performance revision in shaders the
shader regression should be fixed
already this was just I've fixed
somebody okay while I'm edit I'll fix it
but it happens in a game yet which hits
dead and it costs constantly compilation
of shaders so the patch was correct but
every word out of it because no game had
the problem it and how however I had
sold out sources we would have a
performance regression so I just really
just I get this II could be a badge and
a fixed with the device independent lab
engine but it wouldn't solve the problem
with opengl because I we've got to see
the direct robe directx applications can
use GTI commands on the graphics cards
back buffer and we currently handle this
by downloading everything into system
memory passing it to the x server
drawing de and then uploading it back
and the download and upload to the GPU
takes it's pretty slow the high-end
cards it works properly but it's some
IDF it's still slow for it on all the
cards and osprey diem cuts at least I
once tried to implement how to
accelerated CDI drawing by writing my
own CD I try mine mine to 3d and we do
not eat much or all the games to with
GDI on the back buffer is throwing text
to just use one
entered sort of it but there are some
architectural problems like that the
directrix a device context and usual
window device context have to be in the
same driver I can't implement it in a
different driver because the application
has to be able to do a bit built copy
between window and surface and my driver
broke that ability and yeah so
essentially windows implements direct2d
in the GTI driver so to get this
properly working we would have to move
mind if you g into x 11 dfv a vine x 11
WV so that that's not really nice is the
solution either so I do not have a fixed
really another idea was to create an
OpenGL accelerated pixmap and to copy
the pics my booth paint video memory so
copying from the pic before the depicts
map is cheap and then it shot past the
pixmap to the server and say blow me
there and then the extra xok put could
theoretically just draw in a card and it
just takes over could do the job but I
do not think cats really the drivers
really supported so it would still be
slow but you just say oh we are innocent
it's takes over that makes things slow
so it but most reddit slow is a problem
with the color from the color or the
format of colours invert the church is
different and DirectX in OpenGL have the
red and the blue channel fix we swapped
so before drawing and gratitude with
color information we have to swap them
and this is done in draw spreaded slowly
recent vertex vertex the vertex to the
card instead of setting here are hundred
where it says draw them and their this
issue is mostly fixed by fixing the
color in the vertex but fine storing it
but it still happens if games draw ahead
my future
of but it's just a dynamic geometry from
the memory but they're pretty few games
are really limited by that and mainly
it's old games and old games on new
cards are fast enough anywhere mostly
there are some exceptions and on old
cards Ross tried it slow is faster than
draw spreaded fast this is an unruly old
cards like TNT to cut so I think browse
reddit slow isn't it isn't really a
problem anymore but some games are still
affected by that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
