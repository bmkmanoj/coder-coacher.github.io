for the presentation which is going to
be given by my dear friend Gregor's
Peterson I had the privilege of meeting
Gregor's at the Danish Linux forum
conference earlier this year and we had
some very interesting conversations
about anthropology and open-source
projects so Gregor's is here to give us
a talk today on reorganizing and non
transactions and it's basically going to
be about the sociology of open-source
software projects yeah maybe maybe maybe
if we're lucky that's what we'll get all
right taking away Gregor's thank ya
thank you as noted i'm going to speak on
reorganizing and non transactions i
sometimes it's really nice with
cryptical two titles and it's licensed
under GPL point 20 the background for
this talk today is that I'm right now
conducting anthropological research into
property relations and notions and
expressions of ownership in boundary
locations between one specific free
software project and commercial
companies commercial interests and in
this context my my or let's say my
setting in anthropological terms is
within a project called open wrt orc
which is developing originally
alternative firmwares for cheap wireless
rulers and now is moving into being a
complete embedded platform and in that
sense open wrt is my tribal village it's
where I have my tent if I speak in kind
of classical cliche kind of
anthropological words and I'll talk on
and I look at an alternative explanation
for a underlying social system of open
source software free software cultures
and hopefully be able to explore some of
the implications of this the focus will
be on an ocean on cultures of sharing
and how such cultures of sharing are
recognized or can be recognized
as new kinds of actors who are going
into processes of reorganizing the
market and the background for this is
that over the last decades it's been
more and more interesting for a lot of
entities to appropriate or let's see say
take over cultural products and in that
sense cultural products would be
traditional knowledge and objects
typically like third-world tribal
knowledge tribal insight tribal objects
it can be anything from a drum to
knowledge about the medical herbs and
these are these different travel
products or cultural products are being
appropriated and converting into
converted into commodities and in that
way they are becoming included in a
market-based economy and this makes a
dick quite interesting to explore how
this traditional knowledge and I'm using
the term traditional knowledge also as
covering open-source software and free
software so I'm playing a little bit on
this metaphor and looking at how this is
defended in terms of alternative models
of ownership and you can generally say
that if you characterize the world of
free and open source software then it's
a social system and as such it's based
on certain set of assumptions you might
say there is a logic to it oh and this
logic on the rights everyday activities
and basically this particular form of
social organization and another thing
you can say is that all forms of social
organization societies produce and
distribute cultural products it's like
current something you can say that there
is something which is being done
and this being done by a certain society
is production of anything from knowledge
to objects and if you look at free and
open source software societies or
cultures it's all typically likened to a
system based on gift economy and gift
economy is cyclic exchanges of gifts and
returning reciprocity which again will
say that you have one part one
individual or entity which hands over a
gift to another giving a gift this
creates a reciprocity relationship where
this other individual entities is being
required to return the gift in that
sense you have like cyclic returning or
continues returning of gifts and that
sense you can say that this cyclic
system of constant exchange and
returning and giving gifts becomes a
society that's a basic assumption and
this
what is important here is that you have
relationships between defined and known
partners which are created over time so
it's not like necessarily that as soon
as you give a gift then it has to be
returned the same minute or the
subsequent minute it can be in a hundred
years but you have defined and
well-known sets of relationships between
known partners and in the context I am
in this requirement of having
transactions or exchange between known
partners does somehow disappear it makes
me at least it makes me wonder then if
you look at how a software project works
you have like a repository here you have
a developer's adding source to the
repository you have a lot of people who
are checking out the source but they're
not necessarily returning anything to it
they don't necessarily have any sort of
relationship with these developers not
in luck like in a generalized sense so
that you can't really say that there is
like a gift relationship on exchange
it's just you know it becomes very very
generalized and maybe even abstract so
it seems to disappear and so I for a
while i was wondering there because
there's like a continuous flow things
keep flowing they're not like hidden
their public they're flowing they're
moving they're circulating but actually
what makes that happen what is that kind
of drives this flow and circulation I
think there's a British or I know
there's a British anthropologist James
leech who took a look at this and he
said you have a basic system which says
and which says and States and recognizes
individual authorship in our credits
source codes credits
it's cool it clearly defined who started
this there's like an biography and so in
that sense you can say there is a basis
there everybody knows who made this or
who started out who has kind of credits
who has to be credited credited in a
continued life of this piece of source
code but if you look if you sit there as
an individual coder or hacker or or
author you can either just sit and keep
your code to yourself or you can
distribute it and by distributing it it
becomes coherent suddenly it makes sense
that you did the work you add it to
something more you add it to the flow so
that could be something which drives it
but there's still something missing and
I've kind of been again like thinking a
bit about this and there's a different
researcher rishabh gosh who's the head
of or the leader of the european floss
projects and and he's kind of also been
looking at this problem and he has
introduced this notion of the tribal
cooking but and I have to apologize for
my writing it's not very nice tribal
cooking pot and his background is
economics so he's trying to Mike model
an economic model on this and so he says
there's this tribal cooking pot
everybody who has something asset to the
cooking pot you have this big wonderful
stew who's probably is going to taste
basically the same year out year in and
by adding something to this cooking pot
it will always contain more than you can
produce yourself so it becomes more and
more valuable in economical terms
and in that sense there comes a logic to
by adding something to this pot you
actually become entitled to more than
you can produce yourself and everybody
is free to take out what it is they want
but again this sounds quite nice but
it's again hmmm you end up with this
profit notion the individuals can profit
on this it's like they make more out of
it and it's just when I look at my
empirical work like the new graphical
work I'm involved in this profiting this
notion of kind of counting or measuring
things and money and economic
calculations is not really and it's in
any way as a central aspect of everyday
life so there's still no these questions
marks which I kept I keep having and I
think the problem is that by this
something like this model you introduce
a notion of the calculative man that we
are calculating our daily everyday life
in terms of money and profit and that
way what we do and engage into becomes
commodities something which has a wet
value which I'm trading for something
else you are inching in towards an
money-based economy or at least a very
clearly commercial and kamata sized
model and you can say about this is that
returning to the gift gift exchange
systems under rights social
relationships continued social
relationships across time whereas money
or commodity exchange underwrites the
existence of commodities so it's like
either you have a continued existence of
relationships human relationships
valuable relationships or you have a
reproduction of valuable objects
commodities and and both are kind of not
really they make still makes me kind of
worried about certain things in respect
to my fieldwork and what is that as i
already stated this sense of commodities
it's not really what i experienced
people are not involved in producing in
the project i'm living in or I'm being
part of just because of that they look
at it as a commodity which they can sell
and profit on and they're not neither
are they really involved in it as an
expression of gift economy a gift
exchange because there is no free gift
if you give a gift to somebody it always
has to be returned and there's actually
these well there's a transaction as a
requirement of a transaction which needs
to go on and in that context I am in
there is actually a lack of this
returning of the gift so there's like
also there is like this ? what is it
then and you can say if you look at it
as a social system the introduction of
in general terms introduction of a
commodity-based exchange system is very
often a threat to these social
structures because they become an E and
alternative and alternatives also
something which changes accepting or
existing aspects and so you're not in
this context i'm in you're not talking
about notions of value flows it's like
there isn't really anything which is
measured in terms of commodity value and
it is neither measured in terms of gift
exchange relationships because they
aren't really there you don't have these
partners which exchange which with each
other there something else
and what could this else be and I can
say okay these transactions I would
expect to find in a gift system or
commodity system are missing and I
started looking around in more classical
anthropological Matthew material and
suddenly I felt and that I found some
similarities in in what you normally
call primitive hunter-gatherer cultures
because they are based on sharing
cultures the based on a model of social
organization which is expressed true
demand sharing and we can say what
constitutes such a hundred gather
community or a group is that they're
typically small mobile roaming groups
they are highly egalitarian their social
organizations based on direct immediate
return sharing there's a distinct lack
of private individual property you don't
really have a sense of I have something
which is definitely mine there's like a
lot of things but they typically keep
circulating within the community within
the group if you hunt something it
belongs to you there is like a sense of
individual ownership authorship but as
soon as you have stated okay I kill that
thing or I found this three with fruits
on it then it is demanded that you need
to share it there's a question
basically it's a accepted convention in
the literature so and they equally
cherien sense is that you don't have a I
q-tip like you don't have it had chief
you don't have like every rock ecosystem
in that classical state orange sister an
ocean you have a horizontal model but
it's it's you know I understand your
question it's kind of its always gets
into a gray zone when you start looking
at it so because somebody you always
have somebody who has more knowledge
than others or are better to a certain
and more respected and yeah yeah but
it's also something that you can't
really say that you have individuals who
have a clear sense of power to initiate
certain activities they cannot like just
state you you and you have to help me
with this an individual can say okay I
think I'm going to wander over there
anybody who wants to follow me are free
but you don't have to so in that sense
it's egalitarian and what also is a
characteristic here is that you have no
control over who gets what if you add
something if you share something
everybody is entitled and you can't say
you cannot have anything there's no
reciprocity so you're not required to
give something to back if you're like a
really bad hunter sorry but you still
read title to meet doesn't matter that
you never kill anything and in that
sense success is no insurance for
getting something in return so it's kind
of a little bit odd to think in this way
and you can ask then okay why do
developers or hunters with success share
there's a sense of coherence as i
already said makes makes meaning gives
it meaning makes it creates
a sense of belonging this had a hacker a
coder he can sit there in his own little
room office building and gorge on his
own code but if he doesn't put it into
the flow of the circulation doesn't have
any meaning it's non-existent so big it
creates existence it creates a biography
and it creates a continued flow and in
that sense you can also say that by
releasing it this coder or hacker or
author loses control over his work you
cannot decide okay nobody if I put it
onto a server on the internet I'm I'm
not able to say you you and you another
I'm not allowed to have access to my
code at least not directly and if you
state it it doesn't help you anything
because they'll get it anyway somehow so
it's more that you share it openly into
this sharing sphere and you can say that
in that sense as the essence of a
sharing culture is actually to keep flow
circulation going things have to be in
constant circulation because in that way
you cannot turn them into individual
property you can turn it it becomes a
collaborative ownership model and in
that sense by looking at this constant
and maintaining and reproduction of flow
and circulation I think it is possible
in some ways to look at the production
of free and open source software as
being an expression of a culture of
sharing which is different from other
models of social organization and
and in that sense you can say what is
being expressed as a model is a model of
collaborative or social model of social
organization which is based on
collaborative ownership a constant flow
like everybody is entitled everybody has
kind of a stake in it despite that you
haven't added to it or you haven't
produced to it but you are participating
in maintaining the flow and that opposes
this generalized commodity-based market
economical model we're living in and can
one say okay why does that oppose that I
think if you look at like the basic
premises of the market is that the
market is based on die did an
identification of an object an idea a
product and the recognization the
recognized it is recognized that this
object thing idea belongs to somebody
there's an defined ownership
relationship but before this can be
turned into a commodity this thing this
object this idea has to be alienated
this ownership recognized recognizing
has to be cut has to be detached from
strings and in that sense it becomes
what you call a a calculative object an
object which is calculated in a
calculative commons you have a setting
where you have certain defined entities
which are putting a price on this thing
because suddenly it is free to be
exchanged in terms of money because it
has no prior ties anymore and in that
sense when I look at
the everyday life i'm perd of it's not
really possible to alienate this code
which is produced by the project I'm
living a nun part of a it's not possible
to detach the cultural product from its
owner producer which is in the sense the
project i'm involved with and this means
that it's not possible to pull one
specific object like this in this case
source code or software out of the
floats in you cannot take it out and
stop it and isolate it and turn it into
a commodity and in that sense you're not
able to facilitate the normal actions of
a market-based economy and it doesn't
become possible to create transactions
it's like a world of non transactions
and in that sense you have an
introduction of a substance a paradox
which is based on that you have a
reality of something might be given or
shared
but
it's still kept so you have a basis says
something might be given but it's still
kept its also called giving while
keeping so you might have that the
project i'm involved in is giving
sharing their source code freely but
they still keep it there's it still
belongs to the project as a social
social entity so in that sense in my
context i'm in the graphic context i
mean is not possible to alienate what is
being produced by the specific culture
or cultural group and in that sense if
this is done or made or some entity
makes attempts at appropriating this
code like placing it inside a product
and black boxing this product not
stating we are not telling you what's
inside it then the ownership the
collaborative ownership of the project
will be initiated and this right to
ownership the recognition of its their
work will be defended in the same way as
you you see it with several like tribal
groups like third-world groups who are
defending their traditional knowledge
and in that way this defense does also
reproduce this whole ownership structure
which is based on collaborative notions
and this defense can take like basic I
probably suppose some of you have like
notions that social shaming just naming
that this is this person with this in
this nickname is doing something we do
we don't like by stating okay you have
this piece of hardware we know that
there's the system running inside it why
don't you just state it on your website
it can be exclusion from participation
communication in forums and IRC channels
and to some extent also
exclusion from having access to source
repository but it can also be in the end
point is that a lie right or license can
be terminated the right to use the
software can be terminated if the
requirements are not met if the flow is
not reproduced by the different entities
which are using the software and in that
sense you can say there's a logic that
if you participate if you help maintain
reproduce the flow like if you make a
kill for a hundred gather a hunter or
find the tasty fruit you keep the flow
going by sharing and but if you do not
share if you do not participate on these
rules you will be expelled eventually
there are certain leniency there's a lot
of boundary land and a lot of gray zones
but eventually if you do not respect the
rules you will be expelled but in what
way is this reorganizing the market
that's kind of the last questions I try
to ask and I think it's realized it in
that way that this particular mode of
collaborative ownership or cultural
production is introducing the reality
and the existence of different modes of
ownership you do not only have one which
is focused on commodity economy the
individual singular ownership of certain
things which you can then sell and
distribute as you like and control and
hide and whatever you want but that you
have a more than one expression load of
ownership you have a singular you have a
parallel collaborative plural ownership
model you have models based on sharing
you have models based on gift exchange
but it introduces reality where there
isn't or there is necessarily one model
which takes care everything so you have
different opposing and competing logics
and I think that's the way something
like the production of free and open
source software is reorganizing the
market by introducing new and different
logics as actual real-world living
alternatives based on flow and
circulation and I think that's primarily
the way or the basically the point I
wanted to make today is that you have a
number of opposing or competing systems
which are crystallizing right now and in
that sense you have the creation of very
very large like boundary zones or
boundary locations or gray zones where
these logics interact and they are
changing each other so things are being
reorganized but what is especially
interesting is that you have this
emergence of cultures based on flow and
circulation that objects cultural
objects cultural products knowledge has
to be circulating and that this creates
different types of ownership structures
and what we normally experience in our
everyday life they have always it's like
it's nothing new I have to state that
you've always had very different models
of ownership but you have right now you
have been in a long period time period
where one particular model has been
dominant I think this dominance is
changing right now so the relationships
of the market are in that sense being
reorganized by new kinds of actors who
are very very or impossible to buy for
money it's like the project i'm involved
in you cannot buy the project for money
so you cannot take over the ownership
and control it in a market economic
model and I think that's basically the
conclusion that's
what I'm involved in is all about flow
and circulation and in that sense I
would of course like to say thank you to
my wonderful project open wrt and Leslie
for hosting me here today no I do it it
anyway so I think that was pretty much
what i wanted to say today
but but you know you mentioned this
question before about this egalitarian
and it is a difficult question because
how do you understand egalitarian
structures I think again as I said the
best way is to see are you do you have
individuals with power or do you have
individuals with by acting well or
actually are being good examples are
being respected who are able to ask
people to help them I think that's a
distinction do you have like power do
you have a bigger gun or are you able to
press a persuade people to follow your
lead because I think that's probably
gonna work out pretty good hmm so yep
the boundary
open source larger open source projects
where they become interesting
players were clearly market base I think
some of them are being involved in a
market economy like money starts like if
you have a big project with people who
are paid for doing work you have to find
money for them so you're kind of like
being integrated more or less so in some
sense it depends to a certain degree on
what license are you licensing your work
under what specific needs requirements
do you have for reproducing your
structure like this the project and I
can say the project i'm involved in is
for example extremely different from
something like apache it's very gallatin
where for me a patch is very
hierarchical very structured very much
like a business it acts like a
well-known business actor you know you
can like say ok there's a certain logic
to it whereas the project i'm involved
in it's very egalitarian there is no
money in it there is no sources of
funding and it's very important for this
group to keep things that way because
they become independent and in that
sense by creating this independence
they're also able to again move as a
different kind of actor because they are
able to handle that commercial companies
are approaching them specifically
because they are independent they're not
you know pulling anybody strings are
being pulled by anybody strings so I
think that's again you have a huge
variety of what goes on and some
projects are more prone to becoming
businesslike than others I think that's
this huge boundary zone which acts there
and for me that's extremely interesting
as long as it doesn't necessarily move
in just one direction
you know I'm kind of chaotic so I like
it lots of directions yeah anything else
or should we just one direction yeah
you got a trainee tribal structure
I think maybe what happened earlier this
year with apples starving project where
you had these you had something like
macports or at that point in time
Davenport's and you have like a cluster
of projects which are quite quite
closely related to some work done by
apple and some code which was licensed
by Apple and then you had certain
changes which closed off down in for a
while and which initiated that some of
it the whole diving project fell apart
and you had a project like the prior
Davenport's which then went to took a
name change change macports I think they
have gone towards a more independent
line because they have definitely
realized we cannot depend on so constant
or continued support from a company like
Apple because they are under certain
market dynamics and they have certain
market interests with which they have to
protect and we as a project Mac boards
have a different interest but I think
it's so again it's difficult to say if
this is a real example of that but it's
at least something i can say that
something happened and it changed the
structure of the background
but again it's difficult to like
pinpoint this and this and this yeah
should we call it a day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
