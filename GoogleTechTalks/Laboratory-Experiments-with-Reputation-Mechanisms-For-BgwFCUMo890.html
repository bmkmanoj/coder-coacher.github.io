Ted today we'll be talking about
reputation mechanisms for electronic
commerce Ted thank you very much for the
invitation and if you have questions
along the way feel free to bring them up
what I'd like to just to start with
there just to give a context of
reputation in an area i'm sure we're all
very familiar with you've ever had the
opportunity of buying a used car
particularly from a private dealer you
face this question of how do you tell if
it's a good if it's a good car or not
and you have various options it
particularly if you're not that
mechanically inclined you can pay
someone to help you out threaten to go
to court if you get a bad deal and and
so on but another and sometimes easier
way is rely on the reputation of the
seller if they've done this kind of
transaction many times in the past and
that's really what we're going to focus
on today looking at different reputation
mechanisms fundamentally this problem
which is buying a used car from someone
who knows quite well how the car runs
but you don't is an issue of information
asymmetry and this basically just means
that two people are thinking they might
have a beneficial transaction such as
getting rid of an old old car one person
knows a lot more about this product or
service then then the other the other
person does and because of the concern
that you might be buying the lemon
people might be inhibited from entering
into these potentially beneficial trades
the market collapses goes away and
essentially people end up leaving
profitable trades on the table if
they're not comfortable in assuming that
they'll get an honest and honest
transaction there's a variety of
examples in this eight or more modern
context than buying cars things like I'm
a business and I have web ads and
someone clicking on my ad is that
really a customer or some one trying to
a robot trying to waste my ad budget is
some software i'm thinking of
downloading is it full of bugs and
viruses and spyware or is it really
useful as as advertised so the issue of
reputation and information asymmetry
comes up and you might you might call
the old economy and it's the buying the
car example and also very much in the
internet economy and what I'm then going
to be describing in this in this talk is
basically what is the economic challenge
for which reputation mechanisms can can
be helpful I'll describe just some
motivating examples and information
services that the Internet can provide
that require people to feel comfortable
both in the providing and they're using
information and for which reputation can
be helpful you're probably all familiar
with a lot of the more web based
examples and so I'll describe some some
other kinds of instances where there's a
lot of potential benefit but people can
be afraid of sharing information more
more from the physical world and then
turn to looking at what are some various
kinds of reputation mechanisms and how
do we go about evaluating them and
finally I'll describe some experiments
that we've done at HP in comparing a
number of different reputation contexts
and very controlled all those small
environments so the economic challenge
for a reputation mechanism is we'd like
to induce honest behavior among people
when they have the temptation to cheat
because they have some information that
the other party transaction does not
have and the idea is what a good
mechanism should help reduce the
consequences of this information
asymmetry so that the people feel
comfortable making a transaction even
though they know that their limit there
they're lacking some information and
reputation is one way of going about
about this it's not the only way but it
has advantages of avoiding the really
potentially expensive costs of detailed
monitoring or after the fact a legal
enforcement so if you can prevent the
problem in the first place it's a lot
better than
trying to fix it afterwards it's
important to understand as we talk about
reputation that human nature is still
it's still very much the same the
difficulty of enforcing contracts or
encouraging people to behave as they
says they promise is certainly not not
something that that's new in particular
interesting example of in the middle
ages the merchants had to deal with this
who had lots of profitable trades
between different countries but say a
merchant from France couldn't really
trust that the King of England and their
courts would give them a fair deal if
they had to have some dispute so they
often faced issues of how can I trust
someone when I don't really have clear
access to legal contract enforcement the
idea of reputation is is really very
simple and that is you give some record
of say my past behavior in various
similar transactions as some presumption
of how I will behave in the future
realising that any poor behavior on my
part could be punished by the loss of
future business rather than say being
dragged off to court right right for
that particular transaction and then a
question that comes up is in this broad
context how might we go about designing
effective reputation mechanisms for for
various situations and hopefully that
are easy to implement and use now it's
important to remember when we talk about
human behavior and mechanisms and
incentives that when you put a mechanism
in place it can change the way people
behave they're not just you know static
with fixed behaviors and so here is just
one example it's not particularly
related to reputation but you might
think about your behavior if they're all
similar similar to me in the question of
whether you bother to put links to other
web pages you find you find that are
interesting so I remember very very
early on in the web you would find
interesting pages and you put links to
them and so on and then after after a
while those web pages go away they
change their URLs and they're hard to
find and it becomes a real pain to
maintain your own web page when other
things that you link to keep keep
changing
and so now hey there's great search
engines you don't need to bother to put
in links you can let people just give a
little text summary and let people find
that if they want via via search engine
that will be up to date and you don't
have to worry about updating your web
pages so much of course the problem then
can come if people rely on search
engines rather than putting in links
you're no longer presenting that
information of endorsements if you like
by having people explicitly put in links
links to to their pages and if many
people then adopt this this this kind of
attitude there will be fewer links maybe
it's harder to search and harder harder
if for four mechanisms that rely on the
recommendations from from links and so
this is just as an example of where you
you change the technology you change a
mechanism it to change people's behavior
to possibly make that mechanism less
less effective and it's useful to keep
that in mind in any kind of mechanism
design so before we talk more about
specifics of mechanisms and economics
and so on I'd like to just put the the
context of a design into three different
categories and often people tend to
focus on just one of these three and I
think it's important to keep in mind all
of them and let them balance off against
each other so if you have a car in the
parking lot you know one thing you'll
typically do is lock the door when you
leave and that's an example of a simple
you know technology a lock that makes it
harder for people to break in your car
and steal stuff another way of course is
just don't leave valuable things sitting
around in plain view in your car you're
trying to take away the incentive
someone could break in but they have no
particular reason to do so so that's
more of an economic your kind kind of
issue and finally there is a level of
legal sanctions yes you could break into
my car and steal stuff but MIT
potentially the police could come after
you and if you get caught you you could
be punished these various approaches to
trying to encourage if you like correct
or honest behavior have their strengths
and weaknesses and it's important not to
just focus on just one of them and think
that will solve those will solve
everything the focus i'm going to be
talking about today is it more on the in
the
nah MEK an incentive context but
realizing that technology in particular
cryptographic tools in terms of
providing who has access to what
information can be an important
component of reputation mechanisms in
maintaining privacy and so on so now
let's look a bit add some information
services and and I've just picked a few
here first that you'll be very familiar
with those are a bit based on on the web
and then I'm tossed in a few that are
probably a little bit less familiar with
you with to you and they're not so
common yet though they provide some
examples of some interesting searches
that is so far beyond current
technologies but might be very
interesting and have a key trust issue
in terms of in terms of releasing and
using the information which is what I
want to focus on here instead of the
technological aspects so of course we're
all familiar with the Internet allowing
new sorts of information services
particularly by lowering drastically the
transaction costs so if you want to find
some specialized obscure information who
wants to sell some of some obscure item
that you're interested in or if you'd
like to a gregarious the internet makes
that much much easier than it than it
has been in the past and then therefore
enabling new sorts of services at
reasonable prices for people now
information sources when we think about
the internet and so on often focus on
online sources what sorts of search
activities do people have what do they
put on their web pages what do they
email and ends and so on who do they
link to in there in social networks but
there's also a variety of interesting
possibilities and developing
possibilities in the physical world for
gaining information about the physical
world and bringing this into online new
sorts of services in particular
surveillance sensors cameras all around
whether they're the government's cameras
or our own cameras and cell phones and
and so on who gets to know where where
your cell phone is all the time so thats
cell phone locations tied to you and
interestingly for new kinds of aggregate
searches some medical information let me
do
because that only thing could be a
little bit less familiar to you just
want to go a little bit over what we
might imagine some kind of searches that
really rely on trust information and not
just not just because they're enabled by
the technology so if we have lots of
distributed sensors and we're interested
in environmental monitoring and we could
do this very cheaply and continuously
and so on we can monitor for chemicals
that people are actually exposed to for
how long how much and sends and so on
and then correlate to say disease
outcomes with actual exposures and not
and perhaps the specific genetic makeup
of these people and not have to make
some more coarse grained kind of
inferences that we have to do today so
this could be particularly useful for
the early identification of some say
environmental toxins that are
particularly of a problem that a very
small minority of the population just
because of their their particular
profile that would otherwise take a long
time to figure out another place that we
could gather some interesting
information although again this is not
what's happening what's happening yet or
the various implants that variety of
companies are working on end and in fact
marketing today so these are various
devices that are implanted say to
monitor your heart or your blood blood
pressure or how a bone is healing and
these generally will be useful to give
information to the physician treating
that particular problem of how a
treatment is going is it getting better
or worse and so on and these can give
much more detailed information because
it can collect information continuously
then you would get say if you go to the
doctor once a week or once a month now
another area that I'm particularly
interested in it and at HP Labs working
on molecular scale devices and there's a
molecular computers and sensors and so
on is is taking this kind of capability
that we already see it at sort of scales
about this size and millimeter scales
and developing the technologies and make
this much much much smaller so to be
able to sense compute act on size scales
the particularly relevant for for
biology say that the size the size of
cells
and here is kind of a schematic diagram
of the kind of sizes that we're thinking
of for applications of molecular
electronics it's in the laboratory today
although we're nowhere near able to
build these kinds of devices and and put
them into clinical to clinical use so
the example here is just making a very
small device it's a little bit smaller
smaller than cells yes I'm getting to
that it's good good good question so
these sorts of implant devices are
normally thought of to help you interact
with your physician and that's and
that's it so that that would help would
help you but these sorts of devices if
the information was widely shared could
also be used to provide detailed studies
of as i mentioned environmental
monitoring who's particularly sensitive
to certain certain kinds of exposures
and here's been potentially interesting
search that is just impossible to do
today partly because of trust issues and
that is if you have these people with
the various implants measuring diabetics
blood pressure exposure to various
toxins mainly for their own benefit if
that information could be widely
searched and available in sony could
also make possible virtual very rapid
online studies for you come into your
doctor's office you presented with some
kind of flu perhaps or something see
what that is see how people with your
genetic makeup have responded to that
with to various treatments of that
particular particular problem if you can
do it quickly if you could do it
accurately and you could do it a sample
over a large population just imagine
that the kinds of things of how that
could change the specifics the
specificity of saying medical practice
as that we know of today so this is an
example of a kind of search it might be
very obvious I'd like to know who else
it's similar to you in the relevant
characteristics have had this particular
problem that you're presenting to me as
a physician what has worked for them
what have other people tried and so on
can I find this out very quickly and the
answer today is no partly for
technological reasons but also partly
for trust your trust issues what
happen to this information so the idea
of aggregating information of course can
provide a combination of information can
provide improved services if you can use
not only your own behavior but behavior
of similar people to you whether it's
because they're similar medically or
they're similar in terms of the searches
that they've looked at or they're
similar hobbies or whatever the whatever
the similarity might be you could get
better recommendations better
information for them but of course and
here's where we r we this issue of trust
comes in all this collected information
easily searched and so on could also be
misused it was for it for example to
enable a really detailed kind of
identity theft now that people would
know a lot about you potentially and so
this is just an example I wanted to
bring up because it's somewhat unusual
when we think about just just web-based
web-based services that there are
certain kinds of searches that would be
nice to have nice to be able to do
quickly but for which trust is a really
key blocker if people even if the
technology were available trust for
people to have this information provided
and so on can be a really a key blocker
and so as we think about reputation
mechanisms it's not just for finding a
better car or finding a better apartment
to live in or whether I should download
this particular piece of software
there's a wider context to it which I
think raises a lot of interesting
questions so I hope that's that held at
least to give some some context of why
we should look at things that include
collecting information from from the
physical world so now let's turn a
little bit more to the questions of
reputation and why trust is important
for when we aggregate or collect
information sources so if we're going to
have some services that based on getting
information that's a that people
voluntarily voluntarily give people have
to trust however this information will
be is going to be used and not so that
they're willing to provide the
information and of course on the other
side if you're a user of the information
you want to be accurate and it's not
just some spoof or spam and so on you
feel that the information is reliable so
here I'm pointing out that there's
asymmetric information potentially on
both sides of a transact
here one is I'm giving you know give you
some information you promise that it
will only be used for these various uses
that you promise and not for anything
else can I trust that on the other side
as a user of this information I get
something that gives me a
recommendations on can I trust it is the
information reliable so asymmetric
information is not just on the seller
side necessarily it can it can be on on
both and so if we can devise good
reputation mechanisms and understand
what makes them work and so on it could
be a key enabler for a variety of new
services for which the technology may
not be mature enough yet but when it
went into their we don't want to just be
stopped by everyone loves the technology
but no one trusted and so they're not
going to use it or they'll lobby to pass
the legislation that restricts it in
various ways that makes it less useful
than it could be now the Internet has
both positive and negative consequences
for designing reputation mechanisms and
the obvious one is that it certainly can
help by making a lot more information
available about say a seller what have
they done in the past how do their other
customers feel about them and so on a
lot easier to find that an example is
the ebay rating system if any of you are
familiar with or buy or sell things on
on ebay similarly with with social
networks or you can get recommendations
from friends of friends and you might
find those more trustworthy than just
some some random ones the internet also
provides challenges for for reputation
mechanisms compared to what we might be
used to traditionally in particular you
might be dealing with people in very
different legal jurisdictions this is so
this is again similar to what these
medieval merchants were dealing with if
you're in front if you're French and you
don't trust whether the legal system in
England say will will help help you
there might be anonymous users you might
not know exactly who it is you're
dealing with or if you've dealt with
them in the past or who they've dealt
with in the past you might be doing a
transaction across different business
cultures we're sort of different levels
if you like of bargaining cheating
whatever you care you care to call it
are the norms and how do you how do you
deal with that and also you might be
dealing with very small transactions so
let's imagine buying a small thing on
ebay where it's just not worth the
hassle of thinking of going to small
claims court if it doesn't work out and
so these are kinds of things that make
many of the kind of traditional ways we
think of dealing with reputation a
little bit more of a challenge if we
think you're putting together some
possible reputation mechanisms well we
would certainly like the information
that we're going to use and help people
make their decisions be easy to collect
not and not require very much effort if
any on the on the part of the person
providing the information we'd like the
information to be accurate so that it I
can't easily if I'm competing with
someone else to sell to sell something
on eBay that I can't easily spoof their
reputation and make it seem like they
cheat a lot whereas I whereas I don't
because we'd like to encourage people to
rely on the reputation and then see what
are the consequences for improving a lot
of facilitating transactions that
without a reputation mechanism people
would feel uncomfortable doing and then
also it would be nice if we if we could
have some minimal intrusiveness for for
the people whose information we're
collecting to maintain privacy and
hopefully if people are concerned about
privacy and would either withhold the
information or distort or change their
behavior because of because of that
perhaps in ways that again make
transactions that would be beneficial
just not happen because people are
concerned about what trail of reputation
they might be leaving behind and a
simple a kind of example is if you're
involved in transactions that some part
of society or some other party or some
other society might view as unpopular
maybe you don't want everyone to know
about that so all the gambling you did
in Las Vegas for example I think things
things along those lines and again when
you're crossing cultural and legal
boundaries something that might be
perfectly fine in one context might not
be in another and how does that affect
reputations if you are thinking of doing
business in many different different
cultures or we see this also with with
with search terms indicating something
about you perhaps so the amount of
reputation information that we want is
kind of a balancing act if you have two
little people will not feel constrained
by the mechanism would be free writing
cheating and so on and then people might
feel I can't tell whether the what I'm
going to get is a good thing or a lemon
and so I just will stay out of the
market the transactions don't happen in
the extreme the market collapses and and
there's a loss for everybody if there's
too much it can be costly to collect
maybe you have to verify it which which
which is costly maybe it's just even
confusing to users to show hundreds of
transactions and whether the person
liked it or not or it was a little bit
okay and not so okay rated different
rating scores too much information can
also be confusing and also then as I
mentioned privacy concerns one issue
that comes up is should the information
be verified independently or it's just
self reporting so third party
verification can make people feel more
confident about the accuracy and it also
has the the disadvantages and it could
be costly you might someone has to pay
or motivate this this third party and
perhaps forces some uniform evaluation
criteria that may not be suitable for
for it for everyone on the other hand is
self reporting so I just decide we have
a transaction and I just post little
Landon on the net that says I like this
transaction or I didn't like it that can
be fine that can be very easy but on the
other hand there's I don't necessarily
have to tell the truth about it and what
sort of incentives are there for me to
misrepresent what happened in in the
trend the transaction
so as we then think of evaluating
different proposed mechanisms in looking
at economic mechanisms and in particular
but any anything in which involved would
involve people there's really basically
three broad broad categories if you're
an academic you might look at game
theory and this has a lot of general
assumptions about the rationality of the
actors and what they know and what they
believe about other people and so on and
that can give some idea of well if
there's some kind of equilibrium
behavior to this mechanism would it be a
good one or not and what might be the
consequences then there could be field
studies you might say well let's look at
some reputation mechanisms in use say
particularly on different websites to
have a look at actual behavior not
necessarily rational people what does we
have large numbers of people involve and
see what what happens now generally you
don't in this situation like that you
don't get to design the mechanism you
just have to look at whatever it is say
that ebay decides to do and because of
that you can get correlations but you
can't get causation you don't have the
ability to go in and say well let's just
tweak this mechanism a little bit and
see what happens or change the
information that people haven't and so
on this actually is a familiar gripe in
biological experiments as as well as you
can you can monitor say the behavior of
some cells and watch what things seem to
be correlated but unless you can do
experiments where you can intervene and
make and make control changes it's very
hard to get an get from correlation to
to causation so the third kind of
approach are particularly our
experiments where you can do
intervention studies you can look at
counterfactual scenarios that no one
would be crazy enough to actually
implement maybe they've lewd lots and
lots of money but that way you're able
to test the wider variety of hypotheses
these experiments can be web-based or
the ones that I'll be just describing a
laboratory-based well you have a lot of
control over what information different
people have but on the other hand
they're limited in time and how many
people are involved so I would think
none of these three methods are clearly
better than the others they each have
some have something
to contribute they have their strengths
and weaknesses and ideally if you're
thinking of evaluating some mechanisms
you'll try to do all three in some
appropriate combination so today I'm
going to be talking particularly about
laboratory experiments but just that's
just one way of evaluating mechanisms so
now I should turn to talk a little bit
about actual some actual reputation
mechanisms starting with some fairly
simple cases and then we'll move to some
more realistic ones the concept of
reputation is often studied in a
scenario it's thought of as a
cooperation dilemma of some sort where
you have a group of people and there's
some notion of good behavior and bad
behavior however you however you carry
to find that and the good behavior has a
benefit for the group as a whole but
it's costly to some individual to all
the individuals actually neither it's
because they have a cost to to perform
this beneficial action or maybe in the
in the context of say privacy concerns
they might be worried about an indirect
cost that if they participate by
revealing their information somehow it
might be misused against them later on
and so in a scenario like this everyone
has a temptation to free ride on the
efforts of others that is you'd like to
say I don't want to incur my individual
costs but I sure hope everyone else in
the group will will participate so we
can get the benefit for for the group
here's a very simple example that you
might just think about if you've ever
actually been in a situation like this
you're out to dinner with a group of
friends and let's say you're going to
divide the cost afterwards equally so
what do you order cheap expensive
compared to what compared to what
everyone else is doing and just just
think about it introspectively does it
matter how big the group is you leave
the larger group you're a little bit
more anonymous maybe you can get away
with it do you expect to dine with these
people again or at least or anytime soon
you're just thinking of those those kind
of questions and how they might impact
what you think you would do or what you
imagine other people might do is a
perfect example of this kind of
cooperation dilemma in a very in a very
small and kind of personal situation we
probably all all relate to
so this brings other question of it was
you what is the context in which a
mechanism will be will be used again
will you interact with this group again
or is it a one-shot deal can you select
what group you join you know mate some
cases yes some cases no and if you're
born in a certain country you're a
citizen of that country you never
selected it in other cases you have to
deliberately to select to be part of
some some group or or another saying in
picking what company you to work for can
the group exclude you sometimes yes
since and some and sometimes no so in
this kind of very simplified scenario
where everyone just has the basically
one of two choices I can either do the
quote-unquote good behavior or cooperate
or the the bad behavior or defect and
your choice can just be based on what
the other person's past behavior was and
it maybe it's just a one on one
transaction maybe it's a one on many
transaction as you imagine that say this
is this dinner example and one very
simple kind of strategy that people have
looked at quite a bit in this very
restricted contacts that works pretty
well it's called tit for tat so I'll do
to you whatever you did to me last time
and if if we're going to be interacting
over and over again that kind of simple
retaliation in many cases can encourage
people to behave to behave well another
possibility is if the group can exclude
people that have have this have this bad
behavior ostracism can be a powerful
motivating tool and so these are a
couple of approaches but these simple
scenarios which have been studied both
in the context experimentally of what
people do they've been they've been
studied in having little computer-based
agents that play that play these games
and so on in many many different
different different situations they
often will have a perfect connection
between what you decide what you intend
to do and what actually you do do so the
connection between in 10 which is what
you're really after and outcome in an
action
so generally it'll be will be no noise
whereas in the real world you could be a
you have well intentioned I'm going to
get this package delivered to you but my
car has a flat tire okay I mean it
doesn't mean that I was trying to
deceive you or anything it's just bad
luck so you can have situations and that
makes it harder to evaluate if the
package is late does it mean that you're
a bad person or does it mean that you
just had some unlucky unlucky situations
and of course if you're willing to
believe a sob story people who have no
sob story whatsoever might be tempted to
just tell you one anyway often these
these kind of simple scenarios don't
give the agents or the people a choice
of who they're going to do play this
game with or who they're going to be
their potential business partners will
be so right off the bat you don't even
have the option of ostracizing people
and finally these simple situations
generally do not have a market context
so you can't see how does the behavior
that people choose and various
mechanisms and strategies how does it
affect simple market properties such as
price and the market efficiency and
whether there are trades that would be
beneficial that just don't that don't
happen and so that leads us to look at
experiments that do have it more
economic context to them so the more
more more complicated and people
basically have looked at two kinds here
one is that we call agency trust games
and the other was a more of a full
market scenario which is what I'll be
describing and what we did in our
experiments but let me just just to show
you the contrast the idea of these
agency trust games are some simple
things like you have a pair of people
and one of them has it gets a pot of
money and they can decide some of that
to give to the other person and then
that other person multiplies that amount
money say by two or three and then this
second person who's the agent can give
gifts to give some of it back and they
may choose to give none of it back okay
or they could give all of it back means
whatever it's whatever their their
choice is and so there you have a
concern about how much do you trust this
agent we'd all be better off if I gave
them all my money and it get double by
this huge amount and then say he gives
half of it back to me or stay or
something like that but of course you
could just take it all in
run and if I'm really worried about that
well maybe i'll just keep what i have
and and at least i get something the
boss has been some experiments in a
similar look similar content of looking
at agent kind of decisions looking at a
one-sided market and this you can think
of as you're hiring a contractor or
you're hiring say a legal adviser or
something scenario like that you have
some risk you get a pot of money you
have some risk that you're going to lose
it if you want you can pay the agent
some some amount to reduce the chance of
your loss but the agent in a sense can
work really hard or goof off and those
two cost the age in a different amount
and give you a different different
benefit so how is it that you can gauge
whether the agent will do what they
promised to do which of course will be
i'll work really hard on your behalf so
give me lots of money and it will be
really good for both of us that's
another kind of a reputation content and
both of these people have looked at in
laboratory experiments but I love what
I'd like to turn to now is to describe
some of the more full market scenarios
that we've looked at in the last few
years at HP in a fairly simple market
Basin area we have both buyers and
sellers and both sides can decide not to
fulfill their their contract and
everyone can decide who they want to do
business with so it's a bit more like a
real market scenario rather than they
say restrictive kinds of cooperative
dilemmas that you say flying in people
who study you know pairwise prisoner's
dilemma and so on and our goal was then
to compare different information
policies and see what happens what is it
that people do this kind of scenario
even though it's still quite restricted
is far too complicated to solve with
game theory in particular because it's
hard to model what people believe about
others and you can say what an ideal
rational player who knows everyone else
is rational and so and should do but
that's not necessarily what people
actually do so then I'd like to describe
a bit about the experimental setup and
then and then talk about our results so
this is the HP experimental economics
law I want to describe to you for those
of you
haven't seen how these kind of
experiments are set up it's fairly
simple we get a group of people usually
they're Stanford students you know 10 or
20 of them in for the afternoon they're
basically playing a computer game from
for real money and and here's the room
and we have this low-tech anti collusion
devices you're just big big poster
boards and and so for most of the the
experiments that we do we want to
control all the information that depth
that people exchange and we don't want
them talking on the side and so on and
so this is our simple technology for
that plus the the announcement that if
they get caught you know talking when
they when they shouldn't be and so on
they're going to lose you know that the
money that they should be earning in the
in the experiment so that works that
works pretty well but but obviously not
a very fancy technology now how do we go
about studying up one of these these
economic experience again the
conceptually it's fairly simple we're
going to set up some kind of market we
have a group of people they'd be divided
them in half summer sellers and summer
buyers and for each seller the
experimenter gives a card like this so
you're a seller and I the experimenter
will give you and saying this for this
particular salary everyone will get
different numbers for this particular
seller I the experimenter will give you
one unit to sell and it'll cost you five
dollars and you could have two units and
will cost you fifteen dollars and so on
generally set up within this kind of
scenario or each extra unit costs a
little bit more doesn't have to be that
way but that models the idea of
increasing marginal costs in many kind
of production tasks conversely if you're
a buyer the experimenter goes to you and
gives you a glow card like this and says
if at the end of the experiment you
buyer who start out with nothing with no
units if you give me one unit I'll give
you ten dollars all right if you give me
two units I'll give you twelve dollars
say okay and so everyone gets this card
it's private information they don't you
know they don't know what everyone else
gets and in this particular context for
these two people you can see they do
have an opportunity for a profitable
trade that is if there's if there's one
unit that that transact some price
between five and ten dollars then
the seller let's say it's at seven
dollars well the seller gets get seven
dollars for this unit and has to pay
five dollars to the experimenter to get
it there for a profit of two dollars
similarly the buyer gets the unit has to
pay seven dollars for it but gets ten
dollars from the experimenter so a three
dollar profit for the buyer so that's an
example where there could be a
profitable trade assuming these people
could find it but in this particular
example again if these are just the only
two people involved there would not be
any profit for exchanging a second unit
in this case it would cost $15 for the
seller to get two units and is only
worth at most twelve dollars to to the
buyer so this is an example then how you
go about setting up an economic
experiment you give this sort of
information to each of the participants
and then they play a computer game which
embodies whatever mechanism that you're
trying to test out there like like a
stock market auction or whatever or in
our case a reputation method but this is
how we induce supply and demand that we
as the experimenters know ahead of time
what it is so in our experiment had
multiple buyers and sellers in a market
we allowed the players to restrict who
it is they would allow their trades to
who it is they would even buy from or
sell to if they wish to do so the
particular mechanism was a discrete
double auction so this is similar what
goes on in the stock market it might be
unfamiliar to you if you're thinking
it's just the normal one sided auctions
like in an art auction or something you
see you see particularly as they in the
movies in a double auction at any time a
seller can say post a price or accept
one that a buyer is already declared and
advice and vice versa so going back to
this this example here it might start
out that the seller of course doesn't
know how much things might be of value
to the buyer and maybe this is the
seller says well look I'll sell one unit
for twenty dollars and just sort of sits
around waiting and doesn't see any
buyers taking up that attain you're
taking up that offer and you know so
then the seller might have to lower
lower the price but because it's a
double auction at the same time a buyer
can say well look I will buy a unit for
three dollars
you know and then the seller looks at
that as well I don't like that maybe I
will either post you know post another
one maybe I'll say okay eventually i'll
sell it for seven dollars in the buyer
could sink well should I take it I can
make a profit on that or should I hold
out for something you know for something
better maybe another buyer is going to
take it you know I have to weigh all
those you know way all those those
considerations but that's how a double
auction works it's both and both parties
can make offers and either a neither
side can just pounce on one and accept
it if if they like it we chose that not
particularly because it's the only your
best kind of oxygen maybe it's well
known experimentally at that sort of
oxygen equilibrates very quickly we were
not interested in this particular
experiment to look at how long it takes
to get to market equilibrium or
different auction mechanisms not in this
case no
some statistical expectations of great
differences
so they might actually have economic
experience but what we haven't told you
thought of all the details in expo but
we did announce ahead of time the
overall supply and demand so what you
didn't know is who had you know
necessarily the best price and so on and
so we were it we again we did that
particularly because we wanted the
markets converts quickly and we were
looking at how is it people make
decisions on who to do business with
okay and what changed from time to time
is who had say the good deals and the
bad deals you wouldn't know that but the
overall the aggregate supply and demand
the state stayed the same and this in
this particular server but that that's a
good point okay so in addition to the
market what made this an interesting
from a reputation point of view is that
people after they've accepted some
exchange they said okay I willing to
sell this for seven dollars after that
parts all over there was an additional
decision round for from this particular
game where each person could decide
whether they were going to fulfill their
their contract or not and everybody does
it simultaneously and in with it you
know without knowing what everybody else
is going to do so in this case the buyer
says look I promised to send seven
dollar you give you seven dollars but if
I keep the seven dollars I'm seven
dollars richer and I could still get the
unit if you sent if you give it to me
and similarly the seller had to make
that decision do I give the unit it's
going to cost me say five dollars to
give it to the to buy it from the
experimenter and if I don't give the
unit I don't have to pay that five
dollars and I keep it at the end of the
end of the day so that's where the the
issue of cooperation or defection or
trust and so on comes in in this
particular this particular experiment
and then we just repeated this several
times and with different scenarios and
different groups of students over you
know in different days and so on but
that's that's the context of the
experiment so that's the setup and now
what we wanted to look at is one
particular issue 44 reputation
mechanisms is what about how much
information you have and there's many
ways that we could do this but again in
a nice laboratory setting we have a lot
of control over what this information is
and so we look basically at three
different information policies
number one was when you were going to
potentially trade with someone all you
knew is how they treated you personally
in the past okay did they fulfill
contracts or not with you that's all you
knew and that's what the low information
contact context and this you might think
of is if you had no real reputation
mechanism or information aggregation to
aid you all you might know is I've gone
to this person before and I've either
had good experiences or bad experiences
and then I make I make my decision based
based on that the other extreme we call
the high information scenario you also
you have your personal history of course
but we also presented to people how much
of the their prior contracts with
everybody in the group did they fulfill
in over the course of the course of the
experiment and we told people that this
information was accurate so we as the
experimenters we're providing is this
information and you know therefore they
knew it they knew it was an accurate
representation of what actually what
actually happened what they chose to do
with that information was it was there
was their business and then a third case
which is motivated a lot by the ebay
rating rating system is a self-reporting
feedback mechanism again you have your
personal experience and now what we
allowed people to do is give a score too
every transaction did they like it or
not like it okay plus or minus you know
1 1 or 0 and what we presented to
everyone when they were making their
decisions on who they might want to
enter into contracts with is the score
that they got from all people that they
had had transactions within the past now
if everybody reported accurately then
this score would be the same as high
this high information case but of course
they don't have to report a they just
say whatever they say whatever they want
and so this was an example where this
kind of if let's say you need it to do
the high information case in order to
get things to work well but then you say
well that's really costly you have to
have someone that can verify all the
informations and so on could you get
away with it just the self reporting
mechanism would that work you're more or
less as well or is it complete terrible
yeah
I know you me in the past or now know so
this all happen transaction right now
you just you just show and aggregate it
usually you know your aggregate score
well you know you don't necessarily but
you know your aggregate score and so say
at the very beginning you could see if
you wanted to help how that change and
so that actually is an interesting one
of extra variation we could look at a
little bit more on breaking out that
kind of detail with that would that
matter when people could have various
kind of punishment strategies and yeah
so then again so these are three choices
that we did and there are plenty more
other interesting ones too in these
experiments the only failure the only
way people could choose to be like not
not to cooperate is by not fulfilling
their their contracts in this context
it's like everybody agrees on what makes
good behavior versus bad behavior it's
not like saying movie recommendations
where you can get a recommendation from
someone and you think oh this is the
greatest recommendation I always listen
to this person someone else gets the
same recommendation because their taste
in movies is quite different they say oh
those are terrible recommendation I'm
never going to listen to those that
would be a different kind of a
reputation context when it depends
partly on different people evaluating
what a transaction what it means to be a
good or bad transaction in this context
it's simpler that is everyone agrees
that if you get money it's better than
not getting the money and if you get a
promise good it's better than not
getting it so there it's a much simpler
context in which the reputation take
takes place but not that's not to say
that's the only kind of situation in
which in which reputation is important
so let me talk a little bit about our
results we looked a bit at aggregate
behaviors that is how did it affect the
market and then a little bit more at
individual behaviors and I'll just I'll
just go through these and if you have
any there that are particularly
interesting to you we can stop and spend
a bit more time on them so here is what
we saw with aggregate market statistics
and we don't really have a good
understanding of why this happened and
we've tried a number of
simple simple kinds of models and
haven't been able to find a good one yet
but basically what we see is it you have
different amounts of fulfillment or in
different parts of the experiment the
price pretty much stays around what the
we as the experimenters know should be
the equilibrium according to economic
theories and so on but the trading
volume has a rather different kind of
behavior and that is when fulfillment is
low the volume of contracts people enter
2 enter into is higher you know possibly
because they think of all I don't expect
anyone to fulfill it maybe I have to
have a lot of contracts but I don't have
to fulfill them either or whatever we
don't know what's going on in their
heads that would explain consistently
all these all these these three
aggregate aggregate statistics and so
that's that's an interesting open
question and that the third one is what
we call market efficiency and that's
basically the question is at the end of
the day how much of the money at the
experimenter that we had on the table
for them did they go home with and so
ideally if every case where there say a
five dollar that could match with the
ten-dollar in that supply and demand
every case had a transaction so they
went home with as much money as they
could extract out of the experimenters
as possible then that would be a high
efficiency case yeah so is that a guess
I you guys I didn't mention we also had
noise in this experiment so so sometime
this is to distinguish between intent
and delivery so sometimes you could
intend to deliver something and like ten
percent of the time of just disappear in
the mail so this theoretical efficiency
is with respect to the average noise now
in some experiments it could just be
your lucky to have a little bit less
noise than this ten percent just by the
flip of the coin and so and if lots of
people fulfill in that case you can be
well you can be a bit higher this
question always comes up and I'm yours
to think of there should be some simple
way of you know of explain it but it
turns out it's good and see is anyone
pays paying attention of how can
efficiency be above a hundred percent
and so it's really what's in the
denominator good good question was that
the new concussion is so the market
efficiency was really quite high when
fulfillment was high and one one reason
for this is that the the contracts that
were not fulfilled tended to be ones
that would not trade in equilibrium
anyway and so perhaps someone really
made a really good deal and the reason
it's a good deal is because they didn't
intend to fulfill it you know maybe we
don't know again what's going on inside
people people's heads but that
transaction should not have happened
anyway if the market was were really
efficient everyone was rational so that
kind of unfulfilled contract results in
a wealth transfer that if someone gets
money that the other person maybe should
have had but it doesn't change the
amount that we as the experimenters or
the market as a whole you know gets gets
from the trade so there are other things
besides efficiency that are important
for for markets but that's that is one
of the things that we observed happening
for in the high fulfillment case here's
here's an exact to show you just a
little bit of data of what what actually
happens we say in this case run ran the
experiments for 12 to 12 to 16 times and
you see toward the end although they
don't we don't announce the end of the
game until two periods ahead of time
people know that when the clocks getting
near 5pm is getting near the end of the
end of the game and so what you see here
of course is toward the end of the game
there's I have no benefit from having a
high reputation when I'm not going to be
playing with these people much anymore
so hey I might as well take the money
and run and so it so everyone knows that
and we really sort of see this this
whole crash here so it's fortunately we
were able to run the thing experiments
long enough to see some discrimination
earlier early on you know one thing that
rational players could say is well look
I know at the very end no one's going to
bother to fulfill they're not going to
care about reputation so that the time
before that there's no point in
fulfilling because even if I have a high
reputation not going to give me anything
anyway and you just backwardly it
induced that and say well I shouldn't do
any fulfillment in the beginning in in
some sense that's a nice prediction of
rational game theory it's not what
people do
and you know it fortunate for them
because they can walk home with more
money than if they didn't do any trades
at all we also had a look at
self-reporting accuracies which should
not be very high in this in this
experiment so over ninety percent of the
cases people reported a transaction
whether it is good or bad based on what
actually happened in that in that
transaction but the inaccurate cases
have a high bias toward bad reports and
again we don't know why this this is
maybe people are punishing for things
that happen further in the past or
they're just upset about things or
they're trying to you know who knows
what so so if you look if we look here
there's cases what actually happened you
received your money or good and you
didn't receive it and this is what
rating you gave that I say it was a good
thing or not so the accurate ones are
here and here you received that you said
you was good here the inaccurate ones I
did not receive it but I said it was
good transaction and and and vice versa
and we just see this box tends to be
bigger than that box and again it's an
observation don't have a good a good
reason you know for that we also saw
some behaviors that are similar to what
I described to you with some of the
earlier simpler situations we did see
some evidence of tit-for-tat people
would punish by not fulfilling with
contracts with people who had in essen
didn't fulfill their contracts in the
past and so from these experience we can
get both information about market
behavior we can compare different
information policies and get some idea
of individual behavior and we do find
that information policy is a strong
determinant of how well the market works
at least in this context self-reporting
was pretty much as good as high
information although it has some bias
terrors and non-fulfillment was
occasionally used as retaliation now
more recently we've also done some
comparisons with a particular website so
I mentioned there are these different
approaches to evaluating mechanisms game
theory field studies and laboratory
experiments prosper calm is a simple
micro of microfinance web
site which involves getting lots of
people to aggregate together to loan
money to two people that would have a
hard time getting it safe from banks or
have to pay high interest rates and we
were comparing what we saw in our
experiment with what we saw with evident
evidence of happening on an prosper and
then also just just for comparison like
to see what happens with these much
simpler models that I talked about these
simple scenarios and in particular we
see when we compared with the simple
scenarios they don't allow people to do
a lot of interesting behaviors so you
can't see it even even if you wanted to
you don't have the ability to exclude
and so on one interesting thing we
didn't see evidence in their experiments
of price discrimination that is I could
give a bad deal to someone that has a
low reputation and maybe they're
desperate enough that they have to take
it we didn't we didn't see evidence of
that we saw a lot more evidence of
people that's ostracize and don't refuse
to do business with with people but it's
interesting to compare what do our
experiments do with what happens in some
field studies a variety of open issues
would be nice to have a comprehensive
theory that describes how these
different mechanisms work in practice
with real people how might people use
strategic reporting what about
specialization if there's if different
people are somewhat more in monopolistic
situations could they afford to have a
lower reputation but people have to deal
with them anyway what about identity
change you have a bad reputation you
just go offline for a while and log back
in with a new name and how do people
connect connect that up can you make use
of networks of trust is that we devise
an essay in social networks so you value
reputation reports from your friends
more than just some random stranger who
might be the friend of the other person
and you don't you don't know that
there's a variety of broader issues
going back to the three approaches that
I mentioned in trying to encourage good
behavior finding combinations of
technology mechanisms and public policy
how does that depend on on culture and I
would just like to point out if you're
interested in this is there's a couple
of good books that describe a bit more
of the policy context around some of
these issues
and both these people are really great
speakers if you ever have an opportunity
to to to hear them that look a lot of
the social and policy issues with the
emphasis being it's not just technology
technology enables a lot of new things
gives us new problems new capabilities
new opportunities but it's important to
keep in mind the the context and these
are two places that you might might find
that helpful okay and so you have any
questions typically the range in our
experiments is a bit new 75 to 150
dollars and so that would be about the
about the range what they were and yeah
some people have either a better lock or
better traders or for whatever reason so
that that's wrong in this yiannis in
this bit so that was a range in this in
this particular area pretty much oh it's
pretty much like a bell like a bell
curve in there but not in all
experiments and just in this in this
particular one um no they certainly
could have been not not anything that
that that we saw well I mean that there
are any some examples in much larger
scale auctions of companies using some
digits of their prices to signal to
their competitors what they should or
shouldn't be bidding and you know the
questions you could design experiments
to try to pick those those kind of
things those kind of things out to or
situations in which that would be
properly in this in this context the
amount of time that people have we give
them at a couple minutes per round and
so on plus they don't have a chance
ahead of time to sort of sit in the back
room and decide you know hey this is
what we should do makes it makes that
harder but you certainly could have
situations we tried to hear
sort of side channels and is that
happening where there is sort of broad
collusion among people may have the
amount of light networks well they don't
they don't tell anyone but in the the
what but what their what there is and
certainly is is side discussions so you
it's another way of sharing reputation
information and so you might say well
I'm thinking of doing business with this
person is there anyone else that has
done so I actively seek information you
can have side conversations you know
like like that it's another thing the
internet facilitates and of course you
can read things that people say that may
or may not be true and you have to make
it you have to make an evaluation on
that as well okay thanks thanks for your
