recall but unfortunately it's been
that's okay mom we'll move on to the
actual introduction video
so that's I think a good introduction to
what my project is it's called Aston
it's a submission to the 2009 NASA Space
Center design competition but that
pretty much means is I'll show that the
contest guidelines but it pretty much
tasks high school students with
designing all aspects of a space
settlement or in habitation within the
next 50 years so I guess I'm gonna go on
to exactly what my presentation will
consist of so I'll start off with
talking pretty much what the contest
requires you to do what the guidelines
are then I entered the design philosophy
so what I really took into account the
structural design the construction
process the life-support systems social
structure acknowledges and closing
remarks and any big gamers that they
would realize that the song that I
played in the inertial video was
actually halo anyway so on to the
contest guidelines so I'm sure you guys
not really sure what the actual contest
is but like I said it's designing all
aspects of a space none of them to be or
debating anywhere and it's required for
a minimum of 10,000 residents and
supporting a transition population of
over 300 people it must be physically
constructed within 50 years using
beautiful reasonable extranet
extrapolations of existing technology so
nothing like an T like phasers or little
spaceships or anti-gravity devices or
anything like that so it has to be
something that you can really build with
existing technology so that's something
I really took into account and I should
really focus on that one but oh and if
you guys have any questions feel free to
just yell em out of division so the
design philosophy so whatever they try
to take into account when I was looking
at this contest they were really four
important guiding principles I'm most
you guys have engineers so I'm sure you
might have seen this in your courses in
the university or high school whatever
the the idea of modularity so parts that
you can interchange of one another or
placing with something else or gonna
modify them expand VT cetera the idea of
mass production efficiency cost
reduction etc the use of existing
technology like I said no replicators no
lasers no transporters antimatter that
doesn't exist of course in ecosystems
systems what I'm just pretty much trying
to say is make sure that it's livable
for people and not for robots so any one
of your Google's out there should be
able to live comfortably on the station
and not have to come back to earth
so amazing that it's gotta go into
overall layout of what the whole station
really looks like so you see there's no
vocalization there are they can be
divided into three main areas the
fabrication region as you can see there
the central industry hub and Inter
special structure in terms of the size
it really stand from the total height
from 1.7 kilometers high through one
kilometer in diameter and can support a
maximum population of twenty two
thousand four hundred people so the
habitation region itself consists mainly
of a series of pods
that's actually the basis of the entire
station and these pods are actually
developed from something that NASA
developed in handy for called the trans
hab module now what the transit module
is is essentially a giant balloon you
send it into space you inflate it and
you can live in it so on the left you
can see there with the black background
that's the trans hab concept so you can
see the people living there we are just
finished with the exact same and add in
solar panels the outside of it and
that's the same thing on the right now
inside it's pretty much like a
condominium and you guys live in the
house or condominium I'm sure you guys
have seen this you have your own bedroom
you got like a living room out there you
know open-concept kitchen a bathroom the
only thing that just doesn't provide you
is natural gas because it's explosive so
so each of these pods is around 11,000
200 of these parts and these parts are
connected to what we call wing segments
now these make segments are nothing more
than giant hallways like the office
hallways you see up in you're outside
the Google offices but so they produce
link all of these parts together and the
special thing about these is like the
habitation modules they're all
mass-producible they're composed of tiny
little segments called range segments
themselves and these are pretty much
drawn together like blocks of Lego and
you simply weld them together and you
got your whole bin hopping right there
you've also got attached to these pause
something called support structures
because gravity is
on the station you don't want the
balloon sort of sang downwards you want
to keep it on the stick position so we
have steel poles with hydraulic clamps
on them that would secure these habitats
much as in place so these rings have
ring segments actually the structure of
them is also you can see there's a
picture there of the habitation module
with the actual ring segments connected
together but this structure of the ring
segments is based upon what the
aerospace industry uses in the jet
liners which is a semi-monocoque shell
so what that consists of is a stressed
metal skin over a series of struts and
those struts in this case are composed
of titanium and carbon fiber so it's
meant to provide a really really strong
structure at the same time with a low
weight so these ring segments are
connected to what we call vestibules if
you saw in the picture before the design
boxes these giant boxes contain
everything that's required for life
support so oxygen production recreation
loose ball tables and rock band and well
pretty much everything you see there's a
bit of a park there too but yeah so they
connect to these vestibules and so you
can imagine them if you're like a
condominium building like church normal
office set on the hour
your little pods are like your there
were separate apartments and this would
be like the swimming pool you can see on
the inside are composed to four levels
levels one two four level two is the one
with the actual gravity level I'll tell
you how gravity's made and but there's a
different varying levels of gravity and
then the upper levels would have lower
gravity the lower levels would have
higher gravity and then you can use it
with several things in fact there's a
whole separation you can see that level
one is mainly meant for agricultural
purposes or meat growing I'll talk about
that more that later on
hydroponic planting level 2 consists of
all the parts that you would don't want
to see your pool tables your gyms your
pools your arms etc level 3 consists of
water filtration and storage so how we
recycle the water how everything is kept
alive and the bottom part is secondary
energy stored so electricity so what
makes the lights run so the structure of
the vegetables themselves how they're
maintained their shape
it's actually based upon space frames
you might have seen them with
buckminsterfullerene jisuk domes or with
the biosphere 2 but this is the exact
same thing it uses steel tubes arranged
in triangular structure is to provide
our very strong language support system
so they all come together and this is
what they pretty much look like of
course you can see that the pods it's
multiple habitat pods they connect you
see the ring hallways and these ring
hallways come into the giant box or the
best of you and the best we see is
something coming out of it I'll talk
more about that later on so that's what
the habitation region looks like itself
so if you move on to the next part of
the station called the central industry
up you see it's a giant white cylinder
in the center that's pretty much where
all of the zero-gravity manufacturing
and research takes place on one of the
station it's separated into a bunch of
different segments there's a docking
network at the top but it's mainly meant
for manufacturing purposes research
maybe a Google office somewhere and as
well as primary energy storage as well
as the DioGuardi space hotel so on there
it's actually isolated from the location
of the entire space station which is how
we've been here in gravity but it's
isolated from it using magnetic bearings
which has been developed by NASA and
it's currently under perfection
so pretty much entire space in stins I
start spins but like like an axle and a
ball bearing everything would spin but
the central industry itself would not
move at all I would say motionless thus
having to do a gravity so if you let's
say to fly up to my space station Aston
you would fly up in let's say space plan
and you dock through here which would be
a docking network consists of a series
of each of these tubes I would shut out
from the central corridor
there's a few much stock here you'd
float out of your space shuttle into
your central corridor and you can pass
by and thirsty might pass by it's a
space hotel now this is meant for where
we support you know your family members
let's say your mother-in-law or
something like that people you don't
want to see in a house you just stick
them into your hotel where they can live
for up to three weeks in a zero-gravity
and they have observation
they've been staring at the Stars or in
the pitch blackness of space
okay mother-in-law you can just stick
her in the
women little watch TV now so after you
pass the hotel you can see the central
quarters in the center but after you
pass hotel you passed the satellite
manufacturing which is where the bulk of
money comes into the station so there is
actually the satellite manufacturing is
divided into sub compartments themselves
and can actually open into this space
and release you know spacecraft
satellites whatever so there's different
segments you've got the offices which
are gray you've got the parts
manufacturing which is red and then
you've got the storage which i think is
green and then you've got the blue
section which is final assembly and then
release so that's pretty much all of the
central industry hub but then we move on
to the final section of the social
design which is the inter special
structure so if you imagine the entire
space station as a giant bicycle wheel
this would be the spokes of the bicycle
wheel so in fact the bicycle wheel
spokes are the inter spatial structure
not all of them actually connect the
central industry hub you have some parts
which are actually floating just around
it they were not necessarily connected
you can sort of see them with whether
called transport channels and those are
the elevators you saw with the magnetic
bearings on them but then you have what
they call it just look gravity labs now
these are just with gravity labs in
order to minimize the amount of bearings
found on the station these pretty much
sort of float on the surface of the
central ownership and don't exactly come
in contact with it so what these chamber
channels are they're nothing more than
giant elevators the only difference with
these elevators is that they have cables
on the top and below for those years you
understand the physics I'm sure you guys
have taken in high school
gravity levels vary from the central
industry hub to the habitation region so
it's necessary to have complete tension
at all times with the elevator car it's
a double-decker elevator just so you can
have high volumes of cargo and high
volumes of people now they just about
gravity labs these labs are there's two
of them in each of the channels and I
think there's 15 15 channels in total so
30 labs each of these labs can move up
and down the entire channel I can
Barbarian gravity levels so let's say
you want to test something
how would working
how it work on Mars you simply stick it
in addition to the interest to the edges
with gravity lab and move it up and down
so that's pretty much the general
outline of the design on what the whole
wall space station looks like but now it
goes up to the finite details of how you
can actually construct it so I'm sure
you guys have seen this in University
Gantt charts everyone loves them so this
much is a timeline of construction is
tomato
barring any sort of political problems
money problems financial that always
screws things over but it should take
roughly 30 years preparation phase is 15
construction phase is 12 and the
habitation phase is sweet I'll be
focusing more on the construction phase
preparation phase and habitation phase
outlines of course about that later but
the construction begins really in lunar
orbit we have a mining facility or we
hope never mind a facility on the moon
get raw materials like titanium iron etc
and from that point we build the central
industry huh oh sorry placement first my
bad so the most important thing is to
realize where would this space station
be placed there's a whole bunch of place
you can stick it around Jupiter and
sticking around the Sun you can stick it
you know anywhere really but for me most
space stations have three possibilities
those what they call the garage points
lowest low Earth orbit which is where
the ISS is and the geostationary orbit
which is where you find the GPS
satellites so the first option was the
LaGrant orbits and in fact many space
stations that have won the contest
before have used Lagrange points mainly
because are dynamically stable by their
means geometrically and also because of
gravitational forces but the problem is
is that you can see the distances from
the earth to the moon they're quite far
and of course we want to make it as
feasible as possible and that's a
business model that's not very good so
the other option is low Earth orbit
which is where you see the ISS and of
course that's very useful because most
of the satellites are located there it's
very easy to accessible and everything
but the problem is is that it's not in
sync with the rotation of the earth so
communications are a bit of a problem
and at the same time you have to
constantly keep boosting the station
otherwise it might you know burn back
into Earth and might you know land in
Australia or somewhere so the other
option of course is geostationary orbit
the geostationary orbit like I said
where GPS satellites are located that's
really really good location because it's
always about one spot on the earth at
all times
another benefit is that it's always
within reach of the Sun sunlight the
only difference is that verbal equinoxes
the spring and the fall you know when
you have the summer and winter equinoxes
then you lose about an hour when you're
the darkness but the rest of the time
you're always in the light of the Sun
which is good for us for energy purposes
so now in terms of the actual
construction process you could begin
like I said on the moon in time lunar
orbit with the construction of the
central industry or even giant cylinder
I like to say before the paper roll she
said with the toilet paper roll and then
you stick little beans or sequins on
them and these are pretty much that
inter special structure that you saw
before or these elevators you can just
chop them into little bits and you stick
them on the sides and you sort of strap
them on there
once you complete instruction middle
orbit you transfer that into
geostationary orbit and you can start
construction of your vestibules now
these vestibules you have to be built
them in space or true Dodgers sent up
from Earth and then since everything is
strapped on to the center and Shihab you
simply drop them about them in another
are welcome together and you have
starting to transport channels so you
can see they're just what gravity labs
have not been released yet but you can
see the next one they get unfurled as
well attached together and then you go
so then after that's done while all of
this is being done on earth the
manufacturing facility hopefully in
Florida there is a certain construction
the mass production of bring segments so
those that's jetliner fuselage structure
you saw before as well as those balloons
or saw the habitat modules so that mass
production begins and then and then once
that's there all done construction there
they set him up in the space and join
together like blocks of Lego so after
the wings having its are on you fire up
the habitat modules screw them into
place and inflate them and that's the
whole station and then the final step is
to add solar panels just to generate
some electricity itself so what the now
it's on to exactly how we're going to
build the station has a spacecraft
there's a lot of stuff we have right now
NASA is developing the Ares 5 you know
we have the Space Shuttle is retiring a
whole bunch of different things but 50
years in the future hopefully something
is more advanced
because it takes a long time really to
construct or even small things in space
so we also emphasized the fact that we
had to use existing technology so the
construction marginal as the
construction vehicle develop is called a
modular
mobile construction vo modular
construction vo ago and this is where
the the concept of modularity really
applies so this is the base
configuration it's actually based upon
the new Ares 5 rocket developed by NASA
which is going to be used to fire a man
on the moon so you take the parts where
you stick the the lunar lander you
replace that with what we have here
which is the command pod and the
structural core etcetera and some days
you can attach a canid mention canada
arms so here's one configuration and in
this configuration you see there's a
whole bunch of canada arms stuck on the
ends and those are giant pretty much
like you know hands whatever they can do
the work for you without having to send
people in spacesuits and then you've got
also down there unless you can see the
words dexterous manipulator or Dexter
and from that Dexter you can do even
more fine work like removing battery
screwing in screws excetera so that's
one configuration the other
configuration also uses the Canada arm
again when uses what they use on the ISS
called the mobile surveillance station I
believe so that pretty much means it's a
giant wall nominate John it's server
train and it latches on two tracks
located around the entire space station
so let's say you can simply drop it off
like a mothership drop off the arm and
the arm can travel a lot of tracks let's
say to the other side of the station and
build something there so that's
construction that transport is another
issue this is what we have here is the
moon transport so let's say you want to
get your miners from the moon back to
earth but you want to get some space
station whatever this is what you would
be using and this once again uses
existing technology the central core
that the the central section there would
be engine on it is also the Ares 5 so
that's already been developed no changes
there and this stuff on the sides is
actually another modular component and
that's actually uses area and five
rocket boosters so stuff that the
European Space Agency fires into space
they use these Rockets you can use the
shells and pretty much produce two
different configurations you can use a
cargo configuration will stick like or
on there you can
- you know TVs or anything at all
and you got passage two compartments
where you can stick people so that's fun
for the move to the station but from the
earth to the station also something we
can use as space planes which has been
in development with Lockheed Martin
skunk works as well as NASA which is the
venture star the x-33
unfortunate at'll but we can revive it
hopefully and pretty much it's a giant
space plane so it launches into space
vertically and glides back down like the
space shuttle so this is another use of
assistive technology around the station
now the cost space stuff is notorious
more notorious in software development
for being way way way too expensive so
of course this is a general estimate but
- bunch of calculations through labor
materials support facilities research
and development R&amp;amp;D I kind of estimated
lowball cost it cost around five hundred
sixty two billion dollars so roughly I'm
not sure maybe half of what Obama's
often right now for economic stimulus
now so that's what the cost of course
could be but barring time delays
research problems I'm sure you guys have
all recognized that this could each each
of the two to three trillion dollars it
is a really big project and I recognize
that so that ends in terms of the whole
construction area now how we really
support life on the station because you
can any fire person to the space but if
they die from the lack of oxygen or they
don't have any food to eat then that's a
bit of a problem so we want to make sure
that they can live up there they can be
born there they can die they can they
can live the whole life stay pretty much
so the life-support systems is what's
there in place your admission that they
survive so the first part I'm gonna
coming is a thermal control and the palm
is in space you don't have an atmosphere
so that when you move let's say from the
darkness of the the far side with the
sunlight it changes you know two to
three hundred degrees Celsius which is a
major problem because you want people
boiling and then freezing and boiling
and freezing miserable day to be
uncomfortable so we want to make sure
that we maintain you know proper
of comfort within the station and that's
accomplished by using actually the
infrared energy from the Sun it actually
heats an exterior cooling pipe network
containing silicon oil which is a
coolant and that pretty much heats it up
and then that we're going to a hot
coolant tank which use an induction
heating which uses the magnetic fields
to generate heat and now we'll keep it
warm and then you can use that to heat
the air or and hit the water so it's
sort of like what they use now so low
heating but more high-tech and then it
can be cooled down with using radiator
panels developed by NASA's Glenn
Research Center so that's how we keep
ourselves warm and comfy on the station
so that's pretty much live demonstration
of how gravity is produced on board the
station uses centripetal force or
inertia the spinning of the station
means that all the people on the station
are subjected to movement and because of
this the floor is pretty much movement
against them all the time because it's
rotating there's a force thing sort of
downwards into the floor of the station
and that's how you get gravity so that's
pretty much you saw in the animation
beginning through the whole station
spinning that's how we generate gravity
and that's the reason why in the center
of the entire space station there's no
gravity whatsoever because so now into
oxygen production so how do we recycle
the oxygen you you don't want to stop
the office environment you want to make
sure it's like nice and breathable
people suffocating or dying so there's
actual whole system developing around
that and the basis of oxygen recycling
is algae tanks which was developed in
Boeing in 1961 so what this pretty much
means is you see a green
Center that contains a whole bunch of
algae and surrounding that is
high-intensity discharge lamps now these
lamps allow the out to the undergo
photosynthesis and algae is extremely
efficient at photosynthesis around 8%
which is on par with sugarcane but
pretty much that would you know change
to carbon our Sun to oxygen and then
from that point we're going to an air
composition monitor just to see may she
have an abortion if it doesn't have
enough it's back and core so again and
once that sign it goes into a HEPA
filter because you don't want to be
breathing in algae and you also want to
make sure that it doesn't smell like wet
hay so once is that options been done it
goes to the Karoo which is a modular
component located at the entrance of any
single room on board the station whether
they send for a regulating units central
air reg many units the critter was a
giant air conditioners or you know
thermostats they can control the
temperature the humidity as well as the
cleanliness of the air so let's say you
want to set up a micro processing
manufacturing facility next door in the
next room all you simply just change the
crew swap out some air conditioners
taking a whole bunch of air filters and
you have a clean room right there so
that's what the crew can do and after
the courier has adjusted it to your own
personal liking it inputs into the room
the laboratory whatever facility you're
into so once it's done let's say you
don't breathing out you have carbon
oxygen in the room it's pumped out it's
filtered again because you don't want
any dust contaminating the algae and
then it goes into thermal control system
before with the radiator network so then
it's cooled off and then we heat it to
the proper temperature and then once
again the whole cycle begins so water
filtration so that's another problem on
living in space unless you want to
constantly fire up snacks like ruffles
chips and chocolate or whatever you want
to make sure that people can grow their
own food because it is self sustainable
in this case water has to be recycled
it's very expensive to ship things up
from the space videos in the future so
you have to recycle what you have so
water filtration begins really from
let's say your sink with your toilet
from that point the wastewater is
separate into categories which is what
the energy terms as grey water and black
water so grey water is pretty much what
you find from your sinks you know you're
so
the drought or whatever and the black
water is what goes on the toilet so both
of this grab on a blackboard agency goes
into ozone treatment which always have
molecules which are highly reactive are
bubbled into the solution and they kill
a lot of bacteria and pathogens when
that point is separate into one point on
the other the gray water goes up to
micro filtration reverse osmosis which
is used by companies like Aquafina and
designing whatever and then you have
black water which goes after high
temperature pressure vessel which is
nothing more than a giant cooker so it
cooks the the waste water to kill any
more bacteria so the second step of
disinfection and once that's done the
black water then goes into
centrifugation so it spins and then that
separates sort of the the waste material
into both urine and fecal matter
the urine is then sent off to
ultraviolet disinfection so they pretty
much expose it to UV rays to kill any
more bacteria the fecal matter goes at
the robic respiration in which you have
back here eating off any more organic
matter so from these points essentially
it's another whole cycle and the end of
the cycle shows that you can use the
urine as fertilizer nitrogen fertilizers
for agriculture and you can use the
human fecal matter once again as
agricultural fertilizer as well and the
carbon dioxide produced by respiration
the bacteria can also be used for
farming so that's water filtration in
our aunt electricity which is a major
problem of course you can't buy
computers in space without tricity you
cannot anything without electricity
onboard the station so the main source
of electricity onboard this is solar
energy in fact there's three different
acknowledges that you've been using you
can use multi multi Junction
photovoltaics
you can also use like guided solar
optics as well as an antenna so those
are three different technologies in
development multi Junction photovoltaic
is pretty much using the different
spectrums of the Sun a specific
semiconductors and from that form you
can generate a more more efficiency in
terms of electricity light guided solar
optics it's a bit of a variation upon
that in which the light is concentrated
actually this was developed by Canadian
company called Morgan solar so rather
than using giant mirrors to do it uses a
material acrylic plastic and human
and shapes of triangles and whatnot -
pretty much
channel the light aren't you one
multi-junction photovoltaic cell which
is a lot cheaper than trying to put them
all around you you know really expensive
solar cells across the entire station
the other option is what they call nano
antenna which is under development in
the US which it uses the infrared
electricity to generate a current within
antennas a frequency of AC current and
that unfortunately is not feasible right
now because the current is much to hide
samaan I think 60 million Hertz and we
only wanted 60 Hertz which is a lot
larger than that but that's something
under development and if it gets about
in the future that can be easily news so
all that's electricity though it has to
be stored somewhere because you're not
always in the sauna maybe you have the
times when electricity demand is really
high or really low you want to make sure
you have continuous solar electricity
and so the way to store that is using
flywheels batteries unfortunately not
efficient for long-term storage and the
best option that's most feasible is used
turning that electrical energy into
kinetic energy or rotational energy so
fly was operate by spinning a giant
motor letting it spin and then when you
want to let it you know just you simply
attached generator to it and it slows
down but converts that energy into
electrical energy and a benefit of this
as well is that it counteracts is
spinning the gyroscopic force exerted by
the spinning of the station if you spin
these pots in the opposite direction
then the countess de force and therefore
it's not a bigger problem
so another thing though is that you may
not generate enough electricity solar
cells and them to be incredibly
inefficient so another option is to use
what they call mobile energy platforms
this is pretty much giant power
satellites that exist right next door to
the station and they be many so
electricity generate on to the station
or in terms of low demand they can
actually be meet down to earth and they
can sell electricity money which could
help the construction so now that's
electricity that's how we get you know
energy about the station now how do we
grow food the main thing is we can use
soil soil is also you know there's a lot
of problems with in terms of the air
block
a lot of forms of war pathogens etc so
what mostly uses hydroponics and in fact
this here is passive hydroponics so no
active system is really being you know
pumping nutrient solution into there
this is actually uses you know sort of a
matrix of sponges pretty much like
planting seeds and sponges and your
similar to sponge into solution of
nutrients which in this case of your
fecal matter that's been treated in the
urine and that would then suck with soak
up the nutrients and would give the seed
how much it needs in any time better
than over feeding it or under video so
it's a passive system you don't have to
worry about you know constantly watering
your plants but with this agricultural
system develops the whole nutrient cycle
in which you can you know take your poo
and make it into food and make your food
back into poo again so it starts off
with him consumption on the left and you
can see that the organic waste your
green beans really want to go to Grandma
compost the waste water say anything as
well and it pretty much it goes into the
end of crops and algae tanks the algae
case it's fed to keep you make oxygen
and the crops of course to give you food
now in the excess algae growth let's say
that goes too much you want to get rid
of it or those it overflows your
container it can be used and stuck into
a grinder now this grinder when then
kind of breaks it down and this liquid
bottom you can then be used to grow meat
now the speaker is sounds really sort of
disgusting right now but it actually has
been in development so far in the States
or were to use a collagen matrix and
they stimulate the growth of muscle
cells and that's how you can get paid to
grow in the in conversation so you get
all your food groups you get your deer
well not Derek you got your meat and
your vegetables all in one and soft
drinks if you want to shoot them up in
the earth but yeah you get the model on
the station you're not to worry about
shipping cost so now in terms of safety
space is a dangerous place I'm sure you
all know that you can't just jump out
the window
you will die so safety is a really
important thing if something happens in
the station you have to leave there has
to be a lot of ways to keep them in
place so the major problem in space is
asteroids the things flying on in space
you know
astronaut gloves bits of lock anything
are those space stations they could be
flying around and if they hate your
station
you're in big trouble so the way to
prevent that is using something NASA's
developed and is using on their
spacecraft called multi shock shields
but this pretty much is is a bunch of
next health fabric layers and the
particle that hits it would kind of
shatter into smaller fragments with each
successive layer of nextel and that
would pretty much kind of making it from
a giant rifle shot into a shotgun blast
so I went to shotgun blast exterior wall
it has a lot less energy and therefore
has less nobility penetrate so this
applies to the entire station and this
is another example use of existing
technology stuff that's already in use
and doesn't require anything fancy at
all no shields nothing of them so
another problem with space is radiation
now
most people on earth use equate
radiation protection with lead and that
is that is true but suddenly the company
has developed in the States called
radiations new technologies it's
something called demo on our demo on is
a lightweight fabric that integrates
heavy atomic nuclei into a polymer
fabric and that what that simulates is
it emulates the high electron cloud of
heavy atomic metals like light and you
know other ones like that uranium oh and
what that does is it allows you to give
you the same benefit of lead but at a
lower weight a lower cost and of course
a lot more flexible and that's a benefit
for our station because you know the
worried about weight restrictions
anymore because it's a piece of fabric
rather than a giant block bed so that's
what radiation protection but of course
in case all these systems go wrong you
need to evacuate the station it's
important to have lifeboat systems
available so this is an image of the the
habitat modules or those balloons with
the ring segments and every seven
high-tech modules you have what they
call escape niggles they didn't scape
vehicles or cream it's identical sorry
larger versions of what the ISS was in
development called the crew return
vehicle
unfortunately was scrapped again my NASA
but once again this is pretty much
miniature space shuttle that could
pretty much land on its own so once
again there's another use of assistive
technology every seven habit or
emergency you got one of these so let's
say fire happens on the station you have
to get
you can simply boil nacelles and fly
back to earth another benefit of this
where the habitat molitor's is that they
detachable so let's say something
catastrophic happens on the habitat
module you want to isolate and you want
to you know get rid of it
you can simply eject the module and
please put another one so now on to the
social structure so you build a space
station for people you don't build a
space station for robots it's important
to have services in place that would
keep them comfortable and happy and like
your catering your usable tables
anything of that sort as yet they keep
them comfortable because they are living
there for the rest of their lives so the
most important thing is public services
so public service is this most people
think that would be government so the
most important thing here with
government is there's a whole lot of
bureaucracy issues right now but you
know what the Parliament
you know people bickering back and forth
politics so it's been simplified down
here to a single person in this case the
president who makes all the decisions
and he's advised by series of advisers
I'd say through public service
international relations economic
development etc and he signs the power
makes a bill and this bill becomes law
now in the case that let's say 75% of
his advisers say what you're doing is
wrong or let's say let's say half the
population in the city says what are you
doing get it fixed
then that law is repealed and undergo
severe in them and then the people then
can decide so another thing is
occupation so education here I like the
agency system in Canada it's free which
is good for me for everyone else so
onboard the station is also free but the
education system on where the station is
really separate into three areas of
focus academic development social
development and linguistic development
so academic development is pretty much
like your engineering
Sciences your maths etc social
development is sort of how to be a
person how to be a citizen because it's
one thing to know skills technical
skills but it's also important to know
how to interact with people you know
public speaking leadership skills how to
do your taxes I'm like that's something
we're undergoes Social Development and
the final thing is linguistic
development in fact onboard the station
will be three or Fisher languages and
everyone will Parkton of all three those
languages is English Mandarin Indian the
reason why I chose what languages
English first of all because it is the
language of business
imagine Hindi because China and India
have a very large population they're
about to become superpower soon and if
you want to let your children and kid
here if you want to let your children
have the most success in the world then
you have to make sure that they
understand the best languages or the
most well-spoken and in this case we do
Mandarin in Hindi as well so the schools
are found within each vestibule those
giant boxes about because of this lack
of space they share the Reformation
facilities with the residences there's
also University and board the campus
sorry University Board each vestibule
and each of these this university has
actually separated five different
campuses each campus is located on it to
the vestibules now these these campuses
are individually cater to less than
specific areas so one vested we will say
engineering in campus but focus
specifically on engineering and have all
the facilities necessary computer labs
machine shops etc another one let's say
we focus on the arts they were have a
lot of visual arts studios structural
studios you know full multimedia that
purposes so that would be the campus
itself now based upon the Waterloo
system they have here which i think is
really good the co-op placement program
that's something else there is a
stipulation for all these thing
companies in the station they've
required to give co-op placements to
students such that they know how to look
too far for homegrown talent and at the
same time it's a benefit for the
students right so medicine hospitals as
nothing there as well you don't want to
be shipping people back and forth if
they get a flu or something so each best
view of us have a hospital and you can
see here there's that's pretty much what
the Chancellor conveyances a small
clinic pretty much so taxes everyone
loves taxes right like they say there's
only two things certain in life death
and taxes and on the station there's
nothing different so there's two taxes
on
the station there's corporate tax and
individual tax no sales tax too much
trouble for me to worry about so with
the income tax is based upon the
Canadian system which is the gear to
income ratio so let's say you make
$3,000 your first $19,000 is taxed at 16
percent the $19,000 $40,000 is tax the
22 and Burnap 1 in the next 28 etc
corporate tax is slightly more than
Canada can I believe it's 19 percent on
the station is only 20 so entertainment
recreation everyone loves having fun on
the social right so we have a whole
bunch of ladies located on board we have
a gym we have a pool we have an exercise
room we have foosball tables pool tables
arcade games air hockey a little bit
more than what you have here and we have
locker rooms so that's that's is your
full assortment let's say you want to go
for round while you run around the track
one take a dip there's a pool available
for you when I have some fun with your
friends there's a game room available
want a lift out workout all available
for you as well at the same time we also
have a theater multi-purpose series you
want to run let's say a little school
school show let's say they want to like
make meth or some Shakespearean play or
let's say you want to show off your
breakdancing or DDR skills you can show
them off here you've also got Park which
is actually this necessary because you
can live in an office building all your
life but you probably go insane
so for psychological benefit reasons you
want to have an open space of course you
can't have them carry the open space
otherwise is unfeasible so you have a
smallish sort of park like a park it and
this park of course has all your
memories you know it's got you know
tree-lined pathways it's got a pond so
it's quite it's quite small it's
comfortable and each of these are found
within each vestibule so let's say you
go to one park and you say oh there's
too many people here well that's ok I'll
just walk to the next one so now the
economy so you can build a space station
in space then it all build let's say
everything that happens but you want to
make sure that it stays there you know
for a long time so you want to make sure
that an economy in your business so of
course the economy on the station can be
organized into four different sectors
five areas secondary tertiary and
quarternary
so what the primary sector is
natural resources so the Equality
natural resources the forces leading
them to be used in development and
manufacturing so in our case there's no
stasis resources in space aside from the
moon so that would be our main source of
income the secondary is all the
manufacturing that can take place and
there's a whole bunch but the most
important one it's a spacecraft
construction which I showed you before
with the satellite manufacturing
facility now you can see the estimated
percentage of manufactured GDP is eighty
percent so the benefit of spacecraft
construction is that since it's zero
gravity and it's in space you can build
larger you can build cheaper and you can
build heavier as well not to worry about
any size restrictions or harm with
launch or failures of that sort and
you'll also see a crystal growing
homogeny mixes perfect spheres and
luxury products who doesn't want to buy
a pen made in space
tertiary tourism and banking so tourism
the I know Virgin Galactic is offering
you know a few million dollars you can
go into space for about five minutes but
the same thing can be offered on weather
station as well and can provide some
income support and pay off the
construction fees and provide a real
economy banking is an interesting one
Switzerland is known as the banking
capital country of the world because
it's neutral it's safe and etc but what
beats the country on earth the country
in space unless you fire nuclear missile
at it you can't destroy it so you can
pretty much set up a bank there and
let's say you can you can hold a mutual
funds there you can store gold there you
can store money there and it's pretty
much immune from any sort of you know
physical threat because in space fortune
Airi is the terms of research so
research and development something that
Google I know actively involved in so
there's a whole bunch of berries you can
get involved in you get biomedical
research fundamental biology fluid
physics material behavior combustion
behavior and all this stuff would help
benefit towards a researching economy
and innovation in economy as well as for
manufacturing in the future as well so
now on to the immigration process so how
do I have to even get on the station in
the first place
you have to do a whole bunch of trips at
all in fact when the majority of
inhabitants are sponsored by the
companies because the fact is a Space
Station it is
another planet you can't simply choose
people off the street and say you will
go you google you won't go
it's in order to make the most use of
the facilities onboard the station and
reduce the most amount of productivity
and money it's best that we have
inhabitants sponsored by the company so
you know the word we're retraining or
anything sort but for those who don't
understand sirs are using a point system
similar to Canada's own liberation point
system so you get points let's say for
language for education for racial status
etc also you get on board but on top of
that point system or your sponsoring all
candidates must also undergo an
additional medical examination back on
criminal examination checkers as well we
don't want criminals on the station we
want you know to make the most of our
time adaptation test we're pretty much
gonna stick you in a giant tube and see
how well you live for three weeks and if
you survive you pass and then you've got
the interview which is pretty much it'll
be sitting aside for you ask you bunch
of questions about your family to make
sure that you know you're not psychotic
so that pretty much ends off my whole
station presentation and I guess it goes
on two people have to think really so
the people have to thank the company's
first of all would be NextEra Energy
Resources they're a renewable energy
company they helped me with the poster
printing then you've got daily plan I
think you might want to see on Discovery
Channel they helped conduct my my
project on big 11 by 17 she the Toronto
District School Board and my school know
the secondary school for funding my trip
to Orlando Florida where I'll be
speaking the same presentation project
Google itself for inviting me here as
well as for giving me the opportunity to
make those wonderful pictures you saw
they're all actually free finally my
staff advisors mr. wells miss Evans he
mr. wells really inspired me to do the
project measurements this really helped
me open shed the technical aspects and
any sort of grammatical errors and of
course the most important thing is my
family
my mom and my dad who's sitting here in
the room with you so that pretty much is
it but I guess what's important thing is
you really get out of this is I really
had to recognize this design is nothing
more than a fantasy I come here talking
today I don't expect you to give me
money to help pay for it I know it's not
going to be built it's cost a lot of
money there's inherent flaws within the
design you know it may not be
technologically feasible it sure as heck
is not financially feasible and may not
be socially feasible at this time but
there are ideas of sustainability that
you can really take away from this the
whole idea of you know making sure that
your environment you recycle renewable
energy you know the isolation
you know self sustainability that really
applies both on the stage and here in
modern life and that's and I think that
we should be focusing on with our new
economy but above all it really shows my
own personal hope and dream that space
one wouldn't be colonized and I hope
that you all also share in my dream and
believe in this dream because really any
questions hi so I'm sure you can ask
this many times but where did you get
name asked him from oh astronaut
actually came from Egyptian god named
Toth th o th I didn't really like that
name it doesn't sound way for a station
so I look for one of the alternate names
I pretty much thought is responsible for
is he's the god of divine balance
between good and evil and it's also
credited for by the ancient Egyptians as
a creator of all things
magic philosophical and science and of
course there's a lot of science in here
maybe some philosophical and who knows
maybe
Alex I saw how long did it take you to
design on this station and do all the
drawings graph think about different
aspects and everything like the whole
design for year one year five years well
I actually started this was the third
year that I participated in competition
but the specific design took me nine
months so what's the design perfected
like it's on top of the previous year's
or you simply decided that all one was
not good and you had to change it yeah
actually radically yeah the first year
was actually giant donut like you get
from Tim Hortons same thing just a giant
donut eight kilometer diameter it was a
50 page report it was relatively
rudimentary I was great nine so I didn't
know too much then but as each you
progressed I realized that you know the
ring module is not that feasible anymore
and you have to start looking into stuff
that we have here on earth how to use
existing technology and fire into the
space and make sure that it works and
that one of course that's when I hire
arrived at the final one the second year
I did the same thing at donut and then
this year I decided well that's I think
that's enough I'm not getting anywhere
with this or in terms of the contest and
at the same time it doesn't look really
feasible at all so what I was going to
look at and that's when I came with the
whole pod system
so one deadline are you gonna stop here
you're gonna continue to iterate on the
design and we might see something you
know it'd be nice to continue on the
design but I hope you realize that
there's a future ahead of me I got
education things were over
I got exams I have to find a girlfriend
as a guilherme I would say so so it is a
good project it is a good thought
experiment but this of course there's a
lot more places where I could use my
skills this is a nice thing to do to
combine all my ideas of engineering
technology sociology and biology into
one project but I think it's time for me
to grow into something else great thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
