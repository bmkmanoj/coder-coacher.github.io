and we'll get to why that's cute in a
little bit um and I'm from ISC so for
those of you don't know ises internet
systems consortium where a PI 1 C 3
non-profit public benefit company our
most visible activity is software we
provide open source internet
infrastructure software where the people
behind bind and dhcp and now this new
product after basically if it's got to
do with IP addresses we're probably in
it we also run when the DNS root servers
we have a secondary name service for
public benefit and enterprise customers
we do mirroring for a select group of
public benefit companies but sea lard
our big public things are dns and dhcp
so
that that's who we are who am i why am I
here on the technical lead for ISC after
it is a new product this is not intended
as a product pitch so much as kind of
laying out the problem space the
solution space and you know what we're
doing to try to be in that solution
space we're here to talk about the heat
death of the Internet's now it's just
the heat death of ipv4 and you know what
we're going to do when we run out of
address space and the solution that
we're in right now is called dual stock
light and is implemented in in this
brand new product so um and the
universal deployment ip6 so if the ITF
there are these Scotch ball off spawned
every toast ends with you know to this
or that person and the universal
deployment of ipv6 and someday we'll get
there sooner than flying cars sooner
than gallium arsenide that's it's going
to take a little bit doing so set the
stage we are running out of ipv4
addresses we have been 41 this has been
a crisis for about 15 years
unfortunately we've learned to live with
that and the problem has not gone away
so the unallocated address space is down
to about ten percent of available and
you know with a burn rate of I think
it's about 13 / 8 blocks per year so
we're going to run out no get to that
soon so to be very clear what we're
talking about here you know address
space goes through a certain number of
steps before it's actually provisioned
on your laptop you know
there's the iono unallocated pool they
have the address space that no one else
has they they meter it out in in units
of / 8 box on an as-needed basis to the
regional internet registries we then
parcel out smaller bits of that to the
local internet registries and some of
the bigger eyes peas they in turn parcel
out smaller bits of address space to the
enterprise's on the smaller ISPs and so
you know at every stage there is a
certain pool of unused address space but
what we're looking at is the big one at
the front end this is another important
point that once our addresses are
allocated they almost never go away they
there is no formal mechanism to reclaim
unused address space that that happens
at a not ad hoc lai at the enterprise
level mostly and at the ISP level but um
you know nothing ever goes back into
almost nothing ever goes back into the I
have a preschool
and blisters use after space to you know
the story of the SMT toaster okay this
is something that's you know my former
company a blog technology corporation
did for a demo once to to show off what
SMD can do and you know they had an SMP
controlled toaster the good you know
sets they chose down to a stop light
dark and query it but that means that
your coaster needed an ipv4 address in
order to run this so yeah yeah in the
early days when ipv4 was being designed
there were like of course 32 bits is
enough you know what are you gonna do
but I pee on every doorknob and as well
now we've done that so here we are I
this is the xkcd map of the Internet's
from circuit 2006 I love this that you
know it was kind of reassuring at the
time that you know we're not actually
running out of address space but things
have changed since 2006 and so um all of
these address all these address blocks
are now allocated winter
so actually one of the last ones just
this model is one it is not one so your
canonical example IP address 1 2 23 24
that's going to be a live IP address
sometime real soon here's is this green
Oh is is one little bright spots that
was originally allocated to public data
networks and was reclaimed just a couple
years ago but in general the curve only
goes one way this big block here in the
corner that's 240 to 255 is actually
should not be you know green considered
green fields because that's officially
reserved for future use that's not part
of the eye and a free pool nobody owns
that address space to get it into the
ANA free pool would take you know
intergovernmental action and in the end
woods really only bias you know year
year and a half at the current burn rate
so ah yes I stole this graph from Jeff
Houston's ipv4 reports he's a researcher
in Australia he has done a lot of
research watching the trends in ipv4 and
ipv6 deployment and so as this vertical
line is where we are now the line to
watch is this red line that's the eye on
a free pool and you know that's here we
are now and you know we're going to hit
rock bottom this is one of the magic
numbers is zero and we're going to hit
zero he's estimating September fifth
2011
so what happens then that's that's you
know death of the internet part 1 this
light blue line here is the regional
internet registry pool collectively
there there are five different
registries but you know there it's elit
aggregated here and it's a kind of
sawtooth pattern because you know any
time their ad address space gets a
little low you know they add another / 8
block to that so it's it's been gone up
and down but you know at this point this
gets refreshed and then it slides down
to the magic number of 0 some time a
little later the Green Line is addresses
that are that the regional industry net
registries have assigned their customers
and that is you know going to hit the
magic number of about 220 sometime
shortly thereafter these are the purple
line is addresses that have been
assigned but are not advertised in BGP
so they're not actually in use but they
do belong to you know ISPs and
enterprise customers so this is kind of
flattened out and that's going to drop
off bgp border gateway protocol so at
the same time you know advertised
addresses is going to reach the magic
number of 220 and and that's when you
know it all ends because then there are
no more addresses you know for anyone
the more unallocated addresses for
anyone to play with
right minus my minus this block met 10
and other smaller reserved spots oh ok
so septemberfest 2011 is not that long
so we have to do something soon what do
we do afterwards after we run out of the
unallocated address space we can't just
stop you know the internet still needs
to grow um we have a lot more customers
coming online Mike you know my parents
are on the internet now my phone is on
the internet now my TV is not on the
internet but yours probably is so so you
know we need more you need to serve
those customers in one way or another
there was you know the crisis of the 90s
was with more one of you know we're
we're afraid the routing table is going
to melt down and you know the address
allocation was kind of clunky
class-based addressing denter not to
work so well you know so we went so we
got cider classless routing and you know
we got the regional internet registry
system setup and so you know the
allocation is lot fairer and you know
the routing table works but we're
running into the address space pro that
only gets us so far there are you know
you can throw a lot of machines behind
in that but
that you run into a lot of limiting
factors there
mmm
right so the question was about
reclamation about getting / eight blocks
back and there is not a formal mechanism
to do that at this point there's there's
no mechanism for address trading or
address reclamation so actually the wage
if Houston put it was you at what point
do does the current allocation policy
become irrelevant at what point does it
totally break down and we need a new
policy so just keep in mind even if you
got a / 8 back in the air in region
which is north america canada some of
latin america it last three months so
right but it's a losing game yeah yeah
not so much that it's a losing game that
is that it takes people a long time
responds like I I know in past jobs
we've had to do ipv6 support because the
government was going to switch well that
was years ago and they so it seems to me
you know Oh doing other things to
prevent us running out seem worthwhile
and in fact that's a good segue what was
the best happened we were supposed to go
to ipv6 and we were supposed to get
there bye bye you know everything going
dual stack and you know 624 and other
tunneling mechanisms that's um
encapsulating ipv6 in ipv4 tunneling it
out of just you know to the other little
islands of ipv6 um and you know we put a
lot of the other pieces in place d on
the DNS supports ipv6 dhcp supports ipv6
and so we thought that you know they you
the end user we're going to to drive
this this move to universal ipv6 but
what really happens there was kind of a
collective yawn and you know people went
back to doing what they were doing in
the way that they were doing it they
there's no you know ipv6 killer out to
really Drive this the and I'll say this
as someone who spent a long time you
know doing ipv6 implementations that you
know ipv6 really doesn't give us
anything other than bigger address space
yeah sure there's this you know cool
auto configuration stuff there's the
dentist office scenario where they it's
going to flood their machines in and
they find each other but you know even
the dentist office now it was using a
home gateway or you know soho router
that has dhcp in it so it's already gone
auto configuration effectively so you
know it all comes back to the address
space issue and
what what this slide adds up to is is
there's there was nothing really
compelling driving in the market to ipv6
and nothing really compelling driving
the market away from ipv4 so
unfortunately it really kinda came down
to the the game of chicken where you
know we have to you know where the
internet has to melt down before we
actually go there says it's it and it
says sort of a chicken and egg problem
too because you know the the carriers
aren't rolling out ipv6 because there
isn't a man for it there's not demand
for it because the service is that I
need to get to or on ipv4 and you know
my g4 still works so what's the big deal
so so now here we are and we know where
we need to go we need to go to ipv6 but
we need to continue to support the four
devices the four applications before web
services and it's not all going to
happen at once you know we need to I
mean carriers are going to upgrade their
equipment when they get around to it
it's it's going to be staggered we don't
have a flag day for this and everything
needs just to continue to work you know
I need my amazon order to go through I
need to get to google so so there's been
a lot of activity at the IETF level that
largely to this point in the research
area so we're looking at solutions like
um you know double mat
sixty-four we mentioned six rd is ipv6
rapid deployment which happened that was
I rolled out in France it's basically
extension 2624 you know they basically
rolled out v6 tunneling in a matter of
weeks to their customers you know most
of the rest of this has remained in the
lab there are a number of ITF working
groups working on this stuff or on
pieces of this stuff but it still hasn't
really gelled in the marketplace so what
does any solution that we have here you
know needs to work in the carrier
networks it needs to work in the
marketplace it needs to it needs to
scale up to large carrier size
deployments yeah they need to be able to
stagger X and it's got to work no worse
than the current net you know you still
need to be able to run your peer-to-peer
you need to run your your home servers
and yo it needs to not be worse
performance than what we have now
so now we get to one particular proposal
in the solution space this is the one
that we've been working on it's called
dual stack lights it's currently defined
by an internet draft which means it's
very much in the experimental stage but
it's conceptually I mean that the
concepts are very simple and very solid
and it's just a matter of working
through the standard process working
through some of the small details it's
basically a combination of two well
understood technologies tunneling and
that and you know in fact the way it
works is basically you take your home
gateway and you know you put your not
out in the next and you know you put
your your neighbors naps and you know
all your neighbors now it's on the net
and you got a great them into one match
so it's a it's an address sharing
solution so rather than I'm jumping
ahead just a little but rather than you
know everyone having one address that
they share between all of their their
home systems you know we have one
address that we share around the
neighborhood which has some interesting
properties so this proposal was then
driven largely by the broadband carers
comcast in particular so they're they're
thinking in terms of the home users the
end users you know who have a few
devices and who would be good candidates
for sharing
they want it to be transparent to end
systems so you know it just looks and
acts the same as as you know what the
customer has now and it conserves ipv4
addresses by by sharing them between
customers
it seems to me that it's also nice from
comcast perspective because now they can
more readily identify the people whom
they can try to charge business or
server class fees to because now those
people don't have the ability to offer a
server because they don't have an
address that they can request it from
the consumers perspective it probably
cuts down on the risk of various kinds
of attacks against their home router
because that's not exposed except in
their neighborhood yeah as jumping ahead
a little bit um you know as as far as
the you know identifying the home server
customer there are mechanisms to you
know request a port forwarding but
that's not a guarantee and we might end
up with something like you're describing
or we're kind of separating the the real
home users from the you know the home
businesses so the DS Lite protocol like
I said it separates the the home gateway
from the Nats the home gateway is now
provisioned with ipv6 only and and so it
has to create a tunnel to the NAT and so
you know the basic things that has to do
our figure out you know we're descends
the traffic encapsulate the traffic and
it now doesn't have to worry about NAT
because big brother is taking care of
that
oh the cute terminology we refer to this
home gateway as the b4 element basic
bridging broadband elements and the
piece that lives in the carrier network
is the after before and after this is
why you shouldn't let engineers name
Thanks look at all that the IETF working
group names it's at least this sort of
means something anyway the ad after or
the address family transition router is
the tunnel endpoint for a number of be
four elements how many is up to the
carrier it decap slates that the
customer traffic and naps it out to the
internets it takes internet traffic and
you know does the reverse snap mapping
and sends that back to the customers um
and then there are you know management
operations around that security access
control lists or importance although I
don't think I actually hit that on slide
but you know there's the administrative
n but the basic technical piece is that
you know it's the tunnel endpoint M&amp;amp;S
and because i need pictures to actually
visualize what's going on this is the
really stripped-down version of the
topology so we have me at home with a
mixed v4 and v6 network and yo there's
my home gateway that is provisioned with
v6 only so it's passing a mixture of
native v6 traffic and tunnels ipv4
traffic you know so the native v6 just
goes straight out to the v6 under
it's the but tunneled before you know
goes the after and gets an added out to
the before internets I know one of the
important things here is that you notice
that you know my neighbor and I are both
running the same private address space
so you know this has to be able to
disambiguate Smee from him this came out
much darker than I expected but alone
because I'm an implementer you know I
think in terms of you know okay so what
is the the not mapping table look like
and you know the mat that you have today
takes a three tuple of the sort source
ipv4 address and the source port and the
protocol and that's you know writes a
new header with the mapped public v4
address and this is you know going to be
an active public address and the mapped
ports so the only thing that happens
differently in after is you know we now
have the this source ipv6 address
uniquely identifies the customer you
know me versus my neighbor it's that to
the two pole and so this you know this
address is now be sure before address
within my network as opposed to his
network but other than that the the
mapping is the same you know source
address source port and protocol goes to
young gets rewritten as a you know
mapped address on the mapped port
so that's how the protocol works and you
know now we get down to the
implementation you know where am I going
and what am i doing in his hand baskets
we were contracted to do the initial
development by Comcast and you know
they're also driving the protocol the
the IETF model is rough consensus and
running code and we're providing the
running code part of that it yeah so
this is a they want to prove that this
concept is solid and is so solid that
you know anyone can write it till they
can have a third party come in and write
it one thing I need to emphasize is that
you know comcast name comes up again and
again in this talk but you know they
have not committed to using to deploying
a dual fact lights they have not
committed to deploying you know our
implementation of it they just you know
want to make sure that this is that it's
at least fully explored and an
implementable that's the level of their
commitment to this they may or may not
end up the playing this they they may
have a different solution in the end or
you know they may just go straight to a
dual stack and you know give everyone
these six addresses
so this is initially funded by Comcast
because you know there are a large carer
and the carriers are feeling the pinch
first they are most in danger they're
the first ones who are going to lose in
the race to bond an allocated address
space and since the the problem is you
know increasing number of customers
they're moving the solution to where the
problem is and saying okay our customers
are not going to the share addresses and
so they're they're also very interested
in you know how does this scale you know
how can we incrementally to play it so
having running code also lets them play
with the operational aspects in addition
to the protocol aspects as far as I see
is concerned you know we're here to
rights open source implementations of
Internet infrastructure protocols that
solve important problems like DNS like
DHCP now d is like this is what we live
to do
so the actual implementation of the be
four elements that's the home gateway
this lives on you know on the cut this
is the customer premises equipment and
to put it in carrier terms it needs to
you know live in a resource-constrained
environment like a home gateway and in
fact very like a home gateway that's you
it has been implemented gianna home
gateway it only needs to do you know a
few things to actually make it a be4
element it can do other things but the
things that it really needs to do are to
set up the tunnel and stuff traffic into
the tunnel so the implementation we we
prototypes the b4 element on open wrt
which is a linux distribution chrome
gateways it was originally designed
specifically for the linksys wrt series
and in fact that we use at wrt54gl was
our first be4 element and it works very
well in that environment it's
provisioned with a v6 address only on
the land side there's a it discovers
that the tunnel endpoint via DHCP
there's an internet draft that defines
that as well in fact I think David's who
wrote it is
and there may be other tunnel discovery
mechanisms written for this if the the
whole DNA thing really takes off but
that's the one we have now that's the
one we know works so encapsulation is
the easy part yeah basically you know we
tried together at the B for element and
then we have not had the Taj X you know
in the last year it's it's basically
dead simple what it does the after
element is where we spent all of our
time this you know needs to do the basic
income the basic tunneling and that
operations there and it also needs to do
some port reservation and port
management it needs to you know do
possibly you know some rate limiting on
new connections but it also needs to be
able to reserve ports to forward to the
user there's other administrative stuff
for on configuration logging resource
management i think that's on another
slide so again you know we're we're
we're not looking at expensive hardware
to do this on you know this is you know
this could be implemented in hardware on
a cisco but we implemented it's on a
linux notebook that's what we've been
testing on that's what we've been
demoing on this is it doesn't really get
any simpler as far as commodity hardware
does you know so this is kind of proof
that this can be deployed anywhere in
anybody's carrier network the
architecture is is really kind of dead
simple it's actually single free
so that it doesn't have to do contacts
switches and locking and such and it's
implemented in user space to make it
easier to experiment change things
without having to rebuild kernel modules
and or even reboot the system you know
we make you know change shut it down
start it off the gun and it runs over I
don't think I actually have it in here
but it runs over I pennilyn a 10 14
under a tunnel interface so yeah here's
where we talk about port reservation you
know if you need port forwarding now you
know you log into your your home gateway
by some you know web-based management
system and use you request you know this
port gets forwarded to this machine here
their comcast and visions you know a web
portal that does much the same thing you
know you log into comcast and you know
request you know this v6 address you
know gets this v6n before address pair
gets you know this court tunneled to
them the thing is that that that just
becomes a request rather than a
guarantee you know you and your neighbor
mutt might both want to be running mail
servers and till only one of you is
going to get port 25 on that address so
that becomes an area of some possible
contention there's also dynamic port
reservation where an application can
request a port that it can advertise on
peer-to-peer networks so the standard
way to do that now is as upnp universal
plug and play
there's also a matte PMP is that heart
mapping protocol which is defined by a
mal expired internet-draft but is also
widely deployed in Apple networks so i'm
not sure why didn't advance that to the
RFC stage but both of those would be
supported now and but they they both
assume a single broadcast domain where
you're directly connected to where the
client is correctly connected to the
matte box and so there have already been
projects to kind of extend that and and
put a proxy in place where you know I
could be running a multi-layered network
at home and already want this on a v4
network and it just dovetails really
nicely with what we need which is to be
able to forward you know a port request
you know through the tunnel to the mat
so you know the port proxy projects is
you know something that someone else is
doing we've also implemented you know a
nap PMP proxy and agents we've also got
support for you know straight pass
through if you know you happen to have a
public before address but no before
infrastructure that can get tunneled
straight through and that's a possible
solution to you know my neighbor and I
both want to run mail servers you know
in comcast might come back and say no
okay you know for a little extra you can
buy you know a full ipv4 address rather
than a fractional address
and I at first you know I thought this
is you know just kind of Lackey edge
case but I I can see you know business
cases where this passed through you
might have to be you know side by side
with the regular Matt case are there any
implications with respect to VPN or
ipsec of this approach um those I VPN
and ipsec mostly already worked through
now so we don't envision that the nat
traversal is going to be really any
different in this case like I said one
of the design goals was to make this as
much like you know your current not
experience as we can we do enter time oh
there's a clock there all right good
okay um so like like anything that's
conceptually simple you know it gets a
little hairy once you get down into the
implementation details so to make this
as much like you know current not
experienced as possible we need a
certain level of proxy and application
level gateways you know we we need ping
to be able to work through it ftp has to
work through it although you know early
implementations of matt already broke
ftp and so now most of the ftp clients
are using passive mode so they you know
we'll work through most now it's even
that even that's that don't still notice
that okay this is now going ftp control
connection i better set up the incoming
data connection but you know we
expect that to just work so you know we
included that ftp ftp data connection
gateway so another thing that's
interesting about this case is that you
know since this isn't an encapsulation
you know we're wrapping the v4 packet
with a v6 header which adds another 40
bytes to the ethernet frame or you know
whatever your transport whatever your
layer 2 is so if you're running
full-size packets through you know
you're streaming lolcatz videos or
something you're going to have some
fragmentation issues and fragmentation
is something we really want to avoid
because you know it's really clogs the
network and you know in tcp you know we
have half MTU discovery but it's not
always reliable and we'd like to avoid
having to do the whole path MTU
discovery dance you know where we you
know send back a packet to big messages
so we have a hack in there let's not
call it a hack it's a tweak to rewrite
the MSS option on outgoing TCP syn
segments basically you know the the TCP
negotiation that says you know here's
how big a frame I can handle you know
here's how much do I can handle and
since we're rewriting the header anyway
we just go and say mm we'll just ratchet
that down by 40 bytes and that has
proven to work really well in lab and so
in test implementations um
and finally and any implementation needs
to run well and you know needs to be
scalable so we have tested this
generally in in fairly small networks
you know with with you know the small
numbers of clients but you know we we
fully believe this you know will will
scale up to large numbers of clients
running on larger hardware the limiting
factor turns out to be cpu speed because
we do a context switch on every packet
and that so that load tracks pretty well
to cpu speed it's much more of a
limiting factor than say you know the
amount of memory or you know the speed
of logging or anything so you know if
you need more performance you you're
basically throwing faster hardware at
the problem but or or you're you're
moving the after element closer to the
users and you know serving fewer users
and and just deploying more small boxes
rather than yo one big box okay so in
the real world you know outside of the
protocol area you know we still have the
operational and administrative
challenges of you know logging and
support there's actually something
that's not on here which is that we
would actually we would like to limit
the logging to just you know what we
need to log just just the bare minimum
because it chews up resources for one
thing
yo it's it chews up the resources on you
know just just kind of you know writing
out that the log it eats up disk space
with logs that no one's going to look at
and it potentially you know until the
disk with logs of you know personally
identifying information so personally
identifying information in this case
being you know what machine behind the
net is is requesting this you know
there's there's nothing you know with
your name on it unless it your name is
the name of the machine so what we've
done here is rather than logging every
not binding we allocate a bucket of
ports to each customer and you know as
as the connections come in you know the
NAP findings come out of that bucket of
ports and then we allocate another one
and furthermore we randomize the the
bucket so that you know that the port
allocation is not predictable it it's a
small measure of security but that means
that you know when we when we write out
the log it's just you know this ipv6
address you know god assigned these tcp
ports so you know lawful intercept you
know the FBI can come in and say you
know we need to know about you know a
customer using this public ipv4 address
and port at this time and you know they
can still get that information it's a
little less trivial they can still get
what they need to get but no more than
that they is just enough to identify you
know it was this customer
no no it will not identify machine
within the house that that source ipv4
information is not logged at all it's
just you know you know that something
behind this v6 address has has gotten
this binding so we're kind of feeling
our way around you know what the what
the law requires is far as lawful
intercept but we think this strikes a
good balance and still then there's a
whole issue of you know how do we
support comcast how does comcast support
their customers because every time you
add a tunnel you know or an hour layer
of indirection you're really kind of
adding an extra layer of complication to
the debugging aspects and so we don't we
also don't know how this is going to
play well with native ipv6 you know with
6 rd so we're basically looking to our
customers to tell us what tools they
need almost done and the end state that
we're really driving towards is native
ipv6 ipv6 everywhere everything it's the
ipv6 on everything everything on ipv6
six rd is is a little bit orthogonal or
even at cross-purposes to this but you
know it may help in in other climates or
you know it may be deployed you know
incremental e like you know this
neighborhood gets you know v4 and v6
tunneling this neighborhood gets v6 and
B for tunneling
so you know we expect that there are
going to be a variety of solutions that
actually get deployed and the carriers
you know might probably will eventually
you know decide that okay this this is
all very interesting these coexistence
technology but you know what let's just
do native ipv6 it's easier that way so
they may decide to you know just bite
the bullet and step back at which point
we declare victory and go home except
that we don't because v4 has a very long
tail and you know we're going to need
some kind of coexistence strategies you
know whether it's something was whether
it's an address sharing scheme like this
or whether it is you know okay we've
gotten a lot of people off of v4 and so
we can now allocate v4 to anyone who
still wants it so when I was rehearsing
this my test audience pointed out that
okay I'm going to talk to google and you
know you guys are you know in a sort of
different network space so this this is
a solution that's aimed you know at the
home customer it's it's not aimed at the
large care networks isn't it's not aimed
within the large carrier networks it's
not really aimed at you know guys like
you you know your solutions to running
out of address space you know would be
largely the same as the carrier's
solutions within their networks you know
you might deploy you know in that 10
within the network just to round things
around or you might play the six within
your networks and kind of tunnel the v4
threats but you know again
you know that the long-term answer is
still the same it's it's still ipv6 and
you know since there isn't a a six
killer app you know you could kind of
drive that and you know be the v6 killer
app so now and we have come to the end
and you have a question so from an
enterprise perspective this does if at
Google's we have small offices that
don't have it may not be able to get
dedicated services or tomorrow or and we
may have internal v4 only applications
additionally for the customers we have
we have increased latency concerns we
have increased MTU concerns we have MSS
concerns we have dns concerns we have
logging for lawful intercept I remember
for legal compliance concerns all of us
had now have to say by the way it was
Paul at this IP address and this port
they're not not necessarily logging port
today perhaps so there are content
people and enterprises in general mmm
this does touch their space but okay you
know something I should keep in mind
awesome any other questions questions
from the remote sites cushion on the
performance of the cpe or your be for
element on can it actually pushed
something like 10 megabits per second or
maybe 20 I'm down without falling over
um that's well I mean it depends on the
hardware um I have you know pushed my
linksys device to the limit that it will
go to but the the limiting factor there
is is actually my you know cable link so
i guess that's that's another part of
that the question is that you know if
we're looking at where this is actually
going to be deployed this is going to be
deployed on cable and dsl and you know
it's not
might be you know really it's not going
to be on those eps networks so you know
any home gateway that is sufficient for
that now should not have a problem with
with the added load of encapsulation and
d capsulation right so another question
so um the UCD s like being use for stuff
like fibre-to-the-home like verizon has
their feels right i mean presumably they
could push a gig of traffic I mean
obviously um you probably not gonna have
the linksys for as a cpe device right or
full could it I mean um yeah I'm not
actually a familiar with with fiber so I
don't know what the terminating device
is at the home now but it does is
convert a fiber signal into basically
just a standard copper in boxers has any
benchmarking been done either by you or
by vendors like network vendors comcast
or equipment vendors linksys d-link that
gear and I would even extend that to say
is there a way we can you know deploy
this ourselves and connect to an after
device somewhere in the world and test
to see what sort of things happen yeah i
mean this this is all open source
technology and you know you can download
it and test it out today you know you
can the the beef or build instructions
are specific to open wrt and linksys
devices but you know you can adopt that
to anything that that can you know
create the tunnel and the the after
codes like I said Jill runs on anything
from a Linux netbook on up so yeah you
can certainly play with it now i have
the world
shortest ipv6 tunnel in my house
actually it could be shorter it could be
you know one foot cable but it's a three
foot cable so I actually have this kind
of horrible setup where since i don't
have native v6 in the home you know I've
got my devices behind the the be for
getting tunneled you know chew the after
device and you know since I haven't put
the after code in my home gateway you
know it's it's getting matted and then
it's getting that it again going out to
internet so it's kind of the worlds that
the worst of all worlds that I have now
but you know I don't notice a
performance head you know even with all
of those all of that hokey pokey that
it's doing other questions we're a
little over time
crickets all right well thank you for
