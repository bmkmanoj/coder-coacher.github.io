visiting us from from CERN he is part of
the the quad team at CERN that develops
the wood toolkit and all the the
symplast bells and pipe integration work
that they're doing so actually please
introduce yourself a little bit deeper
yeah no that's already good enough
thanks a lot
and thanks a lot for inviting me over
it's a pleasure to be here and talk a
little bit about the funny things we do
which you know I would see them as not
as relevant for for companies like a
little bit maybe I'm wrong so we'll see
let's give it a try I'm going to talk
today about how we use C++ in an
interpreted world actually also and the
new interpreter that we came up with and
now going to talk a little bit about
about Python as well so ideally what I
will cover during this half hour or
something is C++ as it's used by by CERN
now of course also talk about the LHC a
little bit then the interpreter I was
referring to is called clearing that
will give you a good impression of up a
lot but not exactly of everything so
CERN is a research lab we really do just
fundamental research high energy physics
we try to answer fundamental questions
like what is mass we don't produce
things except for knowledge so it's just
to satisfy our curiosity CERN has been
founded in the 50s it's on the other
side of Switzerland near Geneva and the
main tool we have and is it we use it as
a giant microscope to see tiny things is
the Large Hadron Collider what we do in
there is we we have a we have a ring and
we send protons one way around and some
protons the other way around and then we
let them collide at control points and
we measure what happens over there I put
a few of the numbers up they are really
very unique worldwide we have an energy
of a TV we have the two Kelvin inside
the the magnets because we need them to
be super contacting which by the way
also makes us one of the largest if not
the largest
humor of Helium of the world and the
whole ring is 27 kilometers long it's
huge now because this is such an
investment of course we try to make as
good use of it as possible and so we
have about 10,000 users 10,000
physicists and several experiments at
the LHC this is what what it looks like
it's beautiful down there and that's the
reason of course why we are there right
we at the Alps we have to like we have
some green green fields and and then
what you don't see is this the Jura it's
fantastic
and then we came and we have to put the
ring somewhere luckily we decided to put
it below ground so this is what it looks
like we have a few entrances to to our
tunnel and then you see these caverns
down there that's where we put the
detectors now the detectors are giants
you can see the the small people in
front of this yellow platform you can
see that this is lots of heavy lifting
that we have to do but also tiny parts I
mean all these small intricate parts
here in the this is one of the
detectives have to be built when you
can't order them so this was all
handmade they also see a bit of the beam
pipe here the the beam the beams collide
in the center of this detector it's
spectacular you see this yourself and
you might have a chance next year
because we have to shut down the LHC for
a year to do maintenance and so you if
you want sign up in a few months and you
might get tore down there it's probably
the last time actually that we open this
up for for the public okay so that was
certain now let's switch to C++ a little
bit if you have physicists you learn C++
very early on because if you want to do
data analysis but what this really means
is you have to code you immediately have
to code and have to interface with your
experiments libraries that's how we do
data analysis in high-energy physicists
the experiments libraries are giants you
know maybe not in your environment it
for us it's it's huge
we really notice the effect of of gold a
lot for example with gigs off of
libraries
we have enormous amounts of pipes and we
have about 50 million lines of code C++
code not all in-house we have a fair
fraction of external dependencies but a
lot of that is actually developed
in-house and you ought to remember that
we don't sell services or something for
us computing is just something that gets
us to where we actually want to go
namely physics we do research and we use
computing just as a tool i work as a
member of the root development team and
root is one of these core ingredients
that all the experiments share these
they don't want to reinvent the wheel
and root is one of those wheels we take
the the physicists and you know help
them write when the data leaves the
detector so that they can serialize the
data they can store it let me give them
math tools a 10 so that they can do
statistical analysis and then the end we
even do the graphics part so that they
can produce plots and publish them in
their publications we have a lot of
users 10,000 at CERN 20000 and total we
also have a few more unknown and the
reason is that we have a very unique
collection type something that is highly
efficient if you have a huge amount of
similar data like our collision data and
for example bangs use it for four stock
markets and these kind of things root
has an interpreter so it's very easy to
start it up for people and some small
binary and they then load their
experiments code into root and so they
use root as a simple interface to the
experiments code to these giant
libraries that I was talking about this
interpreter is now about 20 years old
it's called Sint and we have a lot of
experience with users interpreting C++
and since and actually these
interpreters have a long history at CERN
by themselves around the 70s the first
interpreters and turns showed up because
somebody was like well I just want to
look at my data and I want to rewrite
the program and I don't know probably
still punch cards in
hand it over and and then look at it and
then if I change my mind want to look at
something else have to reprogram again
now I just want to fire it up and then I
want to enter what I actually want to
look at so to access data the first
interpreter was born and then of course
the first user said hey that's fantastic
but actually what I want to do is I want
to do a plus B so can you just add plus
and minus and divide and multiply and so
on
so simply expressions there what's the
next step ha okay what about you know
functions or something okay so then came
simple algorithms and you can see where
this goes right I mean in the end if you
do this then then of course you want to
prototype your algorithm right if you if
you write an algorithm for the big
experiment framework then why don't you
want to why don't you test drive it in
the interpreter to see how it behaves
you optimize it and then you put it into
the the giant framework okay and and now
what really happens nowadays the last
step is that people write the code in
the interpreter and then once they're
happy they put it back into the
framework and this is the main reason
why we believe that interpreting C++ is
important because it gives you a way to
develop your code in an interpreter
interactively and have the same language
as your compiled word so since the old
days this is sort of the layout we have
this giant block of libraries and data
you know the official part and then we
have physicists who write their the
analysis code and to interface with the
giant part using an interpreter the
current use is such that that it's used
as a cult development environment it's
mainly used instead of just blinking and
and so on because it's so much faster
right you can change the code and within
fractions of seconds you see the result
you don't have to go through all the
build steps and it's something very nice
because even though you don't know the
whole giant library you can you can just
peek into different corners you can test
drive code test drive classes here
whether they be
half the way you want I think another
reason why this really caught on and
sinners because if you write a physics
analysis you have an idea of an
algorithm you try it out and it works
mostly and then you try to refine it
stepwise so there's a lot of code change
see how how that affects the outcome and
you go back and forth all the time and
that's supported of course by by an
interpreter now given that we had sinned
we were really happy and lucky but of
course when people want to do all
fanciness with the interpreting then
with a homegrown interpreter you you
reach the limits at some point so we
were looking for alternatives and when
clang and LVM came around then that was
just amazing you know was it was a
brilliant set of libraries to be used
for well possibly we use for an
interpreter so pling is based on LVM
implying the c++ libraries it's
developed by a small team of people at
at CERN and at Fermilab in the US and
our main challenge was to map the
concept of an interpreter for the
concept of no compiler this sounds like
not a big deal it is it's a huge deal
and for all computer scientists are
there I understood from my dear
colleague the computer scientists that
we are actually not doing an interpreter
because we don't interpret anything we
used it we compile really natively but
for me that's a seedy term because
really feels like an interpreter so the
main thing we had to change was the
understanding of what a translation unit
is a compiler as a translation unit as
the full input it ever sees and at the
end of the input the end of file it does
things C++ requires things to happen at
the end of the input now we can't afford
that
we have to do things at the end of each
input but the ast will grow there will
be more input so some certain actions
need to happen in between all the input
lines and and some we need to delay to
all the end so for example Cochin needs
to happen after
input we want to be able to call all the
functions that have been entered by the
user something else that might not be
that obvious is is you know the fact
that you cannot naturally use glass at a
prompt because there is no way that you
can enter in the same way code that is
C++ in you know in one in one global
space sort of thing let me explain you
what I mean here we have n I equal 1 and
sine of I plus plus
okay now that cannot stand on the global
scale can see plus plus right you've got
a rapid sum and I'll show you why we
need to wrap it and why we need to
extract declarations why we need to find
declarations versus expressions so if we
take the same input what we do is we
wrap it first of all because that makes
it legal C++ plan can parse it you can
tell is this part is a declaration that
part is an expression so what we do then
is we need to extract the expression
sorry the declaration and put it onto
global scope because otherwise its
lifetime is just inside the wrapping
function something we don't want right
we want people if they enter into I they
should be able to reference that I later
on it like your input lines so must
become a static lifetime so we do this
on the ast level there's no reason to do
this on the textual level we just
extract the ast nodes and put them out
so then we are left with our wrapper
function which has only the expression
of course we need to call it because
that's what really expect that the
function gets called but do people
actually care about sign being called or
not no they care about the outcome they
care about the result of the call to
sign so we use a hack that was invented
for cinder that's fantastic it's very
simple if you omit the training
semicolon then we will print the result
of the last expression and so that's
what you get playing will print the
result of sign using some metric that
I'm not going to describe in detail but
it works
so there are a lot of details which
makes the whole thing
ugly but still work one of the things is
that globalization's are really tricky
if you don't have a defined concept of a
translation unit usually you run your
global initializes once when you start
up your program right here we can do
this we have to do it step by step when
there's a new global you have to
initialize it but we must not initialize
all the Global's that were already there
these otherwise we're going to reset the
values that might have been changed on
the contrary for the destructors we
really need to collect everything and
then run everything
when Kling dies and something that is
super evil is wrong code if you enter
wrong code say our int I with a sign
afterwards and you misspelled sign the
more people expect us that the whole
thing goes away the compiler forgets the
whole input so even the Declaration of
in a must be removed
now which compiler implements removal of
ast node none obviously because it's
insane right if it's highly inefficient
and so climbing doesn't do it neither
that it allows us to tweak a few things
you know a few loopholes and that's what
we use and so we successfully recover
from errors like that ok that was insane
but we are going yet a step further we
were able with your interpreter to open
a file which contains serialize C++
objects and you just inject them into
the current scope the c++ skill it's
extremely handy if you interact with the
compiler with the interpreter you open a
file you just want to see what's inside
you want to call function on it
now that hasn't worked with the compiler
right because this is not valid killed
the compiler is no idea what the option
file really is and they cannot determine
this at compile time because it doesn't
know will it enter this part what's the
file name what's inside the file so all
of that has to be done in runtime the
way we do it is we postpone the
compilation of this part until runtime
until we know what's inside the file
so we use the compiler as a service or
as my friend the computer scientists say
hey that's just like a Gil are some some
dynamic language runtime apparently so
the the JIT that I was referring to
already before is fantastic for it's not
just because it gives us nice
performance and it does the performance
is amazing but the real advantage is
that it gives us a bi compatibility this
kills swig right there
because we know how the target invokes
functions I mean flying nodes right or
LD and we don't have to take care of it
so we can immediately just because of
that call into libraries into shared
libraries natively so in this example
here you know let's look at the
invocation of playing you see that we
switch it to see mode and then we load a
share librarian which is libs ed and
then we pipe this code into clay so here
we declare a function and then we call
it and you can see it just works like
that there is no wrapping involved it's
just native calls another part that is
super essential for assist reflection as
as you know C++ has this weak point of
not knowing what it's talking about
there's no runtime reflection so we
always had to generate a description of
our types just like you guys do with
prototype we've built above for example
in but now with the ast there is no need
for that anymore because the compiler
knows at all we can just cure it
so we know the memory layout we know
where to stuff data at one time we know
the target ABI all these kind of things
and even better we can annotate the ast
so we can put our own comments into the
AST to help us with our civilization all
these things I think cling as it is is
already in a very usable state it's
really fun to toy with it it does what
you would expect to but we still want to
to drive it a little bit further
one of the main crucial parts that's
missing is clangs support for the
windows C++ ABI clang doesn't offer it
and as clang doesn't offer it we can't
afford either it's actually album and
client so this is something that we are
really really hoping to to get and have
fixed at at some point of the near
future
something else is much easier which is
C++ 11 because we use clang as a
front-end we won't just inherit flying's
abilities to support superpowers and you
know features get added continuously so
I think this will just just be fine not
an issue Objective C and C++ are not
really a topic at CERN but it's
something that is also easy to to add we
know that simple things can already be
run in Objective C and C++ problem CL is
the same thing my belief it's mostly
implemented in clang so it should be
naturally supporting thing as well and
then of course you can go crazy and just
implement link or whatever fountain you
like so given how fantastic pling is of
course you all want to know how do we
get it well here it is you can check it
out I it's rather stable so don't expect
a lot of API changes it's really really
small it's fast fitting to see how much
work you put in and the more work we put
in the smaller it seems to become it it
really works everywhere we're LVM and
it's JIT work
so notably not when
and we deliver it as a stand-alone
binary which allows you to play with it
but I think most importantly we deliver
a few libraries sort of module libraries
that allow you to interface with it and
embed it and any way you want
oh yeah and the important part here I
guess is that it's not GPL to something
but use the same licenses flying in lbm
to something similar to MIT okay so
given that I had such a mixed bags of
topics to present here I allowed myself
to have several conclusions I think
three in total so let's start with the
first one the interpreter language um
actually not yet the conclusion so the
enterprise Python who I almost forgot
about - yes so he comes to Python Park
so we we talked about C++ interpreting
C++ and of course we all know that this
is awkward and so people use Python for
interpreting right it's far more compact
it's it's a little bit more casual
coding than C++ the way we did it for
rude is by implementing a standalone
tool a bridge between Python and C++
which called PI root cemented by vimla
Reiser who is out there in the net if
you look for Python and in C++ it's it's
him all the time so the bridge works
like this you can do calls in either
direction you can call Python from C++
and you can call it was plus from path
in a Maps concepts so it understands
that if something implements an iterator
interface in C++ it should be iterable
in Python as well dictionaries the same
way the best thing are its internals
which are not visible that's the point
of having it internal right it's not
stopped based we don't need to
pre-process the headers to generate
information there is nothing at compile
time that
is forced to be run to be able to use it
with impact and instead which is used
reflects in which we already have and we
continue to have what client in an even
better way so dynamically we build the
the knowledge we add the functions to
the Python objects that are available in
C++ it's really performant because it
caches a lot and it uses some form of
object and it's a annotation on the
Python side to be able to to remember
certain properties that it will use when
bridging the language barriers no no it
uses regular Python libraries actually
so the the C interface to to the regular
Python library yeah so it's built on top
it's not implementing a Python
interpreter or something like that oh
yeah exactly
yes sorry yes sir
right so so now the question is of
course well maybe it's not the question
but you know for me this is one of the
big topics is what do we want to
interpret do we want to interpret it as
plus or do we want to interpret Python
now I understand of course the drive to
write Python because it's so much
simpler than writing C++ it's actually
frightened ly simple to write 1 million
lines of code Python but what we see
then is that you know I mean once you
have all this complex algorithm Python
are you really going to rewrite in C++
the whole thing and verify that it's
giving the same results it may be next
week right so we end up with a whole
load of C++ of Python that is not as
performant as we would want it to be so
for me this is really an issue I still
love this sentence that I heard
somewhere about the i/o performance in
fact okay so here comes the conclusion
the first part um interpreters so for
assets err and interpreters are more
than just a command-line interface or
something like that they're really a
different way of interfacing with with
giant libraries with a lot of libraries
in a different way of writing code much
more direct feedback explorative coded
the key for having interpreters work
properly is reflection data and I really
really hope that we all get it into into
C++ at some point
it helps us with dynamic binding for
interpreters the offices with
civilization and any with anything
dynamic like plugins languages are
always a matter of taste and so this
slide is highly you know my personal
opinion nevertheless I think that the
languages we have chosen still limit us
certainly the transition from Fortran to
C++ in the 90s and transitioning 10,000
people to C++ was a huge effort
especially when these people are
then a computer scientists right and we
did so successfully which means that C++
is really amazing and it worked for
novices as well novices can pick up
chips plus they do understand how to
write their analysis on the other hand
it's easily possible to write C++ code
that is completely understandable
definitely also for novices so that's a
danger with Python of course the problem
is that it's difficult to migrate the
code out of pipe and into a more
performant version and so what we see
now is that we have code massive amounts
of code in either language and we have
no way to go because there is no other
language that inherently is able to
interface with C++ think of pound
include my header dot H there's no other
language which allows you to do that if
you think for friend OC that was
possible there was a nice migration part
right but nowadays we have to use things
like split go so just a line so that's
the sad slide here comes the the happy
one clay I think what what I'm trying to
say here is that you can trust us we
have a lot of experience with novice
users with C++ and with interpreters and
all of that
ended up in in cling and we are really
happy with the product it's really worth
a try
having clang LVM is amazing it really is
a game changer in the way you you write
parsers and you do anything with codecs
and because it's it's fun and stable I
think it's a good time to to start
looking at it and because I know that
the really only thing that's convincing
people is demo I will have a demo but
I'm not going to do it myself instead I
found a demo by some random guy that I
don't personally know he picked up
clanging in the only cling in the early
days he found it amazing he likes Fuji
apparently as well so he used it to
showcase how you develop QT with clang I
find that amazing it's on YouTube so I
understand that this talk is recorded as
well and put into YouTube
so for the geekiness of it we will have
recursive YouTube here but I don't first
a wireless connection so I downloaded it
so this is what it is
the the window here to the left is an
interface to claim it's just a QT layer
on top of it so what what I think Thomas
Garrett is named what he's doing here is
he's loading code into playing header
files declarations ok to our elders that
before he linked Kling already
apparently with the QT libraries so all
the symbols are there he's now just
declaring things to to claim and here we
have the first variable that he created
he called shell on that variable and you
see how it pops up right the window
popped up he's moving it this is life
okay it's just the code is there of
course that's that's boring we just have
a widget now so he wants to do things
with it now and especially QT which is
very visual right um
benefit from having in interactive
programming because he immediately see
what's happening so now he's going to
define some layout and inject a button
there so let's see what happens he's
declaring it and well now the object is
created now he's adding the widget and
ideally there it is right this I mean we
haven't written clean for that that's
let's just decide if a great can do
whatever you want whether it's just C
plus pass
okay so we have clang as the backend and
clang is a property versus compiler so
hey why not use signal slots property
processor constructs you know okay so
he's connecting seeking slots this
button to to window hiding and whoa it
works and it works repeatedly so he's
entwining so much she's not doing three
times right so now he's changing the
size as well because he wants to have it
more I don't know suitable shows it and
it still works so I think this gives you
a very good impression of how dynamic
development can be how visual how
closely you your feedback is if you use
an
so yes
so many different parts that question so
yes sure so the question is how do we
educate novices how to use clay if I can
summarize it like this and so first of
all we try to make playing as natural as
possible so the Dell you saw here is
actually not needed you can just pound
include the headers as well it's also an
option but I think the main answer is
that we have ten thousand physicists out
there and these Summa students for
example will have a supervisor and the
supervisor will have written hours and
hours and hours of code with the route
and interpreters so they know how this
works and that's actually how it spreads
that makes it very easy for us we are
only seven people in the development
team you know we can't educate the world
I mean know all ten thousands of
physicists but of course it makes also
very dangerous because we have no idea
what they tell these people and you know
sometimes we get these funny things
where we see killing who wrote that
everybody's using it God so you know
it's absent downs but yeah it's it's bet
you know if it's if it's a good tool
something that makes sense is easy to
use I think then you don't need a lot of
it reduction procedure spots of course
that's stupid we still have the lessons
of C++ it's still one of the biggest
headaches that we have that some are
students who just stay there for a few
months need to learn C++ that's costing
them a considerable amount of time but
yeah that's life right I mean that's the
language we chose and it would be the
same with any other language presumably
yes right so the question is do we have
support for dynamic introspection you
said right right we do we have several
actually which is painful and we're
going to reduce that to one there's one
and root which is the mother of all
because it's used by civilization and
whatnot
and so you can ask any object that is
used I mean that's known to root
basically but it has a itself a type
that has been declared to root you can
ask it for its type for its members
calling signatures you can call then
Italy through the reflection interface
any functions of these objects
dynamically right so the answer by Avice
here was yes it's a part of playing and
playing I mean you have a whole freaking
compiler and JIT in the backend right so
of course yes you can use anything we
want yeah it's all there do you have
completion on the prompt yes we do but
only in route and not the way we want it
to be so
clang has a feature for for completion
and we want to use it but the problem is
that it's intrusive with the with a code
with a you know the string buffer
containing the code so we don't know yet
what we're going to do with that because
in principle we would have to again
Weaver tasty notes that the user might
have tied them pressing tab and then
yeah that's actually not what I want and
then you know back up and so that's kind
of messy but we'll find a solution
that's the one so we have it only in
root for now yes
so well yes this gives me more time to
think so
the question is given a binary context I
believe which declares for example
variables and functions can you access
that through Kling right that's your
question and I think the answer is yes
but you have to declare it l LD be the
debugger based on l vm does funny things
by hauling debug symbols for example for
that so that would be an option but we
don't implement that unless you declare
it it's not going to be available yes so
the question is how do you handle
failure crashes segmentation violations
these kind of things put inkling very
good topic very difficult topic to
answer because everybody wants it
differently so if you use cling in a
bigger framework then of course you
don't want clinging to capture anything
you want it to be passed through unless
it actually crashes in that case you
wanted to be buffered or something like
that so all of that is up for discussion
right but the main point is we can can
only do so much if there is a crash a
hard C++ crash then we can try to
recover using the usual things you know
signal handler idea but I mean the state
afterwards is going to be unusable
anyway so we were actually thinking of
moving all of the interpreter out in a
zoo into a separate environment but then
in the end you don't gain anything
because the whole environment the whole
context is in that different process and
ok crashes you
would nevertheless have to restart from
scratch right you can't just replay
everything so that's basically unsolved
you can handle a few things but if you
have a crash you have a crash yes
yes yeah all of these are really content
so the question is do you have an IDE
which makes use of the of the
interpreter such that input becomes
becomes a source file for example we
have put a little bit of time into
creating at least an editor that
interfaces with with the interpreter but
you know given the scope of things we
have to deal with we are not going to be
able to implement something like that
there is actually an editor out there
are things called scintilla or something
like that that has been I don't know
whether it's still dad's but it has been
using Sint as an interpreter you know
under the hood and so yes I mean this is
definitely something that will make
senses especially with Kling and its new
abilities that's something that it would
be very tempting to have but I don't
think they'll be able to to influence
them like especially as you'll never be
able to convince all physicists to not
use VI not use Emacs and not use Eclipse
you know these kind of things you know
it is right so the question is is
anybody working on Emacs mode which is
claimed as an interior shell not that
I'm aware no no yes sad but I think
there is a they something with American
clang I think there was a it was a
module
and suppose and let me try to repeat the
question because that also makes sure
that I understood it well so the
question is you have a server which went
son code and what about enabling the
server to have a an interpreter
interface so that you can log on and
interactively play with the with the
server place that's about right or so
there are a few things whenever I hear
server an interpreter I go ooh I
especially see this class right I mean
don't really the the second part is yes
the whole thing the whole thing is meant
to be used in a production environment
as well so it's not just interactive and
given that we have these gigs of
libraries out there we're not going to
have all the source code all the time
the plan that we have is that we build
something that is called modules clang
modules for each of the parts of the
frameworks there are basically partial
PCHS that you can inject into the ast we
load them into the SD fantastic really I
really really hope that this will end up
in C++ at some point if it's feasible so
by that we don't have to publish the
source code we can just put the PCHS le
the module somewhere and load them in
dynamically actually on demand even
because you know when the library gets
loaded then we load the libraries module
so that we make reflection it available
yes
yes
right so we have a the other just to to
repeat that to the microphone you have a
batch system based interpreter so your
local fondant actually means that you
submit your the job the code you enter
to to a whole cluster of notes which
then works away on the input and yes if
you write wrong code then you will have
to restart this cluster once a while
this happens you know it's all it's all
dynamic it's your process anyway exactly
so no questions on Python and C++ y'all
happy okay yes
the question is are there more features
than reflection that we would want to
see in C++ that are useful for an
interpreter right I think I mean the the
syntax of C++ is sort of limiting its
usability as an interpreted language you
know by design but you know that said
C++ 11 goes a long way and simplifying
what you have to type so so I think this
is a step into the right direction and
you know from what I see one of the main
arguments with new features as always
look people these 20 lines of code will
collapse just too you know we need this
feature and that's the right approach
when that makes perfect sense so I think
really reflection is one of the key
features there are more features like
the uncertainty about about the the
target layout you know none of that is
available you don't know what the target
is going to put things into memory how a
call actually works these kind of things
that are that would be very nice to have
as well yes
excellent question so the question is
C++ enforces that one definition rule
how do you handle that can you handle
that can you have multiple definitions
in the interpreter turns especially when
you prototype code you write something
and you change your mind because it's
not the right thing and you change it
but then that changed function has
exactly the same name is the function
before you want it to be replaced
all right so our alt interpreter had
actually the notion of unloading code
and reloading code so it forgot parts of
the ast the reason why I didn't mention
that here is because we haven't
implemented it yet but this is
absolutely the goal I mean the whole
point of prototyping is exactly that
that you can live change code and you
know modify the contents of functions
and so on this is closely coupled to
error recovery as you can imagine
because also there we have to forget
parts of the ast we have to add a little
bit on top of that because we even have
to make Global's so values forgotten we
need to encode gen so to say so it's a
little bit tricky but I think we'll
manage because we sort of know how to do
this in Sint and we have the experience
from sin so should be possible does that
answer it yes
yes so you said is that the budding
bitch so the question is I was claiming
that the C++ Python interface is
completely dynamic now let me test you
what if I load a header file which
contains a template can I actually call
the functions now with sint you could
not with our alt interpreter because we
need a template in sensations now that
we have a compiler and a JIT in the
backend we can do this dynamically and
so the answer will shortly be yes
absolutely
you can just call the function because
we will generate the symbol
automatically and it will be made
available to Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
