got a team of people here from Hawk
Sheila Bremen in Germany Digital Media
Group and Michael lat key is going to
introduce the team since I probably
can't pronounce lava shark hello nice
that so many people found its way to the
google Tech Talk my name is Michael
ladki that's the American pronunciation
the german one is quite hard ok and
let's not make more funny jokes about
that I'm a student of learn young
Lukasiak at Ocean agreement digital
media master group and this is the best
anhyzer also student of Yan lebu shock
we have been doing other stuff before we
were students again I've been working as
an audio engineer for aldi and bang
olufsen Sebastian was a sound designer
for company called the Gaussian man
group which makes gambling machines that
you can find in Las Vegas and so he's
responsible for the sounds that you hear
coming out of these machines and telling
you what learn with Louis shocked it
would feel more than one hour of talk
time so let's just say he's a professor
for computer graphics um that was my
introduction thanks the digital media
master group that we're in should be
able to change slides
our aim was to find novel approaches in
sound exploration and so we did this
acronym but the meaning of the acronym
changes whenever we want to do something
else so it was something else before and
I'll try to give you a short
introduction airy problem think of
yourself being a sound designer working
on a movie score and you have to do this
sound design for one of the dinosaurs
that shows up think of Jurassic Park I
think everybody has seen this movie and
what you would you do if you search for
a sound that should go along with this
dinosaur he has a huge audio database
and you just cannot type in dinosaur
because there's no recording of a
dinosaur available not that we know of
and so maybe you would start typing an
animal or something and you might come
up with something like this which is a
bird not really fitting to a dinosaur
and then you think okay maybe we need a
more mean an email you're not a dynasty
but if you being a sock designer I know
you have all your tools on hand and you
know how to change that sound of a pic
and such a way the idea now is this
process can take an unbelievable amount
of time you have as a sound designer
40,000 50,000 sounds in a database hard
drives or not that costly anymore
nowadays and get an overview what you
actually have in your database is quite
hard so the aim of our software
development is to ease the daily work of
a sound designer and try to help him to
find sounds faster in a more convenient
way and to demonstrate you one of our
first software prototypes that we come
up with I'd like to ask sebastian Heiser
to present Santa
okay hello everybody again I will
present one of our prototypes that is
dealing with searching and large and
complex sound effects databases so we
know a group of focusing sound effect
databases you have in mind that most of
the mir guys are dealing with mp3 music
files most of the time we are dealing
with sound effects as Michael already
said it can be really hard to find a
specific sound in your database I don't
really need to tell you that so just
imagine I have some some part of my
database with me this is a common
product from sound ideas and if I have
maybe this this library here and I'm
searching for is certain sound maybe
let's say I'm searching for bird and I
get in a list of something you know
about I think 50 60 whatever recordings
just what stacked with with bird so even
there are some some better text I have
to go through all these things and have
to listen to it and just if you would
say okay every recordings one minute and
they go through it and listen to all
that stuff it would take about let's say
one hour just listen to everything and
ever then if you're at the last 10 what
was the first recording or something
like that so this takes a huge amount of
time just just listen to all that stuff
or you know tagging is the problem back
to the dinosaur problem I'm just
searching for dinosaur of course I would
just get an empty list there's nothing
of course or I'm searching for a bell
sound you know and I
say I enter Bell and I just get a list
with with the helicopter sounds that are
produced by there because they attacked
so this is a problem so of course I had
to search for brass bell or something
but so this is a problem and we face
that we try to come with come up with
something else we don't have that list
view thingy that is common in all other
media libraries we come up with an icon
based thing we put some files of those
bacteria like thingies on a surface and
now we give the user something that we
called a a sound torch flashlight so we
have a flashlight stick to the mouse
pointer and you can resize it with the
mouse wheel in our case whatever we have
a demo where you can control it with the
remote control it's pretty cool so you
can just add really that with the remote
but this is more for dmoz we have it on
the on the mouse pointer and if the
light comes to that icon it begins to
play hopefully
no it does not hey I you something wrong
with the sound play a you know
yeah we're so
and you wonder maybe you want about the
shape of that song this is just imagine
you know that great form images from
bone from your solid a little something
just wrap it around that circle or so
the shape is formed by the audio power
and due to the spinning speed of that
bacteria Venice you can have an idea how
long that sound if it's a fast-spinning
one that then it will cause a very short
sample if it's a it takes a longer time
this is a long recording whatever so and
you can browse just easily browse
explore through your database by just
drag and drop that surface you see you
find other things more
and what we do is that we have a virtual
model of speakers around that night
servant so you can set up even with that
program with whatever how many speakers
you have so we have a stereo system
right here but normally would
professional studio
a 7.1 surround system so we stick those
speakers around that light circuit and
that guy here
one of the top coming from the survival
center speaker so we use these
well-known cocktail party effect and the
brain just easily figure out if you
searching for assault would have
something they are something we're
behind me inside me
you're always sitting where the culture
is so all speakers are cute and of
course you can zoom in and zoom out and
you easily compared to where this
month-end atomic research
we hear it because the brain just skip
all the other things
yeah so what happens is that you can
zoom out and condition to let's say much
more than just one pile at the same time
you can listen to pairing 2050 hundred
whatever whatever the other thing is
that should cause your anything we had
those more thunderstorms ference right
here in background we have some metal
sword Shawn's right here we distribute
those items and that surface by that is
not really ought to find nowadays but
just extracting ms.vp pictures having a
self-organizing map and so we get a
cycle of just a similarity nothing so we
have always groups of more or less say
similar sounding things together on
several charges that surfing so okay we
have here a is more dim America's new
sounds on it but of course I can load
much more things let's say so i just
select another folder is just to reload
orbit stuff it takes a few seconds and
again you can go over it with your
flashlight and listen to all that stuff
in researching or exploring just your
database
somehow a song insulted some crazy
chemicals or whatever somewhat down this
is profession so we did some user tests
with it to try out if it's really fast
it to find something and a lot of this
and we asked our subjects to say can you
can you find a certain pattern in that
so we play make a sound something like
this one maybe this is just a small just
this little small blip and can you find
it so this comes due to you now if
you're a sound designer you often have
your database and you know I attempt
that recording power in it but applause
for something that but you know it is or
you have a very good idea of what kind
of sound here searching so you you have
the sound in here in your mind you're
searching for it and to similar they at
that we we said okay can you search for
that blip sound sounds like a lip gone
back to that map so can you when you
find that blip and normally you should
zoom out take some a certain left like
five and go over
well
Oh
to start entering you also promote ok
here is it so these are 160 sound files
and it takes a few seconds to find that
certain pattern that she knows so this
is I think that's amazing and one could
say ok that blip is somehow outstanding
ok you can hear it of course I can load
another map so let's say we have another
pattern can i play with this one somehow
where is the play no
so I have that ding dong thingy and I'm
just loading another map again least
takes again some seconds
so we have a lot more of just instrument
zones on business you know again the
more metallic things are on the upper
left and the doll sounds on the that
corner get these clouds and you go over
there always I don't know if you
remember that ding dong but again we'll
just go over
but those
it is so it turned out it works pretty
well yeah so much to santosh for the
future we try to enhance of course some
complementation issues putting more
stuff to do with graphic cards or
something it's a hard thing to mix
hundreds of fights if you listen to it
in real time always together or can we
do something with HRT FC related
transfer functions with hundreds of
files in real-time using the GPU or
something like that that's ongoing work
in our project with that aya will hand
over to urine just close my my fix
okay now you saw some bacteria like
icons what I'm going to show right now
is a work of two other students who
created the different shape of icons for
a different purpose namely icons that go
along with increased mp3 music files the
idea is we can plug into Windows
Explorer to create our own icons
procedurally on demand depending on the
content of a specific file so what we do
is we look into the content of every MP
thief mp3 file extract acoustic features
namely mfc CS and some sort of rhythmic
spectrum beats per minute spectrum and
with that information compose procedural
icon that is displayed everywhere where
you see icons in windows explorer I can
show that we've got that running on this
machine it's going to look like that
whenever you open some folder that
contains mp3 files you're going to see
these icons in different sizes and the
shape and the colors of these icons
should sport what's in them so we do not
attach labels to say genres or different
sounds yes we just create a sort of
visual representation for instance let
me go symbols for instance you see that
some mp3 files receive really similar
icons
and since this one here as this brownish
shape that's audible is it Oregon should
be audible it's not as it is okay that's
some kind of industrial techno sound and
this also is some kind of industrial
techno sound they receive the same same
shape if you look at some heavy metal
piece this one here it receives a pretty
different shape obviously their stuff in
between like this robot jungle piece
which is a blend so to speak between
industrial sound and have a method sound
this kind of icon creation is based on a
neural network the user picks say five
songs office or her liking to define how
those icons should be built so think
about your your music collection is a
landscape you try to pick sounds songs
at the outer edge of this length escape
you define icons for them by controlling
800 meters is I kotha if I can control
it in terms of color inner outer color
and in terms of the number of petals
into shape of petals this is what you
define for say five songs you train the
bureau network with their data and then
they use that neural network to create
icons for every mp3 file that may be on
that system we extract the acoustic
features from the mp3 files use the
neural network to look up which
parameters should go along with those
acoustic features and create bitmaps in
all sizes that are required and hand
them over to windows XP
we did use the tests on that question is
does wizard similarity or dissimilarity
translate to acoustic similarity or
dissimilarity and we found all that it's
pretty works out well what we did is we
actually printed those icons on
cardboard and asked subjects to sort
those guard BOTS by similarities so what
you see in the lower right are the
clusters that users formed from those
printed out icons this is these are the
clusters that one user found and these
are the classes that another user phone
so these clusters are pretty similar and
we went further but we played back with
songs after that it's just now the audio
is gone oh you're good sure so do we
have all you again okay we play back the
songs that belong to one of these
clusters and mixed in a song of an other
cluster and this song pretty much told
out the users were able to tell this
song from all other songs so we could
verify that there is a relation between
acoustic and visual similarity we've
thought about how to extend these ideas
one extension is a two dimensional
arrangement once you've got flowers in
your Windows Explorer you may think
about having fields of flowers this sort
of landscape genre landscape acoustic
landscape has been done quite a lot in
recent years here it combines nicely
with the icons when we display them as
some sort of flower field they are
pushed apart by some physical forces
physical simulation to not form very
dense clusters another application is
for very crowded this place like this
PDA
we can easy to display 150 songs on one
single screen by just showing those
icons and nothing else and now I hand
over to Micah or file system tricks
ok
the last part of the presentation that
will conclude somehow the overview of
our recent research is called file
system tricks for audio production what
we try to do is when we write all the
software prototypes we want to make a
search result accessible for other
software applications like Pro Tools on
window or whatever you're using in your
studio and all these machines are file
system based so whenever you want to
read a file you cannot just read it out
in SQL database you have to read it from
the file system and that we got the idea
of using virtual file systems I think
you're here google all probably know
what fuses and we thought about how to
make these files accessible if we have
an search outcome from sound torch and
then got so many more ideas about what
we could do with virtual file systems
together with audio content and I'm just
going to show you some of the demos that
I brought here right now the first
application that we did was can't we
just enhance the built-in search
functionality of an Apple computer like
spotlight and these virtual folders to
give us more audi related search results
and we found out we can it's quite easy
to write spotlight plugins and we did
music information retrieval applications
for spotlight for example you can search
your music depending on the syrah
crossing rate of a file which is just
one short prototype of an audio music
infirmity information retrieval
application the next question we asked
us was can we use fuse not only on Apple
machines or in Linux machines as it was
used a long time before like proc FS is
a very old software we wanted to use
fuse on a Windows machine and we found
out that like
as far as we know there are five
projects going on right now that try to
bring fuse to Windows and Windows Vista
there's only one that we could really
work with it's the doc on file system
driver and we came up with some
prototypes that should help you to work
with audio on a day to day life with
audio effects the first thing we do we
did was we call it riff regions file
system if you have a rough file for
let's say one hour length and you want
to work with that baffle it is quite
convenient to define regions in that bar
file where you can for example to say
okay now this guy speaking or now the
band's place or now the other guy
speaking and this is just a part of the
riff header where you can define that
region and you can name that region and
here i just did it for a Johnny Cash
song and it extracted all the different
verses of the Johnny Cash song and the
cocaine blues and here I still have the
original but i also have all the
different verses as a single file which
is just retro so this file does not
actually exist it's a virtual file
system it the fuse file system grabs the
region markers out of the roof header
and displays a new file to the file
system another application that we found
is it might be convenient to have all
your effects that you have installed on
your audio workstation this can be more
than 300 400 easily if you're working on
a professional studio also accessible
via the file system which we try to do
here for example you can open up the
guava effect as just a folder in the
file system and if you play back a file
from that folder the sounds will
automatically be processed with
effect another thing we did we call
audio processor day-to-day life
applications that you have to do as an
audio engineer for example you have to
normalize your audio files if you drag
files to these folders and read them
back again from these folders they will
automatically processed and you can put
these folders in one another and you can
for example like this build yourself an
own batch processing file system which
is thought of like an on-demand batch
processing I'm not going to demonstrate
it because it crashed sorry the last
file system application that we thought
of was if you're working in a studio you
very often have to face the problem that
you have networked windows vista and mac
OS 10 machines and in terms of file
handling and project management you want
to have all your files in a different
folder and you want to have them
accessible from all the machines and you
want to have the folders labeled maybe
by your project names and windows vista
and Makos 10 comes with this virtual
search folders where you save a search
and whenever you open up that folder
again all the search files will show up
in this folder again the only problem
that this system has if you save a
search on a 10 machine and you want to
open the search again on the one windows
vista machine you just see in the xml
file because basically the search is
just sneak some alpha and it works vice
versa again so we tried to address this
problem as well by using a standard SQL
database in the back end where we have
files tect with project names this is
basically an enhanced MySQL of s that we
hacked and what we can do now is we can
go into this mysql database and see here
we have two folders or files and search
we go into this folder all files we see
all the files that we have this is just
a short demo in our whole studio and we
can using the proud SQL database tak
these files as belonging to different
projects if we go back here into the
search folder and we see here we have no
project assigned yet if I make a folder
now denoted project a a new folders
created and in this folder automatically
all the files that have been tagged with
as being belonging to this certain
project are showing up as virtual files
again this is again no rocket science
it's the same thing that a spotlight
does with the same search on OS 10 and
windows mr. Duff with the same search
the good thing about this application
now is you can export this file system
just as an SMB share and it turns up
here again on every network machine and
it's accessible from everywhere so we
thought this is also quite convenient in
your everyday stool your life that
basically ends my presentation on file
system tricks for audio production
production and also our presentation
about enhanced audio search thanks you
all for participating and if you have
any questions feel free to ask them and
i'll be happy and sebastian and yon as
well to answer them hopefully
when you arrange your sounds by
psychophysical psycho acoustic
similarity on this 2d space what what
kind of method you use to compute that
similarity you mentioned it's kind of
from bright too dull but what what are
the dimensions and how is it computed
and you train it or is it some simple
standard measure or what is it I mean
over this question to the best time
please you mean at sound towards the
distribution so in an pre-processing
step we extract all the mfc CS with
let's say 10 milliseconds windows frame
size and take the first 13 dimension of
it so certain dimensions of em FCC's and
we take the median so we have a whole
bunch for everything we take the median
thing in the middle to for the let's say
one shot thing to find a certain vector
that we can use to put it on on that
surface and then we take most files as
possible to train that self organizing
map with that 13 dimensional vectors and
that just chains itself and distribute
it all that whole thing that is so there
are no fixed Labor's to the axis it's
it's yeah there are no loose limbs yes
of course you cannot all the time you
get a new self organizing map with some
or changes of course because it's more
or less random what's coming out
I was wondering that was a good question
i was my first question my second
question was on that same torch
application it sounded like you said
that the speakers are arranged around
the user but how do you decide what's in
front and what's behind and can you like
rotate the plane so that once something
that's behind the user is now in front
user so I'm sorry if I don't know
something about the Sun set up right in
here so we have this is the this was a
fallback sterile solution so we of
course we just have two speakers and I
don't know the speakers are arranged in
this place but right now I understand
the limitations of this auditorium in
the sound studio what direction on that
circle is to user facing Collins onions
front how do you say what sounds are in
front and what sounds are in back Appa
sand front darkness behind you pointer
Murray and users head is their users hat
at the mouse point but so how do you
decide what sounds to put it in front of
the user in what sounds to put mine and
what if user likes to turn around can
you do that in your tool which other we
can but we don't want to because it
would break the system it just works as
the sound comes from that direction as
you see it because then you know I okay
I hear from vector that direction and
then I can move my search light into
that direction and if you turn your head
it's okay if you turn the mouse then it
moves which makes some which makes that
the cocktail party effect easier if it's
always moving because you're moving Saul
sources if it's a fixed image so to say
then it's harder so you can the more you
move with the mouse the easier it is
next question please so I've done some
amateur audio design for things when i
was in uni and sound torch looks really
cool can I get it I think so yes of
course publicly around it's not publicly
available yet we have to fix a lot of
installation issues and
have to make it work on more graphic
card it already leverages quite a lot of
graphical graphic cards computation
power but it will be available cool it
is for its it's based on the.net 3
framework and with written with the XM a
thingy from Microsoft but if you have
the Venus machine then it should be
possible cool decent graphics card any
further questions
