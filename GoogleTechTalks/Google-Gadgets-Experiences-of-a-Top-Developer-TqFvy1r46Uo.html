Thompson who was a here from Henderson
Kentucky and Michael Thompson's been in
the Google Gadget ecosystem for a long
time and way back when it was stumbling
and a kibble emoticon i guess it was
called we had no idea what it was
putting this cute and it was weird and
we thought hey see what happens them
that was kind of popular and 90 gadgets
later on the consumer side three gadget
three gadget ads and now multiple gadget
ad templates and Michael Thompson is you
know mathematically speaking the number
one gadget author in the world you won't
see it in the top authors because he's
number one because of his ads including
right now on ebay which is you know up
until very recently the number one
gadget in the world why traffic so
anyway without further ado I thought I'd
introduce a michael thompson who though
who's i'm told very nervous but you
shouldn't be as it you know these are
all your friends so you know in the
toidy okay well it was a great intro we
probably go down from there presumably
you're listening to this talk because
you're interested in google gadgets so
online I think eventually what we call
the lab will become everybody's file
system and what we call browsers will be
the shell people use to operate on that
file system and the things we're calling
gadgets will overtake gadgets and other
web applications will overtake
conventional applications and importance
so I think it's a good thing to be
interested in right now so it's today
particularly we're going to cover how I
got started with gadgets a few things
that were successful a lot of things
that fail and some of the few things
I've done to try to promote my gadgets
and we'll also talk about games gadget
ads for nissan ebay and target
try to disperse away this is the family
concept that hadn't talked about way the
way this came about my daughter's in our
major both at work and she drew these
older you know faces she was doing ice
and I tried to animate it so if you look
at this live and I'm not sure what's
going to happen when we do this I guess
if you've seen it only moves even watch
the one at the top of the corner just
kind of as it's a probably one of the
worst designs in history internally but
it is cute
that didn't start
won't you again
to hear that and we're off again okay so
that was the live version thumb way
eventually started using too much
process from time on the shared server
so this is a picture thought my today
got evicted from the shared server we
had to move it to a dedicated server
right now my gadgets and the supporting
weds websites those 90 gadgets use about
four gigs of bandwidth every taste in
general at the beginning of the year was
about six gig per day but I revisited
all the gadgets and implemented the new
image caching features all the new
caching features I could find and that
had come up in the API after the initial
launch and so let's save about two gig
per day hats off to the API p.m. for
that one gadgets can be really valuable
to webmasters who want to get additional
traffic for their sites it's next one
this is a pong game the poem that video
game remember that that's what got me
started in programming I saw that I said
I don't want to learn how to do and see
this
a little better
try this see I started a scoring contest
I didn't know the laser pointer would
you go
started a high score contest and even
before the contest it was actually doing
pretty well was the number of my number
one gazzard for a while and it kind of
covers around the top five right now
first contest was six
this is robot arm cost me about 50 bucks
and was surprised people were competing
for and so forth the contest Randall
Aaron and about December I started to
realize that it depends on where the
winter lives how much it costs to ship
this thing and so I started looking at
the IP addresses of you know they were
logged with the scores and there wasn't
a single us address in the top five
there was one guy over in our gallery
whatever over in Chicago that looked
like they had a chance i was really go
chicago come on shikon and you can see
here the winner was in Italy so so my
fifty dollar prize I had to add $65 to
ship it over and then a hundred dollars
value-added tax so so oops this this
year the contest prizes I think you can
see it on that on that slide back here
some gift certificates that can be
emailed
this next gadget this is a surprise hit
for me it's today in history with it the
way that came about it if you've been
around a long time you remember on the
UNIX systems there's a date tag list of
events the system administrators used to
use to add a little interest to the
message of the day people would log in
it would say system going down at nine
o'clock tonight for backup and they
could also add these little entries you
know like today in history this happened
so and there was also much longer list
of advanced that used to float around in
the newsgroups back when news groups
were really about all there was to the
internet and so I put those two lists
together and a few weeks after i
submitted that i saw thousands of people
were looking at it so i mean i began to
wash things a lot more carefully home I
realized there were a lot of factual
errors and those common lists that I
started working with so after that I
budgeted roughly about an hour a day for
a year to go through and I made
thousands of Corrections and some items
I had to eliminate all together and I
also added things as it would happen
like Katrina or when Steve our own guy
got killed in a freak accident and then
in the help section of the gadget I
invited users to help me find
typographical errors or duplications or
factual errors and most people that
responded that we're really kind and
encouraging some of them weren't get
messages that I think they were using
this template and say you are obviously
no check the political party or religion
support or the tractor you should get a
brain or 9,000 deaths because on their
stance of different things so I get a
lot of those and I also made a version
of porta diversion to
suitable for the iphone which is is just
trivial to do just takes moments and a
few days later I've got an email from
apple saying you know who published that
today history app and I feel hope you're
going to sue me we're going to see me
what I do and then turned out they just
liked it and they wanted me to submit it
to their directory and make some more
you know I might do it again later if i
decide i'm interested i don't know yet
but today in history gadget now is
almost fully automated what i did is i
picked out for news feeds and i get the
top five headlines at the end of the day
what i call the end of the day from from
each of these new news feeds there's one
in the course US and india china I've
got the BBC Australia and I just saved
those top five headlines and then one
year later I add those to the bottom of
the today in history list for that date
so it's almost fully automated I'm to
kind of look at it sometimes it will say
something that's really not really
doesn't make sense in that context I was
very careful to read the Terms of
Service for the feeds I used you're
hoping okay it doesn't look like they're
going to sue me for doing this then very
careful about that at one point one of
my top gadgets was magic 8-ball virtual
magic 8-ball always wanted one of those
when I was a kid I never got one so I
learned how to make a JavaScript program
i made a virtual amazing people I should
be saying right now magic 8-ball
trademark Mattel and but one day
suddenly dropped off the google page
like cement hit a switch and i started
load searching around and I saw people
blogging where they've gotten cease and
desist letters from Mattel so
I guess it turned out a guest and I was
correct that mine was a victim too so I
made the amazing crystal ball instead
and it has about 10,000 users again on
sep tember sixth of this year just like
suddenly this gadget shot up by a factor
of 10 in the number of new installations
each day I don't know why I'm still
trying to figure it out whenever I go
search for it the only way i can find it
is i search for it explicitly you know
right I know I know exactly what to
search for but I don't find any
references to it it's hard for me to
find it in the directory because there's
some kind of cookie sanger saying oh
he's already got it or he's had it
before don't show it to him again or I
don't know exactly how that works I had
theories about start of the school year
angular deflection the moon I don't know
my guess best guess at this point it has
crawled to the top of the heap somewhere
I wish I knew would cheap it was its
continued to climb and right now it's
doing about 20 times more new
installations each day than it was
during the march September baseline it's
a it's a canvas based gadget everybody
familiar with the canvas tag in HTML you
ever used it probably nobody uses it
it's terrific it i mean in live and if i
if i do the live thing again i don't
know what's going to happen when we try
to do it one more general
here there you see how they kind of
rotate around over the last week this
unbelievable but science teacher
contacted me and he was asking questions
about it I clogging I was probably
really not suitable for use in education
so he said okay we'll fix that and he
started helping me with like little
details like Kepler's law and stuff
about astronomy I had no idea about so
that's been nice and I think if I if I
kill this boy go back to the
presentation no okay was worth a shot
we're there okay so
I used some of my own metrics to try to
tell I don't know see that very well or
not do you see the solar system there
blowing the curve and what this is is
it's a pretty good indication it's not a
perfect indication but a pretty decent
education first time somebody installed
this gadget and then I can look at
google analytics and see how with the
keep rate you know how many people are
actually keeping it I say if I see it
going up you know whatever rules two or
three hundred a day and then in Google
Analytics I see it maybe I have that or
two-thirds of that I know kind of what
reaction maybe it's just a novelty that
tried don't like it get rid of it but
you know there is stuff some continuous
growth and the other thing you can see
is is that about you know first three or
four gadgets are more popular than all
the other gadgets combined so since
since most of my work would be
considered unsuccessful efforts we
probably ought to talk about those
here's a quick look they let the at the
Google Analytics you guys all know who
you've invented this so you've seen it
and you can see here's a little
different picture than today in history
one is the one that blows the curve here
this gadget coming up next I was very
enthusiastic about I'm not going to
touch the laser pointer visit thanks my
half of it see the shadow of the shuttle
there I thought that was really cool and
what you can do is with gmaps use the
cursor keys and you can navigate around
the globe you know map just scrolls
underneath you and it has designed into
it a little mission brief about 20
missions you know like go to Perth
Australia wait for an upload then go
back to Houston and so I thought man
this is going to be great you fly the
shuttle played with google maps and you
learn some geography you know which way
is purple straight up and out of two or
three hundred million people to possibly
look at it you can see 105 users agree
with me that's really great is this one
also got a response i'm not kidding not
making it up from nasa and well actually
it was just a brief series of emails
from a rather perturbed gentleman who
works in some dark corner of the jet
propulsion lab and he wanted me to know
in no uncertain terms that the real
space show does not make sharp turns
like that and work in it hover over a
city and he gave me several other
reasons why I'm just no good this is
another gadget I was kidding out miss
Devlin then when I have a big warm up
this next gadget it has excitement
danger romance a 60 second game clunk
and less than a hundred users
probably work about two weeks to make
that happen this next one I worked on in
about 10 days I think but I know I spent
three months just picturing in my mind
how do I do this how do I make this work
and I think if I'd had this one in the
directory like in December of 2005 it
would it really would have really taken
off it's like a persistent scratch pad
and what you do is you can think of
color did you take your mouse and drag
it around in the whole work area and it
remembers what you drew and if you want
to you can give yourself a nickname and
hit submit and it shows up on this web
page this is actually a screenshot of a
website where people have submitted
different ones you can see I drew Snoopy
and I thought it was a neat idea and was
well executed and everything this pretty
so pretty well sums up to your response
to the community so that's that's enough
of that I got lots of emails about
gadgets this fall I started getting may
be back in the summer I started getting
messages from people with these
elaborate plans and they had one thing
in common they all started out have you
heard about the Google Grants for gadget
development we noticed you have several
gadgets that would qualify and as I
consider these these particular sounding
offers I've tried to imagine Google
handing money over to improve the
amazing crystal ball you know a thought
okay there it is what would I do with
the money one of the world why I say
okay I'm going to hire somebody to
convert the predictions into haiku I'm
going to hire Nostradamus as a
consultant well the ghost of non-stop
drums so we'll have a better predictions
nada Scotty's can't see it so what most
of those I don't bother to respond to I
also i have one gadget that gets really
hot in October and November it's a
whorehouse and it has ghosts and spooky
sound effects
I got a series of emails about that one
an individual wrote that he could hear
the spooky sound effects even after
deleting the gadget well I'm not kidding
he also posted it as a comment there
could not stop the sound even after I do
lead in the gadget well that seriously
that worried me because you know I call
those sound effects with a timer and I
don't use sound files that often so I
would probably really don't know what
I'm doing is so maybe something i'm
doing is bad so i wrote him back to find
out more about the circumstances and he
told me that he still hear the sound
effects after deleting the gadget
restarting his browser and rebooting his
computer so at that point i was really
tempted you know like dear sir we regret
to inform you that your pc is now really
haunted it's a it's a known issue with
the haunted house gadget recommended
workaround issue causa with holy water
and but i passed on adam can you imagine
the consequences that be a link on digg
to a youtube video this house fire
related to a Google Gadget through them
so i took that i took the high road and
reported it to a friend and here google
went along to my source code say tell me
if I did something wrong there's a
there's another individual on the
license he's very concerned about the
quality of quality of experience for the
Google Gadget users I know he is because
diligently posted a comment similar to
this one on any gadget I have it has
more
two thousand users looks like the name
of the site a higher quality experiences
came out blurry on this slide you pull
up to that so as you know gadgets are
now being deployed his ads I'm told this
one for a while was getting more views
than any other gadget in the world so I
guess that meant to continue to work for
what the way that came about is a lot of
people here at Google and people he may
combine their ingenuity and expertise to
make that happen so all I really had to
do is listen really carefully try to
understand what they were telling me
which wasn't always easy and then
expressed that as gadget one thing I do
like about this design is that a single
source file is producing these different
shapes one you know I really have to
have things simplified if I if if the
project was you know create a separate
source file for each shape then every
time somebody came up with a new idea or
an improvement I would have had to
implement it correctly you know three or
four times and if you talk to any of the
people to work with me on this they
would tell you that often it took me
several tries to get something right one
time so if you can imagine the simpler
the better and then this ad can accept a
keyword for querying the ebay back end
or you can use the site it's on to fetch
a content related keyword I didn't
invent that but I thought it was a good
idea
you can do that one of the first test
sites was one of those sites where they
show pictures of celebrities and
embarrassing situations and we were
testing this in the first time I saw the
gadget live it was adjacent to this
candidate photo of some poor young lady
and a bikini trying to climb into a
speedboat and I felt well I finally
crossed over to the dark side and but I
guess we can produce a useful ad in that
context that were just about anywhere
the next add the target ad got the
benefit of all the everything learned
the hard way on the email but the
development time on this was about one
quarter of what was on the ebay and the
designs a little different to ebay ad
has the search box as a last resort if
it couldn't find any appropriate items
bliss this one has a search box and in
all instances here in this case a single
source file is producing seven different
sizes if the user mouse is over listing
it changes that image to the right
accordingly you know nasty when he's
moused over it it can pick a keyword
from a list and an external xml file and
also if they wanted it to it could
display if it didn't find any
appropriate listings you can play a
target video it's also skin so that
background image like you can see this
tower on the right has a little Holly
around it in other words using that you
just replace that image as well as long
as you're respectful no as long as you
can respect the location search box and
the logo at the top it works for it so
one of the guys I work with knows where
I'm Anna they kind of cover my back on
doing this this is the Nissan ad for one
of these sons cars and starts off with
the gmaps showing common inviting zip
code box and so someone can see them
current traffic conditions in their area
which is pretty to me that's pretty
decent that's all I did but then you can
also explore the interior of the car I
think this was on this next slide you
can drag the image around there's six
hot spots you can zoom in zoom out there
on the on the bottom there that's my
favorite the one the skyline it's the
most richly interactive gadget I've had
the pleasure of developing but you can
maybe I you know consider the list of
requirements he said you know in three
shapes banner Talyn rectangle and also
as a homepage gadget toggle between a
slightly hacked version of gmaps and
images of the interior of a car detect
which of the four different ad groups
and three different sizes the given
instance of their ad is running and
report all exits in some interactions by
calling the appropriate corresponding
double-click URL while inside the car
the user will be zooming in around
dragging and dropping the background
thanks Adam and so the hot spots have to
stay right don't lay those hot spot call
outs and secure the logo or the exterior
shot of the car and while you're at it
we're eight weeks late over budget and
make the images of that car Chris hurry
up so tonight might understand why my
favorite view is the skyline and but
actually I was able to use just kind of
straightforward set of arrays to handle
the whole
one source flat and one last topic for
me that I guess they're going to be
plenty of time for questions I said
these are some examples of templates
have been given the opportunity to work
on and they're currently the source
files for these are struggling to
survive the strictest code review in the
history of mankind just just kidding
there is actually was a stricter really
would believe you know there actually
was one stricter review but that one
doesn't really count because developed
the developer just jump out a window and
they use these code as what it was then
but I think now I understand why there's
no really tall buildings on the Google
campus I think I think the templates are
a great idea it's an important next step
for the gadget ads because at least in
my opinion this gives a way for small
midsize companies that couldn't pony up
a big development upfront development
costs or wouldn't take a chance on it it
gives him a way to kind of ease into it
real fast and if they give good results
you know for example I mean a lot of
companies are going to be glad to have a
quick easy way to get a coupon out there
is fill in the blank I got a coupon with
my logo morning okay that doesn't sound
too bad so I think unless you have
something like that like the templates
that will be hard for gadget as ever get
out of what Michael a chronology stage
this way something everybody will be
interested in and at this point I wish I
had a really profound conclusion for
everyone but I think most world commodes
at this point is that's all I had to say
have any questions
it's okay if you know
mortgages okay I'm supposed to repeat
the question biggest statement motivates
me to write more gadgets there's like no
there's not just one thing a lot of this
work I did to try to impress my daughter
you know like a try to impress her with
some way and if I work really hard like
three months I can't I can impress it
for like two minutes that's that's part
of it the other thing i found out really
fast was fro as i have some mildly
popular websites i mean its sole model a
popular that you never seen them or
heard of them but but these actually
drive traffic to those websites and all
once right the website you can have a
nice little Adsense ad there and
somebody might it could happen they
could click on so that's part of this
and and the other part is just me
personally I have to have a challenge I
had to have something occupying on mind
if I you know won the lottery bought an
island in the South Pacific I would be
bored out of my mind after about four
hours I'd had to go create a problem you
know let's cadillac LOL the
invertebrates and again
have to have that challenge and these
were kind of a fun challenge at my day
job this is my hobby okay my day job I
write software for industrial equipment
and then the equipment is is huge it's
like three stories tall it has hundreds
of times of lockup for us it has molten
aluminum in it has this cylinder that
takes off like a rocket with 3,000
pounds per square inch of pressure it's
going like as fast as a bullet and
there's people around this thing and
I've got software communicating with
that so you know sometimes it is not
exactly terrifying all the time but a
lot of times you know if I make a
mistake from make the wrong code
mistakes I make it really been hurt if I
make a mistake here so I oh you know
this doesn't look right in Safari okay I
can fix that nobody space got mold on
we're good so it's really it's kind of a
very relaxing sort of thing and also it
turns out you know I'm not that bad at
it except for code reviews everything
on the consumer gadgets you know just
runs in the directory at what I just
tested to satisfy myself I try all the
different features that i designed for
it if it works try to make sure i have
no javascript errors the want to show
you one thing if I am I don't know if
it's gonna I think it's okay to look at
this
this is a test harness that I made one
way we're trying to figure out the tarc
out of ebay ask you let me start there
Betty ebay and I've got a version of it
here so what we did what would happen is
they give me a new
something that like we have to log some
new information than antelope before and
it would have some kind of unintended
maximize that if it's max but have some
kind of unintended side effect because I
wouldn't remember to test it in all
cases so what we did is is I made a
script that would green comments embed
again the gadget source file and and for
example and this one you can see you
know I have a like what happens when the
search descriptions of a certain case
and for some reason I'm not doing this
exactly right I'm kind of nervous I
guess still bit but these are the
different test cases and the idea is
that given all these scenarios it still
needs to look right you know there was a
bad site no site malformed site no token
no user too few results minimum number
of results and so forth all these
different test cases so every time we
make a change before I would send it off
to Adam say okay here it is I had to
just frog for all of our benefits run it
through this again and make sure it
would pass all those tests that we know
about and then later on maybe it's hard
to think of an example right now but in
various times we would add to these
tests like something would happen we
find a bug so we would add that to the
test it's kind of reactive I don't know
if I answered your questions
satisfactorily
most time of the testing the most
time-consuming part honestly for me in
general most of my gadgets is thinking
ahead of time of what the design is
going to be like for all the consumer
gadgets like the solar system and today
in history a in each case probably I
spent a lot more time thinking ahead of
how's this going to look or how's this
going to work how am I going to
implement it that's where all the time
was and then one actually came time for
coding is maybe the short so maybe I
thought about planning maybe it's better
we're going to plan this long and and
have this much time for coding and maybe
the testing goes on into the last user
is dead hahaha you built somebody got
and I'm curious like how I usually find
instead of a TI region
okay useful things about the API gadget
librarian things i would i would like to
see for me it is probably not what
you're looking for a bit for me would be
almost at the top of the page when I go
to the API documentation we'd be like a
little box with Fran said here's a log
of the last 15 changes with me this is
the date this is the change anybody was
just one sentence you know we're like an
XML feed that I can have a little gadget
say and I can see we made a change from
any change different things like it to
be honest it's a very rare occurrence
but it has happened where some change in
the API cause the gadget throw an error
you know in for a gadget developer like
me I mean you know I'm maybe I finished
that 14 months ago you know tested it
worked there now all said I'm getting
emails that it's not working or I see
the number of installations plummeting
you know something's wrong I don't know
what so it's kind of like an earthquake
what happened and so that would be the
first one and but but in general
everything I've seen you guys do in the
APR is just it just keeps getting better
and better I thought the caching was
great you know I still think I won't do
it because I vow to always use my powers
for good but someone had to use that to
make the Google file system you know it
seriously could I thought about how you
in good and that caching idea that was
terrific and
that's probably been the biggest help
overall I think 11 area for improvement
is is I don't do it much but some people
handle flash files and then it's not
quite smooth yet exactly how you do that
how you wrap javascript around then that
flash unless unless you're just going to
show somebody a youtube video with the
default YouTube player is pretty strict
if you get outside of that it's really
difficult I how much used to I make up
the gadget directory and do I have any
future suggestions for it I probably
look at the gadget directory once or
twice a a day just depends only on what
I'm thinking about sometimes I'll have
an idea for a gadget one of the first
things when I have this idea when the
first things I do is go look to see if
somebody's already done it most the time
they have you know or something so close
to it that I don't wanna bother
sometimes I don't care I don't think you
know they do that very well why it is
going to be great and now get 100 users
the comments really bothered me
sometimes there's sometimes there's
vulgarity in the comments and I'm doing
because you know my daughter okay she's
18 the oldest was 21 yeah they've seen
it they've heard on it but if I could
have it so I could show up stuff and not
worry about them seeing that I'd like
that and I've reported a few comments
and the pad kind of makes results
sometimes Elding the other day were gone
and sometimes I never heard anything I
don't know but how can you control it
you know me it's like Google people are
going to write stuff on the wall they're
going to spray paint you know the
buildings outside and they're going to
put stupid comments
make a comment so I only some asleep so
what can you do you know but I think one
of the things I wondered when you first
started was how are you going to handle
it because I'm making more more gadgets
than list is getting long in other
people are gonna make more gadgets
tonight I thought it was really handled
well we show like the top four or five
gadgets and whatever however many more
16 look and where he could open that up
so it really compacted that the director
I thought that and and the last
suggestion i have would be to check for
author michael at michael thompson gorge
in go ahead and put that at the top
hahaha yes once you three
of persistence some kind of persistence
and as you started that you've got that
dot set when you very first started you
didn't have any way for us to do
anything persistent some of the things I
do like the high score the palm game ok
I have to log that on my own server if
there was some safe way for me and the
user wrecking save their high score for
them and really wasn't subject to
somebody saying oh here's the URL just
changing I have a 8000 home you know so
some safe way for me to have some
persistent data I know the challenge is
that you know you google has such a
tremendous respect for people's privacy
and you're not going to do anything to
jeopardize that or even give the
appearance of jeopardizing that so
probably it makes persistence harder but
that would be the thing if you let me
point to a log of high scores or
different things like that things that
I'm doing incorrectly on the server have
a good big deal yea it's going on about
how much volume of
here's some cash
or because I'm job how much impact do
you think it has it's actually like
taking some complex that actually
yes there is the question was how do I
get a lot of email is it helpful and and
is there a correlation between the
number of people using the gadgets and
email again and the answer it depends
like if we if there's a surge of that
temporary unavailable you know that goes
on for six or eight hours I'll start to
get a lot of messages where's family
where's pong you know you're not good
because it's gone and that's that's one
of the top lines and it wouldn't work if
I get like one or two I don't really say
thing but if I start to see a pattern
I've got like this many in the inbox you
know I've been sending a email off to
Grievous and just in case it helps
anybody you know this is what I'm saying
things like on some gadgets like the
today in history when somebody points
out a typo or a factual error or
whatever it helps add their name to the
credits not their email address but just
their name you know whatever they gave
me you know and people seem to respond
by that you know I knows people give me
two or three things what we do put a
star beside my name by three
I don't know and it is kind of funny
like for example on recipe of the day
that has the highest number of you
recipe of the moment has highest number
of users I don't get any email about
that there's no comments there's not one
raid okay and I get most of comments
about anything that's a game you know
people say oh you know who this sucks go
to Google Warcraft right so you know
those I consider those not the gentleman
that contact me about solar system you
had you know he was asking questions I
said you know what I wouldn't use this
in education as it is and he said okay
let's see let's go you know and so I'm
going to credit him on the help file and
really worked hard on you know he's
giving me diagrams and explained which
moons of Jupiter go clockwise and which
ones go counterclockwise really digging
into it's great and I don't know what
will happen with it I don't know if
it'll show up in some 8th grade science
class but but that'd be neat if it did
you know if it was really help somebody
that would be nice
your experience lessons learned creating
gadgets for advertisements right the
tolerance on what you see is plus or
minus zero pixels I'm going to learn
that I learned that the Russian says I'm
just gonna go ahead and say a lot of
times the people is not just true in
this industry but a lot of times the
people who make decisions about what
happened or the people who don't know
actually how to do anything and they
really don't know how to do anything
there's no other job with them in the
company but to decide what we're going
to do this today or that you know so you
know so there's a lot of uninformed
decisions made or or people coming
things and they have really no idea in
you know if you start talking about a
URL they so I wit get all technical on
me I'm not making that I really got that
response no I noticed sometimes I think
I kind of have an advantage I don't know
if you notice about one of the older
gentleman and I've been I've worked in
sales i worked in cost estimating I've
done I've had a lot of jobs Farley found
I could do and one of the things i
learned with is how to talk to customers
you know for you know this is something
else I probably shouldn't say but too
many customer you kinda like babies you
know they crying to get wet got a powder
the diagram this had to be super patient
and can't be too patient Gus told my
girlfriend and she was mad anyway so so
you know he's had to be very patient and
accept them you know to accept the
customer work wherever they are mentally
you know and I have to communicate with
them however they want to communicate
and then sometimes that means they want
to burn four or five days between email
messages or not well they don't want to
get on gmail and use that hand a little
chat or they want to take two weeks I'm
not making it up two weeks to schedule
one phone call talk about somebody's got
some time and their time like a schedule
phone call two weeks you see that on the
chart good gosh and also you just really
have to be patient with customers and
because because really you're on the
same team I mean both of you want to
make money right both of you want to
make at be successful both Michael
Holmes and I did great today so so we
really do for me I keep looking for how
can I make this a win-win situation how
can we both come out all of us come out
winners so anything I touch that's
that's how I approach and salama let it
like to say a big lesson for me it
really was the plus or minus 1 pixel and
also I don't know what Chris means if
somebody says that images not just not
crisp enough I'm dead I am I talk I
talked to someone who works in
advertising I was telling him that story
was really a nice gentleman I mean he
said you know I know exactly what
talking about he says it means to take a
kind of low-resolution image and make it
look better maybe give it a little more
white you know and you can kind of trim
the edges a little better weather may be
jagged in those kinds of things so he
knew exactly what they meant but and in
that case in that instance I didn't know
how to do it and I kind of kind of put
the ball in their court i said i'm sorry
i don't think i can understand what
you're asking for in time to do this or
even if i do understand i may not have
the capability so you guys have this art
department let me give you the
individual images make them however you
want and we'll stick around i'm dead
they were real happy about that it's
like their destiny was in their hands
you know and you know I do drag it on
and pretend I knew what they were
talking about or try two or three them
it would have just made it worse and so
but I actually like working with people
in and you know what I had some of the
best results of the people who started
out being the most difficult you know in
in industrial manufacturing you run into
a table pounders you know they pound the
table to get all mad and everything if
you ever run into a table pounder maybe
you can just reach over pat him on the
shoulder thing don't like it tough right
you know and make them laugh a little
bit and you can win
I'm wondering if you have any ideas or
wishes for a cow yeah interaction with a
container for instance right now you
forgot a link you're basically going to
open up in a new window what definitely
I'm opening up an expanded you
understand container and also forget to
sort of brought their renovation right
now small side
you know that that's a to me that to two
things was the question was what do I
think about being able to expand the
size of the container of the gadget and
or maybe something different happens
other than going to open a new site when
I click on a link in a gadget and you
know if you think about it since 2005
you know one or two gadgets of power off
and whatever pattern I've been making
I've always thought about I'm going to
square this bit so I haven't really had
time to absorb what happens if you if
you really expand I do have one gadget
that's a maze and I use the standard
open-source maze generating algorithm to
create the main and I just went ahead
and said you know and whatever space you
have right so it uses that canvas tag
and which you can draw on just like a
bitmap you give an XY coordinates
plotting our greater we want to do and
so just playing around with that one if
you expand it what happens is you get a
more complicated maze it gets bigger so
in that case that gosh that would be
that would be great on the other hand as
a webmaster and they click on something
sometimes I wanted to go to my side and
accidentally click on my adsense head
maybe you know so I don't necessarily
want to just keep them trapped in that
in the gadget but I think there's
something a lot of gadget authors are
going to that happened but have to give
it a whole lot of thought and you know
maybe that maybe a lot of the others
would be a lot smarter than me they tell
it suddenly oh yeah I can do this now
you do that right now I just gotta
boggled by don't know
what would happen is I don't think it's
bad but it opens up a lot of new
possibilities that's almost always good
Oh so one of the things to talked about
yesterday with some of the problems that
you had in authoring gadgets
particularly layout with gadget ads and
I wanted to mind sharing that with you
for some problems with gadget ads if I
can pull back to that let us show you
this kind of a learning thing like that
like the first one we really like the
most time on was this ebay had ok I'm
going to give it a keyword gmail see if
there's any gmail and counsel for sale
on eBay about 99 cents i can get one
okay the layout of this one this is the
banner and obviously in a rectangle you
can imagine what we the design called
for was pull that list underneath the
underneath the logo with that image and
on the tower you know it's had the logo
on the top and and two or three images
down you know download the tower so on
that when the approach was embedded in
the gadget is some HTML with some some
big obvious tags where you can replace
things kind of a baby version of
something that you know like a really
good template generator terrorism would
happen and the annum works I think it
works effectively on the target the city
looking to the next one on the target ad
okay now on that one with something we
didn't really have time in the you know
given the time constraints and all the
other things we were trying to do was
and what we talked about it on the ebay
ad was just say okay let's just let's
just set up some divs and look at the ID
and just everything as a like the OEM
replacement you know just got replaced
so that one pretty much works that way
and it's scanned you notice we just skip
it this background image and till the
gadget a little bit about you know
here's where your local coordinates are
here's your coordinates for the search
and and that's really all it needs to
know so no matter what shape it is as
long as it has those certain coordinates
in an array they can handle it right so
that design makes the code a lot shorter
okay so those are the kinds of kind of
the thought process we went through then
like when the Nissan ad I'm not kidding
I'm not making it up the the expectation
was that I was going to make a set of
files with a image map for this shape
and this shade
this shape and i would i would have had
to i'd still be working on it because my
mind just doesn't work that way and and
I really i'm not good at getting
something right here and over here and
over here i'm doing good if I just get
it right in swing spot and then make it
figure out how to do these other shades
or whatever so you know I couldn't I
couldn't really thrive in an environment
where i had to have all these separate
files fairly so I was just lucky the
JavaScript and the object model of all
that has a way where you can do it was
just one source file I was wondering if
you have any experience with
internationalizing again is trying to
make
while your audience game you do if you
have any comments on experience in
English sure if you don't thanks it was
a good try something here but
when I was first talking to that running
I'm sorry when we were first this is the
guts of it when we were the question was
about internationalization and when it
first talks about the ebay ab the
individual google it was contacting me
about it it's one of those far sighted
people who tries to think of everything
and he was talking on the phone and the
information was coming really fast he
said ok we have some I a I ate in issues
and I'm like on Google I ate in yeah
yeah ok and the book but this one of the
things I figured out what you do pull
this up here now I had everything I was
going to say in my top of everything I
was gonna say on my talk on paper up
here so that's why the computer down
below that so
one of the things we thought about gosh
I can find this at the end because one
of the things we thought about was the
different currency symbols
maybe an old version I was just going to
show you the script but to answer your
question basically what we did was
putting out an algorithm that you know I
looked up the different rules for
displaying the formats of currency and
just put in an algorithm that could
could handle that we gave it some rules
like because it use a comma or decimal
point isn't you know from the right to
left or left to right there were some
surprising things you know about
different ways the world displays
currency and the different little
punctuation marks they do so in the
algorithm and just replace and I just
started off thinking okay how do we do
it and lay that pattern out and then use
an array of currency symbols okay this
is us so the dollar sign goes here okay
this is the bridge pound so that means
dollar sign panel tine goes there and so
on for the numbers for Matt it was a
little bit different you know whether
they use commas how many places after
the decimal place someone once number
two and so forth so the way I handled it
was to make a little algorithm to you
know give it an amount and which of
these six or eight different ones we put
it we plugged in there would you know
how should that display given that
currency and it was really easy we made
it a user pref and but I don't think
anybody ever actually I don't think
they've got that far yet but I tell you
what it's probably going to be a really
you know that's going to be a really big
challenge it's almost like a gadget /
language or whatever almost unless you
do you put something in the source code
animal cases your one hand
to try to promote your gadgets or you
find that they will
one of the one of the things I do I try
to show you in here talk about promoting
gadgets lost my mouth one of the things
I do is I have some gadgets refer to two
other gadgets so like if somebody goes
to him gosh as presentations wreck see
what you've cleaned up here
shooters
ok
that's pain so like go down here okay
here's the Christmas calendar okay you
remember when you were kids they'd have
some of some of his headless little
cardboard calendars you peel back one
day at a time that's what this does you
accept it looks at what day it is and
you can't click on 10 yet they'll say
wait till this weekend and in the help
file in the help file for for that one I
might be able to show it to you but in
the help file for that one it talks
about another one it says if you like
this right you might also like the kind
of like these kind of like you might
also like the Christmas snow globe
so one thing all my gadgets have a here
it is here's the Christmas snow globe
and the help file on it talks about the
Christmas calendar and the haunted house
gadget talks about the halloween pumpkin
and and so forth today in history
because it's it kids seems like the kind
of users that are interested in a lot of
different things we just go here here
sears an instance of today in history
and you see this is the mouth showing up
yet free software okay there's a random
gadget so I haven't you know that
remember we started off that index of
all my gadgets every time you can click
that just pick one at random and invites
you to I'm okay I'm not making this up
somebody that works for me she's really
used to work for me a really bright
developer and really sharp I really
liked working with her but she got a
better offer and I couldn't match it I
said is there anything else I can do is
there anything else I'm vegetable I'm
gonna pull me so her show pony she
didn't stay this is the city today and
it's your they can also add you like my
car here i could say so try to do
they'll never forget this talk get this
one you know so it'll show up every year
on the december hands whatever it is
so that's how I promote gadgets point to
them from other places and and most of
my gadgets when I click that and a lot
of surprisingly it works for the people
to do it's not working for me now I'm
trying to click that do something change
to make you ok so goes to this site and
here's just showed up tell you what my
next plan for this is is you'll be able
to put in like like say today's my
birthday you know and it'll show up as a
history of Michael Thompson's birthday
in the fall his owners and kind of
decorate the page for yourself and send
it around people like birthday cards
anyway that's my next idea as you can
see like here's my little live weather
gadget there's a hundred of live weather
gadgets out there like mine better so
there it is and you know there's the
mountain go get it from the Navy site
and what the phase is there's solar
system today and it really looks like
that basis I suture on the east coast
and so people come here and they see
these other things you know like I think
maybe maybe this is where they're
finding that solar system guys and they
say hey that's me and I'm hopeful and
then of course settle when they come
here they can see anything see us about
all
I put my categories on that are correct
this kind of alcohol have you done
anything with inner thighs of
communication and what do you think it's
sort of you know you can share a cab
sharing a top of the whole suite pages
that are meant to go together almost
like a dashboard but I think it's a nice
great idea I actually did it before
there was a good way to do it and it's a
very unsuccessful ganzen actually here's
a couple of them like the survey gadget
shares information like if I click yes
everybody can see that somebody new clip
jealous you know across all gadgets all
instances of that gadget webmasters
started entering questions like isn't
this the coolest website so i gave them
their own where they just cleared on our
websites got one question there it is
another one I did I have this idea that
didn't really take off see if I can find
out bacon okay now what this is we can
play around with it but let me show you
how you'll probably recognize in just
one second why it was that successful
but beacons designed to let you post a
message on your google homepage that can
be seen only by a group of people you
select ok so so what I did is I did like
a public key private key thing you know
the private key you need that changing
public key you need that to see it and
so you see right now I just lost 99
percent of my potential audience but but
some people actually use it and the ones
who do use it they're really proud of it
you know so once somebody's figured it
out they're really handy with it and you
can
kind of cool thing yeah I thought it was
cool anyway well this is too hard to
configure but hey I think I've got a
little website about it where I have
examples of the content you can do heyo
like I thought okay everybody from do
will want to use this you know and
here's how you can say happy
thanksgiving to your family and hey book
i would have caught you know those kinds
of things so that was the idea and to me
this did that but mike says very very
bad user interface is very difficult to
configure not intuitive at all i can
give you along this or reasons why is it
good it does work and and so you know if
you guys make an easier way for bed
bedroom yeah so anybody to caffeine
infusion yes there with Jo Jo Memphis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
