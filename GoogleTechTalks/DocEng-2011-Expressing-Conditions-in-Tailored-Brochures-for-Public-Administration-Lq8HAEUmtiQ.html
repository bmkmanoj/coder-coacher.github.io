base I have not no i am not now nor have
I ever been associated with the English
National Health Service according to the
proceedings I actually am with the
University of Nottingham and formally
through the HP labs and vegetables this
last set of this penultimate session is
about adaptation of content and layout
and we have three long papers full
papers the first of which is basically
from Australians with a American
attachment i believe and keith van de
linda is going to be talking to the
title that's up there good afternoon my
name is Keith van der linden i'll be
talking about work that I've done with
my colleagues Natalie Cole anew and
Cecile Paris both at CSIRO and Sydney
Australia in collaboration with center
link which is Australia's delivery
organization for Health and Human
Services the project in general involves
the tailoring of content which
distinguishes our work perhaps from the
papers after us which deal more the
tailoring of layout and in particular
today I'll be talking about to the
representation and expression of
conditions which is quite important in
public administration I'll start with an
example to give you a sense of what
we're doing here I give you hear a
three-page excerpt from centre links
informational brochure for their a bee
study program I won't go through the
details simply to say that this is an
entitlement program for Indigenous
Australians going back to school what
we're more interested in is the second
two pages of this excerpt the
eligibility conditions these conditions
figure large in public administrative
texts here for example we see all the
requirements that are placed upon the
a/b study program so for example to be
eligible for this program you must be an
Aboriginal Australian or you must be
Aboriginal i found this definition
exceedingly interesting not all it's a
three-part definition in fact not only
do you have to be
an Australian and indigenous Australian
but you also have to identify yourself
as such and be identified by others as
such a fairly complicated definition you
can probably imagine political and
social rank over the decades to produce
this particular text it props up in
center links documentation over and over
again pretty much word for word because
it is a quasi-legal statement right in
addition to that you must also be an
Australian citizen as you might imagine
and you must be studying some approved
course or undertaking an approved
apprenticeship as you can see from this
example these are generic brochures
they're designed for just about anyone
any one of us could read this and decide
whether we're eligible for this program
and for most of us the answers probably
know we probably fail on all three
counts all right center links challenge
to CSIRO my colleagues and I was to help
them explore the possibility of
tailoring these brochures instead of a
generic audience we wanted to focus on a
particular individual all right with
that the talk will generally go along
four lines i'll talk about the tailoring
in particular in the context of a demo
I'll quickly demo the system that I have
run in on my local server then we'll
talk about the system that underlies and
focus on the conditions so I'll start
off with this a demo which I will dig up
right dupes that's another demo there's
the Ambo the beginning of a tailor and
demo always asks for questions from the
user we need to know something about our
reader before we can tailor for them
this particular list of questions is
automatically generated by our system
based upon the underlying model it looks
through all of the conditions relevant
to the programs it knows about and
collects those things and produces a
query wizard that you see here the
mechanism for doing that production it
is something that will talk about if I
as the read or choose not to specify
anything and ask the system to grab
eligible programs or programs for which
I might potentially be eligible it will
go off and it will give a list of all
the programs that we currently have in a
knowledge base which in this case is
three programs
the three student oriented programs from
center link the first is the a B study
program that we just talked about the
second is a you study this is for
non-traditional older students I had
actually a chance of getting a you study
had I been a resident long enough I had
no chance at youth allowance because I'm
not youthful enough I have to be under
25 to get that if I were to look then at
the a B study brochure that's
automatically produced and tailored for
this nobody that's produced no useful
information on the input I get pretty
much the same brochure that I showed you
earlier I formatted it here in terms of
a web page similar to the way center
link formats their web page right now
and if I asked for eligibility
information it will tell me exactly what
you saw before that I have to be an
indigenous Australian here's that
three-part definition again exactly
copied citizenship and the course and
apprenticeship so that's pretty much the
same if on the other hand I rerun the
scenario and I take on a persona which
is not me by the way but a 21 year old
let's see if I get my paper out of the
way here australian indigenous
australian aboriginal planning to take
an approved course if i give just that
bits of information that's enough as we
know to establish me as being eligible
for this program i can ask for the
programs for which i'm potentially
eligible again and this time i'm going
to get a shorter list I've lost my
chance for a you study because that's
for older students and I'm only 21 I
still get the a B study program in the
youth allowance our system actually
knows enough about the potential rates
of funding that you might get that it
could suggest one or the other
Centrelink was not interested in having
us make those value judgments so we just
give you the ones that you're
potentially eligible for I happen to
know that in my circumstance I would
prefer to go with a bee study there's
more money available for me there if I
look this time I see the same definition
of the a/b study program in the web form
just like we saw before but now the
eligibility is considerably simpler it
knows a lot about me
now it knows well it just comes right
out and says now that the tailored form
you've told us that you meet the
following criteria you are an indigenous
Australian you are an Australian citizen
and you are undertaking approve course
or an Australian apprenticeship so you
should be eligible for this program if
I'm if I'm in doubt as to what these
definitions mean we do continue to
include details link so you can still
get that famous three-part definition of
an indigenous Australian now what I'd
like to focus on in this talk is the
condition so you've seen several
expressions of the conditions in these
documents now and in our informal study
we discovered that roughly fifty percent
of these brochures is filled with
conditions definitions of terms
involving conditions and so forth like
this text here for example so we're
quite interested in coming up with some
mechanism for dealing with that you'll
see the first form here is an obligatory
form you must be an indigenous
Australian that's one form that we've
seen and then it goes on to give the
definition on the previous page you've
you've seen a short feedback statement
you are an indigenous Australian similar
but not the same all coming from the
underlying knowledge base and there was
a third expression of this that may be
less obvious than the first two that was
on the very first page the query wizard
itself which is automatically generated
are you an indigenous Australian again a
fairly related form but different and
used in context okay and so those are
the three basic forms that our system is
producing at the current moment for
conditions the obligatory the
declarative and the query and you can
see on this first page that the query
form actually comes in several guys is
depending upon the sort of condition
that we're talking about we're talking
about the indigenous Australian this
system actually in fact represents other
races as well but this is the only race
that really matters so getting back to
an earlier talk where you could be
female or other here you can be
indigenous Australian or other okay
because anything apart from the
indigenous Australian leads to no
special distinguishing marks all right
on the other hand if the various values
of the form do play a role so for
example what is
school status for example full-time
part-time not a student any one of those
can lead to different payment rates so
the system produces a multiple choice
question in that context and as a
simplification at the moment whenever we
ask for integer input we're just asking
for the actual value so those are three
qui reforms that will come up depending
upon depending upon the nature of the
question if I had specified all the
information here and I quantify the
final documents on average they're
roughly forty percent shorter than
Center links current originals so what I
will do now is get back to the talk
itself talk a little bit about the
underlying system that's implementing
all of this the system comprises two
basic components a document generator
and a context model I'll say a little
bit about the document generator and a
little bit more about the context model
the document generator is based upon a
top-down hierarchical planner that's
been common in AI for many many years
it's configured with disc with
declarative plan operators that are
specifically set up to build a discourse
tree that's rhetorically annotated okay
so that's a discourse planning
technology directly out of the natural
language generation community from once
we hail incidentally the generation
itself the construction of the actual
text on the page is coarse-grained that
is we're working with larger chunks of
text chunks of text on the order of
paragraphs or sections like the
indigenous Australian definition not
only is that an engineering problem
makes it a little easier and more
efficient to construct these texts but
also we have these blocks of text that
we don't want to mess with I have much
respect for the summarization folks in
the previous session but we didn't want
to try to paraphrase or summarize this
three-part definition of Australian
Indigenous so that's how we chose the
coarse-grained generation departing from
our roots and language generation the
mechanism that we're using therefore lie
somewhere on a continuum between the
full natural language generation on the
one hand and more commercial document
automation systems on the other the
discourse planning comes out of nlg
and the coarse-grained generation is
much more like document automation we're
probably much closer to the DA side of
that spectrum the the major difference
is that we retain that discourse tree
with the rhetorical annotations that's
helpful to us and put in generating the
feedback expression I showed you earlier
you've told us that dot dot dot I'd also
has been useful to us another work on
layout which we also are interested in
the context model itself is implemented
in LDL and it is what retains all of the
conditions and all of the blocks of text
we implement reasoning using hermit
which is fairly standard approach the
reasoning is used in two ways it helps
us decide who's eligible for what and it
also helps us decide who needs to hear
what so we decide what elements of the
text to include and how to format the
text based upon some of the reasoning as
well it's probably easier to explain
this thing in the context of another
short demo which I will run in which I
show you the beginnings of what might be
called an authoring tool I think that
probably does it too much of a service
it's right now a an implementation tool
that we hope to to improve and make it
actually author friendly the moments a
bit authors early but at least it will
show us the contents of the knowledge
base which is a standard all knowledge
base so there's not much here that would
surprise anyone familiar with semantic
web technologies we've got awards center
link has lots of those benefits claim
methods lots of conditions a program
there are those three programs that we
currently implement the individual for a
be study looks as follows and here's
where you're going to see those blocks
of text that the author is written so
the expectation is that the author will
write these things and do what they do
best then we will clump them together
sort of as a Lego generation if you will
you'll see that we have a space for the
author to specify the precise title
senator link inexplicably capitalizes a
be study or it upper cases a be studying
only capitalizes a you study I've never
understood that and I'm not sure they do
either short description is here again
handwritten not a automatic
summary and in the full description you
can see that these are set up for
templates their little escape sequences
in here that allow me to grab text from
other parts of the knowledge base and
they're all formatted in HTML for us to
perhaps a more interesting part is the
aggregation we can see a number of other
individuals that are related to this one
the one that we most care about is the
conditions we've talked about the
Aboriginality condition already there's
the individual that underlies that and
here you can see the owl syntax this is
Manchester all syntax for those of you
that are familiar you must have the race
value of indigenous Australian we also
have the citizenship condition that's
similar to they have originality we
actually specify that you have to be a
person the discourse plans are set up so
that we don't actually come out and say
that seems insulting to tell a person
that they must be human but center link
in fact does give benefit to other
things besides people to organizations
and schools and so forth so it is a
condition that underlies in the system
the discourse planner is the one that's
deciding to suppress that hidden
information also we have the approved
course and historian apprenticeship
that's Ord so you can see the standard
disjunction here now what we wanted to
set up was a system that allowed the
authors to author things but that we
would try to step in and do some
generation of things that were rather
more mundane now this for example is a
disjunction you have to be an apprentice
or studying approved course we allow the
authors to step in and write this out
and in fact the authors can produce a
better version than we can with our
fairly simple mechanism for doing
ontology verbalization we can do dis
junctions and conjunctions and they're
logically correct but as as it gets more
complicated and become harder and harder
to understand the assumption was that
the author would step in quickly say
everybody out of the pool i'm just going
to write this one rather than have it
automatically generated and here you can
see this is where they've done that
mostly for this I've just been cutting
and pasting the text directly out of the
current brochures all right the
Aboriginality condition on the other
hand is one where if we let the system
go it on its own there's no description
listed down below
and here we see the condition that we're
going to be verbalizing and in the
computational linguistics world this
problem is commonly called ontology
verbalization all right now I think
that's probably easier to show you with
my slide so it was my slides there so
I'll go back there and I'll say this a
little bit about the conditions here's
that Aboriginality condition again just
on the slide you'll remember that it
didn't have a name a shorter a long
description that's because the author is
leaving it to the system but it does
have the logical condition now we
construct the expression of these forms
using the following approach and these
are all implemented in the declarative
plant operators these can be changed but
this is what we have now the name of the
condition if it were to be a title of a
section picks up the name of the
relationship race the short description
starts with just a simple introductory
text you must be you are fairly simple
chunking the other of text you must be
an indigenous Australian the long
description takes the short description
you must be an indigenous Australian and
tax on the and indigenous Australian is
someone who dot dot dot all right so
it's a fairly simple mechanism so you
can see some issues here that we do have
to deal with first of all it's a limited
range of forms that we're producing but
our hope and our expectation is that in
a public administrative text these
things are relatively constrained so
that we don't need a broad range of
expression a second issue that we need
to deal with is the expressiveness we're
not doing full ontology verbalization so
we can handle attributions such as this
one so you have a race Aboriginal have
citizenship this and so forth we can
handle instantiations you must be a
person and we can handle this Junction a
conjunction as I said before in a fairly
limited way but we will have to be
careful when we build the authoring tool
that the the forms of conditions we
allow the author to specify will also be
ones that we can generate all right the
system also takes care of at this point
age ranges and the like between 21 and
25 under 16 and so
some other limitations on this thing
where it's going to be a challenge I
think in the when we start building the
interface to make it so that the author
understands the ramifications of what
they do you can see here for example
that this long description of the race
relationship really isn't a long
description at all the text plan
operators never present that as a
description of the relationship in fact
we never described the relationship at
all but the author needs to understand
the changes to that will have
ramifications throughout the document
they may be trying to fiddle with the
query form the query wizard but they'll
be changing things down in the
definition deep down inside the document
as well so we're hoping to give some
mechanism to the author to see the
ramifications of the changes that
they're making but that will be a
challenge and in addition there are some
repairs that need to be done so this
indefinite article for example sometimes
as a sometimes it's an so we have very
simple textual replacements that handle
those repairs and that also is limited
so we need to make sure that we have a
range of vocabulary that would be
appropriate for people authors using the
system and we need to make sure that
they will understand all of that okay
so I'm moving up here to the conclusions
we believe that we've demonstrated at
least the promise of some useful
capability for producing public
administrative texts we took the
original documents that center link gave
us which were roughly fifty percent
comprised of conditions and eligibility
discussions and we reduced the size of
those things by forty percent by
providing a query wizard that we
collected information from users and
then producing a simplified text of the
documents that we produced were not
simply going through the document and
cutting out bits of blocks of text
although we did definitely do that so if
for example we found out that the person
was an Aboriginal we didn't waste their
time or ours defining what an Aboriginal
was to this person but we also included
additional text that wasn't in the
original brochures so we provided
feedback text and other forms of
personalization we said things like you
have told us that dot dot dot this
discussion of tailoring is is relatively
rare in the public administrative domain
I was actually quite surprised by that
but it's a very common topic of
conversation Andy health so we took a
lot of our marching orders from this
work from a health so we produced the
sorts of feedback that they often do any
health we produced personalizations at
the very beginning of the document I
didn't show you but the system will say
we've tailored this just for you Joe
Blow on such-and-such a date the health
community discovers that all you really
need to do is put that sentence at the
beginning of the otherwise unchanged
documents and people will tend to it
more carefully not surprisingly they
call that placebo tailoring in that
domain we will try to take advantage of
the same thing but there is a large
question as to whether the tailoring
forms that are used in eHealth will also
be appropriate in other domains like
public administration the work in
progress I've alluded to a couple of
times we are attempting to do the
evaluation of the effectiveness of the
tailor
we have one qualitative evaluation under
our belt once we produce the system
which was sometime last spring
centerlink went on and engaged their own
testing group to run a qualitative
evaluation and they brought in 15
Australian youth allowance recipients
and ran them through a previous version
of the system which is very similar to
the one I've just showed you here and
they had lots of comments lots of
negative comments about the tailoring
and suggestions for changes which is all
very helpful but probably the two most
important things that we discovered that
was that there was unanimity on two
points one that they liked the idea of
tailoring they really do hate reading
through the two to three page
explanation of the eligibility
conditions when all the system really
needed to know was that you were 21 year
old Australian Aboriginal studying at
University why did they need to read
three pages they were very pleased with
that indeed they were happy to answer as
many wizard questions as we deem
necessary to produce that tailored text
we need to verify that more of the
better quantitative study but at least
we have some marching orders I think
from the youth allowance students in
that study but we will continue on with
that and secondly as I've alluded to a
couple of times we really are keen to
produce an author's interface that our
colleagues or their collaborators at
center link could actually use we work
mostly with authors and business
analysts they were not software
engineers or knowledge engineers of aime
uniform we also there did some simple
qualitative studies to see if they could
understand sort of the hierarchy of the
concepts and the nature of the text
blocks rather than sections and
paragraphs and pages and they seem to be
working reasonably well with that but of
course that remains to be seen as well I
think with that I will conclude I will
thank you for your attention and I guess
we open the floor for questions
oh well thank you
I have one then which is what are you
really doing is that you've been looking
at building the front end of the content
creation content selection and if you
have any thoughts about where
presentation part may or may not come
into it whether you need to do it
presentation
would be helpful for example putting
things together in one page separating
your pic yeah so you're talking about
layout tailoring and so forth yeah we're
very interested in that topic we're not
as advanced of this community in that
I've taken most of most of the
prototypes we've built our taken largely
from your own work so I don't have a lot
of interest to say that except to say
that we do agree that it's important and
that we have partially built our
mechanism so that we can continue that
sort of work in the future so I really
like this idea of formalizing legal
notation have you looked at have you had
much thought about how you could go
further with the legal system in general
perhaps encoding all law as a set of
logical constructs and then constructing
the law from that well that's an
exercise we leave to the reader right no
um and in fact i don't i don't like our
chances there i mean i don't want to say
that will never try but you've looked at
legal texts right we've all looked at
legal texts part of the reason that
we've succeeded with center link with
this is that the informational brochures
are not are at a higher level they are
not even an accurate representation of
the real center link rules the real
center link rules are in the center link
policy manual which may be none of even
the Australians have not seen promise
you it's more complicated than what I've
shown here what I've shown here is what
the authors felt was the most important
things I think we can succeed at that
level I don't know if I like our chances
even with the policy manual cuz things
get really ugly really fast so we will
take it as far as we can I promise you
that but I doubt whether we get all the
way through the US legal system Kowalski
about 1981
attempt to systemize systematically
represent the British Nationality Act in
Prolog and it could do certain things
and other things it just gave up it gave
up because well the legal system has
already got a certain amount of
ambiguity inside anyway there was a very
strong attempt to try that 30 years ago
okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
