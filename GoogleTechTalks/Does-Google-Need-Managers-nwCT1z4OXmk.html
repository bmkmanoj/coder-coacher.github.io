and I'm
designer and the user experience team
here at Google and it's my pleasure to
introduce Scott Hirsch and Ron Stovall
ski of management innovation group mig
is a strategy consultancy that
specializes helping their clients
demystify the changes that are rapidly
changing their industries and understand
how to compete in a less uncertain
future our less certain future excuse me
their clients include nokia British
Telecom the New York Times Reed Elsevier
rodel and many other companies who wish
to remain anonymous because they don't
want you to know they are afraid of
Google please help me welcome Scott and
John thank you a little bit of
housekeeping first and then we're going
to jump into our presentation but we
wanted everybody to take one of these
post-it notes I'm going to say this all
into the microphone and then I'm going
to walk over to you take post-it notes
and while I'm talking this is a debate
by the way so pretend like you're back
in high school debating team and you
know so one of us is going to argue one
side of the question does Google need
managers and the other the other one is
going to argue the other side and
because it's high school debate and it's
the forensics team and everybody's
really nerdy we've made sure to make our
talk really corny and to have some jokes
in it but there's substance behind the
jokes and I just want to let you know
it's okay to laugh I don't want to have
any awkward silences where you guys are
looking at each other being like are
they really serious yeah we are serious
but we're all we also have a good sense
of humor and so we wanted to bring that
to Google because we know a lot of you
guys and we think you guys are really
funny and great but the thing that I
wanted you to do before we get started
and we jump in the character since we'll
be in characters is I want everybody to
take a post it note and write while I'm
talking since I'm arguing that Google
does not need managers I'm taking the
default position write down how you
think that's true just one thing in one
sentence any any anything it can be
anything while John is making his
arguments and he's taking the opposing
position which is google does need
managers and help me talk
after me you're going to do the same
thing supporting his arguments and we're
going to actually use some of the
commentary that you guys give us in the
process of doing our rebuttals so um let
me just jump around really fast and
handsome self
now I have to get into character so if
John if you'll stand up next to me for
one moment so that we can say our one
line that we have to stay together to
establish the character that we're in
hit it don't you start
I think you start okay i'm a mac and i'm
a pc okay
so that should establish the point of
view that I'm going to be taking I'm
going to be stating things that are
really obvious but maybe a little
painful in character now I'm coming into
character okay okay so sorry I have to
adjust my notes okay so i'm a pc and i'm
going to be arguing why google does not
eat managers that google is fine just
the way it is and we all are familiar
since we're all fans of popular culture
familiar with this image from perhaps
one of the best movies ever made about
office culture and the argument that i
think that they would be telling you
right now in this image is you can sum
up the reason why google does not need
managers with three simple letters does
anybody know what they are the first
ones t ah got the answer right now you
win a prize sir the prize is free lunch
of the Google cafeteria three simple
letters TPS reports the bane of everyone
in office spaces existence so why are
TPS reports so bad I'm going to have
very few words in this presentation this
is one of the few wordy slides so
forgive me the really simple argument is
that process gets in the way of
innovation and how can you be innovating
if you're constantly having to fill out
reports and go through all this
unnecessary process and procedure in
order to do what you really wanted to do
to begin with which is designed really
interesting cool products and work with
other really cool creative people second
hiring and hiring smart people and pure
accountability work better than bosses
so this is really obvious in a culture
like this right isn't everybody really
happy that peer accountability and smart
co-workers make working here really fun
and interesting third darwin i'm going
to be hanging on all these points in my
talk I'm establishing the conceptual
frame for you guys Darwin figured out
how to prior
is more than a hundred years ago we've
got things like Darwinian natural
selection so you know the wisdom of the
crowds is much better at figuring out
what things we should develop than any
strategy consultant for McKinsey or any
MBA analytic framework from business
school might be able to help you figure
out how to do so if you've got smart
people and you've got peer review should
be able to figure out what the right
products to do our fourth project-based
self-organization eliminates
organizational friction and I'm going to
got some really good examples on maybe
using from this later on and the final
reason why process and procedure and TPS
reports are unnecessary is because there
are better incentives to get to a launch
than actually having a Gantt chart of
how to get to the launch in front of you
so first I want to talk a little bit
about process impeding innovation has
anybody seen a chart like this at any
time in their careers I'm getting a lot
of nods i found this chart really kind
of interesting because i downloaded it
off of a website about software
development and um actually it seems
like they've squeezed an awful lot of
stuff into week 1 and week 2 you
probably can't read the words but i was
just really shocked it's just seemed
really aspirational to me and wouldn't
you much rather than going through a
requirements gathering process at the
beginning of a project like this sit
down and actually start innovating and
iterating and i think that's really what
um google has learned that other
companies have not learned and that
other companies are really jealous of
google for which is how do you create an
environment of empowerment where people
don't have to be beholden to the process
chart they don't have to be beholdin to
the grant to the Gantt chart and let's
talk about managers for a second a
manager's job even at the lowest level
is to figure out how to create charts
like this and how to make sure that they
stand behind you while you're doing your
work and figure out how to make you hit
that next piece of the Gantt chart on
time and that takes a lot of time and so
if we free up that time from those
managers from having to do that then it
gives a lot of time for other more
interesting and innovative things and I
think finally the point I wanted to make
about this chart is that these charts
are these charts are lies basically um
you think that the purpose of this chart
is to actually figure out how to
allocate resources to projects to get
things delivered on time but in reality
there's fudge built into every single
time somebody does a chart like this
there's fudge built into it and so why
do all that fudging why not just like
hit the ground running and innovate and
iterate as I said earlier and take all
the wasted time out of the system and if
you take the wasted time out of the
system then workers get more time for
being delicious this is my first
cultural reference i'm actually very
proud of this one i tried to work a lot
of pop cultural references into my talk
because I hear that's what all you hip
cool kids are doing nowadays
another free lunch for anyone at the
Google cafeteria today if they know
where this reference is from no one
knows it's it's really obscure so I'm
really proud of it it's a it's a
spin-off fake television show from a
fake reality TV show that you know it's
fake because it's animated and it's
impossible to have an animated reality
TV show called drawn together which used
to come on Comedy Central and jut that's
judge fudge he's really into being
delicious so okay my next big point and
I I think everybody in this room knows
this one and has had it drilled into
their head a million times and it's in
every single article that you read about
google and that is part of what makes
the magic of google work and why me why
the hierarchy can be flattered is
because you hire smart people and so
I've actually formulated this equation
that I'm actually going to be its
patent-pending but i'll let you know
what some of the variables are because
that you know i have to let you know how
it works a little bit but um I call it
the her shrank equation and mu is your
high school GPA and Sigma is the number
of tech related news feeds that you read
each day and if you plug everything into
this equation about any individual you
automatically know how successful
they're going to be at Google and if you
you can later use modifications of this
equation to actually figure out how to
how to assign them a score of between 0
and 1 on their performance review so it
can go into the promotion committee and
people can get permitted I thought that
was going to get more chuckles you guys
know I'm being snarky right I'm the pc
I'm supposed to be saying things that
are really obvious in a really dumb way
okay and indoctrinating them early
everybody knows the culture at Google is
really really thick you can cut it with
a knife that indoctrination serves a
purpose and that purpose is is
everybody's in alignment around the same
goals values beliefs everybody has the
same performance incentives everybody
has the same high level strategic
direction
that gives you the freedom not to have
to be given specific direction by a
direct manager I see the mac is taking
notes I'm getting really worried I'm
worried about the rebuttal because he
was actually the captain of his high
school debating team there's tons of
things in the indoctrination process
that you know much better than I do but
I like to think of it a little bit like
the hypnotoad from futurama and the
hypnotoad for those of you don't know
has the longest running television
series in the year 3000 it's been on for
five hundred twenty-seven years another
role of manage of management is actually
to eliminate friction and I think this
is probably the one that Google has the
most need for managers to be able to do
because if you're going to create a
culture of empowerment you need to be
able to butter up the sticky parts of
the organization and allow people to
actually work on to remove the
roadblocks that are getting them in the
way of delivering and working on the
things that I want to work on and that
they need to work on okay so let's talk
a little bit about prioritization I know
mites are winning Darwinian analogy is
not exactly right because Darwinian
evolution has a lot to do with random
occurrences and natural selection
filters out the random occurrences to
best suit individual species to their
environment but there's parts of the
Darwinian analogy that I really like in
application to product development
processes at companies like Google and
the clients that we work with are
incredibly jealous of this incredibly
jealous because they feel like for them
to make a course correction at any point
once they've defined a strategic vision
for a series of products they're lagging
by a year sometimes at best six months
and if you're in an environment where
projects are allowed to emerge and get
traction and get energy around them and
then later maybe be killed off or maybe
like subside a little bit go off to the
back burner for a little while or
they're allowed to blossom and they hit
launch that's just a much faster more
iterative way to be able to do product
development and
especially in the telecom industry
everybody that we have worked with has
been incredibly jealous of this and they
have no idea why they can't do it and I
think the reason they can't do it is
because of the reasons that I've already
mentioned in this talk which is the
culture the culture is absolutely
important piece of how to make processes
like these work okay so I wanted this
I'm moving back into snarky mode so you
guys can laugh again this is talk about
evolution and so so when you have really
smart people working on really
interesting projects I mean of course
sometimes projects are just the ones
that are going to hit launcher going to
be the ones that are absolutely the best
right you know the ones that are really
going to make a splash in the
environment in the world and consumers
are going to love them and they're just
gonna be absolutely embraced by the
media you know things like oh ok I put
the wrong slide I'm sorry I meant to put
that one you know that same level of
energy and embracing of new and
interesting ideas and embracing new ways
and modes of working into your culture
also apply to mergers and acquisitions I
think Google that's another reason that
Google has been actually really good in
not needing managers because it's been
very strategic and the types of
companies that it's acquired and
actually been willing to kill products
and projects or have them subside let's
say if they haven't met the expectations
by the way I watched this talk yesterday
if nobody's seen it I found it really
really interesting it's eric schmidt
talking at gary Hamels management
innovation lab and he talks he doesn't
mention technology hardly at all anytime
in the talk all he's talking about his
culture people and processes and he
actually hints at some of the things
that he thinks might be major roadblocks
for Google coming up in the near future
I thought super interesting so if you
haven't seen it i highly recommend it
okay so in the next slide I'm going to
talk about self the self organization I
have five minutes thank you let's talk
about self organization because self
organization is really key to operating
an organization that doesn't need
managers because managers are there to
impose organization and if you don't
want to have managers who needs to be a
method for self organization and all of
the things that I've mentioned so far
have been important factors in self
organization and this next slide I think
is the strongest empirical case for the
relevancy of managers and I think it's
self-explanatory
okay so self organization is behind us
for those who don't know that was on the
board from Star Trek which are the
collective and they all have the same
brain and they all do the same things
just being a little snarky sorry um okay
so next I want to talk about incentives
to launch because none of this would be
of any use at all it would all be very
academic unless we actually had
incentives to launch and I think you
know the concept of smart people working
on they won't on anything that they want
has been highly romanticized outside of
Google and you know it the slack that it
gives in the product development process
that our clients are really jealous of
that I talked about earlier in my talk I
think would not be possible if there
weren't the right incentives in place
and you know Google is definitely a
company that rewards its employees very
generously especially if they're able to
launch and deliver on products oh wait
okay that's not that's actually not I
must have been using Ask Jeeves that's
not the that's not the certificate I
meant to put up there I meant to put
this one up there which actually doesn't
exist because I don't think google issue
stock certificates but I made this one
by pasting the google logo over the
apple logo so so if it's a shared core
belief again part of the culture that
launched is one of the most important
things that the company can do to better
service customers I've got three minutes
thank you then nothing is academic
anymore right because everybody is
moving towards a share golden on a
shared objective I wanted to pull out I
wanted to put on my MBA hat for a second
and pull out some classic definitions of
management that I think this talk has
already I've already done a pretty good
job of challenging because I think what
my opponent is going to try to do is
he's going to try to tell you why Google
does knees managers and I think he's
going to try to use classical arguments
I actually haven't seen his presentation
so I don't know and so you know one that
the derivation of the word management
needs to lead by the hand but the the
things that you learn when you read
business books and in business school is
like managers are there to allocate
scarce resources to divisional eyes
complexity set strategic vision make
course corrections direct coach mentor
staff etc and I think you know of course
there's no needs to divisional
or manage complexity when you're the
Borg and you know allocation of scarce
resources the scarce resource in google
is not let it as in most companies and
most companies its people meaning talent
and money and that's not the case here
so there's a whole different system for
allocating scarce resources that just
doesn't apply in most working
environments and I think makes it
possible for Google not to need managers
so what is the role of the manager I
think I'm going to try to preempt an
argument that I think my cut my worthy
adversary might try to make which is to
say that of course Google needs managers
all companies need managers and i would
i would like to preempt by agreeing with
that but i think the role of the manager
and a culture like this is more of a
facilitator or a lubricant or a coach or
even a therapist and i wanted to go back
to that derivation really quickly
because to lead by the hand I think
implies a very paternal paternalistic
relationship between manager and
employee and that relationship doesn't
need to exist when you're in a culture
such as this one where you have a group
of equals where everybody's intelligence
is equally valid and everybody can
debate their point based on their
beliefs the facts and its merits so um
and also like it you can't really be per
turn elastic at Google because there's
no I mean just look around there's no
parents here so I'd like to think of
leading by the hand as more of this
image which is you know the parents
spinning the kid around and and not
necessarily to make the kid dizzy and
throw up but to make the kid feel really
joyful and excited to be alive and to be
doing that the things that they're doing
so in conclusion Google does why Google
does not need managers I can actually
sum this up in one very simple image why
mess with perfection
thank you
ok so I'm going to offer the
counter-argument while John is giving
his counter argument i'm going to
collect any comments that you guys wrote
down supporting my thesis and so I'm
gonna pass this out
write down your thoughts on my Google
dozen hangers
alright I'll back it out there that's
actually how to survive an encounter
with a nuclear explosion okay so I'm
gonna argue the counterpoint why Google
does need managers and I'm going to
specifically try to convince you of why
some of the prevailing wisdom in some of
the arguments that my colleague just
laid out are actually short-sighted or
unsophisticated so my colleague argued
that you know in this new world we have
emergent coordination that we have
Darwinian selection that we don't need
managers to control that it's like how
hands clapping in an audience naturally
kind of come into sync with each other
that there's feedback mechanisms that
help everybody get aligned and that's
the way that Google works because we
hire smart people we have common vision
we have common priorities we have common
values and we just you know tend to
align emergently or he's or you know
maybe the model is something like
looking at you know the flock of crows
and how those tend to get signals from
each other disperse come back together
pick up on signals move in acting out an
individual self-interest actually come
to good collective decisions so those
things I would say are true I believe in
those too but Google's actually the
people who work at Google are not crows
right in fact they're people and people
don't behave because of the intelligence
that we have in the same way that less
intelligent animals act people don't
behave in terms of simple tasks like
hands clapping in an audience because we
have systems that try to override
emergent group behavior and make our own
decisions because we've all come up
being smart people understanding that
people value our opinion people value
our decision and we have confidence in
our own decisions and so I'm going to
trust the thing that's made me
successful throughout my life which is
being really intelligent to come to my
own decisions rather than just kind of
be held mercy to the to the decision of
the flock and react to that
very rapidly so people I'd say are
actually a different animal so then
what's the model for managing a group of
people well it's been pretty well
documented what the model for Google was
Larry and Sergey have both said we were
at Stanford studying software
engineering and we designed a company
that we thought would work really well
based on what we knew which was academia
so that's our model in the academic
model I think you could argue really
well works for lots of situations but
has some drawbacks as well but if the
model is going to be academia basically
means higher really really smart people
and let them do what they want that's
what the tenure system is about right
okay so publish or perish we're going to
follow the academic model that means
launch or you're out so get to it
noogler but I think there's a problem
with this and that's the offense to take
into consideration that resources
actually are becoming more scarce oh my
colleague argued that Google doesn't
need managers because unlike most
companies we don't have scarce resources
of talented people well in fact that
might have been true when you had a
hundred people a thousand people maybe
2,000 people but with 20,000 people
think you have to ask how many of the
best and brightest really are out there
in the world and if you look to that
academic model which was kind of driving
the founding of the company you look at
faculties at you know some of the best
universities in the world like Stanford
or MIT or Chicago or Berkeley Stanford
and Harvard have maybe 2000 faculty
members mit has maybe a thousand faculty
member Chicago has maybe 2,000 faculty
members getting that up to 20,000 people
would be incredibly difficult to find
people who really continue to live up to
those standards of academic excellence
of intelligence of high performance that
you really come to demand so how do you
maintain those standards and continue to
get high performance as a company if
you're just relying on trying to go out
and get the best people in the world if
you get to a company of 30,000 40,000 or
50
is that really going to be realistic I
would argue not so what do you do well
you could make your own people or come
up with ideas and have sock puppets some
companies sustain themselves pretty well
under that model for a little while but
eventually crashed we don't want that to
happen to Google of course so to me the
question though is Eric Schmidt says you
know every company says that people are
the most important asset but at Google
people really are the most important
asset okay fine let's accept that on
face value question is if that's your
asset how do you get that asset to
perform for you when the markets up and
when the markets down if you now have
scarce resource of people that are
assets you know really good financial
managers tend to get good returns
regardless of the market environment
whether I'm investing in asset classes
that may not be optimal asset classes or
I'm investing in really good stocks it's
about my ability to select to find value
etc so I think if if Google's employees
are its greatest asset then managers
have a role to play there in terms of
managing that asset in the way that any
asset manager has a role to play in
figuring out what are the right kinds of
assets to get the most kind of value
right now and that doesn't mean that you
necessarily have to hire the best and
brightest only it means that you add
value as a manager through your wisdom
through your process through your
methods for putting asset classes
together mitigating risk etc I think the
big problem is that when people say
management and Google needs managers
we're all kind of locked into a
traditional view of what management is
that comes from in a very significant
part a guy named Frederick Taylor who
invented scientific management those had
a lot of Appeal because it took it from
a very kind of crafty thing to almost a
more algorithm based way of doing
management I think there's some parts of
that that folks in Google would would
value in fact which was to to
systematize and try to optimize
performance from individual people but I
think today Taylor's model falls down in
an important way which is that its task
for you
it's about trying to optimize the tasks
that employees do and as a manager being
sort of the font of knowledge about how
you do that and I think that's wrong
what that actually leads to is control
systems and what i would call pseudo a
pseudoscience it's just about
aggregating control for the enlightened
management class right making everybody
else of servient to that i don't think
that's really the right way to think
about it though I think the right way to
think about how managers that value is
to think about how can I find people and
put teams together as my asset that are
going to really be undiscovered by the
rest of the market I can look for
arbitrage opportunities I can look for
different theories I can develop smarter
ways being actually be inventive and
creative about management rather than
sort of rely on the old models that will
help us get superior performance it's
not about me just bossing people around
so if you look at great asset managers
somebody like Warren Buffett absolutely
believes in that investing for the
long-term finding undervalued securities
to invest in in one of the ways you
discover what's a good investment to
make is all based on people's motivation
so he says that he what he tries to
understand is is the company that I'm
investing in run by people who get out
of the bed in the morning because they
love the business so there's passion
there it's not necessarily about raw
talent to raw intelligence and Warren
Buffett's been incredibly successful by
taking often contrarian views about
where does the source of value in his
assets come from I think Google has an
opportunity to be inventive about
managers in developing new ideas about
how to maximize the value of people as
an asset those things aren't out there
those are opportunities to be exploited
just like Warren Buffett did by coming
up of his own theories on on what to buy
an investment I think there's lots of
other good models for this to a lot of
you probably know Moneyball this is
Billy Beane who's the general manager of
the Oakland A's and he basically has
seen
himself as an arbitrage or as well so he
says like Google perhaps that in a
market where people are competing for
scarce assets for the Oakland A's its
players we can't get enough really good
players because there just aren't that
many out there in the world just like
there aren't that many great software
engineers out there in the world there's
always going to be an efficiency in that
so what he's trying to do is find a way
to see into dark corners to turn over
stones that haven't been turned over
before and to figure out who are the
great players that people are missing
because they don't fit the standard
criteria maybe they didn't have the best
pedigree but there's some real value
that we can get and I think this is a
real under-exploited way to look at
managers for Google where there's an
opportunity again to be very inventive
about it because of course the Yankees
don't always win the Yankee approach
which I would say has been the Google
approach so far is just be willing to
pay for the best talent go out and
acquire the best talent but that best
talent just like just like certain asset
classes don't always perform equally so
for me the question is if you're going
to be a manager at Google can you win
with different teams in different people
over many years anybody recognize those
folks yeah that's a nod to my hometown
the Motor City Detroit Red Wings coach
Scotty Bowman and new coach Mike Babcock
they just won the Stanley Cup last week
Scotty Bowman 19 Stanley Cups between
1974 I think with the Montreal Canadiens
in 2002 with the red wings and did it
with probably at least six teams that
were incredibly different from one
another and so what is it that how that
a coach can do to add value and
consistently produce winners without
necessarily having the best people on
his team's that's the opportunity for
google to use managers now of course you
can't just hire anybody
right you probably should have an IQ
that's at least maybe one standard
deviation from the mean but my point
here is that management can be very
creative okay maybe not in the mold of
Enron but I think the thing to pay
attention to is the fact that just like
it's very googley to run lots of
experiments with different kinds of
products out there in the marketplace I
think Google right now is missing a big
opportunity by not having lots of
managers run small experiments around
creating the future of management so you
have pretty standardized in a Taylor way
ways of selecting who your hires are
that's very very centralized you have
very very standardized ways of
evaluating people's compensation if
you're a designer maybe that is a harder
in some contexts for you to kind of
proved how you've added value or
impacted Google than if you're an
engineer because you're less in control
of the levers that actually get products
to launch so by standardizing that
you're taking away lots of ripe
opportunity to be very internet e to let
people invent on their own new ways of
making decisions new ways of creating
hiring practices new ways of allocating
resources new ways of getting
performance out of people and what
happens when it's you know very highly
centralized or sort of pushed from a
single place is to get positive feedback
loops now positive feedback loops aren't
positive they're actually negative
they're things that cause traffic jams
they're things that cause microphone
interference where small actions tend to
accrete and be amplified throughout the
system and so what that means is when
you make certain hires we tend to hire
people who are like us right and so if
those little inefficiencies come in in
terms of how we get hired and that
ripples throughout this very very common
hiring practice and we're not allowed to
experiment with divergent ways of
selecting people then that's just going
to turn into a positive feedback loop
it's going to create echo chambers and
the real danger is that you start
breeding a monoculture monocultures are
problems especially when you have a
culture as thick is Google's because
while in certain environments
those cultures are very very well
adapted to the environment when that
environment shifts in it's a single
swarm of locusts that comes and takes
out the whole field you have no
resiliency there so you need to do some
more experimentation well that also
means i think is that you start to get
fairly arbitrary ways of distinguishing
people that can it worse turn into a
popularity contest that's not
necessarily based on real contribution
but that's based on fitting in to the
culture seeming googly and I think again
managers have an opportunity to not
standardized that stuff not introduce
common practices but introduce divergent
practices introduce more diversity in
terms of the way that people are
evaluated compensated motivated etc so
if you're a manager at Google and you're
trying to think about again people are
our greatest asset here how do you get
performance out of that asset well I
think the secret is people work for
people we all know this this is a
platitude in business that people work
for people Orchestra conductors are a
common metaphor this happens to be
Benjamin Zander who's the conductor of
the Boston Philharmonic he gets to
select from some of the best musicians
in the world and he says why do my
musicians play better for me then they
play on their own or that they might
play for another symphony I'll tell you
why it's because I get them to be TFI
anyone not be TFI is it's beyond the
 it's getting people to feel
motivated to really kind of push past
their fear push past the insecurities
push past the politics and really get
more out of themselves and you think you
could sorry if swearing on youtube is
not allowed by the way so what are some
other examples of ways that you could
introduce some management innovations
here think creatively about it I think
there's lots of models out there in the
world we've seen them in our in our
client companies we've tried to help
them invent them Whole Foods a client of
ours as a company that's definitely
experimented with having a premium on
manager in managerial competence
but not standardizing at also googled
what whole foods does some things in the
market that in the industry that are
very very different most people believe
in the grocery business the way you make
money is by standardizing as much as you
can and rigidly controlling your supply
chain so that you get leverage over your
over the people that you buy from as
your distribution channel so that means
your stores tend to be the same the
things that you carry tend to be the
same at Whole Foods actually the stores
themselves decide how they want to be
designed what the user experience is
going to be in their individual store
how people are going to be which people
are going to be on teams so when you get
hired you get hired provisionally for 90
days in order to stay on you have to get
a unanimous vote of everybody on your
team even if you just want to be say
working in the produce aisle as a
produce stalker you have to kind of win
the confidence of everybody and the
produce team and anybody can veto you
can veto that but as a result they get
an opportunity to introduce lots and
lots of experiments about how they're
going to build these models so if they
go into oakland in a more industrial
neighborhood they might decide we're
going to use this as a chance to
experiment with the loft like Whole
Foods experience experience and then in
Houston when they buy out an old spa and
decide to build their store there it's
an opportunity for them to experiment
experiment with the spa-like experience
of whole foods and these are things that
then the manager's job is to take that
from individualized localized
capabilities and turn them into
institutional capabilities or
institutional learning and again I think
that's a way that you can be really
really inventive so in conclusion I'd
say that Google needs management but
management innovators not standard
managers you need managers who are going
to commit to solving big problems we're
going to hone the spirit of Google to
say we're not going to work on things
that don't move the needle that don't
impact a lot of people we're going to
work on inventing management practices
that solve some really crappy trade-offs
that you typically have to make in
business and because management is both
an art and a science the way that art
and science progresses is by doing
experiments you have to work hard on
those experiments and you have to work
just like in the university sometimes
for years on a single problem to be able
to solve it
so you need to open up room for managers
to be able to work on those big problems
for a long time with that there's room
for I think both theoretical approaches
and experimental approaches to creating
new management practices and in the end
it comes down to challenging
conventional wisdom arbitrage a new
value thinking like a Warren Buffett and
saying as a manager at Google I'm going
to look for ways that I can find people
or I can find more to get people out of
I can find more ways to get value of the
people i already have that other people
don't see that other people aren't able
to jump on and as a result i'm going to
outperform other companies that's my
argument Scott's going to have five
minutes to three minutes to rebut me and
then I'm going to have a rebuttal from
there actually we want to leave enough
time for some conversation with the
audience so I'm just gonna really
quickly do a rebuttal based on some
information that I got from the audience
but first I have to jump back into
character so I can say my favorite
Simpson Simpsons line ever which is you
made me get off my stool for this the
comic book guy so so my opponent
actually tried to argue that there's a
financial reasons why Google needs
managers as a company grows and scales
that it actually needs layers of
management in order to be able to
continue to scale effectively and
actually be able to manage its its
people as an asset well I fundamentally
agree with his premise and I think it
actually aligns with one of my points
which is really about a new role for
managers a more googly interpretation of
the role of managers as opposed to a
traditional classical role of managers I
completely agree with the person in the
audience read it very clearly on this
one post-it note why why we don't need
managers 170 billion dollar market cap
without them pretty much sums it up as
far as I'm concerned
let's see another point I just wanted to
call out really quickly was that
managers are simply filling the role of
risk mitigation we can afford risk and
we need risk and I think that also
aligns really closely to the to the
points that I was making in my talk and
if I can step out of my fake debate I
think it really closely aligns to the
points that my opponent was making as
well which is it's not the traditional
role of management that we're really
looking at here as being the opportunity
for google yes risk management what's
though it's what's the real word for
risk management it's it's cya you know
cover your ass and and that means you
know limiting the flow of information
between the people below you and the
people above you google has done
something entirely different which is
about transparency of information from
the top to the bottom as far as I know I
mean I've never worked in the culture
but that's everybody I've talked to has
described that and that really is unique
and those of you who've worked in other
companies I'm sure can agree with that
or might agree with that are you ready
to do your bottle John because I want to
make sure that we have time to like to
engage in a conversation so John's going
to do is rebuttal map so so two quick
points about that one you say risk
mitigation is really about cya I say
that's not true risk mitigation is about
being resilient it's about the same kind
of thing as why we don't want to have a
single company rule the whole internet
because we don't want that much
vulnerability in the system we want lots
of individual bloggers lots of
individual people creating new methods
in creating new ways of working in that
collectively that makes the system much
less risk prone likewise managers
creating experiments about different
ways to manage people mitigates the risk
of a monoculture of a big environmental
change where the current culture which
is so strong is mal adapted for brings
down the entire company in the entire
set of really really really smart people
the second thing is a reading from one
of these questions not sure who wrote it
you say that Google will benefit from a
ventev managers what about the
uninventive standard inflexible managers
that we have today I don't know anything
about that but before John finishes you
act like we don't have managers at
google today you assert that our bonus
system works that we have autonomy to
work on projects of our choosing that
people and money aren't scarce you are
so wrong I just wanted in our defense I
mean we had to create an artifact
artificial construct within which to
have debate I'm not debating or denying
that that might be the case but I am I
go on so I guess the thing I would say
about that is I wouldn't necessarily
call those people artful or highly
talented managers and I wouldn't say for
sure that their management innovators if
it's all about quote uninventive
standard and inflexible managers so what
I would say is that it's a big blind
spot for google precisely because Google
hasn't embraced the idea that managers
can create value that we need managers
that managers have something unique to
contribute thanks we're going to take
some questions from from you guys now if
you want to declare one of us the winner
especially me I'm happy to hear that no
no otherwise we'll take your questions
if you have any I think we have a mic
now so I can anybody has a question yes
Thanks so what's what's your definition
of a manager is that someone that's
formally given the manager title and
generally yes although I don't think
that only people who formerly been given
the title can be skillful at management
I think a manager is somebody who plays
a certain function in the company which
is about inventing new ways to allocate
resources to get value out of the assets
that you have in the company to figure
out strategy to align people and to get
people to perform really really well so
what if I was to submit to you that
Google has empowered individuals to take
that role of innovation and making
decisions I would say that's good and
you should do more of it and you should
really make room for those people to
challenge conventional wisdom bring in
some people may be that they want to
hire that say top management wouldn't
approve of so would that be a counter to
having more managers may be less
managers and more of these kinds of
people well I'm not saying I'll let you
address the sorry Scott I'm not saying
that Google needs more managers I'm just
saying Google needs definitely needs
talented people in the role of manager I
wasn't kidding when John and I didn't
compare notes before this hunk we
actually did it in the car on the way
here but I think that's the common
ground and in both even though like you
know I I was put in the straw me in
position right you know so I was put in
the position to argue that Google
doesn't need managers based on an
assumption that it doesn't currently
have managers you know so like I was
sort of in the straw man role John had
the opportunity to be a little bit more
provocative in redefining the way that
Google could have managers in a more
googly way but i think the common ground
in our mac because he's a Mac exactly
and i'm a pc but i think the common
ground in both of our talks and where I
and just because John and I have worked
together forever we're in really close
alignment around this and that is that
you know this like artificial like arc
type that we create in our head of what
a manager is does not have to
exists I mean there's plenty of
opportunity for innovating in that space
as well as in technology and as well as
in online products thanks so how would
you say or how would you describe an
innovative manager working within a
thick culture and against certain kinds
of indoctrination Wow I mean that's a
super good question and it's really hard
to answer without you know having been
exposed to the culture more than John or
I have but you know I mean I'll just
tell you like you know just from things
that I hear from my note from people
that I know who work here and that is
that you know and people wrote that in
my cards actually you know like
processes a bad word you know like you
can't use the word people are allergic
to process and I think sometimes the
idea of process mirrors on to the idea
of management whereas in the work that
John and I do with our clients we view
our role as facilitative leaders we view
ourselves as facilitators first and
foremost we don't impose we're one of
those strategy consulting firm that does
not impose an existing framework or an
existing process it's very co-created
between us and our clients and our
clients of told us they really
appreciate that about us and I think if
I were in the role of creating a
managerial discipline at Google I would
start first with that and I've actually
heard managers at google talk about that
in mags Hanley Smith is that her name
spoke at MX about this adaptive paths MX
conference just about a month ago that I
also spoke at so I got to hear her talk
I guess I would just add to that that I
think it's about making a commitment to
make room for managers on the front
lines to really be empowered to kind of
pull levers in different ways the levers
meaning how you hire people how you
configure people it's kind of looking at
what your what your portfolio management
approach is going to be to go back to
that kind of asset management and
metaphor I think you have to figure out
are we going to be value investors are
going to be growth investors are we
going to be you know people who try to
time the market are we going to be
putting in for the long term
term and I think it's hard to answer
that in absence of doing some real
experiments and so you need people you
need to empower people on the front
lines to you know make those calls on
their own to test stuff out to have some
kind of locally suboptimal
configurations but that adds more value
for the whole
do you think it's likely that it's
possible to do successful experiments
with management techniques and a company
that up until recently has been doubling
in size every 12 to 18 months guys are
really fast um I just think you can yes
you just have to be cognizant of it the
same way that you're cognizant of the
experiments that you run in products and
technology infrastructure so I mean
that's my view on I would say it's
probably easiest to do that in a company
that's really really seriously
threatened I would say its second
easiest to do that in a company that has
ninety ninety seven percent of its
revenue come from a fairly limited set
of products and technologies that give
it enormous growth rates because the
industry is growing really well and
gives you a cushion against failing a
lot yes I would say yeah absolutely at
Google I think there's room to do that
and and I want to add something else
like I I i think i speak for john i'm
not advocating at all if i choose to
choose to john's position which is that
Google should experiment with management
which I do agree with even though i'm a
pc i do not advocate at all that this
would be the way that it would be
visualized to employees is an a reorg
you know i'm not talking about hierarchy
or structure or anything like that it's
really about running experiments and how
teams work together and how to
facilitate and lubricate and lead those
self managing teams that can become even
more empowered
any other question I think we might be
just about out of time yeah can we do a
quick poll just if you don't mind being
public about this just kind of show of
hands who buys the argument that
Google's fine as it is and doesn't need
managers one two three okay and who buys
the contrary argument that Google does
need managers oh my god I lost trying
just like in the commercials thanks a
lot of fun talking with you guys and
we'll be around for a little bit if
anyone has additional questions but
thanks a lot for the opportunities fun
thank you
