is a second part in their two-part
presentation by Professor DJ moved from
Georgia Tech its presentation is on e
sourcing impact of non-price attribute
strategic thinning and learning so
without further ado you do thank you
okay uh yeah this would be more fun
because last I was really at the top was
really finance it's hard you know it's
math but this is the way especially I
see my friend in a way or we got our
data sources it's here and yeah but I'm
also a little bit upset you know we have
this real expert a year so the talk is
e-sourcing and we're trying to start the
impact of non-price attributes okay like
quality delivery okay relationships and
the strategic feeding behavior of the
suppliers and also the learning behavior
of the suppliers this is really the work
of Vivian drom she's my PhD student this
is really her dissertation she has been
working for procuring for three years
and also the kind of procuring yeah yeah
so let me thank procura first yeah so
therefore we bas on the job market if
Google is recruiting you know check her
out I know she's extremely smart okay
yeah she did almost all the heavy
lifting here of the work so what's the
motivation here is um so we know a lot
of p2 see auctions yes actually early I
mean en ik wrote a paper with me and
other professors professor Sri Thailand
professor Hans on its own consumer
auctions ok the beating behavior for
consumer auctions believe or not you
guys really provide a lot of research
for us to do ok folks like a Google like
eBay others and I'll say
new firms in a lot of people that you
download data from eBay which is a
public okay so then you can download you
can start the beating behavior for
consumers okay but our question is how
about firms so the question is does b2b
options different than B to C auctions
so we're trying to ask this question
what's the difference between B to B
versus B to C C's we we thought we know
a lot about B to C but we don't know
okay anything okay about the b2b until
actually Vivian's dissertation so this
is for the first time where you'll find
out in and see what's going on and all
what's unique about the b2b auctions
what turns out they are in the
literature they have been talking about
three things ok on the non-price
attribute is going to be different okay
whether you are my income one supplier
make a difference and but in ebay
auctions you anybody can bit right a dog
can bid right you don't need a name okay
actual name but for this procurement
auctions you have to be a pre-qualified
supplier and definitely you're gonna
tell the buyer who are you right so this
is different second thing is hey we need
the auction that's not me winning a deal
ok you can be really low you thought I
can do win there's no way these are
procuring oculi the price is going down
okay and if you're trying to bury say
for all resorts like a Hilton Head you
know the right there in South Carolina
and of course you know the higher the
price you go you know you're gonna get
it right so this is different ok then
consumer auctions finally this kind of
quiche it's repeated because you know
yeah I don't know seeing a we you know
the Georgia Tech we have the buyer in a
pencil signals it
year right so we have to run this
auction scene over and over again okay
again let me use it again I've my
favorite the case the dell case example
is in a dell need to you know by memory
chip signals every year okay one said it
once so these options they are repeated
which is different to them p to see
options right I just need one I party
and I yeah I may even bid for use the
car but I just need one use the car as a
professor that's all I can afford right
so those are different things okay I'm
you theory okay so we want a personal
nobody has actually opened accurate data
center check was what's going on so
that's why you know say we really
appreciate the relationship we have
intimated with this company now
everybody knows is procuring okay and
actually other firms to actually give us
the data the b-2s b2b building data and
also dynamics it's important okay that
has been shown again into v to Z
auctions you know see how do you bid
okay how do you beat for 4i part in ebay
okay different person have different
strategies so I think smart people at
the Google you may use you know what
called a sniping strategy you don't pay
the you watch in the last minute you're
gonna bit right see oh yeah there are
also other people's you know you could
go on naive meters you know they just
like the participate in that keeping
beating me or simply using the proxies
provided by ebay right so we know okay
we know something in and actually that's
the earlier paper by media and also
other researchers unity about the beauty
behavior okay how do people bit but we
don't know how to firms bit that these
are actually deals right contracts right
those are billion dollar contracts you
know how to firms the bit so so those
are the second
you know that motivation is different
the last one yes you know right here
Stanford probably he's also comes out
into it for Google professor Paul
Milgram me and very famous and as a
world-class in economics yeah he's his
acht action theorists came as authority
of oxygen theorists but he is calling
for the new theory about facts a per
curiam early chapters seen as a when we
took a look at all the options going on
with procuring we trying to fit with all
the literature sorry none of this
textbook oxygen you know their models in
a fix what they are using your business
practice so that's why so we want to
start it what's going on in business
practice okay find the facts and see if
we can build some theories so those are
the motivations in it ok any questions
ok so actually bien sûr dissertation
actually uh yeah this is our only two
chapters of his dissertation two papers
okay the first paper ok I'm going to
talk to the more today is trying to find
out in p2p auctions you know say what
are the beating dynamics you know how do
they bit okay also what's the impacts of
a non-price attributes see if I know I
am an incumbent okay supplier okay do I
bit differently versus I'm a new guy
okay I'm a new entrant ok so that's the
questions you and you know whether
supplier type okay we'll play a role
okay inkay in terms of their bidding
okay the second point is how to uh
that's the second point actually
non-price attribute like supply type
okay effects meaning behavior and also
the auction outcome remember we winning
the auction that's not you sure you're
going to win in the day or the contract
right so but what's the relationship
right between okay a my type okay my
supply type B is my bidding strategy
a-and yeah and and also the interplay
what's going on and the second question
is what when you have repeated actions
in SE to suppliers to actually learn
right because I'm beating right again
and again they are some options market
you know we do it daily like electricity
little bit he writes daily okay yeah now
procure is busy you know some firms in
that run and this events more and more
frequently right so then see so this is
the same thing right so I'm been in
trying to get this deal from there to
sell gel memory chips you know do I
learn something right over time so those
are what we're trying to do okay um this
is the literature what they're saying
okay this is what we're doing basically
so yeah i think is only the first work
that I have to show you the evidence you
know see we have lots of theory but
those here it does not fit precisely
okay what the industry people they are
doing ok but first thing we ought to do
well to find out what's going on in
industry so this is the first I believe
this first work that shows the empirical
evidence what's going on so this is
actually maybe you know him this is
actually my friend Norman Oh from
Georgia Pacific yeah this is the most
recent lecture he actually gave you my
class at Georgia Tech he was also a
frequent speaker for procure empower he
was there when you run that in that
bucket and this year actually and he did
your video show okay so he's a really
authority about strategic sourcing and
turns out so there are different stages
see reverse option is not running the
auction only so there are a lot of
things before the option and after the
auction so this is very important to
understand is awesome so you have this
information garion stages you have this
implantation stages you also have to
manage okay yeah I believe procure
software have all this you know
modules functions you know to satisfy
the needs of different different stages
okay so the whole point is I want to
borrow his slice is there's a process
okay it's not just running auction and
then this is the model okay so this is
we trapped on a major fire in the
high-tech company okay is it's a big one
a major buyer and yeah maybe you look
around is right here but i can not gonna
tell you the name okay see turns out in
this company's assaults in business
process the first two pre-qualification
okay they qualify suppliers okay the
invites apart supplies to this business
is imitation only okay they send all
this RF x-ray to request for information
your request for proposal okay then do
the auction okay then the after the
auction they also have the stage called
the contract awarding and this
particular company is not automated it's
not automated exactly is a manual
selection okay who is going to win okay
when the select a winner actually take
consideration of these non-price
attributes okay so what's unique about
risk risk researches we have we are
fortunate to have two different data
sets ok the first data set is the
auction data set okay we also have the
second data set is who actually got the
deal okay the winner does it and we also
know the supplier type information okay
whether you're incumbent okay long terms
of wire or you are new entry guys okay
so it's very unique yeah let me tell you
a story with one picture know what we
found okay yeah the winner is the
incumbent yeah this is very different
than what the media has been saying the
previous work okay because people
worried okay reverse auction is gonna
piss off my long-term suppliers okay
it's not going to be sustainable okay
there are a lot of cry
it's not the case okay you know they
also made the practice firms like yeah
like procuring as it won't be able to
sustainable because they don't have use
that's not true okay now so data show is
actually now more and more firms okay
and they are using reverse auctions
using each saucy okay this is actually
evidence so we have to share this paper
with Malcolm area with many people there
gave us actually comments you know this
paper yeah commercialized was nominated
for the best paper for the ISIS
conference yeah this is Libyans paper I
was them and we've got a lot of comments
in the from this and really industry
experts and like Ricky heart scientific
atlanta mock Mario and no but all let me
tell you what we found ok so wat here
these are actual contracts actual
contracts for three years for a major
buyer in the high-tech industry and the
y-axis is is if I'm gonna water deal
okay to the news new guy say let's say
in China the savings ok yes suppose I'm
gonna what the deal ok to the lowest
bidder so those are the potential
savings ok and the axe accesses you know
you know if you travel east right there
is the potential is the actual savings
if you get into a waters do to your
long-term supplier so are you with me so
you know this picture we're just trying
to say ok so suppose the deal if i'm
going to give ok to my say suppose
there's a point right over here ok in
this white triangle area ok that means
so the savings i'm going to get ok come
here the new guy versus my long-term
supplier the savings is bigger okay if
you get the deal it's all what i do to
my incumbent
okay my long-term supplier okay and in
that shaded area right there is if you
can award a deal okay to the new guy
okay in that your savings will be huge
bigger okay come here if you want to
give the deal to the same supplier your
long-term supply or incumbent okay so
this is the 45 degree line so that's
that ingredient separates right so the
shaded area it's suppose you're only
going for the lowest prices okay then in
that shaded area you should award the
deal to this new entry guy okay and you
think that in this area in this area
okay you should avoid a deal to this
long-term supplier okay guess what
happened this is actual data okay actual
contracts so what's showing right there
so there's this occurs with the Sirkar
okay white dot is what actually happened
is this new guy or we could nan
preferred supplier actually was awarded
deal and that square is the preferred
supplier got the deal okay take a look
at this picture it is almost all the
dots are squares okay that means okay is
the incumbent they got most of the
contract okay and take a look right
there in this shaded area okay that's a
strong evidence shows the influence of
now attributes right see why you get the
deal offer the look a lot of deals right
over there I why offer those to use you
know to this to your incompetent unity
you're not saying a lot you could save a
lot more if you give to induce new
entrant but it did not ok so that's
evidence of the non attributes the new
furnace of non attributes and they're
also roughly you know these I don't know
that you can see that yes I don't know
maybe thirty percent of the time you
also see an interesting behavior is
actually you see that most of the time
suppliers the long-term suppliers in
the survivors they built the same almost
the same rights it's all around that 45
degree line is they're actually matches
the matches this new entries bit to see
that and there are also real cases
actually this long-term supplier they
bit lower even lower so they are willing
to give the buyer more you see that you
see all those dots right there so these
areas that means the surprise is being
lower okay long-term suppliers incumbent
is being lower than new entering guys so
in they are actually willing to give
them more well a pathway explanation
years you know that they have a demand
is unity unity yeah they have basically
can afford okay to give more so there's
always also evidence is this long-term
supplier they are willing to maintain
the long-term relationship right but
actually give you a better deal even so
either I match the deal of this new
entrant guy or actually I be even lower
yeah basically give you even more and in
exchange you also find evidence is
evidence it's in some real cases okay
the buyer is actually too willing to pay
more see normally this reverse auctions
this is the price I paid right last year
then I need seen us of course reduction
right over the years their case is
actually I'm paying more than I paid
last year okay in those real cases all
those tears were awarded exclusively to
incumbent you see that you see the
evidence you know they're trying to
maintain at this relationship okay and
take consideration of non-price
attributes so this is basically my talk
you can go okay so this is the actual
reverse auction I ain't no I won't have
time to go over is an actual oxy and we
started okay this is only one auction
platform home procured has all kinds of
choices you know they the buyer actually
you can set up your own
auction the different oxygen rules you
can choose you know it's really a
platform but for this particular in as a
high-tech buyer okay they use the fixed
one a fixed k a platform that's what we
did for this paper ok what's the
information has been revealed this is
important ok what need for mates you're
going to reveal ok there are firms who
messed up ok how do they messed up they
actually reviewed the actual big price
of the suppliers and that's that's
dangerous then I'm not going to I'm not
gonna participate well you can you can
imagine if I'm gonna participate my
final bid is really very close to my
actual cost right you can imagine right
you know close ok if you review my
actual bit ok that means all my rivals
they actually know that they have a
guest I should know my price in rent
right so therefore you know it's hurting
me but this company is something very
smart see they did not reveal the actual
bit prices what I review is the rack ok
let's see where are you right now ok see
your own bits of course if you can see
it right ok and also the colonel knows
the beat you know and also your rank
where you are ok in terms of ranking ok
with the other rival suppliers and you
can see this information as long you bid
ok you have to build you cannot just go
there and watch it right so you have the
bid ok so have these two data sets this
is unique in the first is the option
data set ok the other one is the cost of
savings data set so we actually know the
supply type we know the actual price and
we know the price before and after the
auction so what can actually happen to
the same is so we actually have a model
ok this is mixture Georgia Tech eunique
right we're always trying to be a new
theories and as a button we started with
business practice so we actually we're
trying to make friends with those yeah
those industry leaders like a pro Curie
or Google
we lover we also want to make a
contribution it was the new theory you
can build okay the new theory one is the
basic idea here is the supplier type and
number of additional preferred items
okay this particular supplier can
provide and there are a number of
previous auction experiences okay those
three things we use this as a proximate
proxy for non-price attributes so
non-price attribution is a one is the
type whether you are my preferred
supplier or not also you know the
experiences you know they they
participated also yeah the supplier did
not just the probably one items in many
they can supply in this particular all
items you know so you are the high-tech
buy what you need memory chips but also
I can supply other stuff I can supply
energy a bunch of items okay so
therefore but within your portfolio of
items your products unity and also you
know how many prefer you have that's a
measure you know you have anything Oh
preferred items in a further buyer so
then yeah those are important okay yeah
that you can you can imagine that's a
lot it's a measure of the relationship
right if you're dealing with these guys
more frequently ok we are imagine that
one is a heavy impact ok that's the
others to the bidding strategies ok and
also to the out our option outcomes how
do you measure oxygen outcomes it's the
final bits and also the cost of savings
and the cost awarding probability ok and
how likely you will actually get the
deal say are you with me ok so we so you
can we have this I re supply type II I
stand for whether you are incumbent or
not R stands for relationship ok e
stands for experience oxy experiences oh
boy and then let me see the first thing
we do is you know we have this auction
data we won't do a classic cluster
analysis we want to know how do firms
bit remember nobody knows okay of course
you can talk her with my friend Mark II
can't tell you how he's gonna bid but
that's just the one for him right
I want to know this big data center okay
and how do firms the bid okay so you can
do cluster analysis it's really as the
istick analysis and how do we measure so
then let's focus on the item level
that's thinking about memory chips in a
drm okay and we measure the time the kit
is from getting in okay then we measure
the firm stop bidding okay they can not
really quick but after that you know
they stopped bidding that's the time we
measure then how frequently it is for a
bit okay and also yeah when when they
actually did the change their peers like
it what's the magnitude okay they
reduced their bit so I with me those are
the four measures okay okay they are
theories but I'm not gonna explain but
anyway so we'll be of those four
measures take up what's going on hahaha
yes there are five clusters skiing it's
a three year data set okay and these are
actually how farms bid for the first
time ok so we believe our research team
is the first who discover in how do
farms bit for industrial contracts okay
take a look of those pink one okay those
we call early evaluators in this firm
they get in ok the bit high then a bit a
little bit then the reason is you did
you want you don't even realize that
suppliers they don't even know the
market to condition so these guys that
come in the bitch they get set up on the
market again but they are not that
competitive right they cannot bid
anymore because it even be the more they
are making a loss right but that's the
here that's the oil that best I can give
it to you market right there and I'll
stop bidding ok and take a look um so
there are also many Valerie's is they
are guys start getting in the middle of
the auction this is roughly tune our
options okay then do a few pits then
stop it okay there's a mid evaluators
okay you also have this that we caught
in opt-in unisys you know opt-in you
opportunist
in this firms they watch out in the end
of the auction they get in okay they're
bit okay sort of like snidey you know in
the ebay auctions okay and we also have
guys called a participator those firms
that just love to participate you know
they were there already that even be
here and then they're gonna play with
you got till the end of the auction okay
what happens it's interesting first of
all they are patterns and all stuff I
just told you it's new because in
previous oculi you know you should not
have this kind of behavior okay yeah if
you follow previous options theory and
open the textbook in a firm should orbit
no strategically okay or what we caught
straightforward bidding okay and
basically you know the what they're
going to produce and yeah it's yeah
that's why this is new saying for the
first time we uncover see they of course
there are firms right there say this now
strategic guys is they are keeping
beating and it's also called see a
ratchet strategy so yeah when you in
roller skater in a righteous you okay
i'll call the pedestrian strategy that
you work like with all right yeah
basically those firms that came in
bidding okay and so is this the blue
line so that's the theory predicts in
actually you should bit like that and
actually it's optimal but if you open of
course the theory has assumptions has
the model set up but if you have to open
this actually real yeah real you know
reality or real what data set you
discover see other clusters and these
are the major strategies so that's why
this the first time we show the cluster
is ok and the firm's they actually did
the pits straightforwardly but they also
be strategically so those two this PDA
is important this is a new okay we need
to take into consideration and yeah this
yeah we had a similar behavior in the
auction level so I'm going to skip all
that oh boy you know
I'm gonna ski all their say know what I
want to tell you is the yeah what would
actually they were fun okay yeah yeah
I'd be happy to share with your copy of
the paper inability I don't want to show
you those actually those data and we
actually did you know those are economic
analysis yeah the phone is is we find
out okay first of all bidding strategies
is not identical okay we have different
firms they have different reading
strategies they are heat your genius
okay you have five clusters at the optic
at the item log level okay and we've got
evidence showing that supply type or
non-price attributes actually change
this ruching so whether they wish you
were here we actually show you the
distribution of these five clusters at
the item level but then if you take a
look whether you are incompetent you
know all your new entry the dispute you
have two changes so that means that
that's the first area and supply type
actually influence in the obedience
strategy so that's the first takeaway
second takeaway is actually it's also
changes the auction outcomes okay see
what happened is you know the there's a
second different impacts okay of about
of the auction outcomes and as we say
that see incumbent guys okay they
actually bit higher overall in the final
bits okay because they know I am
incompetent okay I have other things you
know say you're the buyer actually value
maybe I'm close to you very my quality
you know there are a lot of other
reasons we have to show the evidence and
the buyers no stats and the buyers take
that into consideration okay the actor
Awards was the deal actually to the
incompetent but also new entry guys in
ER has benefit okay that's the second
lecture so what
those new entry guys they're keeping
participating in right see you know you
know I participate in this day auction I
bid yeah yeah by the way they are really
rouse options you know see ya to get
memory chips okay it's just amazing how
they are headed for you know the
profession so the question is you know
again if there's a puzzle you know why
if I'm not getting the deal why I'm
keeping into the participating in this
reverse auction it's okay the second
question is is that because if they have
a short memory The Forgotten see what
happened this actually terms from from
industry so therefore we have four we
need a model right this is Georgia Tech
is different so I have revealed auctions
you know the natural way to do is a
Markov chain okay with developer Michael
Chen and we also measure between the
objects what kind of information you
revealed okay so you do the first
auction t minus one then do another one
right in between you know what's the
lower spit for the previous auction okay
and you also you know your rank for the
previous auction and you also know
whether you actually got the deal or not
well it got the contract or not you
don't know who got it but you know you
know whether you got it or not right so
this is again so this is a different way
to put that my mic off the chain okay
these are the state variables how do we
change okay it's a latent Markov chain
model okay and this is our our you know
the conjectures or hypothesis we
actually have it is it's all supported
it turns out after suppliers they
actually bit adaptive dating they learn
okay they learn between auctions yeah
this is the first time okay you can you
can you can have a feel you can
conjecture but you don't have evidence
you know this her work is the first time
I could review the evidence to show they
do bit adaptively and they also respond
to the rank you know it's to indicate
they are ranked okay so this is the
actual data so if you move from okay
auction t minus 12 option t right so it
depends whether your wreck is high or
rank is low or it depends on the
strategy are you
are you an early evaluator are you an
evaluator or participator are you
opportunist in those are the four
clusters at the actionable if you
measure those are the four clusters okay
then you see that you're they're
changing okay and it depends on the rank
of high see that's the this is our the
probability your change for those of you
who know my cough chain okay those are
the transition probabilities okay you
choose that unity is different between
different strategies ok also depend
different between your rank you know
whether you are high rank or lower rank
ok now let's just take one example okay
example so if I'm an early evaluator
okay and then see I have a high rank so
then you see what's going to happen see
I'm gonna change see next time you know
very likely i want to be a participator
yeah you see what you want to say oh you
take a look of this guy suppose I am a
sniper okay and myrek is high so you
know for the previous one then the next
time what I'm gonna do is you know see I
am going to move change my strategy very
likely to be a participator you see that
you know say there's there's a chain
using going on yeah so what's going on
here is the following okay if you put
that thing you know you to this really
Michael Michael Chen time line diagram
you can see that you see you see how
those from the keeping changing and how
do you make sense of all that if you are
let me tell you one sentence in sa what
you can summarize all those strategy
going on is firms actually have evidence
they're using this strategy or the wind
stay loose shift okay so you all this if
you are your words okay this all yeah
math okay all this data that shows you
see I'm beating with my current strategy
if I'm winning okay I'm gonna stick with
my strategy okay if I don't get it okay
I'm gonna shift how I'm gonna chef Dina
we actually show you the transition
probability depends you know say your
you know your rank and if it wasn't how
you are so therefore to summarize you
know say that why they are keeping
participating they're learning so why
that participating okay of course
another reason is they have they have
lots of capacity they are looking for a
40 horse energy yeah but actually they
can learn market price because they know
the lowest bid price then they have some
idea about market okay they also learn
how competitive they are right because
they know they'll rank information they
also they learn actually bidding
strategies okay over the time and it
turns out in a the yeah procuring allows
firms to actually score different
suppliers before the oxy I tell you what
your score what's your school you guys
don't know each other okay I tell you
whether you might prefer guys or not
okay you can comment on all right but
you have a chance okay to actually to
move up okay you you join into this
option as a new entries I'm a new
company from China okay so if I can
deliver if I can perform so the next
auction here your score got raised yeah
you can also okay move into that most
favorable nation is you can move into a
incumbent list if we can perform you can
deliver okay so therefore that's why
they are known in a bell learning so
they can go back and work it out kc you
know see what IDC was my problem right
he's cast or delivery of quality and so
there they actually have a chance to to
move so they offer to summarize the
other the work by vvn see mainly the
following this is only two chapters and
she's now doing a big thing okay using
the big pro career data set ok so far
she has discovered its suppliers to be
strategically this is new ok then but
why it's why it's a big deal because how
do their bit actually affects the buyers
cost savings so Google should care ok so
you should care about the bidding
strategy of yours
because yeah the obedience strategy
affects the final bits and the final
bits affect your customers ok so we have
evidence and non-price attributes in its
very influential in theory again
professor Palmer groom has proved ok in
this video we auctions that this I civ
role is not the price it's actually this
non-price attributes ok but we show the
evidence ok yeah among the first then we
said why supplies to keep in bidding ok
because they are learning ok and all
this is in sharply contrasts with
consumer auctions so therefore
procurement auctions is very different
than consumer auctions so that's all I
have in ongoing work is the VA is trying
to start a different auction platforms
procured has been alright this is a
particular high-tech they know how to do
business you know they have a fixed ok
platform and she starting to compare so
what if this is a company sourcing for
lawyers versus a company sourcing for
hotel rooms account company saucy for
semiconductors and accompany the
sourcing that's for netscape and then
it's a different information revolution
or ok it's because it's all there ok
then she's trying to study the impact of
this information revelation ok and to
all the stuff we care about its ok
auction outcomes find up its cost the
savings and contract awarded probability
so that's actually her ongoing work is
actually with procuring yeah ok that's
all I have ok yeah thank you thanks for
coming
