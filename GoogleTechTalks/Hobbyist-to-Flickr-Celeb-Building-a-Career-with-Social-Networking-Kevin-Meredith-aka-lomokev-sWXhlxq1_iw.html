this morning's speaker not not only
because he's a fantastic photographer
and he's been an inspiration but but
really because he's he helped he's
helped pioneer a new era in photography
where we're sharing and the
conversations around photographs and in
the metadata that comes along with
photographs are almost as important as
the photograph themselves and I think
for me personally I signed up for Flickr
in about 2,000 2,500 Kevin about a month
offer i signed up so pretty pretty
pretty quickly after i joined flickr and
i remember that the the sort of early
days are sort of trying to understand
what flickr was about but I think the
lights went on when I saw Kevin's stream
and sort of read his comments and sort
of followed him and five years later
five five or so years later this is
actually the first time I've met Kevin I
think mostly as well but I feel like
I've been following him pretty closely
for this before this whole time and know
his life fairly intimately he doesn't
really know mine that much but that's
okay and and he's been a source of
inspiration and tips and guidelines and
you know sort of it's been it's been an
amazing experience experiencing Kevin's
work through flickr so for me kevin is a
standout in a busy industry in a in a
world that takes 60 billion photographs
a year I think Kevin's definitely sort
of changed the way that will help to
change the way that night people take
photographs a little bit of Kevin's
biodun other than jump in his
photographs published a number of books
and I'm saying this because I know that
he's not gonna said a number of books
most recently in National Geographic he
was one of the early contributors to jpg
magazine for those you know that was an
inspirational magazine he's been a judge
on a number of competitions at South by
Southwest and other flickr competitions
he's worked commercially for another
clients Phillips doc martens and his and
and you may have seen his is his
photograph of imogen heap he's worked in
a bunch of work for her he's also
running monthly workshops based on his
book hotshots which I would recommend
looking up the book three months in
advance at this point but mostly he's a
he's a hilarious commenter brilliant
photographer and a terrible speller so
welcome Kevin
thank you so what I'm going to do is I'm
take you through a little brief little
history and I try and run through it as
fast as I can a little bit slower than
he did but just to give you an idea how
I kind of built up my online following
so basically this is the title of the
talk and there's a little bit of stuff
that's relevant to sort of Googlers
towards the end but basically i first
started taking photographs around 94 and
basically at the age of 18 I was already
being employed by magazines to take
photographs at rave parties which it was
really good fun because the end I was 18
years old I was getting paid to go out
Raven and basically I got my travel paid
i got fifty pounds of nine which doesn't
sound like a lot when you're 18 it was
that would have been about a hundred
dollars back in 96 so ya know it was
like I was paid to go out it was
brilliant but then that all stopped when
I went to university in 97 to 2000 but I
always carried on photographing actually
did to graphic design and advertising
college and my photography was always
something I did for me I never used it
as a sort of college project so it was
all very deeply personal but when my
photography really changed is when I got
into something called lomography or lomo
so I found out from reading a magazine
article about this that looks really bad
on the screen there but it's got more
contrast if you look behind on the
screen behind you but and yes a special
little camera called the lomo LCA and
when I first got it in about the year
nineteen ninety-eight they only cost
sixty pounds is everybody cool if I if I
prefer two million pounds because I
don't know when the other pension and
just to give you an idea like basically
they've got such a huge following now
they actually stay soft sell between 165
pounds to 250 pounds now but for me this
is like the ultimate kind of like analog
camera experience and it just enabled
you to get these really rich beautiful
colors in a time before digital compact
cameras existed while most people were
using sort of crappy film clip film
compact camera
and a few people had like film slrs but
it was quite rare even at sort of
creative college anyway what happened is
um it's all like the reason why the talk
is called like a tale of serendipity
because certain things happened that I
imagine if they didn't haven't happened
I wouldn't be here today I wouldn't have
had like you know two books published in
the third on the way and one of my
friends at the end of college she went
to London to go and have a portfolio
review of a London design studio and it
just so happened he was the same guy who
sold me my lomo because back then you
didn't you didn't you didn't just like
by a low moral line because like online
shopping it wasn't really something that
is done so basically he said to her oh
yeah you know your friend he was one who
sold the cameras he said oh you know
your friends stuff looks wicked you
should give him me his address and I'll
put him on our mailing list so they
started sending me lots of invites to
competitions and stuff and one of the
competition's i entered which these
photographs are going a bit too fast to
be honest is basically called the lomo
olympics so in the year 2000 I took part
in the London lomo Olympics where I
basically came second in my country only
do because I drew with one guy and
basically it was decided the winner was
decided on a game of foosball which I'm
crap at so I was rated second-best in
England because of that and then so what
happened after that is like is luckily I
still won the trip to Japan to go and
fight for my country and oh I've got
start my timer yeah so basically what
you're seeing here is just to give you
an idea is the low 'mo'lympics and it's
kind of like what I base my photography
course on is everybody was given a list
of 101 things to photograph with free
rolls of films you sent out in three
hours and it means you have to take a
picture every three minutes and so it's
really kind of like creatively intensive
and then you had the next day we did
what's called a freestyle day where you
had three rolls of film you could shoot
whatever you want so then all the
photographs were judged and the best
photographers were then put into the
sort of the
semi finals which kind of like was
involved photography but more kind of
stupidity so what you're actually
looking here is something called lomo
sumo sumo and basically the idea here is
is you have an opponent these are my
photographs and you have to take a
photograph of their face as many times
as you can they're allowed to block you
while the hair trying to take a picture
of you so it's all very exciting and
other events include Wellington boot
clay pigeon shooting general no
wellington boots our galoshes yeah so
basically someone froze the Wellington
boot in the air you have to take a
photograph of it and as soon as the
person who threw the boot here's the
clicker your shutter they throw up
another one and you have to do you have
to wind on your camera and take a
photograph before it hits the ground so
it was yeah it was bonkers and what it
taught me is like not to take
photography too seriously anyway so
after all the fun and frolics of going
to Japan like sort of it was only like a
ice just it was two weeks into my new
job after University so luckily I got
unpaid leave when I went to my new job
they were gracious enough to let me go
so basically I spent my days working as
an interactive developer sort of making
flash websites for an animation company
in London but while I was doing this I
was always taking photographs and I
always had my little lomo in my pocket
and I just shot photographs for me and
the weird thing was I never put them on
any websites the only way I'd ever show
anybody is basically I used to carry
books around like this and I used to
this is like my best off book so
whenever I would get a take a photograph
I really like I would go through the
book remove one photograph and put
another one in and this this it was like
my flickr so I was kind of doing flickr
before it was a website so I was kind of
I was ready to rock when this website
appeared on the scene but then in 2004 i
moved to brighton which is on the south
coast of england which is about 52
minutes from london by train it has been
compared to San Francisco they call it
the San Francisco of the UK
which I don't think you can really can
because it's tiny it has got a tech
industry you know I think that you know
they make PlayStation games there and
there's a lot of web dev going on down
there and there's a few kind of stars
but it's nothing like this but there's a
large gay community and it's just a
fantastic very cosmopolitan place to
live so I yet so I moved down there this
is a picture of Brighton as this is
taken from the maternity ward of Sussex
hospital I had my daughter and basically
when I first moved down there I just
really got into my sea swimming so this
is me on the warning boy at the end of
the West Pier but yeah so I was really
then I sort of started doing sets of
things a really kind of like because
I've had lots of spare time because I
wasn't working much I was taking a lot
of photographs and Billy could building
upset so one of the things I did do was
start documenting the bright and
swimming club like all the time I'd go
every every day I would never be down
there without my camera but anyway so
how my kind of photography career really
subtle kick-started was basically one of
the women who I swam with and this is
another bit where the serendipity comes
in she is actually a sub-editor at
rotture vision which is the British
publisher for all my books and what
would happen was as I would sort of when
I was on flickr i would say you know
I've just uploaded some new swimming
photographs whining look at them but she
was looking at everything else as well
but I never knew so I'm sort of skipped
forward a bit there but basically yes so
in November 2004 i joined flickr and i
do a tribute my popularity on flickr
down to the fact i had got in there
right at the start as simon was saying
you know he added me as a contact like a
month after he joined i don't know how
how I sudden I do I'm going to tell you
how I became popular and why I just said
that but I think the reason why people
would look at my photo stream go wow
it's amazing is because i was actually
uploading a backlog of the sort of past
five years worth of images so hide like
a pool of the best of so i think if you
actually look for my flickr stream you
can kind of see it's really amazing in
the beginning and then it kind of goes
get like that
and then it kind of gets better again so
like we've literally the first page of
my Flickr stream is like our amazing
even if I say so myself so yeah anyway I
took this image at the right place yeah
so basically what really propelled my
sort of online sort of popularity to
dizzy heights because I took this
photograph before I think before flickr
when I lived in London this is some
pools late and night on the millenium
bridge when it just opened if you try
now I've been there now like five
o'clock in the morning to try and get
photograph of it with nobody on it and
it just always just got people sort of
you know walking backwards and forwards
so this was like it's very rare to get
it with nobody on it so anyway image and
heap saw this image and she said to me I
really want that photograph but I want
me in it so I was like yeah cool I never
even heard of her and she said basically
I'm self-funding my first album I
haven't got much money and so she paid
me but it wasn't a huge amount of money
but it was a it was good doesn't look
very good on there um looks better on
that one looks really good on my screen
and so anyway so I took this photograph
and what I put her in there and we were
like hanging out on the bridge at like
two o'clock in the morning and it was a
long exposure so I had to prop up one of
our pedals with a brick that then had to
be photoshopped out of well afterwards
and yeah that she was really happy with
the shot and that's actually on the kind
of like I think he's you open the CD on
her kind of first solo album I think
it's kind of like on the inside bit but
also when I was doing that photo shoot I
took this because the idea is well she
wanted me to shoot loads of lomo stuff
of her traveling to and from her studio
so basically her kind of work went she
basically would leave her flat cycle to
her studio and make her music but that
was a her kind of head clearing time so
she wanted me to document that journey
and this photograph I took this of her
cycle long it's actually the first shot
on a roll of film anyway flickr saw this
and said we're redeveloping are from
page could we put it on the front page
with luck in the rotating kind of like
random image thing but basic
because that image was on the front page
and if you clicked on it took you to my
flickr page my suddenly up the amount of
hits i just got was that skyrocketed
interestingly enough that I it's quite
again going as serendipity it's um that
photograph is a complete fluke you know
I was actually trying to get ahead in
the shop it it works so well because I
read of a coat is framed on that white
bit of brick it you know I mean I cut I
couldn't recreate that I've tried I
can't come close but it's just really
interesting that the sort of thing that
really sort of held me forward was like
basically an accident anyway and the
other thing I think the reason why
people really dig my photography is
because I mostly use film out of the I
gotta figure here somewhere I think
basically ten percent of the photographs
on my flickr stream are digital the rest
are all film and the way I see it the
this is my favorite film before it kind
of went crap and green basically what i
do i do a lot of what's called cross
processing which is ready take slide
film and you basically get the photo lab
to develop it as negative so instead of
getting a slide back you get a really
high contrast dense negative and you get
these really beautiful sort of over
saturate very dense very sort of moody
images and so when you're on flickr and
you've got all these people uploading
lots of digital photographs yours are
always going to really stand out and i'm
not saying on the only one shooting film
there's loads of us but compared to the
amount of people up in digital stuff
we're still in a minority but i just
think there's something so much more
special about film because you have this
kind of like negative this analog and it
can be damaged it's not like a digital
file that can be you know uploaded
backed up and sort of be you know
special forever so this is like this is
like shot on fuji instax so that picture
that's the only one that exists of it so
if that gets damaged or destroyed that's
it the image is kind of gone and then
she's got like a really good scan but
again one of the things on the come to
is
we've sort of digital technology now I
mean I'm a big fan of hipstamatic and
other kind of like analog smartphone
apps because someone asked me is it all
you know do you think this is going to
kill off the whole kind of lomo film
movement I don't think is because when I
was researching to writing a new book on
toy cameras and when I was researching
that in their forms in Flickr a lot of
people said to me well you know
hipstamatic is what made me want to buy
a Diana and you got weird things like
this is called the why is it called
again this is called the what's it
called no she's just laughing is it
called the digital hair assuming that's
it so this is a little kind of like
digital low mode it's got a screen but
you don't actually compose your image in
that screen you have to actually look
through this kind of like square window
it's really really basic but then it
kind of like what it does is it kind of
gives you the kind of loma effect so
this is kind of like a very expensive
version of hipstamatic what's really
funny about it is actually uses
batteries that aren't rechargeable that
cost ten dollars each so it effectively
is it's expensive as using a film camera
really which I find quite amusing really
so you kind of get in that kind of
convenience of digital but you're still
lacking to pay for it but some of the
images you can get with it are
absolutely fantastic so this is
something I took the other day on the
drive from here LA to San Francisco but
it yeah it's a really good the whole
kind of like smartphone apps i think
it's going to really draw people in but
what I think films really good at it
kind of makes people shoot differently
so this is like a negative sheet of mine
from a roll of film and for the most
part I find when I watch people take
digital photographs sometimes they'll
take ten photographs are the same thing
and my kind of ethos is is no just shoot
one photograph move on and shoot another
thing you might get a couple of crap
photographs but you'll get killer ones
instead of getting hung up you're kind
of like in a kind of loop like a you
know you're stuck in a loop and you just
like you won't move on until you
perfected this image where you take a
film picture you take it it's done and
then you just move on so when I teach my
photography call
from the first day everybody gets lent a
lomo LCA and they get given a list of 66
things to shoot on two rolls of film and
people like who generally start off with
digital photography finding and really
find it a real liberating experience so
yeah oh here when oh yeah so out of the
three thousand two hundred pictures i've
got on flickr twelve percent are digital
the rest are all film so this was the
first picture i uploaded of my daughter
to flickr so a lot of people have said
to me they say oh well you know i feel i
know so much about your life you know
I've been following you you don't
actually really know a lot about me
because I although it looks like I put a
lot out there I tend to not put it out
there because I'm shocked by some of the
things I see I've seen people upload the
kind of blue to photograph the two blue
stripes on a pregnancy test before
saying yeah I'm pregnant and it's like
you're not meant to tell people that
until you're free months in so but we
went one step further and basically we
had the baby she came home I took this
photograph when she was like two weeks
old got it developed uploaded it and it
was like rather than some sort of
substandard iphone picture it's like
look at this and you know the response
was overwhelming so um yeah so I just
you know I love film I just and also the
thing film for me it's a bit like you
have a digital photograph and then you
have to decide how you're going to
process it so but with film is I choose
films and I think well I've always
carried out three cameras with different
film types so I know what films to use
in certain sort of times so it's kind of
like pre-processing rather than
post-processing if you see I mean anyway
so I'm just going to talk about what
happened when I had the possibility of
writing the book and the kind of like
brief history of how I got to become an
author just because I wasn't even a
professional photographer I was just a
guy living in Brighton trying to make a
living as a freelance flash developer
yeah it was okay i had to travel to
London sometimes but basically i started
off basically i had images in the first
issues of JPEG magazine as Simon said
and then basically they started
accepting articles as well and derek the
editor contacted me and said all do you
want to write an article about low moan
i've never written anything
professionally before in my life and I'm
Dyslexic I saw oh god you know ok so I
wrote this article I had friends kind of
proof read it and stuff they really
liked it and they published it so that
was my first bit of published writing
and then what happened after that was is
this was the first kind of version of
Hot Shots so the publisher came to me
said we want to do a book review will
call it the photographers visual index
which is a really catchy title and
basically what they did is they showed
this sampler around all the book fairs
and it didn't get taken up it didn't get
accepted and then so that was that so
the book was over I didn't get me to get
excited cuz I don't get I don't tend to
get excited about things that don't
actually happening I kind of like you
know people can contact me say all we
want you to shoot this job for BMW and
I'll be like yeah okay and I won't get
excited until have actually kind of
signed a contract or I'm on a plane
going to do something I'm kind of like a
very level-headed like that so I just
carried on doing my thing my flickr
popularity was still escalating flickr
asked me to judge photography
competition and part the bargain of
looking at three thousand photographs
which took about two and a half days was
very flew me to New York to a party
where even the winners weren't going to
be there because there's some really
weird law where you can't fly
competition winners from outside the US
into the u.s. if they win something but
like judges it was okay so yeah it's
pretty cool and then yeah just things
sort of started escalating from that
point so mu calm you all guys know what
mu is ya mook calm contacted me and they
said we want you to be a mu designer so
we want people to be able to come on if
they don't have photographs they like
themselves they can use your images and
then I got a job with dr. martens
shooting their shoes but what was really
nice about it it was in LA and then six
months later again it was in San
Francisco and basically was really
simple there was no models involved I
just had to take photographs of shoes
and different location
around the city so we've sort of
produced this little book out of it and
so I was starting to get like loads of
commercial work yes it's going good but
anyway so what happened was is a little
while later I got contacted by the
publisher saying we really want you to
do this book now and it was like wow
this is going to happen but it was like
about two years after originally been
proposed and they completely redesigned
it they hadn't told me so I just got
this phone call saying yeah do you want
to do it we can start soon and then I
started producing the book so this was
my first book it slightly different
color to the American version now
interestingly enough I I actually looked
at least my book is on google google
books it's a cool google book search but
it's not actually scanned you can't look
inside it which I'm quite disappointed
by I don't know what my publisher would
think of that but I'm sort of like all
up for this kind of stuff although some
people aren't but the again the same
thing what I did with my baby is I never
actually blogged or wrote about the
process of writing a book I basically I
just suddenly two weeks before it came
out I went onto flickr and said right
it's here i'm having book launches
because i don't like that whole thing is
where people kind of drag things out and
saying i'm working on this and it will
be out in a year and I've just done like
written another article and blah blah
blah I just I think that balls people to
death so I'm just like I'm like I like
what Steve Jobs does it's like yet BAM
we've got this new thing come check it
out and so here are the two that's the
two that's the UK and the American cover
I actually prefer the UK cover and then
so this year now just my new book has
come out and I think the British
publisher kind of shot themselves in the
foot because they insisted on having a
different title so the American version
is called photo op which is quite catchy
it's easy to remember whereas 52
photographic projects it's a bit of a
mouthful and there's plenty of books
with photographic projects in the title
and also it's really funny working I've
come from a world of light you
I worked in the internet as a flash
developer in a lot of kind of like
London design agency so everybody's
quite forward thinking about the
internet but it's really weird to be in
a publisher and they just like they'd
make books and they don't think about
these things at all and I tried to
explain to them that I was brewing the
face or saying look if you have a
different title when an American blogs
about the new book he's got or mentions
it on Twitter and then an English person
goes that sounds interesting i'll look
at that on amazon.com you can doesn't
come up you're losing a sale but they're
like no we want to differentiate
ourselves from the American publisher
and you're like your mental and honestly
this went on for ages I was yeah and the
funny thing was is the whole all the
books are going to be called 52
photographic projects about what was my
idea and the American publisher took it
on the British ones were like no we're
going to stick with what we got but um
yeah well that's their lookout so but
interesting enough with this book going
back to sort of like the internet and
the flicker is that basically most of
the contributors came because I didn't
write it all only wrote half of it
basically the 22 contributors I found
them through six of them were like
friends from Brighton but their friends
I know through flickr the other three
were who i know from boot camp which i
just told you about earlier which Mona
Brooks is here from food camp she wrote
she wrote an article in this book so
yeah if you want to buy a book you get
her to sign it as well she actually
wrote as well and then also Cody was at
food camp but he didn't write my book
but he works at Google so yeah that's my
new book and it's a bit of a beast and
it took a lot of time now I just want to
now talk about how i use flickr oh no
i'm going to talk about how i use other
social networks not just flicker
obviously flickr is my kind of main
thing i use to promote myself now is I
don't know how it is over here but the
kind of the new buzzword is sort of
social marketing and all this kind of
stuff and I'm always getting people
contact me to talk about it and there's
like training companies as a training
company in brighton that sort of does
social me
training courses and my whole thing is
not the way I built my kind of
popularity of liquor is a kind of
organic process I started it is for fun
and I still do treat it as a fun thing I
know it's kind of like it's very
important to my career now but I'll
still have a laugh I'll still sort of
swear and there'll be some you know sort
of funny things that go on there it's
not like all Tony profession I try and
keep it not very serious now I noticed a
lot of people really get into social
media they try and like be active on
lots and lots of social networks and
what I tend to do is just kind of like
think I'm just going to go for a few you
know and I think you're far better off
concentrating on a few than spreading
yourself too thinly i use facebook a bit
although I do admit I hate it I think I
just I kind of like had I used to use
upcoming but now no one uses that coming
anymore you set up a facebook event you
invite people to come they say they're
coming and they don't turn up or they
just ignore the invites it's all you
know very strange and I think what's
really interesting for me is I actually
do trend spotting for a magazine where I
take like pictures of people in the
street for their clothes and all these
young people you email them and they
never get back to you and you phone them
up and then they say oh I never checked
my email they actually use Facebook as a
form of communication like email is like
so last century to them but they an
issue unless you send and the other
thing I've learned about them as well
anybody under the age 20 unless you text
them about something that's when you
really trying to say come to this event
you know they won't come so yeah young
people it's a crazy I do i do feel old
now when like kids don't answer emails
um I'm just gonna sort on your paper
oh sorry um so basically I mean most
important thing for me is flicker I mean
this is my website and its proper basic
it's just wordpress I've got a really
basic theme on there that I've slightly
tweaked and I do i do want to sort of
sort it out but I do realize it's not
the really most important thing and I
think to be honest although I you I did
a graphic design degree i do think
content is king because i think most
people probably read this in their RSS
readers anyway they never actually see
this and I you know I kind of like don't
it's not like I don't get a huge amount
of visits i think i get about five hours
and unique visitors a month i think but
then when I look at like Google Reader
when it says that like 200 people
subscribe to this and you think well how
many people are actually reading it but
I never actually know about it because
they don't actually go to the website
and that's just Google Reader there's
lots of our readers that blob to I'd
love to know but I suppose I com but
it's good to know that your stuff is out
there um but the way I do things that
you know as Simon said my spelling is
terrible i'm dyslexic I think my
personal website I actually have loads
of administrators on the blog so if i
write a new post i will email my friend
and say can you can you spell check this
for me can you proofread it and he has
to get trained to London at five in the
morning so he'll then edit it on his
iPad and then but i might get up it's
all perfect and posted and it's all
there whereas when i put stuff on flickr
and twitter I kind of don't really care
I are you actually you may notice when I
do twit when I do flickr when I write
anything on flickr everything's all
lowercase and I've always done that I
don't know why it just kind of happens
that way and when I give presentations I
always use a background it and I never
capitalized anything but it's just kind
of signing this just developed but so
what I'm going to talk about now I
should cover it anything is oh yes oh my
use of social media just going back to
talking about my book is when I first
have my book launches I ordered 100
books for my publisher and they were
like are you sure and I went yeah why
and I like well usually our offers only
take 15 books to give to friends and
sell to few family members and that much
okay I'm a bit different and they're
like really well yeah because I thought
you know I following online I reckon
i'll be on a shift a hundred so then I
gauged the kind of interest before the
launch and bright and nothing or better
get 100 more and they were just like are
you bonkers you know these these are
going to cost you a lot of money I'm
like no no I'm going to have him it's
gonna you know it's going to it's going
to go off and basically I sold like 150
in Brighton and then I ordered like a
shed load more for London and they were
absolutely astounded and now I just like
every few months i buy like 100 of them
because i sell them mail order it's kind
of like a good cash cow for me because
what happens is this is the other wave
thing they basically the print run runs
out and it runs out and then they decide
to do a reprint and I'm like what surely
get it to ten percent and then order the
reprint but it's just a weird way of
doing business um but anyway that's
that's my the way the publisher works I
can't do anything about it anyway so I'm
going to talk a bit about how I gained
flickr because I sometimes see people
use Flickr lunch like what are you doing
so now this is an example so when I was
saying earlier if you look at the
beginning of my photo stream you can see
that there's all these really amazing
photographs that are in there in quick
succession well what happened is is I
see people do this now and I kind of
learned from mistakes is I went to the
Labour Party conference was on in
Brighton and every day there was a
different protest I think it was a
protest in the morning the afternoon and
there was a band hunt protest so
basically fox hunting was banned in the
UK so that meant all the really kind of
like hoi polloi posh people came out on
their horses with their beagles just
really protesting and making trouble and
basically dumping a dead horse in the
middle of a fountain in brighton and
ping like truck loads of manure was
amazing so I went and took photographs
of this and but what i did is i just
uploaded 30 photographs all at once and
wondered why no one was looking at them
or making comments and stuff so i've
actually and also this is the other
thing is like what sign was saying about
the metadata and stuff when I now upload
a photograph I'll spend at least 10-15
minutes is like adding the Geo tag which
can be a ball leg because we r who maps
you can only go in so fast or sometimes
i go to google maps find where i want to
go get the longitude and latitude copy
and paste it into flickr i'm just
thinking why can't flickr just use
google maps which I realize is not going
to happen but yeah so I've now I'm sort
of like definitely I sort of put
metadata on everything I've got a
special protocol type in later where I
could just type shortcuts so I can type
like FL lomo and it will just fill out
all my lomo tags like Lomo Lomo LCA
lomography and so basically I'm very
very quickly but metadata is very very
important so what I learned from this
experience is only upload one photograph
at a time because basically it's like
your flickr followers like drug addicts
you gotta kind of like you don't want
them to OD you gotta like slowly drip
feed and ki can come back because we got
realizes when people are looking this is
the same from twitter as well i hate it
when you look at twitter and someone's
like posted like 10 tweets in a row when
I tweet I just little tweet and then
I'll leave it like five minutes to tweet
again am i doing for time oh well so
anyway so this is when people come to
flickr this is their purse first port of
call and basically you'll appear in this
kind of like that where that says your
contacts that's where your photograph
will appear so if you upload 30 in a go
basically only the top photograph is
going to show it's like a deck of cards
so it's really really important just
upload one at time that's how I kind of
gain the system the other thing as well
is like people do weird things
is everybody here a flickr user you sin
like the gif invites and it's really
weird it's like if i get a common i want
it to be like a real person saying
something if they post a picture I want
it to be relevant and there's this whole
thing of like where people put such
importance on comments and fades that
people set up these groups like if you
join this group you have to if you go
into the group then you have to comment
on 500 people photographed it's
basically like Flickr pyramid selling
scheme and it's absolutely pointless and
then you get these beautiful little
animated gifts as well and I think that
CQ actually stands for quality control
which is a bit of a conundrum in itself
yeah and then also explore which is kind
of like flickers pagerank some people
but so much importance on it there's
actually groups on flickr that are
dedicated to kind of like finding out
how it works much as there's a whole
industry like SEO finding out how you
know how to sort of game google and it's
just like just create good content it's
just that simple but you know that's
that's my SEO advice there yeah do I get
like some kind of commission for that
you know it's this bonkers but it's also
as well as I like I don't do a thing
like some people like Stephen Fry when
he was first on Twitter he added
everybody who added him as a follower he
then followed back but it gets to a
point where you can't do that it becomes
pointless so I don't I used to do this
thing where i actually went used to go
through people who would add me as a
contact I'd actually look at their
photographs and decide what I like them
decide where what I add them and then if
I didn't want to Adam I didn't and now I
do this is a bit of like a bit of white
hat action I don't know it could be
against the terms of service I don't
know I'd do it anyway is every time
someone asked me as a contact I click on
the little contact mail and then flick
and mail them back saying oh hi I see
you've added me as a contact you know if
you like what I do you can check out my
book and my Twitter and my tumblr so I
give them all these links to look at so
it's kind of like I'm kind of
like an unsolicited mail but it's not
because they've added me as a contact I
wouldn't ever do it to someone who
hasn't added me as a contact I did a
similar thing with my first book
launches where I looked at my contacts
each added me as a who've added me as a
so you can look on flickr you can look
at your contacts and you can order it by
location so i went to the london bit and
just flick them out everybody from
London it took about three hours but
quite a few people turned up because of
that anyway going on to as well how I
kind of like game the system sometimes
as you sometimes i upload provocative
photographs and you think i can't wait
to post this just to see the reaction so
this photograph here the the amount that
i think it's my most commented
photograph on flickr and Simon said to
me yes they say be interesting if you
tell some kind of like stories about
this sort of like interesting comments
you've got and I started looking at the
comments from this last night and it was
just like oh my god and like a lot of
the comments averaged about 300 words
but I think my wife son summed it up
when she just said um what did she say
she just went can of worms um but yeah I
mean it has had I mean it's not when you
compare it to like YouTube it's not huge
but like 157 comments I think flickr
that's quite a lot but other kind of
light interesting story so sometimes
I'll take a photograph on a story to it
so this is like a stone I found on
Brighton Beach and it had someones
myspace address written on it so I was
like that's interesting so I posted to
flickr no I didn't post it what I did is
I contacted her first on myspace and I
found a stone on myspace it's got your
address on it isn't that weird and she
just accused me being a pervert and
being weird and said are you being a
creepy old guy and I'm like no I
honestly did find this though so then
I'd sort of like wrote about the story
and I posted it under eye height myspace
on flickr so obviously everybody on
flickr who's used to looking at a
quality website which found that
hilarious similar things as well when i
pasted posted my baby my first baby
photograph
I got a hell of a lot of comments and
feedback and now that I've got a baby
and I'm working really hard five minutes
I haven't actually checked my flickr
activity for two months this is the
longest I've ever left it but I still
plan to go back there and read all those
comments and reply to stuff so I'm just
going to go over some few things as a
kind of like professional photographer
now things that I sort of do and don't
do I mean you may have heard that gettys
done this deal with Flickr to license
people's images I don't want any part of
it because for me as someone who's
already getting licensing deals from
companies I basically would lose out
massively I've just licensed a load of
images to del to use a point of sale
worldwide and I got quite a good payment
out of it if that happens we get e I
would have got a fraction of that money
and also for me it's quite nice because
I actually get to negotiate with the
client well the sort of kind of design
agency and also I don't do creative
commons either because although we're
quite like the idea of it there are sort
of nonprofit organizations whose we
force I don't agree with Jill Creative
Commons is where someone can take what
you do I just think I'd rather people
just ask and people ask me to use my
images all the time for free and I let
them and this is protecting your work
against theft as well it's like a real
hot topic of a lot of flickr users and
people say what do you do to stop people
using your work like taking and using
about your permission I'm like well
nothing you know people are going to
steal it you put stuff on the internet
people are going to take it end of story
it really doesn't bother me so but
people have developed a few kind of
strategies to deal with this on flickr
and they've kind of shot themselves in
the foot one of the obvious ones is only
up your upload your images of 500 x 500
because that's a flick displays them
therefore people will be under still
larger versions trouble is when flickr
changed their design layout now all the
little pictures appear like this and
they're not going to look as good
conversely when you look at the slide
show you just get these little images
floating in the middle and the thing is
is flickers going to be around for a
long time and basically as we sort of
moving to the area like high resolution
screens like what's on the iphone for
this kind of old
tents going to start to look very crap
so my whole thing is no upload your
images as high as resolutions you can
just just don't worry about it and also
the other thing is is one of the my real
big bug bears is people who watermark
their images so do you think that image
would have been as popular if I'd done
that to it and like you sometimes get
people who just like put it across a
mini but you actually just rec'd you've
actually just wrecked it it's like I
don't know it's like having the google
homepage and inputting a diagonal thing
across it in red going copyright of
googling it's just like it's bonkers to
me and I think I've actually managed to
get through my talk all in time so
basically what's going to happen now is
we're going to do a Q&amp;amp;A think and
there'll be a slideshow in the
background so i hope i didn't speed up
too much towards the end oh do I
recognize you we met before another guy
in the brown hoodie you ya know we ever
met ok I just kind of recognize your
face obviously not ok so we're going to
take you a name and we're gonna use the
mic so everyone can hear and we're also
videotaping this as we're gonna upload
it on vixen for those who might have
missed the talk does anyone have a
question so so you talked a lot about
Flickr and you know how you use it so
what features on flickr would you like
to see most improved or just like mostly
improve i'd like to see the user list
improved because what's the user list
yeah don't exist that's what I'm saying
you know how long so on Twitter where
you have like lists that's so you can
basically I can make a list of Brighton
people I can make a list of San
Francisco people or can make a list of
photographers can make ins to clients
and I do that on facebook as well with
Flicka you've got his contacts family
and friends so what I do is I use family
as people I've met in the real world so
you'll be added to that now and if we
have a chat layer some of you friends
people who I really like their
photographs
access is kind of other but admitting
I've gotta go through that and color a
bit because there is some sort of like
chat that needs removing but yeah
definitely lists facial recognition
would be nice as well because I i
religiously tag everything like geo
tagged it I tagged it with people that
was a great feature as well aware that
was introduced but it would be nice now
that I've drawn boxes around people's
faces if somehow it go through that go
right this person is Sarah married if my
wife the next time I upload it and go
this is her they could go through the
part by realize obviously going through
the billions of photo gospel occurs got
that would be quite computationally
heavy even with my limited knowledge of
these things have you ever tried the
facial recognition on picasa no I have
not by heard it does it I did I did go
to the thing is is like I've learned a
lot and I think Terms of Service can
sound really scary especially the part
about we could have the right to
redistribute your work worldwide but you
have to because you got a website and
you are sort of you know we just bein
stuff that the picasa Terms of Service
scared me a bit so we didn't that blowed
stuff but I think I should and I will
start getting into it but yeah I don't
know how much is there a community with
picasa yeah does it quite like yeah but
i haven't really checked out for ages
but as far as i understand it picasa is
kind of like an application to organize
your photographs and then the other half
of it is then it has this kind of like
it puts a bit online and it's visible if
you want it to be so whereas flickers
come on the other way around
busy like of mine or of other people's
Oh God um I don't know you know because
it's so I've got is I don't have one
particular fact actually I did there is
one the lug warmer have you seen that I
just I just shown a minute I can just
show you
so I think that is one of my probably
one of my favorites you can't doesn't
that screen doesn't do it justice
whatsoever neither does that one
actually my laptop looks really good on
there if you google lomo kept nobody
loves me and then you can see the image
i think that one that is I wouldn't I
still wouldn't say that's my favorite I
don't know that's really bad isn't it um
I just think it kind of catches a moment
in the scene in the landscape and it's
going to call this level of people look
at it and go you know what's that guy
doing he's taking in the sand with his
bare hands and you can't really see that
that's a beach I mean it could be an s3
it could just be like some really wet
sand is this a lot if you don't know
where there isn't also in the background
which you can't actually see this like a
wreck of a pier I know I'm not one of
these kind of like really conceptual
photographers that's the thing is when I
was talking about the Loma Olympics it's
not my whole thing is this is all just
for fun and I'll obviously for a lot of
people photography is really deadly
serious and oh you know I'm gonna you
know as monikers driving down with
sheets or documented a guy who was
having his brain tumor treated and I'm
just thinking bloody hell you know I
just wanna go and take photographs at
Burning Man yeah so yeah my mouth Toby
tends to be a bit sort of light-hearted
I think actually the cover one of my
other favorite photographs is the cover
of my original book which has got my
wife's photograph on the front so I
remember how to get to that one but yeah
the portrait of my wife when we
basically we weren't we were just
friends at the time but she would come
down from London to see me all the time
and we would spend days together and
yeah I just think it's a really kind of
like it just it just sort of sums up fun
times for me so basically what it was is
we were just having we're having fish
and chips on the beach but it was like
really really windy so you can actually
see her whole hood is being blown by the
wind but we're still
sitting there in the raining fish and
chips so that to me kind of like some
duffus or wonderful moment that was like
that was like years before we sort of
sight going out or anything in years
before we got married but I think that
as well that's one of my other favorite
so it's like a real kind of like sort of
emotional kind of connection that one Oh
God Oh probably yeah that's a really
good but i think martin parr is one of
my favorite photographers of all time
I'm actually really bad at remembering
names and I have this kind of like whole
sort of bookshelf at home of that sort
of my favorite photographers but like
definitely might impose one of my
favorite photographs and there's a
really this is really bad you'll
probably know I should know this stuff
but there's that photograph of a guy
jumping across a puddle does anybody
ever seen this yeah Usher like Google to
get out it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter we'll fix it Google fix it Oh cut
yeah we go I'm liking google images has
changed when did that happen and good no
no it's google my own changed last night
i like one o'clock in the morning on was
there yeah that bigger yeah you can also
add that I mean it's just for me it's
kind of like um the imogen heap moment
but I think he kind of planned for it I
don't think he did but it's just like
he's literally I mean bearing in mind
when this was taken but he's just got in
just literally at that kind of point of
hitting the water but he's not so the to
the reflection in the and the man
is not connected that you can't really
see it on that screen but I'll mine I
can see there's a man
it I think that is a some incredible
photograph so I noticed you I can get my
stats if you will have a look at be
needed things do a lot yeah a lot comes
through google image search
oh wait it
and the other thing is I do is I make my
all my passwords like really impossibly
long and difficult to because i'm
paranoid if anybody ever got into my
google account or my flickr it could
ruin me so well honeywell so yesterday
seventy-eight percent from flickr
traffic-wise three percent from google
image google free central google images
but it's really interesting to see what
people search for so consistently if i
don't upload photographs you can see
what's like we focused people you always
look at i don't know why but vagina art
car seems to be a favorite and also if
you google its we dish girl is not there
how did I I had supposed Swedish the
right way ah Olivia and it's gone hmm I
used to have a good I had a photograph
of a Swedish girl oh there she is she
used to be much higher but yeah I have
weird things that are like get top in
the google rankings for no discernible
reason but so like I think as well
there's luckam if you google hell if you
do an image search for this is really
sort of sad for me to sort of know this
stuff I think if you do a google image
surf for her one of my images was quite
high or entrance to hell so there's
looks like a lot of heavy metal fans of
googling that the a base is quite a lot
ooh ah there we go yeah see that's my
sort of entrance to hell off um yes
I do get quite a lot of traffic that
comes from google it's quite interesting
you see how people sort of fine stuff
well
