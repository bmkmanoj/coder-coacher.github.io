Browns Stefan and I go back a long time
Steen set de guiche in the previous
millennium and since then Stefan has
been pushing the envelope of digital
identity ever since so ok Stefan thank
you
so thanks Mara isn't been for inviting
me it was short notice I happened to be
in a neighborhood at a digital identity
meeting by the Liberty Alliance industry
consortium so it was kind of boring so
I'm actually happy that I had a good
excuse to to leave today so I put
together some slides so and I had to
make a choice of course whether they get
more technical or to keep it at a very
high level so I decided to go with the
high level overview because there are a
lot of issues in digital identity today
that are not technical and that prevent
the the kind of progress that people
have been expecting five six years ago
and so too
so I'm going to focus a bit on those
aspects of digital identity so as a
result there's going to be some you know
very high level animations really a to
illustrate the the problems at a high
level
excellent right so so sort of the
historic well the traditional setting is
of course that
so this slide serves to illustrate some
basic terminology and what digital
identity really is what the objectives
are and what some of the the basic
problems might be and I will get into
those in the next slides so so right now
everybody has hundreds if not thousands
of relationships with businesses
government organizations and individuals
around them
so the terminology that has arisen of
course is sort of these are identity
relations so each of these parties knows
you in a certain way and sort of
technically we think of that as they
know a bunch of attributes about you or
specifically values like your age where
you live and so forth it could be your
bank that has accounting information in
your account so these are just attribute
values of four attributes of any kind
and in a way that represents how a
particular party that you deal with
knows you so that's sort of your
identity with them in order to to have a
recurring relationship with them you
write when you want to get service or
access those are the typical generic
terms for it you you basically identify
yourself and there are two ways to do
that one it's what we call self asserted
identity
it's basically here's my username right
and they'll accept that and let you in
and maybe they'll ask you for some self
generated password or some some other
Authenticator that that is proof that it
that it must be you now so what notice
one thing and it's so this is really
high-level so so but I'll get to the
point later that that in today's world
we use you know here I made my username
maybe Steph so somewhere and it's a
self-generated one and I have myself
generated password at some other
organization when when what I may have
to actually enroll maybe I have to show
one or more other identity tokens like a
password or a driver license and so
forth and then they enroll me and maybe
provision me right and and then they may
give me actually some kind of token
which could be a membership card at a
gym club right so whenever I visit I
present the token at later times and
they can inspect the security properties
of that token and and those are of
course also so this is just another way
of
firing me here I'm not using a
self-generated identifier or I might
actually these are also you know there
are tons of possibilities that's
important to remember that I may pick my
own name there then they register media
from that point on that's how they know
me but they do want to make sure that I
cannot use other names for instance so
that may be one reason for them to give
me a token like wear a badge and and do
at enrollment time some check at a base
credential like a passport so that they
know okay I can only get one username
there so you know so maybe they also
want to know that I cannot transfer my
access rights to my neighbor right so in
this case there may be some special
protections on this identity maybe also
the security protections around it so
that when they inspect it they can see
we issued that and it has these security
properties meaning it's not Stefan's
neighbor who's showing this and there's
all kinds of techniques in the
paper-based world in the electronic
world that we use to to establish these
different strengths of authenticity but
the ultimate point of course is that I
am establishing an identity relation
here I'm and wherever I go and in a way
if you think about it when you meet a
friend on the street the same process
happens right they have sort of account
information on you which is their
perception of who you are it's basically
a buncha attributes and initially they
do an identification and it's like oh
that's Marius right so and then they do
look up in an account essentially with
all the relevant attributes information
and from there they proceed to take
action so it's kind of a very general
setting so now the question of course is
with the online world it becomes harder
and harder to to manage all these these
different relationships with with all
these hundreds or thousands of parties
individuals and organizations or so I do
want to emphasize by the way here so
let's say here I'm actually you
in different usernames right so so it's
an important thing with regard to
privacy that we'll get to that how these
parties know me their identity my
identity with them that's sort of the
terminology we use is is not necessarily
the same right and so in fact the
identifiers that they recognize me under
may not be the same so if they wanted to
to trace or link you know profile my
behavior across all their domains that
may be kind of tricky right because it's
esperance the same is Stefan
maybe it's Simon brands so right so
aggregating the account information may
result in all kinds of errors which may
make the information of the aggregate
value worthless to them the value of its
hope all right so there are the two main
problems in when you go online and you
have all these relations with with
Amazon and Yahoo and eBay and and maybe
your bank and you name it more and more
government online services so when it
the first problem of course is one that
has been bugging the industry for 10
years and for the larger audience on the
internet maybe more like five years it's
one that's the single sign-on problem
right you have all these identifiers
user names maybe you have RSA tokens for
your for your company so but these are
all ways to to identify and then
authenticate at different strength
levels and with different properties for
your own needs and or for the
organizational needs so this is kind of
awkward obviously so the first problem
that digital identity management is
trying to solve both for the enterprise
and for the world at large is can we
give the users a very convenient
seamless experience when they log in to
different sites where they need to
identify and authenticate so that even
in the same online session you can just
seamlessly go from one to the next and
it all remains secure
so now you all probably have heard of
Microsoft passport which is what started
the discussions in industry really about
identity and so that was trying to
achieve two things one was to give the
user that single sign-on experience in
the other worse that's the second
problem which is sort of after single
sign-on elaborate a little bit on that
is when I have my bank here let's say
and here I have some government
organization here I have some online
social network you know they all have
information on me that's either you know
account information right like my age my
citizenship and you name it whatever is
relevant for them now there is a lot of
business value and security value and
personal value in an ability to share
that information obviously across these
domains so basically what Identity
Management is also trying to address is
can we come up with automated ways that
are also giving the user a seamless
experience for transferring information
that sits in the users account over here
to over there
directly or indirectly right so so
because typically what they may want to
know about me someone else already knows
about me so instead of me having to
enter it again it it may be convenient
if it if it sort of again seamlessly
finds it finds its way from my account
over here to over here and the other
reason of course
apart from convenience for the user is
that these may be sort of credentials in
the sense of this is my bank and it says
whether or not I have a bad credit state
of status and that's the potential
landlord and they need to know right so
that's attribute information that in
some way needs to get there so so
basically the two problems are single
sign-on simplified sign-on for the
purists because they're with single
sign-on is one form of the other is data
sharing across domains and of course you
have the same problem within the
enterprise where these could be
different departments in the enterprise
in the same building or may
in different geographical locations and
this is an employee seeking access to
corporate resource over the network
logging in and maybe this branch this is
where he works and I was visiting
somewhere abroad and he's going at this
branch he sees physically accessing a
door or he's actually logging in
remotely to a project resource over
there and so then role based information
may need to find its way over there
right so this is a very it's a extremely
general sort of problem statement two
problem statements simple authentication
login and then the attribute or data
sharing across domains so those are
really the two things now so what
passport was doing and I'm actually
skipping this here was really the idea
of okay you have all these account
relations with and they all have the
information about you to give the user
that single sign-on experience and to be
able to have any attribute data about
the user
you know flow to the access point or the
service point let's just aggregate all
that information in a central account
and so whenever the user goes to to an
organization or an Access Point or a
service provider right there was all
this so much sort of it was parties he
deals with of course this could be a
word document and a PDF file and some
project resource I mean you know access
point service provider it's the same
thing so so let's basically and whenever
you go here they'll basically it could
be a redirection but you essentially
only deal with this central party you
may not even notice it but it will
provision or provide the information to
the resource points as needed on their
request and you just authenticate once
to that central party so this was the
Microsoft idea with passport and of
course a lot of businesses it terrified
the hell out of them because they
figured we're going to be over time
we're going to be service providers in
with Microsoft sitting in the middle
sort of controlling all our
authentication relation
and actually seeing all our client data
so so that idea got rejected by a big
industry players and so they actually
formed into the Liberty Alliance in 2001
right so I guess the idea of calling it
Liberty had a bit to do with also
promotional value of hey were not like
there's Microsoft centralized monolithic
solution we provide Liberty what that
was kind of misleading anyway so they
initially after half a year it was
really an effort to try and and you know
mitigated the potential damage that is
Microsoft passport thing could do if it
would just grow and people wouldn't
contest it so that was quite successful
and and they actually decided you know
what our approach that we're advocating
is kind of useful it's more
decentralized and so so a lot of
companies joined I think it's it's
around 200 member companies and a lot of
the big players are have been
contributing or are still involved in
some way ultimately the drivers have
been companies like Sony Nokia Verisign
Nokia these security companies were
involved initially like RSA now if you
know it's Intel a well you can look at
the list online so so what they've been
doing is defining specifications that
that achieve seeing a single sign-on
experience in a digital environment and
enable data sharing across domains so
this has been quite successful so let me
get to it's called Federation and what
it really does is you know it's still
centralized I mean that but one thing
they said was you know we're going to
carve out a circle for each of us big
players that's really what it is so
instead of having one Microsoft that's
the only party that can sort of sit in
the middle and control all these real
authentic Asian relations so facilitate
ultimately all the interactions or all
of us should be able to do that there
was the first change that they did right
so the mobile operators and so forth we
all should be able to deal with our
clients and in a similar fashion but
they also recognized in the Microsoft
approach of course that the the fact
that so in the Microsoft approach
basically this party would actually
collect all the information that
normally would be collected by these
service providers that you deal with
right so so he also said okay there can
be many of us but we're also not going
to collect the actual attribute
information the account information that
that they have on you we assume these
are corporate branches or organizations
whatever and they should maintain the
the actual account information
themselves so what we're going to do is
basically facilitate the flow of
attribute information between them and
give the user that single sign-on
experience without aggregating all this
is account information at all these
places so there were two to three
premises on which they started to
liberate more really the organizational
autonomy so right it's it's a we're
getting a bit to what it means for
individuals actually quite fast so what
happens in a federated approach is
really that so you go to a party access
point or whatever inside one service
right so in some way it's going to have
to authenticate you so this is for the
single sign-on experience so so it's
simply going to ask the central party
and that may be done through redirection
right so it's going to ask who that is
and so so this is called the identity
provider in in this terminology it could
be your bank it could be a government
organization it's a party that already
knows you and hopefully has a strong
authentication relation with you maybe
you actually have entered into their
office at one point showing your
passport and so it it sort of knows you
better then maybe these parties can know
you or strong you know with more
security guarantees or whatever so and
so you may actually already have is if
this is your bank you may already have
maybe
that are as a one-time password
generator for your online account
transactions whereas this is maybe some
online service provider I think that and
right now they ask you username
passwords and there's obviously all
kinds of security problems with there
too so the idea is that also for that
reason it may be of interest for these
parties to sort of refer to a central
party that that they're going to rely on
to do the authentication and now so
basically I'm just going to use my RSA
token in this case and authenticate
there and so right and then they'll
basically just say ok this is Stefan
right or so so what happens in this
architecture what Liberty calls this a
circle of trust because but if I mean
trust is a very difficult word who
trusts whom with what and this is
actually causing a lot of the lack of
adoption these days and our debt into
sort of the breakdown of what the
various trust issues are and for users
and for reliant we call these relying
parties also because they're relying on
statements and in fact yeah so it was a
more terminology this is called an
assertion so or a statement so there's
this yeah I think Google actually
implemented this for enterprise search
there's sam'l to that oh a standard that
came out of Liberty and some other
efforts that United and there was a
sam'l one that one and now two dot
always sort of the state of the art but
this is really a language microp
language to package any kind of
assertion which could be a citizen of
the netherlands write my name or
whatever package them in some standard
format that can be recognized and so
it's called a sam'l assertion which can
have one or more statements in it which
are really attribute value pairs now so
okay so
so it's not it's not that that it's kind
of what you do in a social circumstance
often - right when when you meet a
friend and there's someone new with them
and what you're really doing is in a way
starting an account relation with them
if you look at it in the abstract way
and you're kind of like so who is this
person and your friend will tell you
when you trust them to tell you
correctly and so you know when this is
the first time that you're going to sort
of interact with this new party or
person that you may accept in fact or
any name doesn't matter you're going to
open sort of an account but next time
you see them again you know it you need
you need that reference is that the same
person again and so let's say you don't
see that person is standing around the
corner there so I may ask Marius who's
that person there that I'm talking with
as I can't see him and Myra swil say oh
that's Ben and I'm going to rely on that
right so so this is actually it that's
this mechanism but then fully automated
now so that works in in certain trust
settings depending on i'm the relying
party I'm gonna ultimately provide a
service to in this case Ben as a user so
if you break it down there are a lot of
security concerns that I might have or
might not have so to what extent can I
rely on Marius to tell me who the person
is that I'm dealing with art of people
that I already have account relations
with Bruce Marius obviously has the
power to say anything he wants and so he
could basically make me believe I'm
dealing with another person
and so depending on what the services
that I'm going to provide I may have a
big problem with that or in fact my user
may made me may end up getting damaged
in of some sort so so if you look at it
then really this this whole circle of
trust
no Sheena was sort of that was advocated
by Liberty Alliance and so what they
said was our it's decentralized because
everybody can form their own circle of
trust
if you're a bunch of organisations you
can pick your own identity provider
and that well right so the user by the
way so only authenticates once so in
this mechanism the initial one was
called id-ff by the Liberty Alliance
right so I go here that's I'm online I
go here they need to know who I am I get
redirected they basically say who make
this assertion maybe it gets redirected
through me over there and they say ah
this is Stefan or the person that I know
it's Stefan and so now he's being
authenticated because I trust this party
I'll let him in right and when I then go
there through certain mechanisms one is
cookies but there are other mechanisms
as well that are more preferable when I
go here it's possible to discover that I
have already authenticated here so
there's no need to again do so I'm still
in the same session so right so so I
basically as a user I only authenticate
once at the start of the whole session
and then wherever I visit during that
session let's think of the typical
example of the online sitting behind
your computer experience so you no
longer need to give so you get the
single sign-on experience for the
duration of your whole session now all
right so so the other thing that Liberty
Alliance was saying is okay so so first
of all this is protecting your privacy
because anyone can be an identity
provider and the and then they added a
twist which is interesting because as I
said in the set up if you look at these
parties you know when I deal with all of
those parties especially when there are
separate organizations they may not all
know me under the same identifier effect
if the whole world would know me under a
unique identifier we get awfully big
close to while we will have essentially
a Big Brother's capabilities there right
it's it's the equivalent of a national
or world identity card same identifier
wherever I go so they actually got a lot
of pushback especially in Europe from
privacy commissioners and so forth we
said you know what we we don't accept
these architectures for
distributed use for government to
citizen interactions and so forth and in
fact there are even problematic when
we're in large organizations when this
is is the an employee in fact that
wherever the employee would go that he
can be that it's a unique identifier may
you know may be problematic when these
are branches of the organization that's
that sit in different countries
depending on you know there's all these
this complicated legislation so so what
nobody did was they said you know we're
going to add add a thing that's quote
that's any call it pseudonyms so so
basically I need to go back here and so
so when I go here so I want to visit
here let's say they know me as s Steven
or as Brian's right not necessarily the
same name as they know me under here is
this central party so what Liberty did
was they said you know after
authenticating in a more storm way
presumably over here the actual
statement that this party makes here
doesn't have to be my name with them it
can be in an alias and in fact so I
don't want to elaborate too much in the
technicalities but it could be a random
number each time I go back here this
party simply associates that random
number for this party with my name
it says Oh Stefan over here is called
Donald Duck right so when I have to
authenticate there it simply says so
that's Donald Duck so let him in right
so so and here you can give me these
other names so they could be random
numbers in fact there are two ways to do
it one is it's a random number and here
they just pick a local name for me that
they already have and they associate the
two but the thing is that that celebrity
claims this is protects the user's
privacy and to a certain degree it does
because in that sense these parties if
if all they get is sort of these random
numbers here and that will just allow
them when you come back to say oh it's
the same person as before that for this
ik it's this account right so
so basically there there's no creation
of a unique identifier so it's so they
cannot pollute put their data together
and say Oh Stefan over here is as Brants
over there and this stuff over here and
so we can profile him and whatever right
we can just link all this transactions
so now of course so that's the official
story of four Federation what you're
actually doing with Federation is is
you're actually linking different
accounts by creating a correlation and
all this is sort of interning our
technical people talk about it because
because the first time I go I have a
relation with this party and now let's
say this identity provider gets
introduced and it also has a relation
with me and it knows me under a certain
name when I the first time I get I
started using this party it
authenticates me here it makes it it
maybe sends out a random number but in
any case what what happens is that it's
going to say oh the person that I know
is Stefan Brants is going to use that
random number over there or this
nickname or alias and this party here is
gonna say okay this random number I'll
use for that user so what has really
happened by doing this the first time is
is what what they what the technical
experts really call that's the
Federation it's it's a different word
for linking accounts so I have linked
because this is also an occurrence
relation so what I have done is I have
linked to accounts it's just that this
party doesn't know the the account
linking information so but this party if
they get together these two of course
they know exactly oh this person here
corresponds to that person there or the
identity right account whatever you can
call it so now so the active Federation
is really one of a one-time process of
linking accounts so and of course you do
the same with all these other parties
now let's look at the apt
yeah so now let's look at what this
really means in terms of trust and
privacy and security and autonomy and
all these vague words that are so
incredibly important for real-life
adoption so you know the the Federated
pitch sounds kind of appealing usually
gets a single sign-on experience in a
session he can go to all of these
parties that he needs to log into and he
only needs to log in once he may never
see the central party in that circle of
trust so very convenient secondly user
may get extra security right because
with all this fishing stuff going on
this could be username password and now
this could be as a one-time password
generator or something else that may be
more secure against phishing attacks
it's all a matter of degree of course so
so usually get some security benefits
and and you can also argue user gets
some privacy benefits or at least this
privacy doesn't get worse because these
parties they continue to know him as
they used to know him and they don't get
new correlation powers that that sort of
these what's the double click style
powers right that's okay they can
aggregate everything across all your all
your activity domains so these parties
perspectives you could say you know if
instead of having to set up username
password
enrolling people and so forth and maybe
giving them security tokens they can
offload all of that to this party
who already may have that so they quite
a lot of their cost and so that's a big
benefit for them right and and the
benefit of these user benefits that are
acquired so they may attract more
customers so you know there are a lot of
good aspects to this that it brings to
service providers or lying parties
whatever you call them and users but now
let's look at at the problems potential
problems and again it's just a matter of
the ultimate setting whether or not
these problems really matter to the
participant so first of all so let's say
an important concept is that of autonomy
which is how autonomous are these
relying parties visa fee
the central party and the Charter and
what's the user's autonomy
it's a vague word as I said so but it's
kind of the independent it has aspects
of privacy and and all of that but also
competitive intelligence and so forth
now let's start with these relying
parties first of all whenever a relying
party deals with me right
they put full trust in this central
party it can claim whatever they want
about Who I am so there there could be a
security risk so you have to trust they
have to trust this party with with not
sort of impersonating for instance they
could impersonate me and access my
account here right which could be an
insider here or management or or a virus
that has infiltrated hacker or whatever
they have the power to impersonate
anyone they want over here of course
Liberty says you know but they don't
necessarily know who I am over here
because that may be another name right
so but again it's just a matter of how
difficult is it to do the attack and
there are there are ways to get around
it if you're a little bit more
determined so so basically this this
party if you think about it it may also
let's say this is an autonomous party
right it's it's a merchant maybe the
fact is that that when the user connects
in real time this party will know our
users is connecting over here so it can
falsely deny access it can but it also
knows users name an access point so
which could be competitive intelligence
right if this is national defense it's a
police officer is a police officer
that's putting a note online into into a
register and there's some central
Department that's being corrupted they
can try to track and trace exactly which
police officer or secret agent let's say
is is is inserting information at what
point you know which could be a problem
it if it's a merchant it's like hey this
central party will learn all my client
identities which in effect if you think
about it this this is this architecture
the Federation is in fact the credit
card architecture
right so likely the credit card
architecture the the credit card company
I mean there are a lot of players there
but let's look at it as one party it's
just broken up into all kinds of
processes that may be managed by
different companies but there are
certainly some of them like first data
and so forth right that so they see
exactly which consumer is going where at
what time so they may have an idea of
what you're buying there so in a general
identity sense that holds to true as
well so so anyway so it could be
competitive intelligence it could be
security issues could be privacy issues
the fact that that it knows at what time
which user is visiting now so basically
so the trust it's not black and white
it's not like I trust this party with
making these authentication statements I
mean there are a lot of things you have
to place your trust in there right you
may trust the party with one thing but
not necessarily five other things so
from the users perspective so right so
this the impersonation capability the
False denial of access capability the
privacy or sort of the monitoring
capabilities that exist across the
entire circle like where the credit card
companies so they can get a lot of
valuable information that neither of
these will ever get and so in fact my
suspicion has always been that you know
that there are sort of perverse
incentives is a general term right there
for organizations to claim hey we
protect your privacy because we only we
do not allow these parties to link
because we give you them aliases here so
they never learn you under unique
identifiers but the the the other
incentive could be by preventing these
parties from learning that this party
has more power in gathering all that
information that these will never get
and so so now well after five years of
roll out experiments the interesting
thing is that a lot of these kind of
concerns have actually popped up that
let's say this is a mobile operator and
these are some service providers in the
mobile space and they're like gee this
now this party is going to know all my
client data you know it may not know
what I store in my accounts but
doesn't have a lot of other information
like the credit card company I'm not
comfortable with that and so what you
actually see is that these parties when
they're more autonomous that they that
they refuse to participate with these
bigger players so that the sort of the
roll out of circles of trust so far has
really been within the enterprise
because then these are sort of resources
owned by the company it's all owned by
the company right so that's not a
problem and sort of the slightly
extended enterprise and so the typical
one is a travel agency these are travel
agencies and this is visa so these
travel agencies they're struggling to
survive so either gonna say you know
what we're not going to play with visa
they sort of have to they you know it's
kind of either with that or we go along
but if that's if that's a mastercard
they're not going to play this with a
visa over there right so so the idea was
of course you know everybody then carve
out their own circle of trust all these
big players and they all basically get
some small players that are willing to
be satellite companies in that circle of
trust and if they're they're fine with
handing over all that power so so the
idea was let's cover all these risks
with legal liability contracts and so
forth and so it turns out also to be
very heavy to set up because there's a
ton of negotiations that have been going
on between all these parties in practice
to to address all the legal liabilities
so I've got when this party is making
statements what if what if something
goes wrong here and this party gives
access to the wrong person and this user
says I'm gonna sue you because you
leaked my data to someone else now
they're going to go here and they say
you made the mistake and so what
liability does that party have right so
these things also stagnate the adoption
because this party has you know has a
lot of power and it's and it can make
errors and so forth now from the users
perspective of course the other thing is
that do you really get privacy so as you
know like the companies like net agree
that that one has been brought of course
a while ago they've been rolling out
successfully a federated identity
infrastructures for the corporation what
that mean really means is right within
the corporation the
let's say a door on the floor at which
you work this is a Word document online
in some project file that you're working
a project you're working on and this is
whatever right some VPN access some
resources you access over VPN or to
email or whatever so this is the central
identity server in the company right
that's what it is so you go here and it
resolves who you are and maybe even it
sends some data about you here about
what what privileges you have and so you
know in an idea in an enterprise setting
as when you're an employee you maybe as
a user right there are lots of different
users again so employee is one user that
doesn't have a lot of autonomy when they
when they work in and the corporate time
and they access these resources it's
kind of fair maybe you know to certain
degree that they can monitor centrally a
real time all your actions and obviously
there are some sensitivities already
right there because some people have
legitimate use to to to be at work and
actually do something for personal
reasons there's an emergency or whatever
an effect obviously in today's
technology climate where people work
long hours so they have to be able to do
stuff in between from work that is
personal you know so there are
sensitivities and there are actually
loss as well about so this is the
various capability there but now let's
say you're not a different more autonomy
you're not an employee in work time
right so the the second step is you're
an employee who's in work time but but
needs to do something personal it's
already a little bit more of a concern
to you that this this power is it it
this can just keep a file with all your
actions right logged in here and there
at this time and I was in the bathroom
for an hour there or whatever so now
let's say you're a business partner and
you work on a project and you have to
access project files over there so now
in that case you're not working for them
and you or your company may actually
figure is it necessary that every time
my employee in the joint project is
accessing a project file
they can see exactly which of my
employees is accessing that file I mean
that's competitive information they may
see who are my most productive employees
and so forth and all they need to know
maybe is that out of the 50 people that
are working on this
this is authorized to make edits to this
document you know it's just a random
example you can it but it to clarify the
kind of sensitivities that there are
that have to do with the autonomy it's
the word that I use I it it as I said it
encompasses privacy security competitive
intelligence all these things you have
in the real world that it's hard to just
enumerate them but you know so if and
let's say the ultimate autonomous party
is sort of like you as an individual
you're maybe a consumer online right so
you visit the resources at Yahoo or eBay
and maybe you know they could start
asking you to log in more and more right
for different areas so that you're
accessing so you know so is it necessary
that they can trace all your behavior
when you're just browsing for what you
might want to purchase now so so there
because you're more autonomous you may
have more concerns about the powers that
that are in there to track and trace all
your behavior and let's say you're a
citizen in a government government
online and 10 years from now all your
government services are modernized and
they've all been right there you you
access them online may not just be
through your laptop or computer but by a
chip card with with wireless
connectivity you know it could be public
transport whatever way you go it sort of
and it would work like this right so so
so entering a bus is just an access
point maybe you know it's going to be
like your cart it sits in your wallet
it's just going to authenticate
essentially to a central organization in
government and provision whatever data
is necessary for the bus driver to say
ok you have access right I you're a
senior citizen for instance so or you
get a discount or whatever I mean these
are examples but you can come up with
millions of them in different
circumstances so would you be
comfortable with a society like that
where
there is a central party that can track
and trace all your behavior in real time
and deny you access to any service when
they want to well maybe not right on
Europe of course it's a little bit more
sensitive because of our experiences in
the world war where where these tracking
and tracing mechanisms have been used
successfully by the Germans so now of
course these if these systems get out
there on a large scale there are there
are concerns and one of the big problems
is that so in a small circle of trust
right it starts we did an organization
let's say so what it really does is it's
not well it's not be centralizing within
it's creating a centralized
authentication capability and
identification capability and yes there
may be there let's say different
companies all have their own identity
server right but across these circles so
if you have a circle there and a circle
there we cannot do for the user i I have
to when I when I go to the resource here
and then to here now I need to
authenticate here so I lose my single
sign-on experience and all the benefits
this is this circle is still a silo as
much as this circle is so the evolution
is going to be like in a credit card
business where let's say that's a visa
and that's a mastercard so I don't want
to have different right I want to do the
same with these I mean the silo is just
expanding at the perimeter a bit that's
how you can look at it so but to allow
free flow and to continue that growth
process these parties these identity
providers they're naturally going to
search to form a super identity provider
all they need to do is right here they
know yes let's say this party knows
mister from brands and I have some
authentication token and it it use it
says ok Donald Duck here Mickey Mouse
over there goofy over there or whatever
or aliases right and it keeps track of
them here and here this party may know
me yes as brands again so it's the same
problem they cannot but I can feather it
between these two and so then they just
basically put their account information
together and say ok as brand says this
is the same person there here he has
these three aliases there he has those
three aliases with these parties so now
yes
six aliases so it's simply and this is
going to be a natural evolution so that
the whole decentralized story is a
little bit dubious when you bring it to
largest scale Society wide scale because
there's going to be a rise I mean
they're those are speculations but what
we see now is that yeah there are
identity providers that are starting to
begin and people are like oh there's
going to be millions of them well yeah
that's organic growth right so the
reality is over time some of them will
be more successful they have strong
authentication relations relying parties
feel more comfortable with relying on
them better security and so forth so
they're going to naturally pick some of
them and it's going to be acquisition of
these identity providers could all be in
the next 20 years whatever let's say
right and it's going to be some
powerhouses like the the ones we have
today like XE om and so forth that no
one has heard of their natural parties
of course to be identity providers the
more they know about you already and you
know so so whereas we built society it
gets kind of scary what the implications
are so because these powers the central
surveillance powers impersonation powers
false denial of access powers are are
there for both users and relying parties
and whether or not that's a problem it's
also a matter of scale you may not worry
when it's a lightweight service you give
here but but for strong for for very
sensitive services you may definitely
worried about these capabilities and and
you know the more players are in the
circle of trust you may get more
concerns so it's all of a matter of
skill as well now so here's something
that that that today is called user
centric identity and how much time do I
have left
it's 10:50 so five minutes so you know
the idea is is really one that it's it's
sort of the cards in your wallet right
it's a metaphor that that many have been
using but if you think about it the
cards have my wallet our statements made
by central parties about me that that I
show to others so it's it could be an
identifier right which is a passport it
could it could have all kinds of other
information on it health insurance cards
driver licenses and so forth and so you
can think of all these statements that
the central party might make as there
are assertions as I said statements
claims there's different language for it
now so instead of these statements going
in real time either directly or
redirected through me to a party over
there it's actually you know possible to
involve me more as a user right and the
ultimate involvement of course is is
kind of the idea what you get when you
have the cards in your wallet
paper-based credentials which is that
when I need to show information over
here there is no central party involved
at that very moment I just pull out a
card whether whatever the information is
they need to see it comes from this
party they can see the authenticity in
the in of the statement and I present it
at any time I can pick I can show the
data that I need to show so you notice
it's an offline transaction and in fact
if you with the plastic cards if when
when I wave my card and you need to know
I live in Quebec you look at it okay
Quebec there's no sort of audit trail
that stays behind necessarily that that
allows the these parties even if they
get together to track and trace all my
interactions on that basis right so of
course we have very limited cards today
because they're kind of expensive and
and so forth but in a digital world it's
possible to do the
say mechanism and of course this traces
back to the roots of when I worked a
digit case where Marius worked as well
much longer than I did
it's that's why I brought in the credit
card example as well like in the
payments payments are really a matter of
assertions or claims that are made by
central parties about value and think
about it it's so identity digital
identity is really any kind of assertion
about a Nana about a party a user a chip
for an application whatever it is it's a
very general thing and so like in the
payments business you have lots and lots
of different payment mechanisms so you
have these sort of centralized ones that
resolve everything in the backend like
credit cards debit cards and all you do
is sort of authenticate once so they
know who you are and then data flows in
the backend right that's what it is in
that case it flows from one account to
another it's an attribute here that says
$50 that gets decremented and here it
gets incremented by 50 and transferred
$50 has taken place so that's
effectively once they they have linked
up the accounts they can transfer in the
backend attribute information about me
and its account balance information so
if you look in the real world we have in
the payments analogy we have cash right
so which I take out of an account and I
can store it and I can present it
anywhere where I want it son for joy
it's self authenticating and it gives me
privacy because there's actually nothing
in the in the coins that that can be
linked back to my identity identifier
let alone a unique global unique
identifier so it's possible to do all
these things digitally and mimic for the
relying parties and sort of the identity
providers the the same exactly the same
experience because ultimately this is
just the data flow issue right they need
to receive as assertions from this party
about me and they have data about me
already in their account and so how that
data gets there whether it's
matter of I sort of authenticate and now
my accounts are linked up and they can
transfer directly or directed through me
with all the problems that it gives rise
to or whether that data actually flows
really through me and I can even store
it in long lift form and I can when I
show it there is no linkage there aren't
there's no common identifiers they get
what they want exactly the same
information so their experience carry me
if can remain the same if you build it
properly so of course what it means is
there's more and this is why this hasn't
happened in the real world and it's very
frustrating for for people like me who's
worked way too long on this stuff that
what's been holding back the the
adoption is that the federated mechanism
does not require smart smart client you
can do this and it's been designed for
that with a zero footprint browser I
mean there are weaknesses with it but
you know it would fish ever more
sophisticated fishing your tax man in
real time but you can do these
redirections and post data and whatever
with standard browsers so people don't
like running Java applets or let alone
installing executables and so forth so
goes the argument at least so whereas
this requires client intelligence of
course now in contrast to when we were
suffering at struggling at any case now
these devices are all out there and
they're powerful to do all the
sophisticated processing and you know to
become a first-class or a citizen that's
ultimately what I saw what I end up with
is is to be a real participant in in an
identity infrastructure you you know it
you cannot have all the rights that that
that may matter or do matter without
also have being intelligent right I mean
it's it's it's actually hard that's the
irony anyway it's if you cannot expect
to address these parties these
challenges in a way that leaves the
client literally dumb you need
intelligence here and you know so mobile
phones and so forth their ideal vehicles
and I saw we actually as a start-up
that's why we we have Nokia's in other
states and
Wester so if they were also party
contributor one of the main ones to
Liberty Alliance so unfortunately the
field is moving very slow and you know
but Google of course would be a nice
party to to because you control the
desktop more and more to actually you
know you could build this stuff in
that's very user centric Microsoft has
been doing this with card space which is
coming out I don't know one or two weeks
from now in the consumer version of
Vista and so my guess is that one or two
big well they've announced two very big
players will will come forward and say
we're going to be identity providers in
card space which is more user centric
but it has all kinds of problems that it
hasn't addressed yet and so it's
probably a Citibank and a visa and
they're speculating but yeah as a Google
you know I would say would be good to be
involved in this and and the whole do no
evil mantra obviously fits nicely with
something like user empowerment so I'll
leave it at that I have 20 more slides
as I said I I wanted to give the basics
I think it's important so
yes so basically the privacy the
question is are the privacy properties
of identity mechanisms contravened by
traceability at the transport layer or
just the ability to correlate data in
the backend or in other ways and yes
certainly that takes away the the pure
privacy that you could get at the
identity data flow level so if your IP
addresses leak right so yes so they can
they can may be used to link you that
there but medea so ultimately over time
you know that it it's not just at the
data flow level at the application level
that depth the privacy needs to be
protected it it should also be protected
in other ways you have policy and so
forth will never go out the window but
the example that I do give to make it
clear that that it doesn't really
contravene the benefits of these
identity mechanisms that protect privacy
is really this one today
you can pay with cash or credit card
when you go to a brick-and-mortar store
now when you pay with cash the fact that
the merchants may have digital camera
hanging above the counter does that
imply that paying by credit by cash no
longer gives you more privacy than
paying by credit card no because you
know if you look at the sort of the
attack model then in the cash model with
the digital cameras to monitor all your
actions there's a lot of work that has
to be done there are uncertainties or
error-prone
multiple parties have to be involved
that may not want to be involved whereas
in the credit card model all the linking
and tracing data is automatically
delivered to the central party right so
there's a big difference but so it's you
know
