so I think I
this will give you an introduction of
what we're doing and then we'll have a
discussion that's normally the more
interesting part the interaction we
started about three years ago with
global footprint network we have worked
about 15 years on the footprint but just
because it was getting very popular and
said we need to have a central
organization to take on the message and
standardize the way it's being used and
have has a very simple mission to end
overshoot now what's overshoot that's
the first progression say what do you
want to end overshoot if you didn't
overshoot is essentially the idea that
we can use resources more rapidly than
they regenerate like we can fish more
rapidly than fish replace itself or
harvest more rapidly timber than timber
regenerates we can emit co2 more rapidly
and it's being observed by the biosphere
all that is what it's called overshoot
so we would say climate change or
fisheries collapses or deforestation yes
we could call them problems but actually
there are more symptoms of this larger
problem of overshoot and now the point
is not so much to lament about global
decline you know for all these
ecosystems but then translate that into
something what can we do about it and
that's where the footprint comes in a
way of measuring where you're at and to
see whether we make progress too it's
where we need to go now let me give you
a quick overview of what i would like to
cover in the talk and then we can have a
discussion after with essentially i'll
start from the big dream of humanity
sustainable development what does that
mean how can we move forward from there
how does the footprint help us move in
this direction looking at some
applications how to systemically address
the issue of overshoot and then how to
scale up because this is a race we want
to win now many of me you may remember
the concept of sustainable development
codify you could say in some ways for
the first time globally to this report
that is now nearly 20 years old the
brompton report how many of you have
heard of the brompton report a few of
you essentially for the first time at
the global level the term sustainable
development emerges
we want to have good lives around the
planet and recognizing that just
conventional development wouldn't make
it because the planet is limited now the
concept has been used in many many ways
and people think oh it's actually not
that specific I would make the case it's
the most specific policy concept around
much more than freedom liberty progress
there are wonderful concepts but
actually the state of development says
we want to have wonderful lives like
development said like this is kind of
the big idea of United Nations we want
to provide great lives for everybody
around the world that's kind of the
driver and so United Nations develop the
Human Development Index which is very
materialistic essentially it says people
want to have long lives I like to have a
long life myself people want to have
access to education most of you have had
access to education I have had so it is
kind of we like that and the third one
is we want to have some minimal income
most people say actually maximal income
you know no buts the minimal income and
these three parameters then add up to
what the United Nations calls Human
Development Index and 0.8 is what the
United Nations called high development
and i personally know don't know anybody
who wants voluntarily to live under 0.8
it's the on average Mexico or Libya
that's about 0.8 for the average so we
can say okay we want to be on this side
that's what development is now with
sustainable development comes to
recognition that there's another
constraint we only have one planet
because if we didn't have one plan if
there were limits then we should have
accelerate development there's so many
people in the word that don't have
enough we just really a big project in
Africa where you see they really need
more resources for having better lives
so how can we have development that's
really the question of the state of
development how can we have development
how can we have great lives within the
limits of the planet now how do we know
know that very simply that would go to
details we can see the budget available
per person of ecologically productive
surfaces like forests fisheries
planned grazing land all added up
divided by the number of people on the
planet is to use the metric number one
point eight global hectares or hectares
that's about four and a half acres of
space that is available on this planet
that's all there is and then you can see
in order for development to be
replicable worldwide we need to be able
to produce that on a budget average of
less than one point eight acres to
provide all these resources right the
food the fiber to absorb the waist so
that becomes kind of this line the
threshold and we can say wow so actually
we want to be on this side and to make
it replicable worldwide we need to be
under this line so we can become very
specific and about the state of the
world and say that's where it has to
happen that's so we are calling for
thinking inside the box probably not a
Google concept but that's what we are
trying to make us a point how can you
move in this direction at various
countries have different challenges just
to show you some country names they're
probably not surprising this
distribution say wow that's a big
challenge now you will say about how do
you actually know how do we know how
much there is and how much we use
because yes you mean Development Index
that's done by the United Nations you
know they're reliable but who are you so
essentially our DNA so to say is this
research question we say without this
research question we cannot move
sustainability forwards and that's what
we're committed to we're saying we need
to know how much of the biospheres
regenerative capacity is used by human
activity is the human enterprise getting
bigger than what the biosphere can
regenerate and then who has access to
which part and that's what we're trying
to answer with the ecological footprint
now it's a good answer possibly not the
best answer possible but it's the best
answer available at this point we would
say and essentially it starts from
looking at the world through
a lens of metabolism like I have
metabolism ve tanned that keeps us alive
an economy is a metabolism and the
question like for the cow is how many
resources are necessary to maintain the
cow you know how much pastures necessary
to maintain the cow how much ecologica
pacity is necessary to maintain a city
the country or myself that's what we're
trying to measure that's a an accounting
of how much do we have in terms of
nature's capacity how much do we use in
terms of metabolism to maintain
ourselves okay let's look at how much we
have available our ecological supply
essentially very simply one planet one
planet that is covered by productive
ecosystems and the productive
exploitable ecosystems cover about one
quarter of the surface of the planet and
if you remember from geography the
metric system was devised was it was was
built on the size of the planet the
French 200 years ago said let's define
the kilometer as a 40,000 piece of the
equator they didn't get it fully right
but 200 years ago I mean they measured
it without satellites they got it more
or less right that's how the kilometer
was defined so you can calculate the
surface yourself you know the pr p or
square thing you know remember and that
take about a quarter look at maps which
is productive not the sahara not
Antarctica but the productive area is a
quarter and then you get with a current
population of that we are about 6.5
billion people now 6.2 in 2002 if you
divide that you get about 1.8 hectares
of a colada productive space a heck
there is about the size of a soccer
field it's kind of very
culturally-specific because I think
football field is about an acre and the
soccer field is about a hectares and I
don't know if that's very meaningful
about anyhow so but four acres four and
a half acres of capacity and then some
of you will remember you have a few
non-human species here around two I just
saw the dinosaur out there in as a
member there are some other species as
well that would need some space with
whom we compete these seals are eating
our fish you know how much of our fish
you want to give to the seals so so the
question is how much we want to leave
for other species the wild species are
in competition with us EO wilson who
brought the biocapacity biodiversity
idea into the public mind set and the
academic debate he thinks that about
half of the by capacity should be set
aside for other species in order to
maintain one of our biggest assets
biodiversity and he's very committed to
quality of life but that would mean if
we follow his advice our budget would
shrink from 1.8 hectares on average
worldwide is an average budget to 0.9 a
big big question really is i think
that's the research question of this
entry how can we all live well with in
perhaps one hectare per person and we
don't know and we say rocket science
that's really hard I would say done you
know we know how to fly to the moon do
we know how to live on this planet we
don't know that yet that's the big
challenge of this century now what's the
demand side that's a bit more difficult
because my footprint is spread around
the globe so then have just one farm
supporting me but they're little bits of
farms like from Colombia coffee perhaps
in or from the Midwest potatoes in
cereals so there are all different
pieces that are competing for space for
food fiber waste absorption open space
you'll add it up around the globe you
get one footprint you can go into
details if you want discussion or how do
we exactly calculate it but it's very
simple I mean you think about I like to
eat for example 10 pounds of tomatoes a
year or whatever it is now how much air
is necessary to Maine to produce 10
pounds of tomatoes very straightforward
same with sheep I'd like to eat so much
even how much air is necessary to
produce that much sheep meat for example
so just added up all competing areas we
have about 5000 data points per country
and year like the use from united
nations statistics just do this balance
like tomatoes how many are being
produced how many are exported hi Mario
imported that's the net consumption of
the United States how many potatoes how
many how many cereals have much cotton
etc all added up and then we can make
the balance at the global level as well
by
adding up all the countries the one big
calculation and then we get this summary
as we said in total using about 1.8
having about 1.8 hectares available and
some of it we may want to leave for
other species we say and then we look at
how much we use say wow this guy should
go into the real estate you know you can
you can make area out of nothing how can
we use more than what we have how can we
spend more money than we earn pretty
simple you know for some so so like we
can cut trees at twice the rate that
they regenerate that would be the
footprint of the products would be
double as big as the area of the forest
that makes sense so that the overshoot
would be factored too so we twice as big
globally we see now an overshoot of
about twenty-five percent or it takes a
year and three months to regenerate what
we use within one year we could look at
the ratio I was born 62 have used about
half the planet by now we use 1.25
planets so it's a rapid increase and
we'd say yeah but hasn't technology
changed yet acknowledged has changed
since the ratio we looking at number of
planets has stayed constant it's a
different planet every year and we see
actually a change in technology that has
shifted the balance but not fast enough
so we have been able to make the earth
more rapidly productive than we are
using resources that we are outstripping
the ability of nature to regenerate
itself we're working with various agency
for example European Environment Agency
sponsor to our update last year we're
working with WWF with the Living Planet
report I have a few here if you're
interested we just had it launched in
october we do local reports here for
Europe where Barroso with the President
of the European Union he preside them
for and 50 million people wrote the
forward and very interestingly he said
we have to respect the limits of the
planet natural resources and that in a
report where we showed that in 1961
Europe used about one here so per capita
we see how much was the
bookbag capacity now you are abused
about two and a half years with it yeah
ecological capacity matters it's
actually not just a moral issue it's a
risk issue countries are starting to get
exposed but having a deficit where's the
difference come from either from
liquidating your ass your own assets and
Europe doesn't do it that much because
they have money to buy it from somewhere
else or by importing the difference from
somewhere else now the interesting part
how can that be used looking into the
future and what we did is looking at the
ratio again from 1960 to 2000 to say how
much have we used in the path that's the
past that's where I was born I got a son
2001 and the question is how many
planets will be used when he is my age
and then we took the most conservative
United Nations projections not the most
extreme the most conservative very slow
population growth those that the
moderates population growth rates the
IPCC you know IPCC the International
intergovernmental panel on climate
change scenario the most moderate co2
scenario most moderate and not even
assuming that much biomass would be used
very aggressive agricultural increases
productivity and still adding this all
up doing as if the various united nation
agencies talk together the overall
scenario that is coming out would tell
us visa but would use about twice the
capacity of the planet by then now
that's kind of the crazy thing in the
past in the past visionaries would go
far beyond what was necessary today in a
situation where our collective vision
doesn't meet even what is necessary
that's pretty pretty striking I would
say so we say actually probably may want
to move out of over she'll probably it's
a good idea that probably pays off and I
the problem is there was an interesting
study done by conservation by third
international birdlife international
they looked at what's the value created
through through old-fashioned
conservation you invest in birds you
know one dollar
birds how much value is being generated
they said roughly about a hundred
dollars of values generating you say why
are banks not running to that
opportunity you know one dollar invested
hundred dollars back I mean who can
resist the reason is that the hundred
dollars they can they get diffused into
the whole world everybody will profit
from the hundred dollars but the
investor won't so that's what holds us
back from investing into the future of
reaction there would be very good
returns you believe overall now what
happens if we actually stay on that
track like with money we can talk about
deficit and debt that accumulates
through debt we can do that ecologically
so the deficit has been growing as you
can see that's not the one point two
planets and then if we continue on that
track that accumulated debt so the area
under the curve so to say those who have
taken calculus and have survived it's
about 35 planet years worth of
production 35 years of production
necessary to rebuild that stock they
would deplete is that possible
physically I mean a forest has about 50
years worth of stock when it's totally
mature and then you can cut it in one
year but then what you know so is that
globally possible to be pleased enough
stock available to deplete for that
track and then when you up there what
will happen yeah we believe that's
pushing it we think moving out of
overshoot is much more productive for us
so really that shifts the balance for
the future I think one of the most
destructive concepts of the 20th century
that is still in our minds is to divide
the word for saying they're developing
countries and developed countries have
you heard of this distinction developed
countries and developing countries now
if everybody worldwide would live
Western European lifestyles they should
take one example will take about three
planets so it's just another current
population levels will be like probably
fifty percent more people by 2050 so
it's a dream that it's not possible so
rather I think the future will be
dividing itself and I thought about fair
or unfair just about describing what is
between ecological detras and ecological
creditors meeting who is using more
resources for the consumption than they
have available in their country who is
not so Switzerland where I'm from we use
about three times more capacity than we
have available in Switzerland wow that's
a but we are rich you can fight a
difference Egypt has about the same
ratio just more difficult for them so
but for all of them it's becoming an
increasing lie build is it's a risk
exposure that we not aware of I would
say like the risk of ecological apps
failing states that they say in the
defense community for example how many
failing States does it take until the
dollar starts you failed somewhere you
know Norma's risk we see that like high
et I'd be talking more about it rwanda
we see their happen they just don't have
much value on the wall street market but
that's what is happening so it's not a
bad is it possible to collapse actually
historically we have seen many examples
I don't actually know about diamond
jared diamond's book collapse but we see
it now already in certain states
happening and and it's it's avoidable
but if we don't give attention than the
number of lives lost the immediacy of it
and the and the probability of it
occurring it's much higher than many
other risks that we are looking at now
we can do maps we can look at where's
the footprint happening you can see what
has happened we actually have a movie on
our website that looks at forty years of
history how the intensity of the
footprint has increased essentially this
is a map of where you want to buy you
where you want oh sorry where you want
to put your shopping markets you know
the darker it gets that's what you want
to put the next moles and you can see
Europe hasn't really shifted that much
because it was already dense and high
high footprint and then you see the
emerging markets China and India with
large populations not so high footprint
but it's adding up as well now we've
just started with a project on Africa
because if you look at human development
debate or international development
debate Millennium Development Goals
beautiful ideas but devoid of the idea
of their ecological limits and that's
kind of surprising because when you look
at how countries are moving what do you
see is and any farmer would know that is
that our ecological capacity they
started constrain country's ability to
consume resources so like in Rwanda they
would love to have larger footprints but
there by capacity which is in in green
there by capacity has been declining to
logic state because of population
increase and so the footprint has kind
of move down with it at the same rate
and then they had a war then he seemed
by capacity declining more rapidly
because they couldn't attend their areas
very well and then they were able to
extend the footprint a bit if y'all by a
capacity for some time this whole
difference is food aid so wow you can
actually show even with bad data sets
from Africa we can show what any farmer
would know you know once you use the
whole farm that's it you know then say
Miguel a similar situation lost by
capacity per capita and as they started
to hit it they've started to get more
constrained and the Wiggles of the
biocapacity start to translate directly
into footprint and that's like a death
and life situation for people who are
just kind of that's less or more food so
we can make this connection very
directly or another example of collapse
just tracing history North Korea was
able to increase their footprint pretty
rapidly because of help from the Soviet
Union and China when the Soviet Union
collapsed china also was floundering a
little bit because of the resource shift
north korea wasn't able to get the
energy from the Soviet Union former
Soviet Union wasn't able to get the rice
from China their footprint collapsed
dramatically but actually even worse
that by capacity as well they didn't
have the energy to run their tractors
and fertilizers and I've just get to and
as a result that that contraction let
you some people say up to two million
people dying it's just a description of
what is not saying that's ideal on them
my question was wondering how HDI cracks
yeah we don't have good HD eyes on North
Korea because it's a pretty closed
country and people don't even know how
many yeah I do have here in some areas
it does in some areas we have had some
more rapid decline for example South
Africa we had a reversal of the HDI the
large extent because of the h.i.v crisis
so but but very much I mean you see kind
of the constraints that those countries
that have more capacity left that just
have more leeway to move around than
others they go into warfare or you know
like Darfur's there's another example we
contract or flu because it's a
sub-national region but that's what
what's happening at the regional scale
lack of resources leading to conflicts
and pretty miserable lives yep okay so
just to insights by capacity constraints
biocapacity can constrain countries
particularly low-income countries and
those first but it's basically I mean
what any farmer would know but just as
absent from the current debate so we do
as if we were limitless in our resources
and we see already that swings which
will be getting bigger for countries
that are like arid areas in Africa in
the by capacity you know dry dry dry
years will reduce the bag capacity will
direct it translate into lower
footprints which is not a nice thing
many people in the words actually
reducing the footprint not because they
want you because they are forced into
slower footprints and that's what we
absolutely want to avoid our commitment
is to best quality of life not to
smaller footprints it's just that
there's only so much budget now let me
get to two major conclusions one is you
say very self-serving what does that
mean for policymakers for example or for
us one is we need good measurement tools
that focus on the things that really
matter and sustain a build is impossible
without looking at how much capacity we
have compared to how much we use and
well it's sometimes resisted resistance
doesn't make limits go away you know
some people say I go hiking oh I hate
gravity
like thank you for sharing I hate
ecological limits here are tools that he
can live with it as this what is so what
do comprehensive measures help you we
call it the bed cover effect if you have
a cold night you have a cold head I'm
going to cover your head but the cover
is a bit small you get cold feet we like
redwoods in California don't we let's
buy more Indonesian timber and not cut
down on redwoods you know or we we don't
want to omit so much co2 let's put biol
diesel into diesel later now in Europe
they have to put five point seven five
percent of biodiesel into diesel as the
first step towards moving out of carbon
that sounds like nothing bP said we
don't want to get into palm oil for
supplementing these five point seven
five percent hmm because palm oil
essentially destroys tropical
rainforests and the last or a new chant
suicide right around you ten how does
you know what I mean monkeys ng they
would be killed by palm oil plant
plantations I think now BP is not able
to get enough non palm oil biofuel just
for the 5.75 / said diesel in Europe so
they Wow are we just trashing the rest
of the biosphere but I kind of trying to
get better on the other side we have to
look at the whole budget are we staying
within budget the second thing is slow
things first what do we mean by that
many people talk about low hanging fruit
we should do things that are easy and
give a good return first we would say
not a bad idea of an even better is to
think of the slow stocks because when we
look at the curve again I quickly remove
into overshoot what we will see is that
that's a very short time frame compared
to stocks we put in place today what I
mean with stocks dams roads power plants
people born today hopefully living 75
years these stocks put in place today
will determine consumption patterns for
dick
aids to come and at the same time we
need to do radical shifts so we need to
get the stocks right now we need to get
the stocks right today so anyhow it's
built today that isn't up to the highest
green standards essentially liability a
trap for the future or building more
kind of just wrote infrastructure for
cars possibly will they tracked us from
being able to live well within our means
so it's not just about being nice to the
poor Africans it's actually being nice
to ourselves are rebuilding future
friendly infrastructures ourselves that
are able to support us in the future now
by having clarity about what we need to
get towards I mean I think Paul Hawken
said you're very good at reaching goals
but not very good at setting goals and
so we need that okay what's actually the
goal we're trying to achieve and by
being able to have these measures and we
have seen that in Australia quite
dramatically by building to all our
projects now using this innovation to
reduce their footprint innovation is
probably the biggest resource we have to
move in that right direction what kinds
of innovation that means thirds with
good accounting is one innovation making
it accessible I don't know if you have
seen do you know cat minder have you
seen Gapminder org like for example how
to make graphs and I think Google has
done a two graphs visible to people to
understand if you look at this little
graph that I showed in the beginning to
make that accessible to people and say
wow you can make a dynamic have thoughts
moved over time how has this square
shrunk over time so serve people explore
what are the possibilities there looking
at scenario is helping people to play
God and say what kind of parameters can
be choose to move outside of overshoot
you know so you can start to play what
changes your fertility rates change of
consumption rates change so you can
start to seek to shoot into space or can
be kind of land the plane again very
essential that's really where I think we
need to move forward to it now in terms
of a doctor you can say is that just a
pie in the sky dream you know are we
able to actually make a difference in
the world we're playing that we believe
we want to win we want to get out of
overshoot
are we doing it right such a small
organization unfortunately we are
fortunately we're starting to play with
bigger and bigger players I think it's
the biggest game in town in some ways
being able to get out of overshoot and
we see the typical innovation curved at
the beginning we were in the dark ages
for a long time people resisting it and
there's still some resistors which we
are engaging with and then people who
start to understand a challenge they
engage with us they talk with us even
statistical offices people who start to
accept the idea accepting me they see ya
it's in our interest to look at the word
from biophysical perspective WWF for
example which spends about six hundred
million dollars a year the largest
conservation organization worldwide are
now using the footprint as their
organizing principle for the whole
programming beginning was just kind of a
weird idea now with the living plan
reports it has become so central to
their being but they say wow we cannot
save pandas without reducing human
pressure but we cannot reduce human
pressure without doing it in fairways
otherwise you just have more conflicts
so becomes sustainability become central
to their operation financial
institutions starting to see we need to
understand who are the winners and
losers in the future so whether we are
interest in sustainability or not
doesn't really matter but it's better
information to understand future
performance and then obviously people
already adopting it billion dollar
projects who are reducing the ecological
footprint so our lens is very simple as
a symbolic goal we say we want to have
ten nations to adopt the footprint like
GDP within ten years so we call it ten
and ten why because once you put
something on the agenda it gets
attention once country start to sweat as
much about their unemployment rate and
about their ecological deficit as a risk
exposure then we'll start to see
traction and in order to make that
happen a lot of other things need to be
in place we have to be able to have
successful business examples we have to
have excellent engagement tools with the
public we have to have academic for our
to engage with but that's kind of the
symbolic outcome are we able to engage
countries and these are the countries
where we like we haven't had 30
countries on the Hot List the red one
Switzerland Japan have already done
reviews of the calculations disease that
really solid information actually Japan
we're just starting with them the orange
one of the hotter ones I mean
Australia's a hot country just because
of climate but there's more interested
and then the yellow ones is where we
have pretty good leads and we could move
it forward with with more capacity so
north and south as you can see has shown
interest it's not just the northern tool
imposed colonial II on to the south and
say you shouldn't consume because we
have consumed but you shouldn't follow
us but we won't change our lifestyle you
know it's not about that it's basically
just saying hate is summer so much
budget you choose what is in it for you
and for all of them to sort of
recognized by capacity matters if you
don't manage it well will be essentially
undermining ourselves so with that I
would like to come to an end with the
just direct presentation because we have
some few little gifts for you we call it
the new Swiss pocket knife it's actually
my wife stroke she says you know this is
like compared to the Swiss pocket knife
Swiss pocket knife cuts through Swiss
cheese but this one cuts through Bologna
so you can take a few with you we also
say it's like a credit card because it
has the same size you know they can
carry it with you and it's so
interesting you can show it to friends
and they say wow you're so interesting I
want to invite you over for dinner so
some economists say there's no free
lunch and they may be right but with
this one they're free dinners so that's
not so attractive to Google because you
have good lunch is here as well so
probably not so much the advantage
perhaps you can get an interesting hiker
donor or an interesting date who knows
yeah and and then we have also a little
video that summarizes what it's all
about and in some of these living plan
reports they this has been the most
successful report in WWF history there
40 50 50 years old not soon and
basically summarizing the overall
ecological challenges with ecological
footprint picked up at at seven hundred
new story according to google that's
what we used of course
track the news stories and and and and
the way to engage that's the last thing
I want to say I mean in terms of
innovation just we're trying to
basically generate critical mass one
interesting thing that perhaps Google
may be interested in engaging is to see
the Olympic Games Beijing vancouver
winter games London they're talking
about one planet Olympics how can we
have footprint neutral Olympics because
we love the olympics but they take a lot
of resources and the idea would be to
engage in a calculator project where
people can calculate their footprint and
find out how they can reduce their
footprint and then pledge that
difference the Olympic Games so to see
if people can pledge enough footprint
reductions to make the footprint at the
Olympics footprint neutral and why that
would be interesting is that it's kind
of just a time-limited thing it's like
it's the competitive thing which nation
would get the gold model it gold medal
in reducing the footprint most per
capita for example in it because you can
make it interactive and just get this
message out in a playful way or other
than being party pooper and say these
battle then because you so many
resources no we like the Olympics but we
can do it together in a way that
actually humanness footprint will
decrease so it's a truly kind of a
competitive spirit for the one planet we
live on so these kind of ideas how to
apply these data sets in ways to engage
with people in constructive ways yes
panting
I a suggestion I think people are on
absolutely not
but I think
you can point out that result
their effects of the entire economy
amazing
yes if your footprint goes down
everything is effectively cheap
then
take that case the song in case that
you do absolutely you
as soon as you walk in the room mates
are making moral arguments of resource
allocation
thank you
I couldn't agree more with you that
would repeat the comment so people can
hear you're saying a tone your name
question traccia says essentially people
are selfish and and so it has to be in
their self-interest to reduce their
footprint otherwise if it's just a moral
argument that will just resist it and I
couldn't agree more and I think we had
very poor messaging in the beginning I
remember we had a campaign at the very
beginning that was paid by how was it it
was
Ontario Hydro Ontario Hydro made of this
campaign they gave us these buttons that
it said reduce your ecological footprint
and everybody was wearing a bit pride
and I then went to Chile to a lecture
and at the end of the lecture brilliant
little student in the in the end she
said hey why should I reduce my
footprint so that you can eat more
chocolate very good I think so what's in
it for them and that's exactly actually
now our commitment is not to reducing
footprint primarily our commitment is to
quality of life and so when we are
working for example in the African
context we helping people how can you
secure your quality of life if you
understand the global context you can
act much better for example we hope to
do the projects to admit Mozambique they
have quite a bit of ecological reserve
and so the question for them is not so
much they had to reduce the footprint
and say how can you take advantage of
the competitive advantage in a world
where resources are getting increasingly
scarce in the past for example Enron
wanted to buy all their gas reserves and
sell them to Europe because they knew
about the Kyoto market but luckily Enron
collapse before so that didn't happen
but that basically we have produced very
little value from Mozambique for
resources that for a reason that gets
increasingly more valuable so then one
implication would be focused on
short-term resource contracts rather
than long-term resource contract so you
can kind of increase your price for your
resource as you move along and the world
is shifting so absolutely that's what
we're looking for how can this be in the
self-interest of a city of a business of
an individual and that's what we are
finding with these applications
absolutely so let's have to question in
the back and then you go to you yes
yes so I want to play devil's advocate
for a second and someone might say like
you know that the resources we have
available are not necessarily fixed
because like you at least use only seven
percent of the oceans like available or
like an eleven percent of feathers and
so again yeah alright so an offer of
course there are the efficiencies in
production or whatever in utilizing the
existing sources so I mean of course
it's good to slow down like the footage
and stuff but what about like increasing
absolutely so absolutely so the question
is obviously a technology has changed
that we can also increase supply and
that's absolutely the case absolutely
the case so we're looking at both sides
not just how much we use but how much is
available there's always the ratio
between the two and when we actually
look at to what extent have you been
able to increase the productivity of the
planet we see you back on average a
15-percent increase across the board so
agricultural like the green revolution
has been a huge driver now that comes
with other costs for example need more
fossil fuel to make that happen or it
may not be less biodiversity friend let
cetera but we have seen a quite
significant increase just that the
increase hasn't been as rapid as the
increase of demand but we're saying
there five factors that you can look at
on the supply side how much area is
productive that we can and how
productive visit per hectare and then on
demand side essentially it's how many
people times how much would a consume
per person and how efficiently is what
they consume being produced so all five
factors play a role these are the only
factors to look at it I mean the steps
that we do I drink a nice additions for
including the
and getting what are the resources but
like I saw only things to reduce the
consumption actually I think all five
need to be addressed massively massively
and I see some bone ends as actually
meaning the in the efficiency side there
someone has to take advantage of however
we have to be careful that efficiency
gains are not just used to consume more
that's what happens I for example
airplanes I think the first jumbo jet I
don't know the exact numbers but the
first jamba jade was perhaps half as
efficient as the newest ones which means
we just now fly further because we don't
have to stop in between so we can have
direct flights to Australia for example
you know so we have to be careful the
rebound effect I think one of the big
bonanzas is demographics it's a very
hard topic you talk about because people
react but actually it's the most women
child and environment-friendly policy
that opens up new opportunities for a
vast amount of populations if you can't
wear that I ran fast enough a lot of
suffering will be coming on to the
poorest not on to rich people so so any
I guess so all factors need to be
addressed and in the back and then took
questions one there seems to be a single
country inside the box out in Latin
America what country is that I need in
the box yes yeah actually if you started
this card then you can find out and I'm
not allowed to say I'm not allowed to
say it in this within this country
and again the square is not doesn't mean
it's individually desirable it's just a
necessary condition the necessary
condition and yeah this part of the
world but notice yeah if you can go back
on the other side it shows the HDI and
the footprint so you could go with which
country is about a footprint under the
black line and HDI that is over 0.8 and
then you go Costa Rica 0.83 no its
footprint is too big yeah and my second
question is that you just mentioned
demographics the area why is it so taboo
to talk about reduction in population so
it's not so taboo to talk about
population control but probably there is
only one country that sets rules that
can potentially lead to reduction in
that is China everybody else tries to
best maintained there probably it's a
very interesting question raising why
the demographics I coachable as I said I
think that the biggest Bonanza we can
get is out of demographics I believe and
there's a very strong economic case to
be made at shrinking industrial
populations will be more competitive and
growing industrial populations this and
we can go to that detail but the morgue
refers haven't understood that yet and
that's at one of that it's a it's a big
absurdity that we haven't understood
that yet and and then I think it's not
such a sensitive issue and I think so
many things have done being done wrong
in the past I mean for example in India
they were kind of a like in for
sterilization or population control that
there were like implant like against the
knowledge of the women they were made in
fertile and things like that so it has
been seen as anti-feminist against human
rights and there's so many or religious
feelings so I think the messaging around
population has been just extremely poor
and it's still such a liability that
nobody wants to touch topic and so it's
just left to those who are kind of more
insensitive
to the issue and then all the discussion
here about demographics gets people's
hair kind of stand up you know and then
let's not touch that topic because it's
kind of it's too difficult to touch it
because it wrote affects my well-being
and it's easy to keep it a taboo but the
suffering it will produce is enormous if
we compare India and China I think it's
quite interesting China chose to slow
down its population growth and I think
as a result I don't have full evidence
but as a result it has been much more
able to fight poverty it's the most
successful country in fighting poverty
it has been able to increase its
economic productive priority enormously
as a country doesn't even speak English
like India would be so much better
position with its great in educational
institutions it's English language to be
much more integrated in the global
economy and and some pockets of India
are but China with the incredible
language barrier with the system sperry
of kind of this communist country now
has been able to turn things around much
more effectively and I think
demographics has a lot to do with it as
an example so demographic is very
important then you had a question and
then you're in the red mmm so going back
to your graph of the dots there seems to
be a very strong correlation between
footprint yeah what's the causality
there is that you're more than love yous
you can do more or is it
yeah okay so is there a correlation
between HDI and footprint I think the
interesting you can look at tues in two
ways at the graph one is to say what's
the kind of what's that what's the
underlying pattern and then the other
question is what are why are there
deviants and I think the deviants quest
is more interesting because a what is
actually the range of possibility and if
you go and look at sub-national level
you seen bigger differences one of the
interesting stories and they is for
example Kerala in the south of India big
about as big in population as California
and they have been able to achieve
longevity is like industrialized
countries and low child mortality and
and and female participation and
replacement fertility and and and an
industrial suicide rates to told us all
the industrial diseases they have
inheritors well on one dollar a day very
high literacy rate free education till
second year of college and they got so
successful that they're now working in
the Middle East and bring a lot of money
back and that's kind of screwing up the
account but in some ways so you can
actually achieve a very high quality of
life and longevity in those population
health on very little resources so
that's possible now generally we have
seen that increase in economic activity
goes hand-in-hand with increase in
resource use so which I understand
that's why I say being in this square
individually may not be the fullest most
desirable situation it's just something
we need to do globally if you don't want
to liquidate our planet so yes then read
you were next and then behave or your
first sorry very good thank you that's
very generous a question mr.
absolutely yeah we are a nonprofit
organization but to a large extent
driven by fee for service projects so we
have a very large percent of fee for
service project like for example
producing living plan report or doing a
study for the European Environment
Agency or working with the Swiss USAID
so the Swiss STC they are called to work
with African is called SDC this is a
development agency of Switzerland yeah
so they are examples of project that are
totally mission driven but people want
the result and we love those because
people didn't want the product if you
just get a grant and then do something
there's no public there then you and
produce something doesn't even reach the
shelf this reaches your own shelf in
your office in the nest boxes of reports
that we want so so the business model is
really important that in order to move
forward we also have income from our
partner organizations to help with of
public goods initiatives like
standardization maintenance of our
national accounts increasing support
from foundations for these kind of
initiatives the strategic initiatives
that don't have a clear product for one
particular client is that what and then
we are working with all of businesses
and actually the way we work with
businesses is we don't go to them to say
hey reduce your footprint we actually
turn it the other way around we say it's
probably a very American Way of saying
it we say we help the good guys we help
the good guys get a bigger piece of a
shrinking pie so we want a good guys to
outcry the bad guys and in the process
not reduce their footprint actually
there should be more successful out
crowd the bad guys you know so we want
to help the conversation of ecological
limits be successful for those who take
it on probably the first thing has to be
breaking taboo about ecological limits
and once that people see that as in
their advantage so who is winning from
that conversation people in the finance
industry recognized if we don't take
these just seriously we put our
investments in jeopardy no particular
long-term invest in stocks that are
badly invested but actually lose out
under-investing in green buildings will
be losing out for example or who are
other winners people who the defense
industry thing where are conflicts
emerging people who say we are really
serious about human development in
Africa if we don't look at ecologic
constraints with
just helping a family to survive another
two years but not systemically turn
things around or kind of help one region
at the cost of another No so we need
these kind of tools to succeed and
that's the people we work with so we
always go with the wind there's a lot of
wind in the word rather than trying to
do I'll pill battles against people who
don't want to engage so you in the red
were next and then mm-hmm powerhouse or
productivity and since you've a lot with
reducer Park Public Health for example
by the organic growing
what your thoughts are original
what's healthy enough what is it smaller
there are various budget constraints
that we have to look at what is
financial budget constraints we have
only so much money and that's what we
have to live in we only have so much
ecological capacity that we have to live
in some people say organic farming would
use more resources per carat produced
for example than non-organic that's
interesting to look at I think the
debate is not conclusive on that one but
on the other hand I mean organic
agriculture can maintain productivity
much longer so these have the hard
question if you look at it are we just
in such a dire situation that we need to
use all the agriculture agriculture we
can get just to get by and feed people
or can we actually think a little bit
more long-term and often we trade off
the short-term against the long-term
understand understand the costs but we
can think differently people always tell
me tell me no politicians cannot deal
with these issues they only think three
months ahead because of the next
election over there were four years
ahead if the election is far ahead and I
think that's not true politicians help
fund public projects like bridges and if
a bridge collapses three years after
it's built it's really bad for them and
their part the whole party you know so
they in some areas they can actually
think very long term but not for
sustainability yet so we haven't been
able to make the case that in the same
way we can calculate is if is a city
future friend are you building a trap
for your constituency or are you
building something that will operate in
the long run so so we have to look at
these trade-offs and that sometimes
there may be her choices but by making
that clear so sustainable development is
a trade-off between say why there's only
one planet and we all want to live well
how can we combine them and by
understanding the potential trade offs
you can overcome them by ignoring them
we just got to stay on pins as usual and
get into more and more difficult
territory yes you were next in debt or
actually I said you would be next and
then you said okay so yeah
this wonder if they're in companies that
are using a smaller advertising I just
saw a bumper sticker today offset your
footprint interesting with that carbon
fun organ so so yes it's being used
quite a lot BP and I think a
multi-million dollar advertising
campaign and we didn't get it all from
it but we're going to the Grateful
that's done where he said reduce your
carbon footprint so are they actually
tabulating saying you know if you like
in us we are working the number of
companies that one is electricity
company bc hydro they want to increase
their production of electricity but at
no net increase in footprint for example
so they use that as an internal number
we have worked with a waste company in
france to look at the footprint of waste
disposal and and voice management say
wow waste disposed is not as the cost is
an investment in being able to
recuperate ecological values out of the
waste streams that they're starting to
think about the whole metabolism so
they're becoming manager of the
metabolism we have worked with green
building initiatives in order to say how
much can it be reduced there's an
interesting example bedzie interview in
the UK whether the architect said we
want to live on one planet what would it
take and the day that they did a social
housing project on a small footprint and
afterwards measured how close did we get
and i think more important is not just
to say we are better than you we are
Saints but saying we're honest you know
we tried we failed that's why we failed
and that's how we make it better in the
future so honesty I think beats
performance from my perspective and the
honors is about the honesty of
recognizing this one planet and what
does that mean how close are we getting
this goal does that answer you quit we
have some more business case studies if
you want to look at about every business
use it slightly differently we could use
labels for example but that's another
people about this idea hasn't happened
yet maybe in a possibility yeah
two questions on the demand side yeah
and you tell me if they're related first
of all what's behind this explosive
demand growth shown on the red you know
um and why is the UAE how did the you
 you 84 miles yeah we always laugh
at dubai because they have ski slopes in
the middle of the hottest desert we
don't laugh as much at las vegas which
is about the same thing just there las
vegas is around the world people are
wealthy and they can just build whatever
they want so i think new days as
legitimate building ski slopes as las
vegas is to build water oasis like just
so so just energy's cheap so they cool
the under cows and energy is a big part
of it wealth needs to be able to
purchase things from other places do you
see the growth and the growth here I
mean to a large extent all the trim
population is a big driver everything we
want to consume or actually here we look
at not so much increase in energy it's
basically flat per capita consumption of
nearly and then population is still
increasing so you can't say it's
populations just that happens to curl
like correlated similar management per
capita not increasing that much a
footprint because of efficiency gain so
we may be able to get a little bit more
yeah so so that's why we thing I mean
the measurement is really important what
would it cost to put GDP into 10
countries I think the 10 crunches will
have critical mass and once this is on
people's kind of radar screen our
activities would become fundamentally
different you know once you recognize
what is this really it's not just kind
of something nice moral to have but it's
actually as a risk that we as a country
are exposed to we believe it takes about
one hundred million dollars now is that
a lot I think actually not really in
France in France there are seven
thousand people working in GDP just for
friends that's a budget of a bad seven
hundred million dollars a year you know
and it's important measure it's an
important measure I'm not arguing that
we are 15 people right now we are
growing about at fifty percent a year 15
people now and two of the people one and
a half
actually are dedicated to look at the
National Accounts 450 countries you know
ridiculous ridiculous and we use of
course we use data from united nations
and all that so that's kind of some pre
work that has been done by others but it
would take so little and what would it
investment what we have to turn around
we looked at four and that's something
we want to do more how much invest and
how much of word gdp would we start to
have to invest to kind of bend the curve
like the mill and development goals I
don't know if I'm familiar with those
people say about 0.7 percent of where
gdp would need to be invested to make
them happen now this probably takes a
little bit more because it's more
comprehensive than Millennium
Development Goals we think between two
and ten percent of something so it's in
that five trillion dollar range a year
of investments and I call them
investments because they're not lost
money they actually would generate more
benefits than they cost just we have to
find structures that some of the
benefits go back to the investors so it
could be private and public investments
so with a hundred million dollars of
investment it's established as in the
world which doesn't see that much it's
less than a military airplane we hope to
catalyze five trillion dollars worth of
investments a year into the right
direction that's a pretty high return on
investment per dollar now okay perhaps
our probability of succeeding maybe ten
percent I hope actually higher but even
if that that discount of just ten
percent of that ratio still huge impact
that you can have they're just bringing
the information to people's attention
and I think that's right Google is
interesting for us because you are
working on information making
information accessible interesting and
not just as a moral argument but so
people can start to play with it and
start to see why is it relevant to
themselves I sometimes use an experiment
in lecture I bring a balloon and I blow
a balloon and say is bigger always
better and blow it up o you who rate
nothing has happened so far it shouldn't
we have some more chocolate you know and
the interesting part is actually people
who sit close they'll sit there with
grim faces you know oh my god what's
happening and people in the back they
got up just laughter heads off you know
and the interesting part so if this is
everybody has
to the same information everybody is
exactly the information about the
relevance of the same information is
different to people so it's not about
information per se it's to make the
information relevant to people i think
with our friend at cha cha ker would we
crusher said it has to link to people
self-interest directly have to see
themselves Indians it wow this is this
measure he sends for me this makes my
life life safer in Melbourne for example
they had huge water crises still have
because it's a very dry area growing
city and 20 years ago people felt when
they used more water they had a happier
life big swimming pools long showers
washington car gardening beautiful you
know and then just hearing the war to
splatter how high know what could have
been nicer you know and now they realize
wow this is actually undermining our
collective security now they have an
indicator that says how many percentage
points are left behind a dam now Oh
thirty-seven percent loss yeah two weeks
ago it was thirty-six percent wow we're
better off you know so collectively when
they see we have more safe we are better
off and then the neighbor is washing
their cars you're undermining my future
no using less I'm better off same with
saving rather than spending the money
stupidly I have it in the bank I'm
better off I'm safer the same way I
think we can reprogram our understanding
it's not reprogramming our genetic
makeup we work with the people as they
are that's what we have genetically
biologically available but is it I'm
better off as a nation when we don't
have this risk exposure you know we are
safer as a nation or we are safer as a
city if it can be efficient I'm safer
with my investment because my house will
not depend so much on resources that are
kind of vanishing like the Petroleum
Institute I don't if you saw this big
advertisement balanced energy did you
see that big advertisement it's it with
all the oil undiscovered on the public
lands we use by 2050 will be using 28
billion million barrels a day in the
United States under the public land they
are 30 billion barrels of oil to be
pumped out so a thousand times Morgan
let's say this would be enough to power
15 million how cars and 30 million
houses for 30 years now if you just do
the calculations acta just a thousand
times more per day that's three years
worth of oil supply no hooray balanced
energy now we're just going to go on for
three years exactly as we did before and
then and then what you know that's all
the oil we have under public lands which
span I don't know how many percentage
points of the whole United States and
yeah so I know where I got on the side
track but
one thing we want according to the
united nations framework convention on
climate change signed by hundred seventy
heads of state including george bush
senior in 92 is to say we want to
maintain the atmospheric concentration
constant the long run essentially they
sign a bathtub eventually overflow of if
continue to fill it up so we shouldn't
fill it up continue so essentially this
we say as a service what we want we
think the next generation is as good off
if you don't have a higher concentration
as we had so otherwise we leave them
with more of a debt so that's a service
that we want collectively we said that
codified so to see now what does that
mean either we can sequester co2 with
technology or we say no no let nature
handle this you know how much nature do
we need to provide this service so for
all the parts that we don't take
responsibility ourselves to sequester it
then that's released to nature and say
okay let major handle that so how much
nature how much of the biospheres
capacity is available to sequester co2
how much actually is needed compared to
how much we put in the atmosphere so we
see as a balance a if you just say
nature's take care of it that's how much
capacity would be set aside and then
rather than harvesting timber we need to
leave it aside for sequestering co2
because they are in competition either
you can harvest timber or we can leave
the area for co2 accumulations and just
to show Nature doesn't have enough
service capacity to provide the service
that we say you want and then you can
compare that to say okay when we do
biomass how much air is necessary some
biomass applications actually lead to a
larger footprint see in the fossil fuel
because they're so inefficient all those
are very efficient so he started going
to see what energy options how are they
inter playing are interesting shifting
the footprint are we moving it so in
some way we don't advocate there's a
sequestration solution but just say
essentially according to the research
question we say the limiting factor of
the planet is its regenerative capacity
how much is available how much do we
actually use there's not hypothetical
it's actually comparing actual demands
with actual supply in every year said
that yeah that's a but it's good quick
question and there's actually a whole
research paper he want more details and
how it's calculated have links to IPCC
calculation all that
I'm happy to send that to you and I also
passed around this yellow sheet if you
if you're interested in our newsletters
which come out every two seconds no
every two months or so then just put it
on your email and then it get updated
yes yeah yeah so as well like you talked
about trade-offs between the long term
in the short term yes I was wondering if
there is a need wave in which you can
make something profitable in the short
term as well as a long term so you don't
even have to convince people like oh you
know this is in your self-interest two
years later or maybe like in the short
term paying at six months or something
okay so yeah yeah and the like I think I
think some of some of these
possibilities absolutely exist and some
of them you need to put in more
investments first for example like green
buildings may be a little bit more
expensive at the beginning but then
operational costs are wait wait hour so
by doing good accounting and for example
putting operational expenses and
construction expense in one pot you can
see the benefit earlier on or through
finance mechanisms where you can finance
the hump it will be possible to kind of
through finance mechanisms achieve this
outcome absolutely i mean these are
these are the innovations that are
needed oh you haven't even mentioned
link beast you know using waste
proactively like i'm going to absolutely
like first absolute emitting energy of
this afternoon which is in the
beneficial both in the short and long
term yeah absolutely and then there may
be some things that don't produce enough
benefits to the user I mean we are
driven by externalities and some people
say extra now this is actually best
cost-saving mechanism existing you know
and and if you take the stern report I
don't know if you've seen the stern
report from the UK essentially they say
each ton of carbon emitted now has a
cost of eighty dollars then you have
voluntary markets so most of the co2
emitted now at zero cost and then this
involuntary market I don't know how many
percentage point of the overall co2
emissions from fossil fuel that is
traded at between eight and twelve
dollars so even in these markets it's 10
let nfo less than the actual costs so
even in the best case of the voluntary
market it's still a distortion of factor
10 10 x marks analogies and next now
should be forced
more than the price ten times bigger
than the price itself so there is there
are miss incentives now massive miss
incentives that that that subsidize bad
behavior in terms of climate or
sustainability so as I don't think the
structure right now is fully there that
all the sustainability projects will win
out on their own but some are and we
need to do them symbolically and to show
technological advances that are possible
absolutely but is so that's why we think
we also need a social contract then but
we need to show that it's feasible
technically feasible and it already now
economically interesting to get people's
attention absolutely very good question
yeah so in that I mean just perhaps as a
summer I don't know how much more time
you have but we are interested in
looking like building relationships also
with you particularly how to do how to
display this data in exciting ways like
and Google Earth the excellent example
could be populated with these kind of
informations scenario calculators or
people can to play with these data and
make the graphs dynamic and interesting
if that's of interest to you or you'd
like to help us in making our web site
much more interesting we'd love that
support in other ways that you see fit
because as I said I think it's a very
small hundred million dollars very small
investment some ways you know that and
that we could leverage so much
investment into the right direction
overshoot is the biggest game in town I
think we're here to win it you know as
people say are you a pessimist or an
optimist but i would say once you play
if you ask a football player are you a
Neptune is the possum is it or say I'm
just playing you know so we're trying to
play as hard as we can and I think it's
a great public probability we see the
uptake so fast in the world that
actually we can get this on people
agenda such an easy concept i remember i
talked with my grandfather 20 years ago
not because i was thickly smart but just
my grandfather kind of said about oil
don't worry about oil you know we always
will have 30 or 40 years worth of oil on
the ground that's a que se how is that
possible i mean there's a limited amount
isn't it less and less and less and less
you know so we kind of have these
concepts are we can invent our boys out
of resources they don't really exist
whatever and now we see oh my god i
don't formally with limits to growth re
familiar ability gross computer geek
city or your
obviously go back to that book 1972 they
just rough standard runs whatever and
they actually didn't say the word would
come to an end as people claim that it
the show curves and say in the mid of
the 21st century there will be a
downturn if you just stay on the same
track now if you look at all the climate
research if you look at these curves
that we shirt here if you looked at the
oil p curves even from shale they all
show the same kind of that turns the
same time range there's kind of
interesting how these simple truths we
haven't been able to communicate well
wanting to accept and I think it's a
psychological question how can we make
it accessible thus I think right google
is so beautiful in some ways make
information attractive and interesting
people can explore themselves rather
than hitting people with the moral stick
I'm a more or less by burst I like to
hit people and say you're wrong but some
I not so inviting and so providing
information accessible ways that's
really I think key to the transformation
and sir that's why I'm excited to be
here so thank you very very very much
and look forward to your email
conversations and come and visit us an
