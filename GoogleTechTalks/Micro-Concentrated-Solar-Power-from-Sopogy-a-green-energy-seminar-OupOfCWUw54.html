guys yeah you came here to here al you
got the other out so on October
sixteenth the great renewable energy and
policy seminar series will post talivar
key from inside google he's going to
talk about power usage and Google today
we have dr. al UN from soccer G he's had
a 20 year career and technology research
and development and manufacturing most
recently serving as a general manager of
coherent semiconductor she was the vice
president of sales in March and even
emcor port which makes up triple
Junction cells and solar free he spent
12 years at HP where he authored bill
and Dave's memos a book based on the
culture writings of hewlett-packard i'm
sure those are for sale on amazon that's
right I've got a whole collection back
there David University of California
Berkeley where he received a BS in EP
and
Santa Barbara you received this ms and
PhD and lecturers here ok so thank you
oh thank you he's John okay are we good
Tiffany we go alright alright so thanks
John thanks to google for inviting me
we'll try to plow through it there's
lots of interesting stuff to talk about
it's going to be micro CSP generation of
electricity heating and cooling and
seafoods works so today's talk outline
I'm going to talk about key takeaways
technology versus product kind of a
solar tutorial you guys are probably all
experts but when I give these talk you'd
be amazed little things like cpv ppas
all that just kind of get everybody on
the same plane as far as different types
of solar technologies and then what I
always like to do is as a start-up for
solar just really talk about kind of
bridging our product development through
HP and all these different types of
technology companies in the Silicon
Valley on how to really get things into
the product life cycle and I think it's
important may be interesting to Google
audience as well and then a summary all
right so about us alright so we're
incorporating 2006 this is really great
we're headquartered in Honolulu Hawaii
venture back really origin ated a lot of
resorts there obviously needed heating
lots of laundry imagine at hotel resorts
cooling for Hawaii and then electricity
generation so they came to the founder
Darren Kimura at so pudgy and asked for
one solution for all then so that's kind
of how it all came out and we do
electricity generation cooling air
cooling heat processed heating whether
it's the water treatment Desalle laundry
anything I can go up to 200 degrees c
and then this last symbol is just really
a hybrid of any of those systems so you
can do try generation from one system we
just launched our soap anova 40 during
inner solar a couple months ago so
that's going well and simply what we do
we provide total solar solutions for
industrial commercial market there was a
question before where this collectors
seem kind of big to put on a rooftop at
home and that's exactly correct
we we actually target industrial
applications and the reasons for that
will be will be obvious after the
presentation so why Hawaii I guess it's
a dumb question Hawaii's fun place but
very expensive right because everything
has to be shipped in flown in so it has
as far as base load pricing for gas
natural gas easily to X that of mainland
and much higher than in other areas so
that's one the other is because it's
kind of remote and it's expensive the
governor started initiative at the
beginning of this year that said by 2030
Hawaii wants to get seventy percent of
the whole islands energy needs from
renewable sources so really big push
pretty big bogey out there and then
finally tons of support obviously from
Congress Senate local government local
in the state of Hawaii that's really
pushing it so it was a good really good
place to incubate lots of application
fun to go to business trips with we
never have any trouble getting vendors
to fly out so it works out that way so
how do we differentiate so when you
start out at your startup you don't know
your name people don't know how to its
Apogee so pudgy what is it you know how
do you differentiate and so we really
looked at starting from as simple as
water heating generation and air
conditioning to how can we make a big
difference and so we really started
targeting distributed generation because
we really feel that instead of grid tied
and there was plenty of people that were
doing extremely large applications and
parabolic central receivers other types
of technology 50 megawatts really and up
I mean typically it's really a hundred
megawatts enough because it doesn't make
sense to do all of the site preparation
etc so we started targeting it's kind of
smaller anywhere from several hundred
kilowatts to tens of megawatts to what
we say and that's in the generation side
and then that exploded too can you use
some of the heat to due process heating
and then Erika
so kind of finding a niche but it's as
you'll see it's a very large market
niche how does so pudgy I'll go over
this and then we'll go into nor the
technology but the business works as we
really want to be the system provider
some people want a total solution which
is turnkey energy but we want to do the
technology's supply be the manufacturer
of that and then work with project
financing of course everything needs the
the financing to work and then local
contractors that we will qualify and
certify to do that that's kind of our
model so let me back up a little bit on
what I talked about as far as technology
versus product so as John pointed out in
and Silicon Valley many years grew up
walking through cherry orchards when I
was little and a lot of what
technologists in Silicon Valley like is
the fact that its technology people are
enamored with technology but at the end
of the day it's really the practical
implementation of that in a product and
I think that's the key focus of what our
company does what we're trying to do
with solar technology so back in
eighteen seventy nine Edison didn't
really invent the light bulb is
everybody thinks he actually made the
first commercially practical one that
actually lasts more than a few minutes
or maybe an hour in the lab so made it
practical and then that was what we will
people use four hundred years basically
and people still use that we go into
houses it's about twenty percent
efficient as far as electricity going
out and what comes out as light and then
a little while ago people went into the
fluorescent lighting which is much more
efficient but pretty bulky you know
industrial applications costco large
garages etc it wasn't till a hundred
years later imagine that that you
actually got to a more efficient light
bulb CFL and that's slowly moving and so
what I'm saying is that things move
technology into products that really
affect things in a much bigger way it
takes time to do that so commercially
and practicals really what people are
looking for and I think everybody can
create your own what does it mean to be
practical what does it mean to be
commercially available but
really the commercial available product
development is much more key to solar or
any of the products that we generate in
Silicon Valley than just kind of the
technology so quick to the tutorial just
to kind of get everybody on the same
page you guys know about solar you got
lots of solar in your parking lot Solar
starts with what everybody thinks of
when we say solar technology it's a you
know solar cell solar panel starts with
a semi conductor base silicon cigs
copper indium or copper total area and
thin films all of those you've heard
about essentially uses the photovoltaic
effect generates a current the current
directly concerns anything DC or through
a converter inverter go into our AC and
also ties into the grid right so that's
photovoltaic thin-film electric effect
the issues with pv or solar panel type
of things is it's done with very large
clean rooms right when when silicon went
into more of a 12 inch or 300 millimeter
we thought wow i mean how many
microprocessors and and transistors can
you fit in on this 12-inch you know it's
almost like a big pizza pie was a big
deal when we were in the semiconductor
industry but if you think about solar we
talked about it in square it certainly
acres it's not square miles and and then
you begin to kind of realize just the
daunting effective how do we get semi
conductor of any kind you know spin it
on spray it on paste it on just dump it
on it still has to cover square miles of
this to be effective as a real energy
solution and this is really the issue as
far as the the solar cell photovoltaic
pv type of technology and that I've been
in that at HP and then at emcor for many
years so why am I looking at more on the
CSP side solar throw for a lot of these
regions because of the limitations
really on the size and scope of Peavy so
since that's so expensive and I see the
EEI solution out there that you have but
a lot of people say well let's use less
silicon let's have optics that shrink
you know five hundred sons thousand suns
I think there's a crazy company in
Hollywood says two thousand suns all
that great stuff but but anyways it's
trying to use less silicon
then your hope that the full on 2x is
tracking the optics and everything on
top of that is cheaper than actually
just using the silicone underneath and
actually it works throughout the again
commercially practical and in all the
aspects of that so that's cpv so
concentrated photovoltaic again trying
to use less semi conductor for that
solution so then we get to solar thermal
again around the world you say solar
thermo everybody at least in europe and
asia thinks about these flat panels that
heat water or pool etc and of course
that's a big industry in itself but what
we do is we do concentrated solar
thermal and it's a little bit indirect
than the photovoltaic effect and that is
it heats up some kind of liquid genet
generally goes into a steam runs a
turban and then it goes into electricity
so it's a little bit more displaced from
that different types of CSP now we're
getting into concentrated solar power in
the solar thermal regime has to do with
troughs which are parabolic troughs
again Ray's come in focuses on a central
beam dish again it's a large this like a
large satellite dish again concentrates
at a point and then Tower which I I and
some of the other East solar companies
do that as well again lots of heliostats
that are all focusing the sun's
radiation on a single tower point and
these are all CSP concentrated solar
power then at the end of the day you
have a source of very large square miles
of collectors again trying to reduce
that cost goes into some kind of storage
again and I'll talk about more about the
storage goes into generally a power
block generator and then eventually onto
the grid transmission on that and these
are very large-scale PG&amp;amp;E you read about
certainly Spain is doing all these these
are in 100 you know gigawatt types of
scale on that but that's kind of the
basic CSP so why why CSP so what I've
shown here is hours during the day this
is the solar day typically and this
sometimes is the demand certainly for
countries like India that are quite hot
or even in regions of the u.s.
go home and they turn on their AC so the
peak may not be just during the day
hours but in the evening hours when they
go home it's still hot they started
running their dryers doing all they do
at home so that the the need actually
can peek beyond the Sundays all right so
if you look at pv the cloud comes by it
doesn't really store because storage
right now from a electricity point of
view is still quite expensive I think
that will get solved but right now it's
intermittent if there's a if it's
generating it's generating if it's not
generating it just goes down to zero and
it'll kind of spike out so this is what
we would call on the utility non firm
energy where you can't predict it in its
firm it's basically spiking wind same
way I typically you put it into a windy
place for sure it's not going to go down
to zero but when does you know
fluctuates and the amount of generation
and I exaggerate but it will fluctuate
and it's not firm and you don't store
the electricity because it's very
difficult to store the electricity and
there's people looking and working on
storage so the whole solar thermal why
people are interested in that is it does
give you a good firm energy and the
reason why that is is that heat
especially in a large tank or the amount
that you're running through your solar
field doesn't just if just because you
turned off the spigot on your bathtub
doesn't make a cold instantaneously
right so so in essence it has a thermal
inertia if you will that guarantees that
it's relatively firm until you actually
turn it off then slowly it cools down
right so so you do have some natural
storage and inertia and gives you a nice
firm energy and then storage then is in
the form of tanks of water oil and some
people are talking about molten salts
for really high temperature but
relatively reasonable as far as cost and
implementation so let me introduce you
to the the hurdles all right so I want
to talk both on the micro CSP but also
kind of putting on my technology to
product hat as far as making something
commercially available what are the
hurdles you have to do right so I'm
assuming that the technology is
interesting it's easy to implement and
all that and you've completed your
product design
which is a big assumption because
typically people who start companies or
technologists they love to tinker it's
never done that's today if you just give
me another month I'll give you these
other features right so it's always
creeping but let's say you have a design
freeze beta and it's done then you have
to go into various hurdles that take you
finally to market acceptance and product
introduction into the field and even
though we've seen a lot of nano sollars
and thin films and CP vs very few of
them are really commercially practical
not just commercially available where
you know if you're for example the tests
look great now you target a very
high-end not necessarily commercially
available but it has to start out at the
certain market and it's just beginning
to roll out so commercially practical is
really the key so let me back it up a
little bit when we do hardware design of
any technology every product and even at
Google when you're doing product you
mean you're selling product it certainly
has a certain life to it or service to
it starting from the concept what I
talked about the design freeze and then
obviously launch release commercially
available and then people large
companies like Google opala HP GE they
do this really well startups are
constantly learning this process a lot
of times reinventing the wheel taking it
through all of these so you're not here
at the product release looking at hey we
didn't think about you know
certification we didn't think about
qualification or oh they didn't know
people were going to put this on the
roof and when the wind blows on it
actually it pulls things off where it
weighs much much heavier than if there
wasn't any wind low so lots of stuff had
to be thought out and then end of life
certainly products run out of life time
is there another follow-on services etc
and these are again very quick gloss
over the life of a product so let me get
back to the micro CSP that cfl slide
that I presented to you earlier cfl took
many years but it went from a proven
industrial fluorescent type of
technology again people believed in
fluorescent lighting it wasn't something
where you go I'll trust this is a new
technology
going to be poisonous or anything people
understood it was just a large
fluorescent bulb twisted in any small
way and made it a compact fluorescent it
was proven technology but this wasn't
exactly something you could displace in
the residential area or residential
socket so it took a while but it's a
drop in solution and that's what we're
seeing with micro CSP this large CSP
desert type of applications solar one
all of those have been proven for
decades they've been running for 10 20
some 30 years and in fact parabolic type
of technology has been around for 5,000
years since our comedians try to I think
burn ships out on the shore right so
parabolic troughs proven etc but not
something that you could drop in like a
CFL into an industrial application today
and that's why we went with a micro
shrunk down CSP that has all the
benefits and proven capability on the
CSP but small enough where you can
really use it as a point of source put
it right next to your boiler which is
your current socket which is gas fired
and then just be a solar source of heat
that goes in and so traditional CSP so
what are some of the issues there you've
looked at obviously Ozma a lot of the
others startups are in in discussion and
news all the time very large most of it
with glass Ozma uses glass everyone else
uses big glass types of thing again 20
30 feet up in the air so you're not
really talking about anywhere near
residential industrial etc need lots of
land wind loads etc and in just a lot of
complexity as you start looking at that
certainly there's a space for that in a
market for that but as far as the
industrial application pretty difficult
so we got to the kind of more of a
Goldilocks effect which is photovoltaics
we thought was not big enough too small
for what we wanted to do didn't do
process heating and again didn't do air
conditioning as what we wanted to do for
the resort's traditional CSP too big
because you needed this land it was
transmitted away a lot of the people we
were talking about industrial needs in
India China or around the world don't
have very good transmission
infrastructure so that was out of the
picture and so right in the middle is
just right which is just the right size
to be big enough for industrial
applications be able to due process
heating and then also do solar air
conditioning so meets this trigeneration
requirement and has enough oomph to go
into the tens of megawatts for the
electricity as well again three
different types of applications here
efficiency overall you know the most
economically practical is really taking
solar heat if you will and just using it
as heat because that conversion can be
extremely high and for typical flat
panel when you're doing pool heating on
a non windy day it could be eighty
ninety percent you know evacuated to so
those are very high applications it
doesn't go up to the high temperatures
that we need but again sixty percent is
really good for solar thermal getting
200 degrees see that we can use guess
it's Kevin questions this is efficiency
based on energy solar coming in through
a measure and then what is the thermal
energy going out so it's not just
essentially a kilowatt comes in point
six kilowatt of thermal goes out the
system correct yeah so the question was
what is that efficiency and that the
efficiencies calculated energy coming in
from the Sun energy going out and
thermal and then so every time you do a
conversion of course you start losing
losing efficiency every time you're
converting from thermal to steam to
turban etc generators all right so very
quickly I wanted to get back to how
people use the energy up this is
relatively old data but you know oil
continues to dominate gas coal obviously
hydroelectric and then you have
renewable as what you all know is pretty
small
but the interesting thing is if you look
at this chart here kind of a spread of
us energy and the way it's divided up
you'll notice very quickly that
residential is about twenty one percent
more than fifty percent industrial the
rest of it is plain trains automobile
type of fuel use right so there's a big
big application in the commercial sector
alright so that's one right so that's a
great market now if you move it to what
do they need that energy to do if you
look at it I just underlined the ones
that use heating and cooling right so
when you start looking at electricity
because everybody's enamored with
electricity everybody in Silicon Valley
and all the people talk about generation
and grid tie and feed-in tariffs reality
is there's a lot more people that need
cooling heating refrigeration water
treatment desalination all of those
applications is a huge huge market and
that's only in the US and imagine a lot
of the non-industrialized India China
Middle East far as water treatment all
of those agricultural the heating and
the cooling are huge in those areas
alright so again just to point out that
that market which people do not
necessarily look at is a huge need and
displacing that energy really has a huge
impact than just electricity okay so how
do we add value besides shrinking it
down okay fine you took a big the big
CSP you shrunk it down it's it's much
smaller we get that well one thing is we
ship it flat so I'll pass this around
it's not basically it's we can make this
this is one of the pieces and the
parabolic it's a rib which we call it's
kind of a body type part so it's a rib
part that forms the parabolic it's
highly precision stamped but this is
just a standard aluminum stamping you
can go anywhere in the world and they'll
be able to just stamp this out so we can
go into a region we are completely
fabulous speaking of silicon and semi
conductor pv fab we don't have any fabs
anywhere at all we go into a region we
give them the stamps right they take it
they stamp these out they bend it to
form these ribs and they'll pass that
around and these ribs just slide around
on those posts aluminum posts to form
the your scene here
just sit into these littles guides the
post go in they put the backing on they
turn it over we put the front that's an
Allen odd polished aluminum surface on
the top for the reflector put it on the
stands and then it's ready to go right
so it's we ship it flat if there's any
shipment if it's not locally produced
it's completely shipped flat like an
Ikea flat box we assemble it locally so
we create the local jobs which regions
like India developing regions really
like that because it's not just some
really high-tech thing that just comes
in something that they can produce
locally Purdue semble locally and then
it's modular enough something not
necessary as small as the one in display
but three times as big as that where you
can get kind of distributed generation
scalable modular questions yes the
mirror is about a millimeter thick of
aluminum sheet it's polished anodized
and then has the high reflective the
protection layer on it and it's cut out
in sheets there's three sheets on each
one three of these sheets sit on to each
collector and at the end and I can show
you more after the talk outside but
basically they're just put on in the two
cowlings on the ends push the two ends
of that reflector down on to the ribs to
force it to take that parabolic shape
it's really important to take that
parabolic shape because that's what
you're getting the concentration when
the Sun comes in to focus on that one
inch tube so there's a collection to
that's one inch 60 inches of overall
space as far as the Sun collections
yes it's a basically a pretty flimsy
film and I film a aluminum sheet but as
you put it on and you push the cowlings
down on it it begins to form right into
that that shape and you'll still see it
out there all right so no transmission
issues again distributed generation
which India loves a lot of again getting
back to some of those regions what we
see the future is is really a whole new
generation of distributed power supply
power plants throughout the the u.s. so
again speaking of that so all these ribs
are inside turned upside down obviously
in these very inexpensive aluminum posts
just guide it essentially and then
you'll put the you put the backing on
the backing is necessary there in case
there's inclement weather hail etc it'll
snow itself upside down and see I think
I need to click this here so basically
it's a single axis tracking very simple
algorithm there at night it'll snow
upside down during the day it tracks the
Sun during inclement weather there's a
weather station locally that will power
out and say it's either the temperature
wind or humidity or some web-based we
can web-based control it and it will
turn it upside down to protect it and
the evening its toes upside downs so
that there's any do or collection of you
know special dust etc that goes on the
other is and some of our fields will
have just an automatic sprinkler
underneath so that if it does need to be
cleaned periodically it can be
automatically sprayed while it's in the
stow position again trying to keep the
operation and maintenance costs down and
just essentially be automated so with
this type of again getting back to the
gentleman's question early on rooftop
mounting cetera we had to do a lot of
analysis a lot of wind tunnel testing
etc it's really like an airplane wing if
you look at that people look at it and
go out this is an airplane wing so it
does have a lot of structural analysis
that's needed again you know deformation
obviously is the worst case is how much
can it handle before the aluminum starts
buckling the other is as you have
certain wind loads on it how much
structural pool either downward
horse her up workforce needs to be
calculated so that when they build it
into a rooftop they need to know exactly
it's not just it only weighs about 200
250 pounds because it's aluminum quite
light but with the wind and as it starts
pulling down they could be much higher
than that so a lot of analysis has to be
done in order to do to be okay another
the hurdles obviously is field testing
and we're just beginning to do that we
just launched the product we have
multiple rows again it's so PO Nova
whenever you hear a startup that has
soap innova four-point-oh that means
they've been busy for the last few years
doing 1 point 0 2 point 0 and 3 point 0
and we were just honest enough to admit
that this is at the very first collector
we made even though it's the first
product commercially available so we've
done various versions in the field
testing Hawaii has very salty air good
storms that come through that really
tests the the product we had to go
through just like Edison did a lot of
different films that just don't work
very well I mean aluminum loves to
corrode it oxidizes very easily and Alan
ah we found is that there's a company in
Germany that especially makes it so a
lot of research just to find something
that doesn't corrode after 20 years or
again if it does we can pull it out but
hopefully we don't have to do a lot of
that so rooftop labs then then we found
the mobile labs and obviously regional
demonstrations to be really key anytime
you're doing a new technology whether
it's based on old CSP but renew enough
where people really have to see it and
so all these are available and we try to
bring it to two different sites to do
that ok so just recently if you actually
live in the area we just gave the free
one eichler it's an old swimmin tennis
over in Palo Alto we just gave him a
free one you can go back there and take
a look at it's just a small eight-foot
collection for their heating needs there
but again trying to make it available
demonstratable and feel tested so it's
actually practically available the other
in this area as you guys get to know and
work in the energy field lots of
different certifications obviously you
heard aul for safety tuv is something
that has mainly a lot of European base
and then siiii certification obviously
is uh these take a long time in fact
when you're doing something as new as we
do siiii and TV well TV doesn't even
have a certification for us so we're
part of their committee to write a
certification for CSP siiii all of their
test lab assumed yours is only four foot
panel sections because all they do is PV
so we've come in with our section they
don't test it so we have to work with
them on the equipment so just a lot of
little hurdles when you're working with
startups when you work trying to get
down to two cents per kilowatt-hour
there's all these little hurdles that
you have to get through besides the
obvious so ramping up manufacturing
again initially what we thought was this
is really easy to make right really easy
to assemble in fact we were doing in our
shop floor and putting it in but what we
found out is if you don't have the right
jigs to do it when you turn it around
there's a lot of moment of freedom there
and it'll actually become this kind of
potato chip thing because even though
you've stuck all the pipes in you put
all that stuff in it tends to have a lot
of freedom there so what we realized is
you have to have some pretty good jigs
in order to hold it all together put the
tension wires in and lock it down so
that it's pretty nice and solid and
clean so so all these things I won't
bore you with it but again ramping up
manufacturing is more than just building
one the technologists love the bill one
they move on to the next thing building
thousands of these shipping them across
the ocean to Dubai in the desert and
then working through customs and getting
all that there's just a lot of things
aspects of that and then obviously the
market acceptance side what we talk
about when we work a lot of it is
evangelizing and we give a lot of talks
but because of our outsource nature we
don't have we're fabulous so we don't
have any manufacturing and we really
don't have any crew if you will that
that goes down and install so will
certify and so we have what we call
parachute teams that will go in
throughout the world and help train the
local epc's engineering procurement and
construction type of companies to do
that and
so on the key takeaways that we we've
been trying to do with micro CSP is
enable the new generation of scalable
distributed again it we wanted to be
scalable modular distributed generation
the total solution and we're trying to
target that pretty large generation
space of industrial commercial and we
talked about electricity heating and
cooling and then one thing that I really
liked about the technology when I went
in from more the PV world is it can be
fabulous locally made almost anywhere
because it's just sheet metal a site on
site assembled and then you know
drinking water water treatment all of
those things that enables a lot of very
interesting things that we generally
don't think about when we're looking at
just kind of energy generation which is
kind of the focus of people all right I
think that's it oh that's it thank you
very much any questions yes yes well you
can use different types of more
absorption chillers and some are based
on ammonia or expansion there's
adsorption and there's absorption
chillers and so I'm not expert on that
but pretty large systems that are
condensation based or you know
compression pressure based and they
essentially work with process heating
right now with a boiler that's connected
to it and it wills has come along and
provide the heat source from the solar
heat source
we go back three years and we will
decided to employ this technology is
that
so we have I guess
it was just
crappy time how would life be different
well if you go back to that slide I
would imagine use more for Google's
probably I would say you don't probably
have too much servers and stuff here but
office buildings would have a lot up to
ten twenty percent of air conditioning
that you could have displaced it's fine
now electrical and conditioning I would
imagine is some other form would it
displaced air conditioning as well
whatever process heating you use is
probably just hot water and the cooking
side and the electricity how much do you
know how much acres or land that's being
used for the for the one point seven
eight thousand pounds 1.7 right size in
there all right yeah so for for the
campuses that are built obviously
strongly like this is again not
residential but I would imagine these
are submit or eyebeam type of structure
we built these in indio that are based
on rooftop deck once you get into more
the places like Bangalore even the land
there is quite expensive so they're
going on rooftops but it has to be a
certain grade or rooftop which took you
know typical buildings so to answer your
question what I would it be different I
think you would solve some of the other
potential heating as well as cooling
needs as well as electricity generation
and I'm not sure about the certainly the
cost i think this gentleman had some
questions on cost cost is obviously all
can be all over the page depending on
the size of it but our manufacturing
costs certainly in asia we start looking
at that we're really talking about a few
hundred dollars of collector it's again
am aluminum bent again made locally so
the collector is extremely inexpensive
most expensive fire is probably just too
polished aluminum sheet on that and then
the rest of the cost third of the cost
is really on the power block I didn't
talk too much about it but we're working
with the company that uniquely does very
low temperature hydraulic engine based
on the expansion of liquid versus a
steam base which changes water into
steam taking a lot of energy to do that
so it's much less than efficient than if
you
small piston volumes of water
essentially just using the expansion of
water which has a lot of power in order
to drive a generator yes Kevin the same
in every application yeah so again
because it started out as a resin resort
type of application needed to be very
safe and that's why we use a food grade
mineral oil that you know it can get
into the wok drinking water it can spill
out nothing happens it had to be that
because it was around Hawaiian resorts
etc so it's the food grade the reason we
why we use obviously a transfer fluid is
because we don't want it to go to steam
we want to go to 200 degrees C without
having to deal with high-pressure steam
once you get into steam the cost of the
plumbing the piping the people handling
it goes way up any other questions yes
John oh I can repeat the question to
nightly I know that the Central Valley
agriculture business uses a lot of hot
water and steam for food processing are
you selling anything yet to that
question so where else do you need
heating and cooling right here Las Vegas
is one we're talking a lot of people in
Las Vegas far as the cooling and
obviously energy side great son etc then
all along the San Joaquin Valley the
heating hallway up to Napa we were
looking at cooling for the wineries etc
so quite a few of those projects they're
not announced just because they're not
fully you know what we're doing all the
financing all the things that we're
doing but yeah absolutely we're doing a
lot and then back in Hawaii again macro
macadamia nut drying because it's
actually a fruit nut and has to be dried
in order to be edible the way we see it
as well as pineapple drying so there's a
lot of mundane type of stuff that needs
a lot of energy and we're working on all
of those heating applications
I have one more what kind of
temperatures in at what powers can you
generate a new system so temperatures is
200 degrees C again it's lower than the
super large csps that go up to three
four maybe even five hundred for the
super steam and that's one reason why is
that we don't use that much heat because
we're trying to run the hydraulic engine
between 95 degrees just before steam
generation oh it's steamed conversion
and whatever the ambient is 25 degree 30
degree C so it's 200 degrees C is what
we focus on that's why we went to the
micro and still could do that that's one
question the other is how much energy
does it generate so we tend to target
what we see that makes sense is really
between hundreds of kilowatts to 25
megawatts of power you can go bigger but
I think once it gets bigger it's just
that practical distributed generation
and you're talking about you know
hundreds of acres of land and you might
as well go to the really large csps
which probably have more of an economy
of scale and at that point of view yes
could you tell us about one of your
great success stories in Hawaii and what
it would take to translate that into
great success in the Sun Belt states
that's right okay this question is that
yeah it's a great success story so we
just launched it we have a very small
project a 500 kilowatt in KSP and it's
at now ha which is a natural natural
energy lab in Kona right so we're just
putting that together that should be up
and running in the matter of pi a month
two months and then we've got actually
Hawaii again getting back to why we
started ha way was a large 10 megawatt
plant that's in the planning stage that
we're working with them the state is
funding it through bonds etc so that's
why our largest ones and then lots of
the smaller ones in the u.s. mainly on
the process heating and air conditioning
because it's it's a new technology the
other stuff is an available PV is
prevalent on some of those and then
unfortunately in the US large plants are
kind of at a standstill because of the
ITC everything all the proposals are out
and everybody's kind of just you know
tapping their fingers on the desk
waiting for this next regime or whatever
happens in order to really get to the
large
10 20 50 megawatt type of plant sign off
because nothing's going to get done
until if that thing gets approved in
order to or extend it for 2008 so a lot
of our activities after in Europe and I
spoke of India India for cooling heating
as well as electricity generation so all
of those are in the planning stages and
going through related to that um so you
said you you donated a setup for a local
swim club so what costs are they
displacing and how much would it have
cost them and they paid for it yeah it's
great so one collector this place is
about what we calculate as far as the
rate is about four thousand dollars a
year which is not tiny as far as the
their heating as far as their water
treatment Nate and I think in one year
displaces about I don't know that I
think it was about seventeen thousand i
think it was seventeen thousand metric
tons of carbon as far as one one of the
collectors do that but I I can get you
the number for that and then if they we
just kind of donated it was Clinton has
a program where if you there's really
trying to encourage a lot of industry to
kind of look at projects almost like a
Habitat for Humanity so we put a hundred
hours of labor and our own collectors
and everything put it in as far as our
commitment to the Clinton Foundation on
on greening part of that
leaving else
I guess you'll be available to answer
questions yeah I have some templates
here if you're interested please pick
one up and then you can always email me
or again any questions Bruce also czar
our local manager that's around I run
the International and all of the
operations on the mainland but if you
want to come out to Hawaii and visit the
plan we always welcome thank you for
your time thanks al thanks Bruce</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
