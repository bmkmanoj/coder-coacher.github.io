the delay my name is Reuben sterling
we're in the Google Los Angeles office
today it is my pleasure to introduce
Noah Epstein CEO of Middle East
education through technology Middle East
education technology or meet brings
together Israeli and Palestinian
students for computer science and
business education that I was an early
instructor and it's grown a lot since I
was there and I'm really excited to see
what they've been up to thanks very much
Ruben and thanks very much for all of
you all of you for coming to this talk
and my name is Noah as Bengie said and i
come from jerusalem i'm here on a kind
of us trip we had two of our alumni
invited to present their mobile app at
one israeli in one palestinian 17 year
olds and they were supposed to do that
in New York last week which of course
got canceled because it was supposed to
be in battery park at the old things the
mobile tech conference and but the good
news is that they still got their
message out and I'm going to be showing
you that as well and so really today's
talk is about how an example of how
technology and the spreading of
knowledge is being used to disrupt a
situation which for many years people
have been trying to tackle and solve
which is the Middle East conflict and
how as an organization called meet we're
bringing together young Palestinian and
Israeli youth who have leadership
potential and we're teaching them this
common language of Technology of
computer science and business and
bringing them together in an environment
that can rearrange and re categorize
group boundaries so that they can
develop a common language and actually
get things done together so let me start
by giving you a bit of a glimpse of what
it is like to be an Israeli or
Palestinian today living in the Middle
East how many of you have been to
Jerusalem okay so we we have a
knowledgeable crowd here so and as you
know the the situation in
the Middle East in Israel Palestine is
such that the societies are very much
divided we have a physical wall that
separates communities but there's also a
mental wall of stereotypes and
misconceptions and this is something
that is really hard to overcome so I
grew up in Jerusalem but until the age
of 14 when I first joined the program
that brought together young Israeli and
Palestinian students I had never met a
Palestinian in my life before that time
and most of the people my age never come
into contact with the Palestinian I'm
Israeli unless it's in the context of
the conflict so at the checkpoint or
through the very negative image of the
other that we see on the news over the
years there have been many efforts and
many valuable efforts to bring the
societies together and to create bridges
especially between young people to break
down stereotypes to create friendships
in the hope that that will transform
sort of the next generation and help us
create the wanted peace that everyone
aspires to but there's several
challenges with the models of
organizations that have been doing peace
building in the past couple of years or
more than the past decade actually so
the basis of all these organizations and
concept is is the notion of contact so
contact Theory has it that if you bring
people together they get to know each
other as individuals and they're able to
create that interpersonal trust and
which is critical to again dissolving
the stereotypes and negative images of
the other and there's two sides to the
spectrum here the type of interaction
you can create when you bring two
opposing sides together one is the
individualistic Theory where you say you
know if I get to know Nora better ok I
will trust in her and then be able to
work together with her to solve a common
challenge the other side of the spectrum
says let's bring groups together groups
that represent their national
constituencies so you set people around
in a circle and and Palestinians and
Israelis suddenly represents their
nations and they discuss them the hot
political issues
refugees and settlements and terror
attacks and and it's all on the table
and it's very very vibrant and difficult
I've been involved in such encounters
personally but then you reach a point
where people realize that at the end of
the day they don't represent the entire
group and they can't solve the political
conflict through negotiating with a
circle of people so the existing models
have challenges that the people who
founded meet Middle East education
through technology in 2004 these people
were trying to figure out a model that
will address these challenges and create
something different so basically they
wanted to do something that can scale
beyond the individual interaction they
wanted to do something that is long-term
so not sending people off to say an
experience of a month or a week abroad
there's lots of student programs that
bring together Israeli and Palestinians
and send them off to like a delegation
to Switzerland or other places and it's
great but it's a bubble and what happens
there then you know comes back and tends
to get dissolved when the back home in
the harsh reality of the conflict and
most of all the guys who the people who
founded meet wanted to create something
that's long lasting and goes beyond the
experience of the interaction itself so
the meat approach to bridging the
societies and to create something that
will help effect positive change between
Israelis and Palestinians is first of
all an excellence model so meet is an
NGO and we run an educational excellence
program for excelling high school
students from Israel and Palestine and
the idea here is that it's not a numbers
game and it never will be so we spend
our resources on selecting those
individuals at the age of 15 from both
sides that we believe have leadership
potential and we invest in them for
three intensive years when they're still
living at home so this is part of the
everyday reality and they go through
this program the teachers technology and
business skills okay they actually learn
computer science Java Python I'll touch
on what they actually do in a minute
and the focus is on a skill set the
focus is not on coming and just getting
to know each other but actually giving
them something that's a vested interest
for them to continue coming to the
program because it's an excellent
program and it's in partnership with MIT
the mission of meat is to educate and
empower tomorrow's most promising
Palestinian and Israeli leaders so that
they can then affect change whether its
political social or economic in the
Middle East in their region and how do
we do this we do this by creating a
network so as I said we invest in people
as they enter high school and they go
through a three-year program during
which they get to study from instructors
that come from MIT every summer to
Jerusalem and through this experience
these students become part of a network
which essentially is long-lasting and
you know lifelong like if you graduate
from the top universities I'm sure you
all have gone to your part of something
that that is bigger and and can last you
a very long time and if you want to then
start a company if you want to figure
out the next step in your life more
often than not you'll turn to this
network and you'll be able to to really
leverage it to make a difference and to
do something and that's something that
does not exist between Israelis and
Palestinians before meet was started so
what do we actually do at meet what does
the program look like the first phase is
a student program it's three years long
and it can pose it's composed of three
summers five weeks each in Jerusalem at
the Hebrew University where instructors
come as volunteers from MIT from Sloan
and from the computer science department
csail to teach our students everything
from the the kind of common language of
technology so Java and Python how to
write a business plan how to think
strategically about a problem how to
come up with a marketing plan so they
actually work on real projects with
real-world companies and we've done a
software for HP that the student had to
develop we've created marketing plans
for selling touchpads to
women over 50 and this is all stuff that
the students would not get a chance to
do not definitely not at this age and
definitely not with people from the
supposed enemy side in between those
three years and where we have those
summer camps five weeks each we have a
year-long program that happens every day
at our lab in Jerusalem so students come
from Bethlehem Ramallah East and West
Jerusalem some small cities around West
Jerusalem and for the first time this
year from the north of Israel as well
Arabs and Jews from the Nazareth Area
and in our program hubs these students
continue to learn and develop their
skills whereas in the first year they
might you know create a calculator or
learn basic Java to program something
you know a small computer game like
snake or something like that in the
second year they're already developing
websites and starting to think
creatively about what can they actually
create that makes a difference one
project they did last year was called
bio book where they were taking people's
information from sort of facebook and
other Google Plus and other sources and
then trying to create like a biography
that's written down and they can submit
if they're going to you know for job
interview or to give a speech somewhere
so these kind of applications are at the
second year whereas in the third year
students really start thinking about how
can their projects have a wider impact
which is really what we educate them to
do at meet and in the past summer we had
a very interesting project called count
me in which I'm going to tell you about
soon and that's a mobile app for Android
which coordinates collective action on a
large scale think Arab Spring and the
kind of applications that can have so
after the three years student program
we've got a very interesting situation
than two years ago we started to see
alumni coming since 2004 and joining us
again in the summer and saying guys we
want to get back involved and this is
incredible because you see people who
are now 22 23 year old and they're at
university some of them are in the army
on the Israeli side and they really want
to engage back within meet so we develop
an alumni program which is really to
ensure the next stage of meets impact
and as part of the concept here is
really to ensure that there is this
network that is not just keeping tabs of
their success but that as an
organization we are actively assisting
them in the next stages of their careers
and helping create or enable an
opportunity for them to interact
together again one element of this is
just to ensure that they can keep seeing
each other so we have full annual events
in Jerusalem where alumni come back and
hear lectures and go through courses and
can just be with each other again in a
stimulating environment the second is
professional development so we're really
helping our alumni figure out which
university to go to how to get in how to
get a scholarship we're turning to
mentors which is a huge resource we have
at meet because of our wonderful
instructors and who've been teaching on
the program and end up then working in
you know almost any top current company
in today's industries so we're able to
really connect and make those one-to-one
matches for our alumni to then be
successful in their endeavors the third
and most exciting I think element of the
alumni program is the venture lab and
this is something I wanted to tell you
google is about because we've already
got google Tel Aviv very involved in
this and also the office in Mountain
View m has been very helpful what we're
doing is we've created an open space a
shared space for our alumni to come back
and interact and work on real projects
by themselves this time so it's not so
much guided by us but it's you know it
can be a pair of people coming back and
saying we want to develop this app and
we're not sure how to get started and
meet will connect them with the
resources that they need but mostly they
have a space where they can physically
sit together and talk about this and
come up with creative ideas which is
very unique if you've been to Jerusalem
you know that such spaces where both
sides can just come and interact in a
creative environment almost unheard of
so the venture lab is at the point where
we're building up the network of mentors
and speakers who come in sporadically
and give a talk at the lab a tech talk
or business talk or something about
social enterprise so that's for you to
keep in mind next
time you're in the region who are our
students where do they come from and
what do they like so our students come
from seven cities as i mentioned from
the Jerusalem area from Bethlehem from
Ramallah and from the north of Israel
and they're 15 when they enter meet
they're very excellent academically and
socially so they have to go through a
rigorous three-stage process to actually
enter meet and once they're in they get
a full scholarship for the whole three
years so it's a very competitive program
and we take pride in when we say that we
have under ten percent admittance rate
so this year we had 700 applicants and
for only 60 spots so it's very hard to
get in and this is part of meats
different kind of model we have a brand
equity that we've built up because of
the affiliation with MIT and because of
the really top notch educational program
that we run and this enabled us to pull
the best students for on both sides
people who don't necessarily want to
come and meet the other side but they
want to come and learn computer science
because they're passionate about
technology and they really want to
improve their skills in a in a program
that offers them those kind of
opportunities we have fifty percent
girls and fifty percent boys and
obviously fifty percent Israeli and
Palestinian and that's really unique
because you you come into the meat lab
and you see groups of young people many
many girls some of them you know
religious some not Israeli Palestinian
and they're all working on developing
these apps and websites and it's really
it's really empowering to see that and
to see what's possible when you give
people such an opportunity and you bring
them together around knowledge in the
coming two years and my professional
partner who's alas added a co-director
of meat and I were working to do two
main things one is to scale this model
so i said before made it not about
numbers but we do want to bring in we
have now 100 so 200 students at any
given time to this program we're doing
this by opening a new program hub in the
north in nazareth and we're also
reaching out
new demography so as you know Israel and
Palestine when we talk about a
leadership network it's really critical
to also involve the Palestinian citizens
of Israel and the Palestinians who are
living inside Israel today and for the
first time this summer we've done that
we've got a group pilot group of
students from the North Jewish and Arab
and we've kind of closed the triangle of
Israeli and Palestinians in the region
as part of this network the third thing
we're doing is the alumni program and
here the venture lab is the biggest
focus and we're really looking to create
support and rally people to be part of
this amazing open space joint workspace
in Jerusalem where people can come
together alums in by national or uni
national projects so the example of one
of the ventures that are being developed
at the moment is one I want to share
with you today called count me in let's
see if the video will work because I
mean and you vowed two of our alums who
worked on this and can tell you
firsthand what it is about so these are
two guys who are invited to present at
all things D and because the conference
got cancelled due to the hurt in Fortune
each other presenters front of the
camera just one second this is at the
hotel room of the All Things the
organizer who is very very helpful to us
hi I'm Yvonne I'm 17 years old I mean
Israeli and I am evening Jerusalem I'm
it mean I'm a Palestinian I'm 17 and I
was at five minutes away from you both
geographically we live really close but
socially we're worlds apart there's no
social interaction between the
Palestinian and Israeli communities for
most of my life I didn't know any
Israelis on a personal level I didn't
have any Israeli friends all I knew was
that
live in same city the idea we're leaving
different cultures and that was our
situation up until three years ago when
we got selected to this program called
meat meat middle east education through
technology is an educational excellence
program which teaches computer science
and business to Israeli and Palestinian
high schoolers in partnership with
volunteer instructors who come from MIT
its aim is to create an active network
of leaders who can create positive
change in our region meat is a very
intensive program we study computer
science and business each summer for
three years we also meet for for for our
weekly meeting where amazing instructors
reality come and teachers Java Python
leadership skills marketing strategies
and so on but most importantly in meet
we got to know more about each other I
got to know about a mean the other side
and the israel-palestinian conflict and
during those few years my friends were
asking me why do you do this why do you
wake up at 7am in the morning for five
days a week during your summer vacation
when you should be on the beach why are
you doing this you're going to learn
computer science with a bunch of
Israelis no less my answer to them was
the same first of all me challenges me
it's given me an opportunity to learn
computer science at a level that has
Palestinian high schoolers don't get but
also I've managed to make a connection
with people who I thought I couldn't
connect it I found out the Israelis
aren't so different for me we have some
similarities and although I don't always
agree with your balls political opinions
I can come to respect him as a person
and that relationship is really
important to me in the second year I
mean and I got to work in the same
project in the same team we managed to
turn our competition into corporation
and realize that once we worked on
towards common goals together the
results are amazing but then last summer
when we were just about to graduate from
the Meech program we realized that the
relationship which we've been building
up for the past three years must be
about to disappear and that's something
that we would not allow to happen so we
decided that we would take action we
would do something to make sure that
after we graduated from eat we could
stay connected our experience in meat
have taught us how important
technologies a recent example is the
Arab screen where an individual's idea
got sprint to the mask using Facebook
and Twitter that's why we decided to use
technology in order to solve a problem
and stay connected we decided to develop
a mobile application called count me in
count mean is currently being developed
by us in the brand new meet venture lab
the meat venture lab is a place where
meet alumnus can come together and work
on very various startups and projects in
by national teams calfee n is an
application for group event coordination
this means it gives its users the
ability to create an event and then
invite others to join them for us count
me in was a way for the 30 students in
our year to stay connected after you
graduate from me and so that we could
say guys let's all go play soccer after
school on Monday it would happen count
me in but then as we started working on
this application we realize this could
be something more this can have an
effect on hundreds of thousands of
people what if we want to clean the park
and we want 500 people to help us do it
click count me in what if we want a
million people to save electricity in
the next two days click count me in we
really believed that the youth
generation our generation has the power
to change our society's future and count
mean was a way to do that it was our way
to connect and to affect but in order to
create a bigger change in the Middle
East we need a critical mass and you can
be a part of it we've come all this way
just to meet you but unfortunately
and sandy got your first that's a bad
luck there's one thing we look for me is
that we don't give up so please stay in
contact with us email us check out the
meat Facebook page the week website and
our IndieGoGo campaign the venture lab
be waiting for you thank you okay so
that was the frame was from Times Square
and that was a meaning eval who are two
of our alums we also have a number of
alums in the states now one is called
sube he's working he's right now in a
start-up in the valley and this is a 20
year-old guy and we have four of our
Palestinian alumni studying at MIT at
the moment so you know since 2004 we've
come quite a long way and Benji can tell
you that we started off as a very small
organization it actually started as a
one-off summer no one knew that it's
going to have this effect and impact but
then after the summer the students were
coming and saying okay what's next you
know when how can we sign up for more so
meet has grown and we're now at a really
critical stage where with this venture
lab we're working hard to make sure that
we can actually see these type of
projects in meets vision develop so we
actually really need your help both in
spreading the word and getting involved
more than that and here are some
examples of how so we've now formally
set up a matching campaign and with
Google so you have the internal system
which you know about so meet is now part
of that and if you you owe your fellow
google eyes would like to give the
smallest amount even to me then that
would be really really welcomed and
really helpful to help fund student
scholarships for Israelis and
Palestinians the second way to get
involved is as a mentor if you can give
even remotely from here an hour once
every two months or even as almost one
off to give a tech review to one of the
projects our students are developing Oh
to help people think through a business
idea depending on you know your area of
expertise then that's really valuable
and merely the the contact that they can
have with you know with Google is abroad
and the kind of role models that we want
to expose them to is really helpful in
what way
trying to do as part of our educational
mission thirdly and if you have a crazy
idea for project you'd love to do and
don't have the time or something that
you've had in your mind then our
students want to know about this so you
can come up with a project you think
would be a really cool challenge to set
for the students in the summer and maybe
even come to the summer for a couple of
days and be a judge on a competition
that we do for that so those there's
really a lot of room for creativity and
ideas and we really want to source these
from you and involve you if you're ever
in Jerusalem and do tell us you know it
were really easy to access we're
situated right next to the ymca in front
of the King David hotel and Jerusalem
our lab is there and there's always
something happening there's always an
opportunity to come give a talk or just
come and meet us and see the students
and alumni in action and lastly I really
mean it when I say help us spread the
word so we talked about meets mission
which is educational to empower our
students to create impact part of our
mission is also to inspire hope those of
you who know Palestinians and Israelis
personally you know that a lot of people
have really lost hope and it's more
common to find people who say I you
can't change anything there's not it's
it's just a lost cause you know all
these efforts and the Oslo process and
everything and it's it's just getting
worse and worse back home and I think
meet for me I mean this is the reason I
I am part of meat/meat gives me hope
because it's being part of something
almost like a social experiment when you
say let's imagine that there wasn't a
conflict a second let's imagine there
was no occupation let's imagine and that
the situation was just normal between
Israelis and Palestinians what would
then cooperation look like what would
happen if you brought really sharp minds
together around technology and business
and challenge them to think big to think
creatively what would be the result and
we see the result every single day when
we work with these amazing students in
partnership with our amazing instructors
who come from the US from MIT and that's
a kind of picture that's really hard to
put into words
but as much as we can you know this is
why I come here and talk about it and as
much as you can tell people about this
and I think that also in itself is going
to make a difference tada shukran thank
you and I'd like to open it up to a
discussion or questions or whatever
really you would like if people have any
comment or you want to ask a bit more
about the program feel free just
introduce yourself as well Benji so in
the video it was a meetin you've all the
thing I mean annual so their English was
obviously very good and I remember when
I was an instructor one of the principal
sources of frustration for the students
and the instructors was the some a lot
of the kids you know didn't have the
English skills I've obviously they were
selected they could speak English but
many of them didn't have you know flew
in English and that was a source of
frustration wondering what's been the
experience since then and have you been
able to figure out strategies to deal
with that so a to meet you know we have
the offering is really around computer
science and business that's what the the
kids know that they're going to get okay
the second layer is the fact that they
get to know each other which is for us
the the core goal and there's other
layers to the kind of what happens as a
result of meet one of which is really
improving your English which is a huge
pool mechanism you're the parents which
we invite to a the pre meet parent event
they all excited about knowing from
friends and so on that that's meet their
kids are really going to become fluent
in English and that's that's the case
today where we have something called the
English rule so people are expected both
instructors and the students to speak
English and even if they come into the
program not so fluent that's ok we don't
disqualify you because of that and we
even provide tutoring before the first
summer at meet for people who need to
strengthen their their language skill a
bit but this is you know the common
language and technologies one so English
is something they gain as well and
in the alumni phase we're actually
teaching hebrew and arabic cuz i
personally think that that's you know
that's really the common language to
know the language of each other but
english is the language of technology
and business and it's a main main part
of the program past summer we've had
students sort of year three students
kind of help enforce the english rule
with your one students for them it's a
bit tougher because it suddenly you know
you're expected to speak english 24 7
and it's new and but it's interesting
because that's that's another thing that
they get out of meat which i think they
realize after it's very valuable for
them yeah two questions one is how do
you think that the fact that you have
other students and Israel together
influence like the outcome you know what
happens in the trainings and all that
and the second question is is there any
formal like discussion around politics
at all it's going on all the
conversation happens like in how our
conversations or I don't know social
activities or things like that I don't
think okay it is working and so to your
first question about how does it
actually create an impact the fact that
we're bringing the sides together did I
get the question right ok so I think
actually Bengie might want to answer how
actually does the binational dynamic
influence the educational size of the
program the academic side if you like
and I can just say from my perspective
that we just get a bunch of really smart
youth in the room and as long as you
know we do teach things that are
unrelated to the conflict most of the
time which is the technology computer
science business and so directly there
is no influence in that sense but it's
more about the academic program
influencing their binational dynamic
because suddenly you get teams you know
they work through they learn through
doing so suddenly there's an a
Palestinian project manager who's
managing in Israeli in the team and
suddenly a female Palestinian is
managing a male Palestinian from the
next city and many different dynamics
which are not so common maybe in the
reality and and that I think that has a
big impact on
changing people's mindsets and helping
them question things more but maybe
Benji do you want to say something about
the teaching experience hello hello from
my experience just in terms of the
actual teaching and having the kids work
together and the project the whole
israeli-palestinian divide really kind
of falls away it's very tangential to
the the projects that they do during the
program so the academics are actually
very you know they coalesce very well
and they work together very well the the
politics tend to come during lunch time
because everyone's you know on the same
cafeteria and everyone's eating the same
tables and we're not talking about
computer science anymore and that's sort
of when it comes out and I had some
interesting experiences without respect
and also add to your second question
about do we actually tackle politics and
so first of all absolutely yes just the
because the program is held in Jerusalem
and we didn't choose to take them away
to a bubble environment we face things
like having to get the Palestinians
through the checkpoint to come to the
program in the morning in the summer for
example and that's a hurdle and
sometimes it doesn't go smoothly and
there's effects to that you know if
someone felt what went through a tough
experience then they'll bring that to
their classroom and they'll talk about
it and we we encourage that it's just
that that's not the the reason they're
coming if that makes sense and more more
so this past summer for instance we did
a marketing plan the students had to do
like a marketing plan for Rawabi which
is a Palestinian city that's being built
north of Ramallah and Israelis and
Palestinians together had to learn about
this new venture and and think about how
to get foreign companies to invest and
so through a very you know business
oriented let's let's implement our
marketing strategy skills through this
they actually started to talk about the
political implications of this and which
is a really interesting and unique way
to tackle politics without sort of
putting that on the table and then
getting people really defensive and
locked in their national standpoint
so I think that's a really unique way to
talk politics and to deal with the
issues but in a way that ensures one
that we already have a foundation of
trust and deep ability to work together
between the students which is something
we establish gradually from year one to
year three and two that even after you
have a heated discussion for example
during the Gaza war okay that was during
the mid summer a few years ago and it
was very difficult to keep running the
program while everything was happening
but we we stopped and we allow the
students to talk about this and to have
these discussions but at the end they
were able to come back and say okay guys
now we need you know now it's time to
move back to the project and we we have
milestones and we need to get stuff done
which is really from my experience
unheard of otherwise we're such you know
situations externally can really destroy
a group dynamic that was built anyone
else is there anybody working on a
program to sort of bus kids around
through the checkpoints to sort of
desegregate ordinary schools bossing
kids around through the checkpoints to
sort of desegregate ordinary schools as
opposed to this sort of like elite
technology you know thing that you're
doing okay so first of all and the
program is not elite in the sense that
it's not related to your social economic
family situation we accept students
across the board if they meet the
academic excellence criteria and the
kind of leadership potential that we're
looking for and we have students who
come from refugee camps and from more
developing cities inside Israel so
that's that's really important to us
this is not like the rich kid school at
all and regarding schools in Palestine
and and the checkpoint question I'm not
really sure what exactly you're asking
where the post this is sort of a
geographic dispersion of different
minority groups that leads to sort of
segregated schools and you know the 22 I
don't know to help people sort of learn
to get along better
needs to be sort of mixing of the
schools but it's probably going to be
difficult to set up a program like that
I mean you have in Israel and Palestine
some schools well it's actually in
Jerusalem on the Israeli side that are
by national in the sense that they they
bring people together for the full
school experience so meat is
extracurricular right so it's it's in
its plus it's in addition to school it's
not instead of school and but it's more
fun than not you won't see I mean there
are no like mixed schools it's not a
very common factor you've got
Palestinian schools and Israeli schools
pretty separate the office often yeah
