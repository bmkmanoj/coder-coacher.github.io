thank you I'm checking I guess I hear
this is picking up great well what a
better place to talk about play than
right here at Google we've all admired
the ascent of Google and Googlers so we
couldn't be more thrilled on this
auspicious day your earnings probably
are out now because on the west coast
it's four o'clock so if you logging in
we understand you're checking the
success of your wonderful company so
here we go skipping your way to Harvard
we could have called this skipping your
way to UCLA or Berkeley or Stanford or
Google but we thought we would choose
neutral turf by putting the word Harvard
in this title as Shari said I'm George
Foreman my partner Alan Hall we
co-founded a company called video tips
we'll say a little bit about that later
but it's not really an infomercial we're
here to talk about play excuse me
a little laryngitis here okay skipping
your way to Harvard on the one hand
parents teachers value play as a source
of joy but on the other hand we're a
little ambivalent about it we sometimes
think it might be a distraction away
from what's really relevant to learning
but can one play and still reach
difficult objectives such as getting
into Harvard or being hired by Google
there's a strong possibility and
research suggests that play actually
might be essential to reach challenging
objectives we propose that this
component play is necessary for both
success and understanding and we're
going to differentiate these terms as we
go along the value of play
does not diminish as one leaves
childhood
let me lay out a few rather condensed
statements we call them anchor
statements and we're going to have a Q&amp;amp;A
session the last hour or maybe a little
less than an hour so if these key
statements these anchor statements might
help you bullet or what you might want
to ask questions about that's why we did
it this way a play what is it
one definition of play it's an attitude
it's not really a particular activity
it's an attitude of casualness or
lightheartedness success on the other
hand is an achievement and it's achieved
by practice and it's defined more by
attaining goals understanding on the
other hand is achieved in a different
way it's not achieved so much by
practice but by reflection and it
requires both knowing what something is
and knowing what something is not so
plays an attitude toward the world a way
of seeing and being an active search for
possibilities so here imagine a child
and you'll see how this fits into the
title imagine a child learn away to a
neighbor's house with her parents
how does she move does she just go
straight down the sidewalk not hardly if
you watch children and I'm sure you have
they skip they hop they walk with one
foot off the curb one foot on the curb
you've seen it cracking the sidewalk
they make an exaggerated jump over the
crack as if it's going to open wide so
they pretend and the child expands
walking to variations that are telling
but are not actually necessary in a
moment I'll discuss how such play leads
to understanding which is a little
paradoxical but it does but first let me
distinguish success
from understanding because this is
critical one can successfully reach a
goal without truly understanding what
one has required to do a boy such as
young David may spend a stone and a
sling and successfully hit his target
each time he releases the sling the
success if you really understand physics
requires a release at around two o'clock
if he's spinning it Ana counterclockwise
way to hit a target that's directly
ahead twelve o'clock yet in SPO J's
research has shown that when asked about
this event most adolescents young adults
will say that they release this string
at 12 o'clock as you see in this diagram
which is not correct so you can be
successful at spinning the stone but not
really understand what you've done
and to understand you need to reflect
you need to sort of rule out the
contradictions you sort of invent the
correct performance you don't really
observe as P as they would say you would
invent and upon reflection our young
David would realize that the stone could
not change so abruptly that see if this
little gizmo works the motion will not
change abruptly here and well why would
motion on fettered make a right angle so
that's in a way contradicts other things
the child knows so to understand David
would reason that the path of the travel
is y but not X that this is how it must
work in this even though as my intuition
is wrong so the reflection on
performance eals understanding and
success
precedes it so now back to play a light
heartedness and understanding how does
the light heartedness of play benefit
understanding play is a form of acting
out what might appear to be unnecessary
pushing your food around on the plate
deliberately putting your coat on
backwards I'm still talking about young
children so don't get worried that oh
you hadn't done that today the doing
wheelies with their stroller this is
what a video you're about to see and
another video we're going to show you a
kicking the air with your foot after
you've thrown a ball with your arm so
let me sort of unpack these a little bit
playing with the unnecessary watch this
child has been pushing his stroller all
over the neighborhood with four wheels
flat on the ground
this is Foreman home video sorry but it
exemplifies what I want to say watch how
he tilts the stroller perhaps to add
interest to his work so you'll even see
him pause like you know what can I do
now and he he's never done that before
a particular reason for it so now he's
kind of done a wheelie with this
stroller and watch how he now
understands that to really stabilize
that he kind of hooks the handles under
his arms to stabilize that horizontal
position in time he receipts the
stroller four wheels on the ground and
at that point he might look at that
ordinary way of pushing in a new way
it's not tilting it back so what does it
yield to push it forward oh I see now I
know why it works better with four
wheels on the ground the first two
wheels keep it from tilting forward it
stabilizes it and if he hadn't a
playfully experimented with the
unnecessary he
continued on his merry way successful
but not particularly knowledgeable now
here's another clip and I'd like you to
watch how this child after he throws a
ball at the end how he lifts his believe
it's his right leg he first kicks the
ball for something he's been doing this
for some minute and then later in the
video he throws the ball pretty good
distance but the throw is not the kick
and perhaps to express this contrast he
raises his leg in thin air so let's look
at this little clip so here he kicks it
and when he throws it I'm gonna
speculate that he was saying something
here the ball is way over there and I
didn't kick it now that's an
interpretation but I'm a child watcher
and I think that's my particular
intuition so I think he's making a
statement that the throw is not the same
thing that he did before which was
kicked so by considering what a throw is
not a children this chalk comes to a
more complete understanding of what the
throw is so to review play helps
children understand the necessary versus
the unnecessary as we saw with the
stroller and to consider what something
is not we saw with the thrower such is
the structure of understanding to watch
as toddler and proper haps number of you
have watched a toddler roll a ball down
an incline if you look carefully what
they do is they'll put it at the top of
the incline and then they push it now
they don't have to push it they could
just release it but young children are
not sure about where motion comes from
they often think it comes from me you
know the the center of the universe they
push it so why do they push or what
might come next if you look closely you
will I said you'll see that they use
their hand but after a while they start
backing off taking a more lighthearted
approach to this and they'll do things
that again aren't necessary they'll
release it and in releasing that they'll
notice the ball rolls by itself of
course if the ball is at the top of the
incline they also as they are in this
playful mode they'll put it at the
bottom of the ramp and they'll throw it
up and they notice it comes back down
now these are all discoveries for a
young child or if they have a cone they
put it at the top it doesn't roll
straight down it surprises them it rolls
then an arc so it's this playful mode
that leads to all these discoveries but
the question I think kind of the
epistemological question is why not be
content with success I mean when you
pushed it down it went down
why do you ever not just keep going
pushing it pushing it pushing it well
it's our species I think we have this
tendency to reflect it's I think very
much part of our specie like what is the
form of my play here and so they are
motivated more by this light-hearted
distance from the action they're not
trying to predict a particular effect
and make it happen over and over again
they're more lighthearted and trying to
discover things by doing the unnecessary
the superfluous the engaging so as the
exception proves the rule as what you do
this unnecessary proves what's necessary
so the skill defines the walk so
skipping is a good way to become the
successful and knowledgeable applica
to Harvard and Ellen and I are going to
switch off segment so now it's Ellen's
turn okay okay so now now some more
thank her statements better thinks that
outline the rest of our talk success
without play will not yield
understanding success without
understanding will not create meaning
and love of work understanding without
sharing will not create quality we will
discuss each of these statements in turn
saving for last the role of digital
video and the Internet in sharing our
understanding with regard to the second
statement we want our children to be
successful but we also want them to love
their work this modern dilemma faces us
all how can we help our children attain
their goals and at the same time love
their work can we begin to recognize
those situations in childhood that
support and maintain this combination of
work and joy in this talk we maintain
that the answer lies in our
understanding of play play allows
learning to occur for the very reason
that it contains joy children try new
strategies and new variations because in
play success is not the issue in play
the child seeks to express possibilities
not necessarily to improve performance
how many ways can I do this it becomes
more important than how do I do this
effectively and what do I know about
this becomes more important than can I
make this work of course ultimately play
yield success and the child's reflection
on success yields understanding but this
is a complex process often passed over
by adult eyes that only flit we chose
not to flit but to slow down and look at
the amazing subtlety of
you will meet three more protagonists in
our story two children Karen and Tyler
and a high school student Frank writing
his admissions essay to Harvard we will
use their stories to explain how
playfulness is beneficial to learning
and success
so let's first watch Karen gluing small
felt and plastic objects onto a 2x4
board you will see how an hurriedly he
works relaxed focused not intense about
his goals at some point
Karen's casualness allows him to step
back mentally and think about his work
as a set of steps get glue dab glue get
object place object this sort of
detachment from the immediacy of his
work allows him to modify these steps if
you will recode the rules that he uses
to generate the product without this
casual detachment Karen would not be
able to reflect on the general structure
of his actions and on the steps that he
is using once he considers their
structure he begins to play with the
rules and events new ways to complete
his goals okay let's begin
oh there's no sound on this so just to
let you know
as you can see the the glue is dabbed
onto the 2x4 and then carefully placing
the item onto the glue then he reaches
for the glue stick again places a dab of
glue at the other end of the 2x4 board
very careful relaxed and focused and he
selects an item but then changes his
mind and selects an item that's similar
to the one he already placed and places
this item over the second dab of glue
and so that gives us a clue to that he
is going to make be making a symmetrical
design so if we stop the video or pause
it and and look at an animation we can
focus on karyn's moves and how he
eliminates steps so here we have what we
saw in the video the glue the item the
glue the second item and then he
continues each time reaches reaching
into the bowl to get one dab of glue for
one object
ah then at a certain point he's going to
eliminate he notices he has a new
strategy that he can add a second dab of
glue to the glue stick and eliminate
steps now his two dabs of glue on his
glue stick and he proceeds glue holding
on to the glue stick instead of picking
up a new object he puts down another dab
of glue
and he doesn't go back once he's got
this strategy in place it's two dabs of
glue item item ah but then he has a new
strategy and now he's figured that he
can take the two items out of the bin
and eliminate another step so two dabs
of glue and two items at a time he
creates a pair and now he doesn't have
to return to the supply bin
and again he does once he has the
strategy in place he doesn't go back at
each time a piece is placed a second
pleat piece is placed in a symmetrical
location
so it's not the point of this example
that Karen became more efficient in
cutting out steps the point is that
Karen began to treat his actions as
subroutines he was not simply engaged in
a gluing activity he was thinking about
the motifs in its actions and how they
related one to the other so this stance
toward action this view from above
defines play in play what is the form of
my actions takes temporary precedence
over what do my actions yield but it's
also interesting to note that Kieran's
actions became more coherent and
integrated as he worked it is this
tendency for play to help one integrate
and make experience more coherent that
leads you to Harvard and Google skipping
hopping and jumping over cracks so we've
discussed how play yields to
understanding by this distance from the
effects in looking at the form now we'll
shift to how a playfulness also helps
performance
so play can improve performance
performing a set of action be the player
a child
pretending to cut down a tree and you'll
see Tyler pretend to cut down a tree are
an adult writing their admissions essay
to college
playfulness improves performance here
are a few more attributes I'd like to
share with you about playfulness and
I'll use these particular attributes to
explain how playfulness can enhance
performance both of Tyler the little boy
pretending and Frank the high school
senior writing a junior writing his
essay a play shifts the what is to the
as if for the child there's always an
element of / temps in play as jumping
over the cracks that in reality present
no threat it's just pretend
when a playful frame of mind the adult
is not literal there as if oriented the
facts are embellished beyond the literal
to yield or feeling and metaphoric
expression a playful frame of mind also
delights in the occurrence of surprise a
surprise is not treated as failure
remember success is not the issue and
surprise is treated as fun for the child
a playful man actually hopes that things
will end up funny surprising for the
adults a writing an essay you use
surprise it adds pause and causes the
reader to reflect a play thrives on
flexibility and the use of new
combinations for the child if she cannot
knock the bowling pin down
with her bowling balls she'll go over
and kick it with her foot so it's
flexible everything is okay she doesn't
have a toy car to motor across the
carpet she'll get a rectangular block
and pretend that it's the car is this
flexible way of being made new Newcomb
unusual combinations for the adult the
willingness to consider any and all
combinations Neil's a creative writing
creative solutions I'm sure this is
rampant at Google the brainstorming
sessions here must be outstanding
the playful mind delights when it
discovers or invents deliberate
ambiguity when two forms are compressed
in one for the child it could be the
lowly pun children go through this
period where they think the pond is the
funniest thing in the world but then as
we grow in our literary skills we is
exchanged irony and other tropisms for
our writing instead of puns and we even
become eloquent so let me introduce you
to Frank and see how these attributes of
play apply to his writing Frank decides
to write about his experience as a
competitive swimmer this actually was a
essay that I got off of the Princeton
Review website to talk about writing
essays it was kind of a tutorial and it
walks the reader through the first draft
and the second draft and what's
different so I'm going to use this final
version to make some points about how
the
high school students playfulness
improved his writing
here we go with portion of Frank's final
essay you don't have to read this if
it's too far in the back to see I'll
read it here the Sun sleeps as the
desolate city streets await the morning
rush hour
driven by an inexplicable compulsion I
enter the building along with ten other
swimmers inching my way toward the cold
dark locker room of Menlo Park one by
one we slip into our still damp suits
and run through the chill of the morning
air the cold air propels an eerie column
of steam from the water's surface
producing the spooky ambience of a war
wolf movie well you know he's a high
school junior okay but this is an
improvement
next comes the shock a headfirst
immersion into the tepid water sends our
heart's racing and we respond with a
quick set of warm-up laps as we finish
our coach emerges from the fog he offers
no friendly accolades I think Frank head
of the Souris here he offers no friendly
Arkell aids just a rigid regimen of sets
intervals and exhortation okay so that
was by the way he did get in Harvard so
you know it worked the picture was not
really Frank
that's my son Jed but I did it with his
permission and how is Frank writing
playful how does his understanding of
his craft result from this playful
attitude and remember we're going to
compare what he did with what children
do so the whole idea is that children's
play is a precursor to excellence with
other media when you're older it's not
irrelevant how might this playfulness in
his love of the writing process to
answer these questions I would use the
poor attributes I just mentioned after
my comments on Frank's Ellen will
compare the playfulness of our College
applicant to Tyler the little boy who
buzzes his lips to pretend he's cutting
down the tree all right here we go
shifting the what is to the as if Frank
thinks about the facts and his story and
realizes that the end and of themselves
are not that interesting he plays with
the exact details to create some
emotional reaction in the reader
instead of saying walking to the cold
dark locker room he says inching my way
now clearly he wasn't inching this is
not literal this is as if to create an
effect to show his ambivalence about the
practice in his first draft he said the
coach joins us later but in the final
draft he says our coach emerges from the
fog again non-literal but adds motive
and emotion to his writing playing with
the element of surprise Frank wants the
reader to be actively engaged in the
story
therefore he sets the reader up to think
about what's going to happen next in a
rather direct way he says next comes the
shock all right well what shot and then
he follows that with the head first
immersion into the cold water
well they thought was cold playing with
new combinations Frank wanted the reader
to reframe the swimming pool as more
than some convenient and measured place
to practice therefore he combined the
steam of the warm pool with the eeriness
of a misty swamp in a whirl wolf movie
and the juxtaposition of these two
images help Frank Express again his
ambivalence about the pool a plane with
compressed dualities
Frank understood that irony and paradox
causes the reader to pause and to think
instead of saying I love to swim but I
hate to he compressed dissing buildings
into the phrase inexplicable compulsion
this phrase captures his dual feelings
about competitive swimming
he practices out of a need to do at a
compulsion but not out of a reason to do
and it's inexplicable the compressed
expression inexplicable compulsion
presents these opposing feelings as
living simultaneously within him that's
what irony is the holding of two
opposing facts or feelings as opposed to
just listing them one after another now
we saw this same structure with Karen
the child gluing doodads on the two
before he can press two actions into one
when he got extra glue on the stick so
he could use them for two placements on
the two before so this is a duality that
he invented and later when he got to
next slide please
got these two plastic doodads at once so
the 1 &amp;amp; 1 become a pair so this kind of
structure this mental structure exists
even in three-year-olds when they're
playing with things as mundane as
blowing doodads on a two-by-four if you
really slow down and look at what
children do you begin to see their
thinking the structure of their action
gives you insight into the rules are
using to generate those actions
okay to continue this discussion of
children's play as a precursor to
Frank's essay
I'll show you Tyler pretending to cut
down trees with a chainsaw you will see
Tyler use an orange plastic tent stake
as the pretend blade of a chainsaw to
tell the story of tree trimming tree
limbs literation Tyler buzzes his lips
loud at times soft at times even
shifting into an idling noise between
cuts after you watch this delightful
video clip we will circle back to me
make parallels to Frank here are a few
things to note as you watch how Tyler
uses the retracting handle of a bicycle
pump to simulate the felling of the tree
how he pretends that the chainsaw will
not start and how the bicycle pump
becomes part of the chainsaw when the
tenth stake is out of reach here we go
Oh
time's it just won't start
okay so above all else we see the
cleverness and creativity of Tyler's
play how he invents symbols modifies
them and communicates his thoughts
through enactment in a non trivial sense
Tyler is writing a story let's look at
some specifics of this play that reveal
out this way similar to phrase al biet
in mime rather than in words the
spacebar there's a little clip at the
end where he pretends that the tent
stake now is a leaf blower and he goes
around the floor
blowing imaginary leaves but this is on
our website you can look at it you have
to clean up your mess okay so while the
entire episode is pretence parts of
Tyler's play are truly out of the box
how is he to represent the gradual
process of cutting through a limb or a
tree trunk he slowly lowers the handle
of the bicycle pump he's asking us to
think about how the chainsaw works it
does not lop off the limb in one swift
move like a machete it takes time and
even though the telescoping of the
handle is not a literal version of a
blade sinking deeper into a limb the
symbol does capture this element of time
the as if takes priority over the what
is there are a number of places where
Tyler keeps us engaged in this story by
throwing in a bit of surprise think back
to his animated tug on the starter rope
followed by no buzzing of the lips he
captured something funny by enacting a
stubborn chainsaw that will not start
the playful mind is open to using
different symbols to represent a story
element when Tyler could not reach the
tent stake when he wanted to start the
saw he shifted the action to the base of
the bicycle pump and later the part you
didn't see but you can on the website
the tent stake itself
became a leaf blower this flexibility
comes from his lightheartedness towards
his goals so again there are many more
examples of Tyler's adventures and
inventiveness but since we are going to
move on and if you'd like to learn more
about the meaning of the video clips
that we've shared we invite you to visit
us at WWE TV com so now we'll shift to
our own professional development we
transcend we transitioned into this last
area consideration which presents us
with several questions how can we both
deepen our understanding of the value of
play and share our new understanding
with each other with other parents or
the teachers colleagues how do we all
participate in this construction of
expertise I hope you felt some of the
power of digital video to slow down and
see children thinking or as we like to
say see what children know because when
you slow down it really reveals the high
level thinking in children's play but
what if hundreds of people could observe
the same video and construct a shared
meaning gradually such video would
become a definition of the abstract
concepts that it represents a social
contract of a green meaning which is not
so common particularly in early
education we don't have many shared
references shared examples of even
commonly used standards like the phrase
you see in all state standards does
child take risk or does child show
leadership or is this program a child
centered approach we have so many
different understandings of those terms
we don't really communicate well we
would propose that if we could share
video clips that video instantiation
would solve this problem at least
knowing what each other means
so let's show you the result of one
project we did in our online course at
MIT it is where a large number of people
deconstructed a shared video on child
leadership in this video and Ellen will
walk you through this hannah organizes a
tea party it's delightful for her
friends she shows great skill and her
leadership and recruiting players
maintaining the flow of play all the
while maintaining and reestablishing her
authority as a director of the play the
video clip has become a classic and
early education many early educators use
this clip to show what they mean by the
phrase shows leadership this phrase is
now both contextualized in the real flow
of an authentic episode of pretend play
but it's also key worded or abstracted
to define the sub skills of leadership
and I think that's where the real power
comes in now Ellen will present this
episode in segments so that she can
pause and identify what these sub skills
are okay meet Hannah in this our last
video clip we'd like to you to a watch
how three year old Hannah completely
orchestrates the story about being sick
and then having tea she makes sure
everyone has a part while at the same
time maintains her unchallenged role as
the director we will note her leadership
skills as she sets the beam recruits new
players makes adjustments when things
don't work and even finds a clever way
to eject an adult who talks out of turn
guess who
setting the theme Hannah starts out
telling Benjamin and you need to get
some rest mommy later she changes him
into daddy benjamin immediately goes
into the sick bay under the stairs
watch how skillfully hannah blends the
pre-established roll
a pretend dog into her theme don't you
love the way she pauses and wait for
this pretend dog to answer in dog talk
enforcing the theme Hana realizes that
Benjamin has to be isolated for a reason
she explains that he has to wait for the
doctor to come when Benjamin tries to
escape the boredom of sick bay she
gently pushes him back in and says stay
in bed daddy
I'm outta here
No you'll come out
recruiting more players hannah has
promised Benjamin that the doctor will
come however there is no person to play
the role of dr. Benjamin is getting
tired of being in sickbay
she tries to recruit William to be the
doctor but William does not respond what
to do
making adjustments Hanna knows that
Benjamin will want to come out but she
has recently told him to stay in bed and
have some food
so she devises a way to satisfy both
Jett Benjamin's desire to come out and
her Authority she pretends that the
doctor has instructed her to tell
Benjamin to have his food at the table
everything's done sort of her directive
go ahead come out so but it's all in the
context of the theme she's in charge
clarifying roles the play has been
proceeding for about ten minutes now
George joins the play with an intention
of bumping up the children's level of
reflection on what they are saying
soon after William returns to the scene
and Hanna wants to be sure that she
knows his role after all it just
wouldn't do for the director to be out
of the loop William explains that he is
the cooker
now the daddy is feeling better
Hannah invites all to a tea party she
becomes the gracious host pouring
pretend tea in each person's cup but in
George's attempt to have Hannah think
about time and space such as how long
one has to pour a full cup of tea Hannah
truly shows her ability to deal with
demands
I'm trying to say if I have a bid cup
then you need to hold the pot tilted
longer so it's time in space there was
such a small amount that's just a tiny
tiny bit oh I see a lot in there I want
some more
I saw the look dealing with the spread
of demands Georgia's request for more
tea spreads to other players William
insists he has no tea hannah apologizes
and pours from the endless pot of
imaginary tea into Williams Cup but
William following in George's footsteps
insists that he only has a little bit
when George affirms that William needs
some more tea Hannah says coyly oh I bet
he does
ejecting the talkee adults as George
continues to ask the children to reflect
on what they are saying Hannah seems to
grow in impatience with his presence she
cannot just ask George outright to leave
so she reminds all of the participants
of their roles and assigns George the
role of a sick patient and as a sick
patient George must go to another part
of the room
displacing the taki adult all this time
hannah has not had her own chair perhaps
she feels that if she had a chair of her
own her leadership role would be more
tangible guess whom she asks to give her
his seat bidding farewell to the taki
adult in the end
George excuses himself and thanks the
children for allowing him to play with
them Hannah in words that might express
some ambivalence about George's leaving
says come on go on and was that last
gesture a gentle push out the door or a
friendly pat on the leg
come back okay okay Thank You Hana
reconvenes her group and the play goes
on with William finishing his chocolate
cake and Benjamin as the planet Pleasant
beneficiary of Hana Hana the coast and
William the cook Hana has shown she is
truly a skillful leader Hana for
president
we love that clip and like I say we
played this in an online course and we
had a lot of back and forth about what
it means and I think what you've seen is
a distillation of that work so there you
see that a glib phrase such as child
shows leadership has been exemplified a
through digital video co-constructed by
many educators who viewed this same
video so in the end result we have a
more refined understanding of the sub
skills of leadership plus a real-time
application of these skills by Hana in
an ordinary moment of her day so it
really has the theory and the the
practice imagine a website such as
YouTube just pull that one out of the
air where one could watch video clips of
children engaged in intelligent behavior
of doing during ordinary moments of the
day and everybody could see these clips
if we use these public video clips as
our data base for creating our
professional knowledge base than I think
the profession would truly evolve we
could write about child development we
could write about parenting we could
write about teaching we could write
about learning and then we could go to
the database select clips that
exemplified what we were talking about
and then people could debate with us
because they would have a better
understanding of what we meant by our
writings and I think the age of the
image is certainly here and text will be
a parallel symbol system but not the
only symbol system so what if we had
such a data base we could search it
after we indexed it we could discover
new things about children we could see
what children actually do what teachers
do what parents actually do and we could
even take video clips lay them out in a
string and show longitudinally the
development of some aspect of
development itself here's a mock-up of a
searchable database we used extensive
support folio to do this and each of
these thumbnails is a first poster frame
of a video clip and if you click on the
clip video launches but at the bottom
you can also type in search words and
when you hit the return all the video
clips that have that keyword is returned
so here's what would happen if I okay
but so the whoa you're a little
bah-bah-bah routine here we go dead
already
we canna discover it right
one day just playing around so that's a
type of babbling it's not the only type
it's kind of supported by a playful
adult but if I had four or five clips
that were returned when I typed in
babbling you could even see these
nuances and get a clearer more refined
understanding of what textbooks mean
when they say Dada babbling is precursor
to - speaking natural language and it is
if you follow the course of babbling it
too has its own course and it sounds
like sentences and it has inflection in
fact it has more inflection at the
beginning than anything else there's a
book called language in the crib and
this mother video recorded her child's
babbling and actually analyzed it so
anyway that could be one use to see
development by using a searchable
database so the clip itself becomes
highly contextualized shared definition
of early language development in this
case babbling other video clips could
show more spontaneous babbling and there
we could see useful nuances of this
otherwise general term currently this
practice of sharing imagery is used in
everyday conversation as we refer to a
movie we saw or something on television
like oh you mean kaki the way Paul
Newman was in Cool Hand Luke or you
might say well I'll tell you why I'm
going to vote for Obama did you see his
speech on racism last week so we have
these shared images because of broadcast
images and we cross-reference them as we
try to understand each other's meanings
and motives but they're not really an
indexed database these shared references
do move us along in our debates because
at least we're talking about the same
thing but we have no such iconic visual
anchors and child development or early
childhood education we do have some good
books that we all read in love and refer
to and Vivian Paley stories but no video
that I know of that we refer to nor is
there any accumulative or indexed
knowledge base that even come from
watching movies and television this all
sort of random and casual but the
Internet can help once again the
Internet has opened up new possibilities
for creating a new form of knowledge and
a new format for professional
development a knowledge that is rich
both in theory and explanation but
mapped to visual examples so note that
I'm not talking about book with the CD
in the back with a lot of videos or even
an e-book that has embedded video I'm
talking about a public video database
I'm not even talking about the
occasional blog that has videos for
people to write I'm talking about
something that's constructed by hundreds
of people or wicka if you will managed
online community or Wikipedia of child
development this would be wonderful a
lot of people wanted it's very labor
intensive somebody's going to do it
we're experts parents and teachers can
contribute keywords and comments to any
video clip that they watch it could be
searchable in a manner that helps it
grow both in scope and organization we
chose to make this proposal to Google
because you're in the middle of this new
age of searchable assets but what makes
this powerful is the debate that it will
yield of the discussion that the video
database will encourage this format will
help us understand what other people
mean and help us more constructively
disagree and it has great implications
for cross-cultural professional
development understanding other cultures
so they call it the democratization of
documentation the democratization
documentation has many ramifications and
I'm just name a few and then we're going
to break for Q&amp;amp;A so some of these
bullets may be interesting to you so it
can make a mental note if you would like
in early education there's this tendency
to use kind of Solus standards they're
just sort of lists that are almost
vacuous instead of using authentic
moments captured on video index and
posted for everyone to see we could
change that we could use video clips the
document quality as opposed to just
scores on some kind of list of standards
and this would remove that distance
between the raw data the real experience
that we have some an intuitive
understanding of and the scores we read
as we evaluate programs and try to
understand where the children are
because numbers may be good for
quantifying differences but they're not
really in and of themselves useful for
understanding what it is you're counting
you have to have another source and
video because they're tight and
searchable could provide it an
alternative to numbers a browsable video
database can be used to transfer
knowledge from expert to novice in a
manner that maintains this close mapping
between theory and practice all young
teachers have great courses in theory of
Education theory of child of element
they have really good practical
experiences but the two just aren't
mapped together they can't apply their
theory when they get into the classroom
because they didn't learn theory that
way they learned it from textbooks they
didn't learn it as an overlay to real
examples and video combined with text
could marry theory and practice and
parents would watch these video clips we
hope but not to find a rainy day
activity but to observe how children
learn the unfolding of how children
think as they play so and we maintain
that this image of the child the
understanding and
learning to observe is important for
being an effective parent by just
knowing what toys to buy and what
materials to have available but how to
look at what your children do as they
play so to summarize here the statements
we made earlier and again you can use
these we're go for these kind of quickly
plays defined as by a casual attitude
toward activity success is achieved by
practice and defined by attaining goals
understanding is achieved by reflection
and requires knowing what something is
not and then here are the four
statements we use to analyze Frank and
Tyler about how it improves performance
play explores the as if play wishes for
surprise play is unperturbed by failure
a play delights in recombinations and
our final big picture anchor statements
about play success without play will not
yield understanding success
excuse me success without understanding
will not create meaning and love of work
and finally understanding without
sharing will not create quality so to
wrap up consider this statement that
success without understanding will not
create meaning and love of work we want
our children to balance work and light
heartedness nothing without joy to
combine success with purpose to develop
a knowledge of how their work
contributes to their sense of self a
self-centered in the context of one's
social and physical space and play helps
to define work in this view from above
using a view of the pattern of what I'm
doing and therefore giving it meaning
and satisfaction to work and you may
know the book by Daniel H pink a whole
new mine I recommend it while the
right-brainers are going to inherit the
world you can
can take or leave the subtitle but
anyway he states in this book
playfulness is showing itself to be an
accurate marker for managerial
effectiveness emotional intelligence and
the thinking style that deals with holes
and patterns and he goes on to say in
his book the workforce of the future
will need these right brain skills more
than in the past so just to conclude
when you watch a child skiped instead of
walk acknowledge that as a path to
Harvard so now we would love to hear
your reactions your contributions your
stories your ordinary moments because we
have plenty of time for whatever
questions you might have working in a
professional way with children do I have
some teachers in ok and parents that
aren't working with children and so are
any non parents non teachers here you
know Googlers ok great
this we think will be on YouTube and we
hope to set it up I don't know how we
can but I hope we can set it up as a way
you can dialogue with us after you've
gone to YouTube or you can go to our
website you have the question in the
wise the Hana yeah
peacefully yeah yeah yeah and I think
that's important with her structure I
think the play has a flow right but what
what would you do differently as the
adult if you start recognizing conflict
the person that got banished into
underneath the stair right because he
was sick if he started kind of being
showing conflict saying no I don't want
to do that what would you do as an adult
to continue the theme going
does that make sense yes of course take
that question is comes up not
infrequently in school and I think our
tendency is to let the play develop
because the chil we find that when the
children are given the time in the space
they can negotiate conflict they have
the tools and so knowing that hannah is
the leader of the play if some of the
participants in the play are seen by her
to be reluctant to continue in that vein
then she may and I think she does in
some ways edit the script as you noticed
so she invites him to come out and
that's work
or we don't jump in to the activity and
stand back and we provide were
supporting in the in a potential
altercation that the children will
surprise us and more and more we come to
understand that they do have these
skills from negotiating with one another
and then the children sometimes if
they're not if at play isn't going along
the way they want then such such the
same as William who we didn't want to be
the doctor they'll walk out of the play
and then maybe return with a new role in
mind as he came back as the cooker or
they may leave a play and not and not
stay so we've got lots and lots of video
on the website that talked about
children entering play how do children
enter the play we think about how
children maintain the play how children
negotiate within play and how children
protect the play and then the roles of
leader and the roles of the child who's
you know in in the play but not directly
leading the play so it's very exciting
and interesting to follow and if we
watch stand back and watch and then
document and then look again we get a
lot of information I think more so than
if we jump in so does that help yes
thank you how long has your study been
going okay this one works a thing works
yeah say something oh hello
alright I'll just cure that so how long
have you been studying this children
play chew and splay Oh who was
personally yeah 33 years all right
what do you think that makes a
difference I see I asked that question
seriously because I hope it doesn't I
think we encourage the parents and
teachers to slow down and look and we
find that when they do they see
incredible things particularly if I
sometimes
teasingly say I don't learn from
watching children I learned from
watching video of children because I can
slow down and there's just you need good
tools of mind to do good work but
everybody's got video cameras now so I
think if I'm maybe going slightly beyond
the motive of your question I would say
yeah I've been doing this a long time
but I don't think one has to get a PhD
in cognitive development to see the
elegance and the high level thinking and
play I'm counting on it
okay thank you sometimes it's just being
given permission to slow down and
observe I think professional educators
sometimes feel like if they're just
watching the children they're not doing
their job and parents also feel that oh
if I just watch my daughter or son I'm
not really helping them grow but you're
going to do a worse job trying to help
them if you don't know why you're doing
what you're doing so I always say you
make a parallel entry into the pot
child's play you watch the child for a
number of minutes you get an idea of
what they're doing and then you enter
not head-on or perpendicular but like
you enter a causeway you know
kind of a parallel entry haven't have
enough question so yes it's very
interesting cuz I know thanks to the
teachers here at at Google right I've
begun to understand better kind of the
value play success etc and you
introduced kind of understanding as a
new element there that hadn't been
thought of before I know at least with
my kids right I've never really taken
into account reflection what you've
mentioned to I look back and talk to
them well what did you do how did you do
that right I just wanted to know if you
have tips to help with a reflection like
as an example my kids son suddenly
started liking to do puzzles right and
so after jigsaw puzzles yeah so I've
been game with a farm board or without a
farm board
you put them in a space you know it's
just an empty like you know 24 pieces
jigsaw puzzle there's no farm board no
no they just like a picture in they're
doing it together right and so I'm like
wow that's pretty good but how can I use
that I think that they like the puzzles
and use the reflection so to help with
their play success that's a very good
question I actually spend a whole summer
in a microbus going from school to
school watching children put jigsaw
puzzle together as part of a research
project Ben Allen you know help out on
this see I have a style and it has a it
has a long history I mean it comes from
a theory of teaching and learning it's
based on the importance of being
confused and so what I try to do
paradoxically is try to confuse the
child in a what I think is a
constructive way
for example we gave children jigsaw
puzzles that are you buy but some of
some of them we took that jigsaw puzzle
and we painted the picture on some
masonite and we cut it up so that the
shape of the piece is no longer fit the
shape of the elements in the jigsaw
puzzle so if there's a hat
shape painted on the piece the Hat piece
was somewhere else so the contour no
longer match the so it made them think
just a little bit more so sometimes you
can you know give them something that's
just a little bit more difficult or we
gave them a jigsaw puzzle where all the
pieces were the same shape they were all
kind of hexagonal and the little kids
would put it together and it was all
scrambled it's like scrambled eggs and
they were just as proud as they could be
because their task was to get all the
pieces in the farm board but you know
when they're little older they realize
the objective is to reconstruct the
picture so or I might give them a piece
that doesn't fit and see how they
accommodate you don't have to say
anything you just start about changing
the task a little bit make it slightly
harder but I wouldn't go the route of
giving them a piece with more pieces
that's kind of silly
you know they doing a 24 piece jigsaw
puzzle I wouldn't give them a 36 piece
just to say oh that's harder I would
think about the strategies the children
use and how the change in the jigsaw
puzzle draws on new strategies the other
thing in terms of your question about
reflection is that we try have been
trying
or challenging us ourselves when we're
talking with with children to stay close
to the action so to think about what
they're doing instead of the end product
so made to clarify a little bit and a
tendency would be you know what is this
a puzzle of or what are you making wow
you know the bus's you're making a bust
in the butt and then what color is the
bus and talking about the the noun what
it is and what it looks like but what we
have tried to challenge ourselves to do
is try to talk more about the action
because a child is busy doing something
so we want to stay close to that and ask
about you know you turn that piece
around do you think that that piece
might fit better if you turn it or you
know a reflection on what the child is
doing or what the child might be doing
to help with the puzzle does that make
sense yeah sometimes
mm-hmm so right so we're also we're
taught the child is busy doing something
and we're reflecting on that action so
reflection on action versus reflection
on the product you know the end piece
and that's just another another idea
that you might want to think about when
you're working to stay away from asking
questions oh I mean you can make
declarative statements like oh I know
that you turn that piece around I
noticed you were doing that piece and
not so much tell me what you're thinking
you're not going to get in by the way
they're playing anyway they kind of want
to pause to answer your questions they
want what so you just you're there
you're you get in their head and say wow
your guests as to what they're thinking
you don't say oh you're thinking that if
you turn that is going to fit I mean you
don't have to go that far but you say oh
you turn them you choose what to say but
if you think it's a strategic move they
made it's related to something
but I think I think we've always thought
that as a kids playing you're supposed
to say something like oh what's that
you're doing you mean it's it's wrong to
ask those kind of things that's really
funny because I've been doing that from
day one
don't say okay we gotta like have
another kid and start like for instance
my son he's four and a half and lately
he's really been excited about doing
what he calls experiments and he'll be
you know in the bathroom in the sink and
putting like cups on top of bigger cups
with water flowing over at all and he'll
say mom I'm making an experiment do you
want to come see my experiment so I'll
just watch him but I you just think
alike so what do you think is happening
so what would you do to like really
encourage that
that's where intelligent comes from you
don't learn from experience you learn
from reflection of experience and you
learn and you learn what the pattern of
experiences in declarative statements
help children encode their so whatever
is going on to the child is already yeah
you say oh that's sweet I'm one more
question I had was about the essay the
Princeton Review essay yeah so you said
that relates to play or play is good for
someone like that because it teaches you
how to write with the imagination slant
on how to be creative and and I think
what you have to do is quit worrying
about this kind of accurate rendering of
your experience aback off think about
you know analogies and be playful with
it I mean one way we define play what it
was it's kind of distancing yourself
from product and kind of trying this and
that and then using some of the things
you invent through playfulness it makes
it more interesting but you know we're
kind of taking the wordplay and morphing
it into the way English teachers talk
about writing it's not a forced fit
though it's just kind of weird using the
vocabulary of play talk about a literacy
yes
so this is really interesting to learn
that you know it isn't always good to
sort of be emphasizing how great it is
what they what the kids are doing there
is a lot of literature out there though
about how that's how you build
confidence and self-worth of the child
and you know when they sort of go out
into the big bag world this is the kind
of stuff that they're gonna remember
that oh they're really great and and
that's how they picked themselves up
when they fall and so forth and I my
babies just a year old so I'm very new
to all this so would you elaborate some
more on how you can achieve that as well
and then secondly are there other things
that you see you know parents doing that
or that would be sort of natural would
you know its quote-unquote natural to us
which is actually not very helpful to
the children because I'd like to avoid
that yeah it is all these questions have
been wonderful I think one of the things
that we talk about even in our work in
the school and also with parents and
working home living at home is about
authenticity so it's really about what's
real I mean if you and this how I feel
George may or may not agree but if you
see your one-year-old doing something
that's stellar too you say wow that's
amazing I mean that's if it's authentic
if it really comes from where you are
but often we get to the point and the
children know it that we're just you
know that's great oh that's wonderful
and it becomes almost a cliche and it
becomes to the child white noise in some
ways because it it's not it's just it's
something you do you see you see
something that the child is working on
and then you comment that's wonderful
but it but but if it's if it's really
exciting to you then yeah go with it
that's how I feel and then going along
with that even with reflections I mean
ask the questions that you you know
would want someone to ask you while
you're doing an activity or while you're
engaged in an experiment you know what
what what are you curious about what are
you wondering and what are you thinking
about what your child is doing and and
make those conversations but sometimes
it seems like we do we find that we do
talk to children in a different
away and so we comment you know for I
was talking about this kind of now and
talk and itinerary talk but the noun and
adjective talk so you know I never would
encounter one of you and you know the
halls at Google and say you know it's
really nice to meet you and I really
love your sweater or you know I or what
color is your shirt today
but we asked children sometimes
questions that don't go along with the
read it yeah your I hear a chuckle
because it's it's true and we just we
ask them questions and then at a certain
point we know that they know that we
know the answer to those questions
questions but we're still asking them so
as some of it I think the word authentic
keeps coming into my mind make it be
authentic like I'm sitting next to you
and I'm really wondering and I'm really
thinking about what you're doing and
it's and sometimes and it's incredible
and I want to say it but if it's real
you know if it really comes from inside
we'll give you a reference it's kind of
an old one but I think it's still
opportune hime good not do you know it's
GI n ot T between parent and child I've
still see it in Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and he
has a chapter in there it's called the
case of the flying ashtray and it's
about a parent who had just turned back
to their child in the backseat of a car
in a long trip saying oh you're so
wonderful and then the child takes the
ashtray and flings it into the front
back then where everybody was smoking
flings the ashtray and then the mother
asks doctor cannot why did the son do
that well it turned out that when the
mother turned around and said you're so
wonderful the boy was thinking about
wouldn't it be great if there was an
accident and the car was split down the
middle and the brother sitting in the
front seat would be killed but the
mother and father would survive and he
would survive and it'd just be he and
his mom and dad so he wasn't feeling too
good about himself when this great
generalized expression came back you're
so wonderful but if the mother had
turned around and said you're being very
quiet thank you
he couldn't really deny that and it
doesn't really create anxiety about his
bad thoughts I think the problem with
some of our praise it's so general that
the child doesn't really know what you
mean by good job is it because you've
finally finished it or because it looked
like or what is it but if you say to a
child wow
therefore now that are in the stack and
the child knows they've been doing three
for a long time and he was really trying
to get that for now the child makes the
inference I know what I did my parent
observed me close enough to know what it
is I was trying to do so I feel like I
have a real audience here that
understands me and I don't need my
parent to give that broad general
statement good job I deduced that and it
empowers children you're talking about
self-concept it really comes when
children feel they're empowered to be
competent not when they're dependent on
you for telling them when they're
competent so the more specifics you give
about their competency the better they
feel
I think that's cannot sort of position
but it's it has a lot of nuance to it
one more thing just because we had a lot
of examples of George's son Jed and my
son Sam when he was 3 years old was
talking to me one day and my mind was
filled with other things as all of our
minds are often filled with and and you
know he can't he repeated something he'd
said before and I said Sam I hear you
and he said well you are hearing me mom
but you're not listening to me and I
think that in some how is concept
encapsulate sit we want our children to
know that where we hear them and we're
also listening to what they're saying
listening to what they're saying
listening to what they're doing and
responding in kind so again that idea of
being authentic I wanted to know when
you go out in the world you're just at
the grocery store you're walking by a
part
and as experts in watching children and
knowing what helps them to grow what is
the one thing or a couple of things that
you see parents doing that you wish you
could walk up to them and say something
about but you never would one thing I'm
particularly sensitive about because I
had an older sibling to do this to me
all the time is to undo my initiative
now you have to be careful because
you're in a grocery store you can't do
just anything now I'm from Massachusetts
and it's I think like no other place in
the world
it looks like parents have all read the
parent guides so in the grocery stores
in Amherst where I live of a child you
know is asking 100 questions the parent
will answer every single question you
know they're right in there
but it's because they really want their
children's initiative to be heard but
then I think in some towns I've heard
that this happens the parent will say
quit asking so many questions
now of course everybody has their limits
but that's one of my little pet answers
tell about your stove know it was let's
see I have to get some thought but I
think this idea of thinking together
with children I do think George I would
pick piggy back on what George is saying
this idea of we do tend to give children
the answers and not because we're
hurried but often because we expect that
a question will yield an answer and that
sometimes thinking together about what
could be the answer of that up to that
question and coming up with some ideas
and not necessarily doesn't have to be
in a grocery store a public place but
this idea again of sitting together and
really brainstorming and also thinking
and this kind of maybe off this off the
question but thinking aloud I think a
lots of times we and we challenge
ourselves at the school to think with
the children so we will all
so talk about what we're how we're
thinking about something like I'm
wondering or I am curious about this or
I wonder if we did it this way because
you really are you know if you maybe
turn the cups upside down under the
running water what might happen so you
know it's again this idea of thinking
together with the children and then the
children the idea of of opening up your
minds and speaking about your strategies
and your theories together then you
become what we call partners in the play
partners in the learning thinking
together learning together but lots of
times I think as adults we do a lot of
because we would talk inside of our
heads you know we don't wear as children
young children as they're taught they
work and they talk and we have the
self-talk that we sometimes omit some of
the steps some of our thinking and and
then we lose the threat of a
conversation that we could have with
children and I've actually done parent
workshops on this one where and parents
realize this they can't seem to sit on
their hands they chose doing a jigsaw
puzzle and we videotaped parents playing
with the children and they said oh my
goodness my hands were always in there I
wasn't letting this child wasn't letting
my child figure it out on his own that's
the common mistake I think again parents
feel like they have to be active that
you know
oh I remember my father taught me how to
fish so I'm going to teach my child how
to fish and you get out there and you
make it kind of onerous and didactic and
whereas of course my father was
different he would take me fishing and
he would do nothing and but I learned
how to fish he was Madeline apprentice
well kids learn by watching and we
learned about kids by watching them so I
think to kind of back off a bit and
realize that observing is an important
important part not just observing but
interpreting and that's where you know
other parents can come in and why we
like to talk too about video because we
share our interpretations oh here yeah
thanks for your presentation
I was just wondering as an expecting
father
my wife and I are expecting in October
if you guys provide any resources or
make any recommendations perhaps on your
website about earlier development for
for newborns and so forth for play and
maybe even through the toddler stage and
in late later on into life I know in at
the beginning of your presentation you
said play doesn't stop in in adulthood
and I loved that six months I would say
our youngest clips are six months all
the way up to six years so gonna be with
us for six years if you like but write
us we'll hear anybody else that wants
one of the heat particularly for
expectant parents and I'll put these
here if anybody else wants them but we
love email and we answer it so like your
question about you know good job
we will dialogue with you about that
week because it helps us help others
having as Ellen says authentic dialogue
with parents and teachers how do you do
deal with frustration how do you help a
child cope with frustration so they're
playing they're doing a jigsaw puzzle
can't get a piece in their life I can't
do this this is hard I don't want to do
this how do you encourage them along
because you know part of the thing for
long-term success is overcoming those
frustrations dealing with them right and
continue playing perseverance we talked
a little bit about lending knowledge as
an adult so if we need to lend our
children this knowledge in order for
them to get over a possible frustration
we do it but again it's authentic it's
that we and I think that it's if you you
see that the child is becoming so
frustrated and just a little bit of a
hint would help the child go forward in
their learning then do it and you know
George I could surely was the one who
taught me that once and you know and
when he's observing in the school and he
said you know it's okay if the child is
stuck in order to learn something they
needle they need your support and your
knowledge
go ahead and do that you know so I think
I think it depends on the child depends
on the situation and as you get to know
children your own children and as we get
to know the children in our schools we
can see where the child is getting to
that point that I can't do and no it's
too frustrating and I'll just walk away
from it if we want to help them that's
why we say supporting the children but
the child is leading but we're
supporting them and sometimes we have to
take the lead for a moment knowing that
we're sharing our knowledge with them
and they'll be sharing their knowledge
back with us step back and think why
it's important for the child to be
successful again we said you know play
is not so much about success sometimes a
task or game gets to be a cause and
that's a little dangerous when like
children at age seven they get into this
very literal stage of drawing and if
their drawings don't look like what
thing they're trying to draw they get
really frustrated it's called the
literal stage that usually passes but as
much as you can and it may be by you
leaving the room try to have the child
reconnect with just the free fun of it
the thing about puzzles though they
really have a clear finish you know you
know and you've done it and you know
when you have it it could be that if you
could find activities that don't have
such a clear gold it might be better
like blocks that are open-ended and you
can do a lot of different things with
blocks yes my siblings and you know my
one is four and a half the other ones
two and a half they both think that
they're the exact same age and they want
to do you know the exact same thing and
and when like for instance at the end of
the day when I'm picking them up from
school they'll both want to talk to me
and I've noticed lately the big thing
they both want to talk at the same time
and so I'm trying to figure out a way to
like how to both of them being heard you
know let me showing them that I'm
hearing both of them but they both want
to talk at the exact same time and you
can't just tell the one to be quiet so
the other one can talks I'm I'm just
like having us really Monday Wednesday
and Friday lunch I like that smile a
very practical suggestion I mean right
there when they're both wanting to talk
to the same sure say it's Monday you got
to go second that's what I mean but
that's doesn't come from any you know 33
years of just kind of what I thought of
when you asked the question what would
you do yeah I have it
I you know sometimes having a finding a
solution in the in that moment when
there's tension is more difficult so I
guess my what I would do and what we
often will do at the school and there's
an altercation or there's something
similar to this
all the children want to talk at the
same time let's say when you're sharing
something and together in the morning is
to talk about the situation before it
happens again after it happens but
before it happens again so this to me
would be a quiet night
you know before a bedtime and again this
is idea of pair adults talking about
what they're thinking like I'm I'm
concerned that every when I pick you up
at school I love to see you both but you
both want to talk to me at the same time
and I don't think I can really pay
attention to both of you at the same
time what's a good solution and we know
that from you know all the leadership
courses that we've taken that the best
thing to do in terms of solution finding
a solution is to get the players
involved so that way the children become
part of the solution and then we see
that these the rules that children make
together in a classroom or in at home
are the ones they follow because they
were part of creating them so again the
site you know opening up and saying this
is a problem for me I know it's a
problem for you both why don't we all
sit you know talk together and find out
what we might want to do and they might
come up with the Monday Wednesday Friday
Tuesday Thursday solution
well yeah I mean I've heard in the past
from someone else that said it's really
good to enforce family rules and so
whenever is something like that would
happen then you would say no remember
our family rule is today you're gonna
talk first then tomorrow on Tuesday and
they'll remind each other to because
they're part they were part of creating
the solution okay thanks sorry I got
another question so so you know as part
of the plaything right so my son is two
and a half years old my daughter's four
and a half years old right so you know
there we say oh let's draw a house right
so my son starts you know squabbling
stuff right scribbling stuff my daughter
draws that nice house right and I said
Oh William that looks good right I see
you're coming along with the house and
my daughter goes no that's not a house
that's a horrible that's a he just
scribble squabbling so how do I kind of
you know cuz she's putting down my son
right you know but I want two and four
oh yeah he's trying you know crazy he's
trying he's trying his best let him you
know do this imagine it said well how
would you handle that situation to
either one you know get my daughter to
shut up and start saying such bad things
right about my son or to you know still
you know have my son continue doing what
he's doing guys he's you know two and a
half years old yeah you called it the
house well I said well he's trying his
he's trying to draw a house
yeah because he says this is house
curved over each other make some
descriptive comment about the mark
themselves the kind of marks relate to
the other mark
oh you discover Lin you need to rely on
strength true which is
characteristically
that age when you start it's a childhood
volunteer the house the child says the
word house
he says team I would say to the child
does look like a house will be I would
and then again this is because it I
don't really want children to think
about the readability of their bar you
can say
I was all right better yet I would I
would just sort of let his comment the
house go by out of the way and then try
to have this mark conversation if you
email me I'll send you an article
it's about growing and what what we can
say when children make marks and how it
may have them reflect of what they're
doing because the representation is not
really what they're about and they say
those things just to please you by
guessing they call it a house but
probably what he's really having fun
with and we're liking about is how you
know all these things look like a big
swirl or something connect about it but
but not this mark stands for this
reference world that's interesting so
what he's trying he goes look look that
house yeah there are a lot of reasons
like that but my guess is that we could
get in his head as he's making a mark
he's not thinking house house house
house house he's saying look dude this I
can cover up the whole thing there's
some of these thinking and that's where
I would hope we would go rather than
what he says because of the social
context and you're kind of projecting
your interpretation he might feel about
what
and sometimes it is the result of this
culture that we do though I saying
before that we have created where we're
asking constantly asking children what
do you doing what are you making what
are you doing so if this child if your
son has heard if you have if you create
something it has to have a name because
people keep asking me what it is that
I'm making
then the noun talk but it's a if the if
if the culture is one in which the
child's marks are being reflected on the
car child's actions more than what the
child is making then they don't feel
compelled to have to give it a name all
the time so I mean it could be this is
just speculation wow it's still there
that's why mark
how they look because they represent the
movement you just made or you continue
to make where you stop at least our
flight weeding footprints in the snow
and that too is an illiteracy to read
mark understand what did I do to
generate that fellow mark that loser
actually so um the the question and and
this discussion that she reminded me of
a funny incident that that happened with
me that might actually hold some lessons
I was a teenager and I was playing with
my little cousin who I don't even know
how old she was and what she was a
toddler and you know very young and we
were both coloring and we finished
coloring and I looked at what she had
done and her coloring was impeccable in
terms of absolutely within the lines and
mine you know I thought it was pretty
good but it actually wasn't as precisely
within the lines as hers was and she
looked over to me and she said well you
tried that might be a good response that
you know I may not you might not think
that this is a house but you know he
tried and you know I definitely felt
good that my little cousin was saying
that my coloring job wasn't as bad as
apparently she had evaluated so can we
just do a little roundup applauses for
the small group that's here
