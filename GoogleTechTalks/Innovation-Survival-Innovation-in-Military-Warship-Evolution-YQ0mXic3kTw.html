pleasure to introduce you to our speaker
David Schroeder Dave Schroeder is a
veteran Silicon Valley executive and
entrepreneur he is presently on leave as
a semantic technology network
editor-in-chief where he oversaw
corporate data protection technology and
systems security technical publishing as
well as a monthly newsletter distributed
to about 120,000 global readers david
has a master's degree in applied
mathematics from the California
Institute of Technology and an MBA from
the University of Southern California
whenever possible he lectures at
universities such as Stanford and MIT
and immerses Silicon Valley companies in
his favorite subject innovation david
has authored 10 technical books and six
commercial software programs for a
variety of computing architectures using
several different languages his
soon-to-be published eleventh book
follows ten years of research and is
titled innovation survival concept
courage and change so without further
ado David schockner very much in ladies
and gentlemen is a privilege to return
to a Google I have to thanks for this
return trip the first is for putting the
aid relief request on your home search
page for a few days I deeply appreciate
that and was genuinely moved the second
thing is is as a published author I was
not convinced that Google's digital book
effort and scanning in the libraries was
a good thing I didn't know if it was a
bad thing I wasn't convinced I am now a
full square on proponent for it and in
fact today if you have not had the
benefit of this particular project you
will get a benefit for it immediately so
perfunctory is aside let's move into the
presentation here this is the google
Tech Talk innovation Survival Series
this is my second one you see the
gentleman there with the bright idea
he's got a couple of guys running tour
him because they like bright ideas but
guess what this is the early and late
majority as well as the laggards the
guys that are brick red are running
because they are on fire they're running
so fast and they're so afraid and the
guys that are beat red are running so
fast they're exhibiting the Doppler
effect
so when you're involved in innovation if
you're not ready to accept something
like this you might have wandered into
the wrong tent and that is one of the
things that I talk about in my book so
let's move on the one lecture I haven't
given here is the evolution of the
surfboard and that's evolution in sports
I've studied I have studied innovation
in six different disciplines here they
are sports art literature music science
Robert Kennedy was kind enough to bring
me a few months ago and I did an
industry flight in the Voyager the
airplane that went around the world is a
google video it's out on youtube today's
talk is on the military and incest
officially it is on worship evolution
they've established that there is not a
core competency here in the audience and
here in front of me in worship design
and that's intentional I take people out
of their area of core competency and I
show them that the things they face in a
daily basis are shared because
innovation is a human experience and a
human condition so this is our talk
today we're going to start off with
warship a wooden warships we're going to
move into ironclads very quickly into
dreadknots you may may may or may not be
aware of dreadknots we're going to talk
about worship supremacy that's going to
be about the halfway point and we're
going to be flying I'm going to have
some closing observations to begin with
this is the wooden worship this is the
apex of a wooden warship this is the HMS
Victory it is sitting in Portsmouth it
is the only surviving instance of this
design the first one was a mary rose and
it was launched Oh 200 years before the
ship was launched this particular ship
was launched in May 7 1785 notice his 27
miles of cordage rope for the sales
killed two thousand oak trees to build
it 820 people jammed onto that little
puppy they slept in shifts in hammocks
rocking away just having a good
time don't you know it was a hundred it
was a first-rate ship it was given that
classification because there were more
than a hundred guns on it these were
smoothbore loaded through the muzzle
muzzleloading and typically ship would
have various calibers of it the thing
that distinguished the British from the
French and the Spanish was they
practiced and they practiced hard they
could shoot twice as fast as the French
in the Spanish so effectively when it
came to a French or Spanish they had 208
guns if you were a bad guy and the ship
was looking for you the last thing you'd
want to see in the high sea was its
masts I guarantee you now built out of
wood the strategic material right the
critical thing is going to be wood for
the masts and the King would send his
soldiers through the force and he would
mark trees that were straight tall true
and strong with a king's broad arrow
mark three marks you could be killed if
you did anything to that tree you did
not touch it okay after a while very
very short while the British forests
were depleted and by the 1700s they were
going all the way over to the Baltics
looking for masquerade would well I had
these three thirteen colonies all across
the United across the the pond and they
climbed to the top of a ridge of the
first mountain chain and as far as the
eye could see there were nothing but
mass grade trees mountain after mountain
after mountain it was an infinite supply
of this wood here and it was one of the
reasons why Britain coveted these 13
colonies now known as the United States
in addition along the eastern coast and
all the way pretty much down to Mexico
there was another kind of wood growing
in a tree called live oak it could
sustain 100 years of immersion in salt
water when properly cured beforehand no
problem this was like nuclear reactor
fuel so
Britain started cutting down these trees
and shipping them over to Britain to
build them but after a while the nba's
get involved they say you know what lets
offshore ship construction it's the
future we can monetize the transit time
all right I ship the stuff over right
let's build them over there and
everything so what was the reaction for
the shipbuilders in the in over in
England they said oh man they're gonna
be big they're gonna be ugly it's gonna
work it's gonna be uh yeah it can
possibly be effective so how'd it work
out well with all things being what they
were there were some unintended
consequences of this and specifically by
the time the war of 1812 rolled around
the United States had built some of
these guys and they didn't have 104 guns
or anything like that but they could out
sale everything in the sea and surprise
surprise they could outshoot the British
guys why is that I know it's going to
come as a shock to you but somehow those
rascally were set of this reprobate
colonists we're saving the very best
wood for themselves and they were coming
up with new enhanced designs you know
they just live far away they weren't
stupid they just live far away and
there's one there that particular design
there kept the boat from hogging and
hogging is when the ship goes like that
and and then that's that's you know
bending and hogging and stuff like that
so new designs best would best of class
ship so strong that that the that one
that you saw became known as old iron
owned Old Ironsides and it got that name
in this battle here battle 1812 taking
on the French and the ship that is
getting the worst of it it's French it
was pulverized by USS Constitution and
it was so Swiss cheese they had to sink
it and get rid of it and just sail back
with the crew well there was an admiral
over in the UK
British Isles that noticed and his name
was Admiral Horatio Nelson and he had a
prediction since I see trouble for
Britain in those big frigates across the
sea is a very smart guy so let's talk
about him Battle of Trafalgar October
21st 1805 in the United States we have a
game called football it's not soccer and
we call we call football in the rest of
the world soccer here but it was
football had a very good sharp
quarterback his name's Joe Montana he
says sometimes there is no next time
there is no second chance there is no
sign timeouts sometimes it is now or
never you know when you go over and you
hit the reset button for power to bring
up you know your big former aluminum
plant switch for one of your big data
centers it's now or never for Britain
they were fighting France and Spain the
deal was is that the British had a
vastly superior Navy to the French and
Spanish but the French of the Spanish
had a vastly superior army than the
British did and they could take their
sub standard Navy sail it up to
Cherbourg or Caillat or whatever like
that load troops on to him sailed just
across the channel and pulverize the UK
right out of existence failure was not
an option what Nelson did was as he said
we must destroy this fleet to prevent
that from happening at all costs
including the the destruction of his own
fleet he is an incredible leader and you
will see this in your leaders here in
Google you looking at real leader will
lead from the front they will be
competent all right Nelson had already
lost one arm he was blind in one eye
from shot and he was a real soldier
soldier he issued general battle guy
guidelines things like this data center
needs to be operational September of
this year doesn't say you know you need
to go to call PG&amp;amp;E and haggle with no
data center needs to come up you guys
figure it out so
here's the battle depiction of the
battle it's beginning to unfold here
Nelson did a crossing the team maneuver
had existed before and what he did was
he sailed into the ship's there on the
right which are sailing to the north and
he cut off their escape route so that
they could not live to fight another day
and this is them sailing in to it and
it's a sort of a depiction of what the
scene look like a few hours later and
the French are getting beaten and beaten
badly as is the depiction of what's
going on inside the deck up up on top of
the deck here you see guys with rifles
those are Marines and their off hours
they are keeping the motley crew in
order by with their rifles and threats
and things like that but in battle
they're shooting snipers that are up in
the lanyards in the masts and things
like that also a lot going on now let me
drop into MBA mode here I know it's
going to be new thing for you guys in a
battle like this there are a tendon
splinters now when you were young did
you ever get a splinter in your finger
you know and you and over to your mom
and you said ma I spun it on your mom
and got tweezers and pulled it out you
know you go okay ladies and gentlemen
these are not the kind of splinters I'm
talking about I'm talking about 20 pound
splinters that explode off the side of a
ship after cannonball hits it about 30
40 miles an hour and weighs about 30 or
40 pounds its sharpest and AXA to Kappa
takes people it dismembers them in
viscera TM their their internals fall
out in red crimson gelatinous goes on
the floor there's people screaming
people getting stapled into the walls on
the other side of the ship so I'm not
going to make to find of a point on this
but this is the real show here how bad
is it extraordinary carnage is going on
below deck and on top deck here half the
crew could be killed not uncommon
alright it was so bad that they painted
the insides of the decks red to cut down
on the distraction factor during battle
and because the floors got so slippery
they spread sand down so that the bare
foot soldiers would not lose traction so
we're going to move on but think about
this because it's the real deal now
gentlemen and red that's Horatio Nelson
he took a bullet from a sniper he died
he died not knowing whether or not he
had one but in fact he had so at this
point in time the hms victory was 40
years old and in fact it was 300 years
pretty much after the HMS way the first
example of this kind of ship was built
so there was very little evolution in a
design a design was good for centuries
Wow okay over the United States going up
and down the Hudson River there was this
guy Robert Fulton and he had been over
in the UK during during these all these
battles and things like that and when
the British want at Trafalgar British
British Navy said to him Robert we've
really enjoyed you being here please
leave and they did one thing that was
very unusual they gave him an export
license for machinery very rare be done
that and what did they export they
exported a steam engine and he hooked it
up on side panels on a ship and with
these side panels you can actually go up
the Hudson River against the current
this is a big deal so is is is this
export technology a core competency
export given away not a good idea right
is this going to make any difference
let's examine the facts okay so there's
a steam engine in there you can see the
black smoke coming up oh look the side
paddles there right they sit in prime
cannon real estate they reduce the
numbers that's the sweet spot on the
boat to put cannons
and they're very vulnerable themselves
you get want to take one of those guys
out you've got the whole boat right
there really vulnerable so I think
there's some serious business concerns
here for implementing this but there's
worse all wooden ships are inherently
vulnerable to fire they had fuel they
were burning stuff a colon was dirty
right these guys had white uniforms a
cold dirt got on them a smoke got into
this suit got into the sails under the
decks there weren't coaling stations
everywhere you're limited radius of
action things like that fart you know
that boilers could explode but there was
something much much worse much worse and
I know this is going to horrify you I I
apologize in advance excuse me I
apologize in advance worse what could be
worse it disturbed the natural social
order of ships you know sailing guys you
know there were guys way up and crows
nests and guys all the way down in the
bottom of the ship and guys that put
sails down and guys you know boat stuff
like that there were these new people
that came on to ships is its topology
here I hate to say in a mixed company
but you ready they were engineers they
weren't Sanders they were engineers and
they looked at these glass meters and
they looked at pressure valves and they
turn things and they they stoked and it
was the engine you know those kind of
people they were there and it's just
like the captain's they're not sailors
their engineers they didn't know what to
do it this is a problem in navies for
about a hundred years do not
underestimate when you introduce a new
technology into a social system and it
turns it upside down the ferocity of the
pushback you are going to get well well
I as an expert here self-appointed
expert I can assure the audience based
on my MBA there is no role for
steam anywhere based on this analysis so
let's move on well back in the Civil War
the crafty Americans here they built
this thing called a submarine and if you
look at the two things circled in red
there those are screws and that's how it
got around and went up and down with the
vertical one you turn it and it you know
Archimedes screw principles screwing it
up and down and and forward you turn it
and pull you back and forth so you sort
of like screwed your way over the water
and this is how propellers began to be
known as screws because they were screws
well there are a lot of guys that were
looking at about 17 or 27 years later
there's this guy Carl John Stevens and
that's a boat up there on top and that's
what his screw look like but it was real
complicated and kind of clunky and it
didn't work well and then there was this
guy John Eric's an incredible engineer
absolutely beautiful engineer and he had
counter-rotating kind of like paddle
screws and what he discovered was this
when he removed one everything was
simpler everything was easier and best
of all it was faster the same thing
happened a John Ericsson ok so here is
something you need to constantly keep in
mind if you're thinking of something
innovative you better do something about
it real quick because there are a whole
bunch of people that were working on
screw propellers and things like that
it's simultaneously in different areas
independently unaware of each other ok
sir francis Pettit Smith he was on a
Paddington canal with with his screw up
there and he hit a submerged log and it
broke his screw in half chopped off the
back half of it guess what everything
was faster so got to take it out and you
got to dink around and you got a
surprise you know and say well maybe
maybe if we make the cue a little bit
bigger here and drop the latency over
there you know maybe we'll get better
maybe it will so John Ericsson takes his
incredible design and forward three
years later he goes to the British
Admiral teen he says I cut this thing
it's just going to save you guys it's so
wonderful do it and that's what they say
all together useless in practice its
powers of plot applied at the
act there's no way you could steer a
ship like this and you know all right
get out unfortunately six years later
islamabad Bernard comes out with the the
SS great britain which is one of the
greatest landmark and transatlantic
travel and that has ever existed notice
what's at the back of their it's a screw
that is very much like like John Ericson
so John Ericson was in appropriately
rejected even though he was dead on so
now anytime there is a transition there
are glimmers that began to appear and as
they begin to appear more and more
rapidly you begin to see the
constellation it begins to appear so one
glimmer in warship evolution occurred in
1779 1783 and it's a French and Spanish
once again going after Britain Britain
owned great you know Gibraltar great
season this was a great great battle
they had there and this particular
gentleman said you know we can get them
from the land side but it's pretty well
barricaded what we ought to do is over
on the ocean side the mediterranean sea
side we should build some rafts very
cleverly and put guns on them and we can
just get within cannon range and just
shoot and shoot and shoot and we can
just wipe these British guys out on
Gibraltar that was it choke lemon why
let me show low balled up oh now see
Monsieur so that's kind of like what it
looked like that's a depiction of a
Gibraltar there and in blue here this is
an aerial view of it and those on the
upper left those are the kind of boats
that he was building he took a regular
ship ripped everything off the top moved
all the cannons over to one side he put
some ballast down in the bottom there to
keep the cannons from pulling up the
ship over and he protected he very
heavily protected the exposed side so
what they do build 10 of these things
ten to twenty nine guns each 5260 guys
were out on these
10 deals they had iron bars over there
on the side to protect it they filled
the areas in between it with sand
because they knew the British we're
going to shoot red-hot cannonballs Adam
called hotshot and pump water into the
sand be waterproofed it had a cover up I
don't know if I was a British guy be
pretty frayed alright what do you think
pretty good plan he have Park out there
and vulnerable you know shoot away she'd
have a shoot away well how'd it work out
Wow the way it worked out was the pumps
failed so they didn't get the water down
into the sand correctly okay the British
used hotshot one boat caught on fire
there were no provisions just to
extinguish any fire because there wasn't
going to be any right the boats were
more too close together the fire hopped
from battery to battery to battery none
of the guys swam because sailors didn't
swim back then there were no lifeboats
because you weren't going to need any
right it was such a good plan five
batteries blew up five burned to the
waterline 4773 killed for nearly ninety
one-percent casualty rate out in the sea
so what's the takeaway here there is
nothing more horrible than the murder of
a beautiful theory by a brutal gang of
facts and just because you sit around
and you come up with a good idea maybe I
ought to wander it out into the real
world because we live in a
multi-dimensional fractal based
nonlinear world with feedback loops that
are subject to dislocations
discontinuities tectonic shifts as well
as the effects of time and scale and you
get any one of those wrong you might
have a ninety-one percent fatality rate
so projectiles a hotshot got those guys
projectiles initially in the wooden ship
days were there to destroy the
propulsion which would be the mast as
well as catch everything on fire and
here's a big long list of things here
yeah Greek fire or yours you know you
shot
burning liquid out that was you couldn't
extinguish and boy that that's that
scared the Phoenicians to death hot shot
Martin shot cannon balls that were
hollow inside filled with molten iron
your plant one of those up against the
wooden ship and why it's going to be a
real scene there yeah it's shrapnel
everything else there's a gentleman by
the name of Benjamin Robbins he says you
know we got rifles and you know when
with stuff inside to spin the bullet and
make it you know accurate everything
like that why don't we do the same thing
for naval cannons and instead of
shooting a ball let's let's have half a
half a sphere in front and let's have a
cylinder made it onto the back we'll
make it elongated and we're going to put
some real wood behind that arrow and
meet some real interesting people that
way ignored so but in 1823 all regionals
affects all France he is mulling over
how can we use mortar shells more
effectively mortar shells are hollow
hollow exploding shells that get shot
way up in the air and they come down and
have fuses and they're kind of kind of
unreliable you know kind of go off
sometimes and they kind of dope when
they go off to go off of the bank so
what he said was what we need to do is
build cannons thick in the back and you
have bands that that are super red hot
when you put them on and they cool and
you know put in tension have narrow on
the front we can shoot the same
projectiles in a flat trajectory they'll
stick into the side of a ship and
explode and put a hole in the ship that
you can drive you know an 18-wheeler
through or even more preferably in the
context it will enter the ship and it
will go off in there and be a maximum
you know bad surprise for everybody so
it was a disruptive gunnery design
innovation and it introduced
discontinuous naval ship design
consequences because the wood chips
could not withstand this note to date
1823 he produces you know he comes up
with us
in 1841 18 years later he says you know
when this is going to do such a number
on ships why don't we put armor plating
around them and then these shells oldest
bounced off how'd that work out he is
rejected however they've been doing
precisely that over in Korea for 400
years for centuries so the fact that
we're talking about naval worship
evolution in the West we're leaving out
what was going on in the east and in
fact it was far more advanced Chinese
put out absolutely astonishing ships oh
something happened in 1853 to disturb
the sleeping giants the Russians took on
the Turks in a port on the northern edge
of Turkey in the Black Sea also note and
these like 10 ships came in and they had
these packs handguns and they caught the
Turkish at anchor in the bay absolutely
slaughtered him 82 one fatality ratio I
mean that's that's you know ten-to-one
that's big you know so looking at Ali
ten to one advantage that's big deal 82
one Wow okay global consensus everybody
says wooden ships are doomed they're
doomed now they had been doomed for you
know 18 years prior but they're doing
now so two years after shinobi there was
another battle Cano now this is a google
map google satellite thank you my third
thank you hair ok up in the northern end
of the Black Sea there's this very
strange Peninsula in a rubber ish to a
river estuary the Deep River and the
Russians had forts out there and they
had those guns those packs handguns in
the French the Turks and Spanish are
going after them now do you think
they're going to take wooden ships no
they said we got to do something else
and so France and and no Spain and and
the UK build armor-plated rafts that
they tow our there with ships and have
very menacing modest propulsion and they
big Park them out in front of the fort
it's there and this is a depiction of
the battle this is the only thing that's
around and sorry there's those three
guys there and this is actually one of
them this is a picture of one of them
here okay but the thing french floating
battery love 1854 17-inch wouldn't holds
four and a half iron plate armor Nazi
going I had a tote around they blew the
Russians away just blew it well this was
noticed by the French who now were
becoming annoyed with the British again
and so the pwede it all goes back and he
builds this ship called nagoya and it
was a based on a wooden battleship but
they tore off the top deck and they put
armor plating all the way around it and
it but otherwise it was a wooden hull
and it had steam okay and had four point
four and a half inches of iron Arbor
blood water line the British command of
the sea notice this frantically built
this ship and this is an incredible ship
it's the HMS wire it's it's it's it's
more right out there within a few blocks
of HMS Victory 14 knots it had 600 guys
on on the ship at steam it was it was an
iron hull not a Woodhull and iron holder
was wood there but only to secure more
armor plating on extractable 10-ton
screw powder 600 guys could pull up the
propeller and they could sail wherever
they wanted to sail without using steam
they had exploding canonical shells they
had Armstrong experimental guns they
were rifled they had two and a half mile
accuracy they were very dangerous to use
they use they killed a lot of their
Gunners okay well meanwhile things are
not going well over the United States
there's this large bickering going on
between the North and the South and the
bunch of State succeed they form the
Confederacy and there is a boat harbor
with a bunch of Union northern ships
there and one of them is this Merrimack
and they can't get it out and they know
the Confederates are going to take it so
they said we got to destroy everything
there goes right there so what they do
is to try and burn the USS Merrimack
down to the waterline and they get it
there and it sinks may try and destroy
the park port but they don't really do a
good job at it and there's like six
hundred dollar in cannons there are all
kinds of ammunition and cannibals and so
civil war is often running now the
Confederates had been watching all of
this going on between the HMS warrior
and local law and they said we need an
ironclad so they went out and they got
that burned-out ship they raised it up
they put a metal shed on it and they
called it the CSS Virginia so now the
union is not stupid either they finally
realize we need something response to
that ship so this they put out an RFQ
and this guy says hey I can build a ship
and ironclad for you no problem he says
oh and oh by the way I've got this
friend Erickson you know the screw guy
that was over in the UK well he's over
the United States now we're gonna talk
in a second how I got here he lives in
New York and he says I'm going to take
my plans and this guy is really smart
we're going to check it out but Erickson
already has a history with the United
States Navy and what might that be well
this is the gentleman that brought eric
erickson over from the UK and they built
this ship and there were two incredibly
large cannons on this ship there was one
in the front and one in the back
erickson built the one in the back the
other guy built the one in the front and
Erickson said do not do that this gun
will explode this gun will kill people
do not do this he did it anyway so how
to work out it exploded
on a very important demonstration it
killed the Secretary of the Navy it
killed the Secretary of State it killed
about any other people it would have
possibly killed the president of the
united states except he was down below
on a lower deck taking care of a woman
that was sick so what I lectured at
Stanford I looked at the students and I
said for those of you in the MBA program
here is your takeaway it's not good to
get blamed for killing your only
customer right so the Navy new Erickson
he gots lined there's another lesson if
you're in the arena and you're doing
hard stuff and there's risk and there's
uncertainty but you're doing the right
thing you are fair game to get slimed
and you need to know it so if when you
get slimed it means maybe somebody
really likes your work but they're not
going to admit it yeah so what happens
bushnell goes back to Erickson and
Erickson says looks good but oh by the
way would you like to see this design
that I proposed to Napoleon when he was
fighting the British he says yeah sure
that is the design sloped armor
everywhere because it's you know it's
all curved and it was rejected by
Napoleon because he said it's going to
cost too much and you don't have many
guns and what do you didn't understand
was the guns were in pterence when the
guns are in church you don't need many
of them because you don't have to point
the whole ship to get your guns in line
the sail along and you just point the
turret and you shoot and then you just
shoot and shoot and shoot so you get to
shoot far more often well they build
this for the United States Navy that
Union Navy notice the similarity okay
it's not us it's not a sophisticated
they didn't have as much time and it
certainly wasn't perfect but it was
called Erickson's folly the reason for
that is people said it would never float
when it was launched into the East River
so Erickson stood on deck is it launched
down the ramp good man very innovative
great place great great
anchor tucked away there's one of his
great propellers that's the actual one
the thing did sink they found it about
10 years ago brought it up and this is
the actual propeller it was on it and
had this turret now he often gets credit
for inventing the turret but that is
false he actually had to take a patent
out because there was prior art and
there was precedents and there was
another fella over the UK by the name of
copper Phipps pulse and he's a very
interesting guy in his own right and we
talked about a ship that was out in was
it a Denmark that flipped over in the
bay and copper Phillips poles also did
one he built one and it rolled over and
everybody except like like 16 people out
of 300 died so the ship with the metal
shed on top gets out first unchallenged
and it destroys two of the ships that
are in the Union blockade that's on fire
what is the problem here well there's a
couple one of them is you know the wood
chips but the real problem is is they
didn't have steam they couldn't get away
from this thing and this thing can only
do like two knots or three knots and
took 45 minutes to turn around I mean
this thing was aquatic Lee and nautica
ly speaking not to be purged ative but
it was a stinking tub of goo though CSS
Virginia comes out the next day and lo
and behold USS Monitor is there and this
is the depiction of the battle there
they take on one another it's a
stalemate
oh the this thing here was ridiculous
was absolutely this is the CSS Virginia
that was a ridiculous that was a kludge
and one of the takeaways here in America
that had been the Merrimack yeah and a
Merrimack by the way has two spellings
one month it came on without so you'll
see that knee go search the deal the
deal is is that sometimes you know like
when you're really under pressure from
an adversary you don't have to engineer
the best thing you can kludge something
together that can hold together for a
while and you can get a stalemate buying
you enough time to go around and do the
right thing so it was a stalemate but
the monitor had only been using fifty
percent of the powder in it shells that
could have used and why was that because
of that explosion eighteen years earlier
nobody in the Navy was allowed to use
more than fifty percent so takeaway here
is maybe it's worthwhile to go back and
review your corporate procedures and
rules once in a while because if he had
been shooting a hundred percent he
probably could have could have taken
that guy out so here it is after the
battle you can see the dents in the
metal from the actual battle itself the
only met once and you see these guys out
there celebrating and lounging and you
know if they'd been able to have a
corona or you know one of these great
juices you've got over here vitamin
drink you know and be out there's lunch
and it looks like a great tour doesn't
it guess what it's not gets up to 165
degrees inside that thing they are
absolutely miserable they're not even
particularly mechanically sound they're
certainly not seaworthy and there are
actual discussions on we may have to
scuttle this whole thing if we're if
we've trying to fight for like five
hours and we run out of salt pills of
water you know it just is we don't want
this to fall into enemy hands so it's a
kludge Oh soon thereafter they're
everywhere these are Union ones the top
one is on the Mississippi River the
lower ones out over on the East Coast in
Washington DC
veterans have them also in fact
Confederates have a problem because they
don't have a lot of iron so they're
stacking you know cotton bales and
things like that around any kind of
armament so they're cluding the Kluge's
now and what you find is the ever both
sides time these are very difficult to
build and they're only for smooth water
they're not seaworthy reason why they're
difficult to build them for different
reasons in the Union everybody been
building wooden ships and so they say
you need to rivet this iron plate to
this iron plate you know the guy with
the wood planer here goes do what so it
was a new technology it was alien every
went over the other side they didn't
have the iron the raw materials so is
this the end of wooden ships not exactly
there's an expression quantity has its
own quality you don't want to bet your
company or existence on it but here this
is a battle going on in Charleston
Harbor you CSS Albemarle very well-built
ironclad owned by the Confederates and
it is being jumped by a wooden side
wheel paddler there and if it had hit
just a little bit farther to the forward
it would have pushed that gun port over
water it would have sunk like a rock but
it didn't and in fact the wind ship was
severely damaged and maybe ruined so
sometimes tactics and quantity can trump
quality well the war ends and the United
States Navy now has has come up with
this monitor and they understand steam
now and they understand iron guess what
they regress back to the days before the
Civil War they pretend like it never
happened because the threats gone
they're building really clunky wooden
ships no steam in them are the ships
under sail go 3 to 4 knots which means
you could almost walk as fast as these
things on the underwater and when it
comes to coal use we're not allowed to
use coal even though they had steam
engines if a captain used coal he had to
write in red ink in the log why
was using coal it was reviewed and if
the reviewers decreed that it was an
unwarranted application of coal guess
what the captain paid for the coal out
of his own pocket no that's an incentive
notice that in 1864 fastest ship in the
world had been built already by the
Union it was called the USS Wampanoag
incredibly brilliant engineer by the
name of a sherwood did it he was very
high-strung these are it's it's his
design points long tapered holes of
gears and a steam engine I had 44 steam
engines there had late cut off piston
stroke which improved the efficiency and
the power delivery of the steam engines
improved on Erickson's boats and guess
what nobody liked him this is his
description the only way you're going to
find my ship is by us finding the the
burning hoax that it leaves behind ok so
in 1899 there's a commission and the
bottom line is is they scrapped it for
three percent of the value but first
before guttering gutting it they haul it
off down the river and they cut it up
and it's gone this was the greatest
fastest ship in 1864 in the world right
he got slimed well back on propulsion
again there's his fellow named Sir
Charles Auburn Parsons over the UK and
he like many other people at the time
was very fascinated by this concept of
the para file and it was this thing from
ancient Greece where you put water into
this tub and pipes came up and you set a
fire underneath it and it's spun this
ball and he said rather than make a ball
spin why don't we take this this jet of
steam and put it into a windmill we put
it into a windmill and maybe but you
know a whole bunch of windmill blades we
can turn the shaft and we can connect it
up and we can generate electricity and
stuff and sure enough it's called a
turban he applies to techno
the first person to do it 1894 to this
small boat called the turban IAM and he
had one very powerful steam engine in
there and he was real pleased what he
discovered was he can only go half as
fast as he thought it could go the
reason for that was he was the first
person to try and transfer that much
energy off of a small propeller to water
and he experienced a effect called
cavitation he discovered it this is
where it happened right so what he did
is he ripped out his engine he put in
three turbine engines each had their own
propeller shaft and three propellers per
shot and there it is that guy was hot
that was the real deal fastest thing on
the face of the earth on water he went
out he disrupted a ship day with Queen
Victoria there the bridge there's
nothing that British could do to catch
him he could run circles around the guys
that were trying to get him well about
1910 or so there's this tremendous
turmoil on material steel and steam and
engines and guns you know configuration
of guns and things like that it's known
as the age of uncertainty it all came to
a screeching halt about 1910 or so 1906
with this ship here it's called the HMS
dreadnought and what made it so special
with steel construction turbine power
one caliber gun you don't need a bunch
of small guns because you shoot at the
guys far away and if you're good you
take him out but guess what they weren't
good they only had two to three percent
accuracy so it higher Sir Percy Scott
and he develops who had developed this
thing called continuous aim firing he
jacks it up by thirty forty percent in
accuracy and meanwhile he trains this
guy William s sims in the United States
Navy on how to do it so Sims he
understood that the Navy was incomplete
archaic decrepitude Brazil had a better
Navy than the United States did so he
gets together with his buddy Teddy
Roosevelt secretary the Navy and they
say we're going to build a whole new
fleet and guess what no outsourcing
and when they said no outsourcing they
meant all the way down to the rivets and
including the rivets they built their
own rivets for all of these ships and so
they did it it was very good Simpsons
very good Homer Poundstone one of his
colleagues had already proposed to ship
very much like the dread-nots he had
been ignored right he got continuous aim
firing going but and it was vigorously
resisted by the Navy if you read Etling
Morrison's men machine in modern times
great story about it and Teddy Roosevelt
was then president so he just wrote a
letter to Teddy Roosevelt that's called
top-down support which sometimes is
imperative when it comes to innovation
right accuracy went up Sims himself on
his ship scored one hundred percent we
talked about getting slimed a couple
times before Sims got slimed there was
an accident that occurred in a turret in
the USS Missouri they said it's all your
fault with all these newfangled
techniques and firing firing mechanisms
and Sims this response was don't store
propellants in the hallways guys we've
been talking about this for 15 years
right you know a ship blew up okay so
but that's it this is the USS alabama
sitting out in Mobile Bay it's my life
there and if you look at that sign
that's the details all right muzzle
velocity is 1570 miles and they can put
it on a football field from over 20
miles away each time every time
incredible fire control despite the fact
that the Japanese had better battleships
bigger battleships excuse me we would
have blown them out of the water in
one-on-one confrontation because we had
that accuracy we could fire over the
horizon they wouldn't even be able to
see us so you know so best best
battleships run there were four that
were better than this particular class
battleship but this is good yes sir
you need a plan how do you do over the
horizon targeting they did have radar
they had computers and and sometimes
they did have spotter planes trust me
they could do it we got a lot to go know
this we got a lot to go but come get me
later but they could do it in World War
two they had them but is it really
supremacy you see those guns there those
are anti-aircraft guns those are guns
also use to protect the short troops so
is it supremacy there's two nopes here
here's nope number one John P Holland
father the submarine come a long way
since mr. Bushnell's day in the
Revolutionary War in fact how far to
come you see this ship here the HMS bar
had battleship it was out in the
Adriatic the beginning of World War two
German submarine got it with three
torpedoes it rolled over and its
magazines exploded as an 860 guys going
away this is very serious the Germans
had listened sometimes it's good to be
agnostic as to what the source of the
facts are nope number two General
William Billy Mitchell air advocate
land-based mom or air advocate
incredible disturber of the peace and
all more abound stagnant organizations
need disturbers of the peace those are
real medals given from various countries
various kings and queens and authorities
and things like that and what he
basically said was you give me
shore-based airplanes and I can destroy
battleships right one thousand planes in
cost equal one battleship and give me
some of these I put them on some of
those I can sink a battleship the Navy
said no you can't and Billy said yes I
can and that argument went on for about
three or four years and tell Congress
said you know we're looking at all of
these allocations and appropriations for
battleships Navy folks you are going to
this test so they tried to softball it
and they tried to slime him how to work
out well we're going to see in this a
second but sims remember the big stinker
and sims back in 1909 he agreed with one
of the Wright brothers that said from an
airplane you can't hit anything so he
says how battleships are safe in 1919 he
says man all the airplane carrying ships
couldn't make an attack on a foreign
country we're going to see an evolved
position because this guy is a critical
thinker that listens to the fact so
here's the test how you guys are smart
I'm sure there's some judgment calls on
whether or not this battleship went down
or not so I'm going to leave it to the
audience here i'm just going to silently
step through the slides ooh ooh oh oh my
goodness
whoops
avi tirsan know what do you think what
did the Admiralty do that were on the
observer ships watching this happen what
was their reaction is even know they
sobbed into their handkerchiefs their
Anchorage's why did they sob because
they were in love with the way that they
were doing things to achieve an effect
and that way had passed don't fall in
love with the way that you do things
right what was the official Navy
reaction ah it doesn't mean yeah I think
it was moored it was clear air they
weren't shooting back you know I wasn't
moving with a very kept doing ok so the
controversy remained so Billy Mitchell
puts out a book 1925 on wing defence and
these are the front endpapers full of
political cartoons that have been
tracking this this deal and I actually
went on a lieberson I got a copy of the
book this is my favorite cartoon here
Billy Mitchell running in bossier houses
on fire and the Army Department says
you're fired for waking me up meanwhile
the award apartment and the Navy
Department are snoozing like babies as
the sky fills with airplanes at this
point in time the United States I can
count them how many operational
airplanes that they have for war
66 the entire United States Oh 22 and 24
had six so he's willing to he paints a
target on himself there's an accident on
a blimp and he puts out a press release
talking about incompetency criminal
negligence and almost treasonable
administration so this is
insubordination right here President
Calvin Coolidge orders a court-martial
no you guys familiar with Coolidge
probably not all of you let me give you
a couple quotes from Coolidge
familiarize you know acclimate you the
large numbers of men are unable to find
work unemployment results here's a
better one when it comes to aircraft
appropriations why can't they buy just
one airplane and take turns flying in no
this is this guy's progressive so Calvin
he he has it so so this is the
court-martial he's going down it doesn't
make any difference what anybody does he
is going down for the count here right
Admiral Simms actually comes and
testifies on his behalf this is another
one of the end papers where he says I'll
tell the world that an airship can sink
a battleship and the other little ducks
which of the Admirals saying silence him
not a word right it talks about the
evolution of the airplane and how it has
displaced the supremacy the battleship
here is the big quote the battleship is
dad those are pretty strong words that's
in March 1922 okay who says if ships
show up with a bunch of these airplanes
on them the best place for our
battleships are as far up the
Mississippi River as they can get away
from the ocean okay John Maynard Keynes
great great economists when the facts
change I changed my mind what do you do
sir congressional testimony and of
course there is the you know the time
immemorial Machiavelli quote about the
difficulty of introducing a new order of
things and change so trials going on
he's got all kinds of press support
these are cartoons here everybody
shooting at them and the army of the
navy in the War Department a joint
resolution and Congress gets announced
doesn't make any difference
now here's where the money comes
involved here okay are you guys history
buffs history okay all right so you got
five dollar question so we're going to
see who was lucky in it but you can put
there's a lot of smart guys here so if
you if you want five bucks you got you
gotta yell out your answer quick I don't
think too hard okay we're in for this
surprise aerial attack launched from
aircraft carriers naval fleet at anchor
shallow harbor torpedo bombers very
successful come on yes come on it's you
know I you guys there's just so smart AB
is there some part of the word know that
you're not familiar with all right no no
no the one I've talked to your name dan
dan dan thank you thank you for
suffering and pain with me here that's
the ship there no is actually in Toronto
no no you get up here come on now you
get you get your nice guy you're gonna
come okay partial credit all right you
know you're my Victim today Toronto
Italy this is a year before Pearl Harbor
so the British did this how they do that
with those guys a little silk cover
things and they blew the Italian Navy
right out so you know you showed gud
Stan and I really probably I i'm gonna
give you partial credit okay your stay
here okay but you gotta stay here okay
so I'm gonna give you inform are here we
go okay name that time okay okay right
right and you can you can have them help
you you haven't you ever friend out here
they dressed dan doesn't have any
friends I ok Harry the Flynn was the
first carrier launched aerial torpedo
attack against a naval fleet in a home
port proposed wasn't yeah take again
come on nineteen thirty good guess no
was nineteen eighteen it was World War
one and we're building to a point here
all this pain here and you're being such
a good sport here ok ok so is 1918 all
right and it was actually proposed by a
guy who was very difficult to get along
British finished naval aviation guy in
1914 and the italian one that we saw in
the previous slide they dusted off this
plan and this plan was to go sink the
german fleet hi fleet that was it a
tanker in a river now it was a bow to
stern in a river
you know like bring them for beautiful
ancient can't miss and they wouldn't
have so oh here go here go yeah okay
here we go Jessa Chris ok let's this one
here let me hear ok 20th century
Japanese naval forces launched two
devastating surprise attack the
destroyed large nation specifically and
declared war after what was the United
States reaction where they didn't enter
the war I was actually talking about 19
04 04 an Arthur they say so but with a
little bit of social engineering and a
willing guest thank you very much then
you've been absolutely supreme yeah give
him a big hand right ok all right so
there's no way that you guys probably
could have got this there was a
distinguished engineer out of the dutch
royal navy from son that got these
answers last week when i gave him but
they actually liked it so think about it
how is it the Pearl Harbor happened
right when they'd been a surprise attack
that was admired by the United States
right that it was an attack and a
shallow Harbor carrier launched I what
were they thinking I can tell you what
they were thinking they were thinking
that you know were the smartest guys in
the face of the earth and none of us can
figure out how to do this so therefore
nobody else can bad answer they thought
they were going to go attack the
Philippines and they didn't do it
forces the earth was only limited thank
you nope oh it was in 1904 with 1940 was
proposed they could not see it was a
trick question it was proposed in 1914
but they couldn't do it logistically in
the war ended and they kept the plan
secret and then they used it in toronto
in 1940 it was proposed in 1914 on the
air the airplane was around like in 1904
been around 10 years that's correct that
I didn't know he not socially
engineering here there's no air in here
oh yeah there's no error they came in
with ships they shot him up yeah I
cheated yeah you know I'm not a nice guy
mr. presenter okay okay so so there's
nothing new in the world except the
history you do not know there's a lot of
history you don't know and that's one of
the reasons why I like Google and one of
the reasons why i like your digital book
project okay so meanwhile back in 1924
Billy Mitchell had said pearl harbor
attack will commence at seven-thirty on
a Sunday and the Philippines will
commence at ten-forty in the morning how
did that work out 755 this is an actual
picture from a Japanese fighter her or
observe a plane here and these guys were
really good these Japanese boy these
guys were good there's no doubt about it
it was beautiful the torpedoes that the
Americans couldn't figure out how to
build well Japanese put stabilizing fins
on the back so they wouldn't try and
drop down to you know 100 feet and then
come back up and ride shallow into the
ships and they put nose blocks in front
so that when they hit though the water
hammer effect would destroy the wood and
they would just go straight in these
guys beautiful notice this but it can
anybody identify those things that are
circled
those are fuel tanks and they were
supposed to be destroyed on the third
wave that never came because they didn't
know where the carriers were American
carriers were not in around in Pearl
Harbor that should have been target
number one if they had hit target number
one that is target number one they would
have taken out the Pacific Fleet you
don't kill an aircraft carrier or a
destroyer by sinking and you just take
his fuel away that was the fuel it was
all intact they got away so three days
later remember membership can never sink
a battleship HMS Prince of Wales out of
Singapore look trying to do some kind of
a rescue mission it was destroyed at sea
during its violent evasive maneuvering
by the Japanese aerial attack moms and
torpedoes that's the attack that is
another Japanese picture taken of the
tack sinking the HMS Prince of Wales and
and one of its sister ships these guys
were good they were really good no
question about it so the Germans had
paid attention for the submarines and
Japan had paid attention to Billy
Mitchell and Toronto those were the key
things they were right on top of Billy
Mitchell sinking of that battleship and
what Toronto happened they said bingo
now we got him I think Billy Mitchell's
reaction was anybody tell me what Billy
Mitchell think about all this why didn't
you listen that's a good one anybody
else come on no guess don't worry guys I
got huh yeah it's good okay well it
turns out he was dead for 10 years so
the takeaway here is when you get slimed
or when your destiny is not fulfilled
sometimes the dragon wins sometimes it
does but I'd rather die in the
battlefield and in a rocking chair right
so every society honors its live
conformist and it's dead troublemakers
great quote so this is a picture that I
took a couple last summer summer before
us the USS Ronald Reagan now
nuclear aircraft carrier distant warfare
they don't see the enemies few guns it's
considered by many to be the supreme
warship so Sims the Mitchell we're
approximately right canes again it's
better to be roughly right then
precisely wrong ok but guess what just
like the wooden warships had outlived
their usefulness we've got super
cavitating torpedoes we've got Exocet
missiles we've got land-based things
we've got Iranian diesel submarines that
are extremely quiet because they have
learned for the Japanese how to build
silent screws have very expensive
inexpensive launching machines and we
have cruise missiles and some of them
can be tactically armed with the nuclear
weapons so evolution is not an event it
is a process and it doesn't end so if we
look at the warship the early wooden
warship the battle went from two
dimensions on the surface of the ocean
to above and below which makes it 3d
these are some of the forces that we're
working on it to evolve it there were
also social forces going above and below
there's the first worship airplane
takeoff and here's the first landing
things in red those are sand bags with
ropes tied to time so they could snag in
between them so they could snag a tail
hook in and stop that guy was dead six
months afterwards from all of this top
10 closing observations well careful
what you all decide not to do and and in
an offshore and outsource you can
liquidate your future the British did it
a couple times just because you can't
design something doesn't mean that the
adversary can't okay tactic sometimes
early reformers can be very abrasive so
you have to decide we want we want to
politically correct homogeneous group or
do we want some guys that are really
going to shake things up and bother some
people and it's a balance that's going
on in here hey just because you're
passionate about something does not
ensure correctness
out of time here remember Lux roll there
was a commerce Raider that went around
the world with CSS Alabama they didn't
have the whooping all right but they
caught it in port and with this other
wooden battleship there was a there was
a battle the CSL SSS Alabama was out
shooting the ship but the killer shot
that went into the sternpost of the
union ship did not detonate and there it
is and that's why the Union one that sea
battle right lucky you bet I'd rather be
lucky than good this is my bibliography
and right here thank you google our
digitally scanned books the facts from
the siege of Gibraltar came out of an
encyclopedia published in 1895
University of Michigan you guys scanned
it and all of a sudden it was there one
day and I got all the facts that I
wanted thank you very much it's been a
privilege being here thank you very much
and anchors aweigh guys
you
