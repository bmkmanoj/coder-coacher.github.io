name is David caulkins I'm the
co-founder of Robo games i also have a
bunch of other robot titles including a
former professor of robotics at san
francisco state university president of
robotic society of america and general
overall robot geek Robo games is
actually recognized in the Guinness Book
of World Records as the world's largest
robot competition Wired magazine has
called us one of the top ten best
American geek fests discover magazine
said that the best robots compete in
robo games just as the best athletes
train for the Olympics and my actual
point of pride is that we were actually
on ESPN is one of the top 10 plays of
the day only because finally you know
the geeks actually got on ESPN you know
and it's not just basketball stars and
baseball and football and hockey is that
we actually had robots on ESPN so Robo
games came about by a very long and
circuitous route mostly because there's
all sorts of individual little robot
competitions all over the world whether
they're humanoid competitions like these
or large combat robot competitions like
battle bots or robot wars sumo robot
competitions which is sort of two big
fat guys pushing each other out of a
circular ring you have two skinny little
square robots about the size of a
Rubik's Cube pushing each other out of a
ring and robot soccer as well as many
other and what I noticed is is that most
of the people who competed in a given
event would never cross compete so much
like if you work at Google you know you
tend to focus just in marketing or just
on the engineering side or just on the
programming side or just on the research
side and you end it's very rare in the
robotics world that there'd be any
crossover that somebody would actually
try to cross compete and unfortunately
with that too many of those disciplines
are very highly focused so for instance
robot soccer is a very much an
artificial intelligence focused
competition whereas the people who
compete in that generally by their
robots so if the robot breaks they don't
even though their robot contestants they
rarely know how to fix their own robots
they ship them off to this
service center to be fixed and come back
the robot combat guys are great welders
and mechanical engineers and machinists
but those robots have little to no
artificial intelligence on them the
robot sumo contestants are very good
with sensors and they can sense all the
world around them and things like that
but there's negligible AI on the sumo
robots and again most of the robots are
purchased as kids so what I would do is
back this is almost ten years ago now is
I tell the robot guys from soccer hey
you should really you know talk to the
sumo guys and learn more about you know
sensors and things like that and I
talked to the combat guys and say hey
you should learn more about AI and
basically try and get him all in the
same room and to build better robots and
that wouldn't happen the combat guys
were just too focused on their combat
competitions to go anywhere else same
with a sumo and everything else and so
basically we found a Tribble games to
put everybody in the same room at the
same time much like the Olympic model
that you know ideally the swimmers can
learn from the gymnasts and the gymnasts
can learn from the basketball players
and so on and so forth so that
everybody's on an equal footing and that
was really the goal of Robo games other
goals about this is to showcase robot
events to people who wouldn't go to them
if you went to a robot combat event such
as Robot Wars or battle bots or the
robot fighting League events um you'd
have sellout crowds and you have just
huge stands of audience people watching
this this cool robot fighting but if you
go to a robot sumo competition which can
also be very exciting or a robot soccer
competition you have very very few
people in the audience and so one of the
things we do with Robo games is we put
the combat all the way in the back of
the house and then most of the people
who buy the tickets come to see the
combat but then they'll have to walk by
the sumo and the soccer and the fire
fighting robots and the lego robots and
these things and they actually get in
tranced and actually one of my one of my
best friends Rick came for the robot
combat and he stopped at the robot
soccer and SAT there the whole day and
never even saw a single combat match
because he was so entranced with the
soccer but he admitted that he never
would have gone if he was just going for
robot soccer that he thought that would
have been a dumb thing
and certainly the audience starts to
realize just how difficult robotics is
and bye-bye coming and seeing wow these
robots aren't perfect and things like
that it helps get more people involved
the contestant profiles unlike a lot of
competitions which are focused on
Strictly high schools or strictly
colleges things like that we're an open
competition so we get kids as young as
six old guys as old as 72 across the
board it's really not limited to
engineers at most its twenty percent
professional engineers be that software
or hardware the other eighty percent is
completely random and diverse you know
we have warehouse workers and people who
work in marketing and bean counters and
and just it's across the board we get
contestants from all over the world this
slides actually little old it says 15
countries last year I think last year we
actually had about 30 different
countries and it grows every year this
year we have a big contingent coming
from Indonesia from several different
colleges and we I don't even know how
they found out about us but but they're
coming the second year we did it we had
two kids from Brazil who came they
literally stayed on monton my wife and I
his couch because they couldn't really
afford a hotel room so we're like AAA
come you can stay with us it's no
problem um just remember that we're not
gonna be very good host because we're
always busy running the event and now
that Brazilian contingent this year is
about 40 individuals from five different
teams all of whom came are coming
because of that first couple who came
and did it and it continues to go so
last year we had over 500 teams because
the event is similar to the Olympics in
that you have you know robot soccer and
robot combat and sumo when all these
other things a team might have a single
robot competing in a single event it
might have a single robot competing in
multiple events or it might have
multiple robots competing in multiple
events for example these robots in front
of me humanoid robots can be used in
about 12 different events the primary
one is kung fu so basically what we have
and after after my long talk I'll give
some robot demos and so the robots will
actually do kung fu and just like
regular kung fu
you know the other the other robot
falling on the mat first goes down a
point then the first robot to lose three
points is the loser and the other robot
wins but we also use these exact same
robots for robot soccer and so it's
three on three soccer we use them for
acrobatics and that was one of those
things a lot of people were feeling that
there was too much focus on out-and-out
competition and so then I wanted it more
like you know like ice skating or
gymnastics where the robots now just
perform by themselves and so now we even
have five different art robot
competitions some of those teams will be
one individual making lots and lots of
robots other teams will be many
individuals working on a single robot or
more for instance Shane nap who invited
me here he's worked both as a single and
as a team mostly building combat robots
but every robot is always better if it's
built build with teams academic papers
for both the high school and the
university students we also have a
peer-reviewed academic paper
presentation so a lot of the people for
instance the humanoids on a lot of
people to focus on vision research for
the humanoids so you can see and
actually this robot here it's got a
camera attached to it and that camera
links back to the board it can actually
do object tracking blob tracking things
like that other humanoids might be might
focus on on walking gates G AIT which is
how accurately you can get the robot to
move in the same way that a human might
move and how can we make that more
smooth we typically have about 50
competitions in which we give metals we
list over 80 competitions we don't
always get all of those competitions
subscribed one of the things I tell
neophytes is hey you want to win a medal
just compete in these competitions
because nobody else ever does and so
long as you can clear safety you'll win
which is which is a sad truth is just
that some of them sometimes the bar is
too high since the beginning back in
2004 we've offered the robot triathlon
in which you have to build a robot which
can swim run in some kind of legged
capacity and be wheeled and actually
there's some several university robots
that can do those things they just never
chance to get the time off to come and
compete we don't do every robot events
around the world we try to focus just as
that just as the Olympics doesn't do
every possible sporting event neither do
we do every possible robot event but we
try to do all of the major events the
four pillars of Robo games of the AI de
vence still our combat sumo soccer and
Robo one and I'll go over those events
now Robo one is probably the one that
most people think most of when they talk
about robots which is humanoids such as
the 2 i've got in front of me or the one
on screen most of those humanoids are
around 15 inches both of these robots in
front of me are about 13 inches they
weigh about 2 kilograms some of them can
be as tall as 4 feet and I've seen them
as small as five inches tall they tend
to be the hardest to control a wheeled
robot is a very easily controlled robot
because it's working with gravity and
basically it just sits there and it's
propelling itself whereas a walking
robot these simple humanoids only have
16 motors some of the humanoids out
there will have 24 250 motors the human
body for point of reference has about
640 muscles or motors for ranges of
motion and like I say we do have over 10
events with these robots so we do
everything from the Kung Fu and the
soccer and the acrobatics to we have a
basketball free shoot in which the
robots have to see how many basketballs
they can sink within three minutes and
this year we've added mech Wars so for
all of those people who played any kind
of mech warrior video game we're
actually now having humanoid controlled
mech warriors they're only shooting
airsoft cannons so you can see the the
cannon in front of this they shoot a
little yellow bb's and then they have
chest plates to receive the hits or not
receive the hits but one of the
interesting things about it is is that
we're trying to replicate the actual
feel of all of the mech wars video games
so that there's a camera in the head and
the human controller is not actually
allowed to watch the field of play so if
the field of play is over here the
humans would be around the curtain back
here they can watch the camera that can
see what's going on through the camera
and they're allowed any feedback from
that
robot in the same way that if you're
inside the robot you get feedback but
what you're not allowed to do is
actually watch the field of play so you
don't have that eye in the sky sense of
okay I know that my opponent is over
there and there will be artificial
building so we've built all these
styrofoam buildings so that the robots
can hide and move around and things like
that so if you don't see the other robot
through your camera you don't know where
he is and then you have to you know work
within that strategy of finding the
other robot or sitting and waiting for
him or her to come to you and speaking
of him or her coming to you another
interesting thing about Robo games is
the number of female participants I am a
former computer programmer and I think a
lot of you here are or work with
computer programmers and it's probably
like a 95 to 98th percentile of men to
women an interesting thing about robot
competitions is it's probably thirty to
forty percent women so it is is a much
nicer more diverse talent pool robot
soccer is probably the most difficult to
the challenge we actually offer several
different forms of robot soccer several
different leagues the picture up there
is called mera saath which is a micro
robot soccer all of those robots are 10
centimeter squares or less so about four
inches are less about the size of a
Rubik's Cube on there all autonomous you
have to program the robot major command
center and what you do is generally
program a laptop which then speaks via
Wi-Fi or bluetooth or any other
communication protocol to your five or
11 depending on which field you're
playing robots and then that coordinates
though the little colors if you can see
them there's stickers on top and those
identify the robot so there's to look
down cameras above the field identifying
the robots the interesting thing about
mera saath and this is where I talk
about my friend Rick who came and just
stopped and watch this is unlike regular
soccer which can be very boring in terms
of like you know you get a 120 score or
you get nothing nothing scores and
things like that mera saath you get us
football kinds of scores it's so fast
it's even though they're tiny little
robots they're lightning fast and so
it's not a typical to see scores of 25
to 17 to these kinds of scores real real
football scores and it's lightning fast
it uses a golf ball as
as the ball which is also great for pool
style things so it's very much more like
indoor soccer league rather than
traditional European soccer league so
there's lots of bouncing the ball off
the walls and all these kinds of physics
involved it's very fast the other soccer
leagues we do is we do the humanoid
soccer league which that is human
controlled and one of the interesting
things we found out about this is for
those of you who like kung fu movies and
things like that when the bad guy in a
kung fu movie or something like
Highlander does the backflips all the
way down the hall you know to get away
from the other guys or to get to the
other guys what we found in humanoid
soccer is that actually works better
than running down the field so everybody
thinks we're showing off when we're
playing humanoid soccer when in fact
what we do is it's just faster to
cartwheel down the the field than it is
for the for a humanoid robot to run down
the field so it almost looks more like a
gymnastics meet than a soccer meet
because you'll just see these robots
going head over heels or cartwheeling up
and down up and down the field and then
jumping and doing kung fu moves to turn
around really quickly to kick the ball
unfortunately like human soccer you do
see a lot of human soccer scores in the
semi-final round last year I we actually
try and get as many people involved as
possible so I I have a fleet of 20 of
these robots and we loan them out to
other team so the other teams could play
and there was an Austrian team that had
come they'd never used the robots before
and so I loan them a set of robots and
so they went through the tree the
competition tree and unfortunately in
the semi-final round they beat us the US
team one to nothing in overtime so I
ended up not getting any medals and they
ended up getting the the silver medal
with our robots so you can even win
without owning any robots other variants
are those like trash cans sized soccer
so it's about the size of a small
trashcan and those are all autonomous
but they don't talk to a central
computer they just talk amongst
themselves just like humanoids so
basically each one has it has it has an
own objective like if you're the goalie
you know that you're the goalie or if
you're the forward you know that you're
the forward and you try and coordinate
passing and things like that
sumo is probably the oldest robot
competition like I said before you don't
have two fat guys you have two skinny
little robots what you see in that is
it's an autonomous League and it's a
black surface with a white circle and so
generally you have two sets of sensors
one is a look down sensor so that if the
robot hits that white line you know that
you're hitting the white line so that
you don't so that the robot doesn't
drive itself out of the arena the other
sensors are to find the other robot and
because it's a perfect environment as a
general rule if that robot sees
something else then it knows that that's
the other robot so then it then it goes
and sometimes you get matches over
unlike real sumo which is which is
fairly long most robot sumo matches will
last ten seconds tops before the other
robots been pushed out I had the I had
the great pleasure of going to the
all-japan robot sumo tournament in
december of last year and for the first
time ever in Japanese history the yogas
una the grand champion of robots uma was
it was a woman and not only was she the
champion but her robot was so powerful
with downforce a lot of sumo robots use
magnets that she had to drive her robot
off of the raised the raised ring like
you see there onto a wooden platform
because no human was ever capable and we
tried to pull her robot off of the steel
ring because her down force was so
strong most of the time what would
happen if you were standing outside of
the ring and he picked up her robot the
ring which weighs about 200 pounds would
just come up with it so if you're strong
enough to lift the 200-pound ring that
would just come up otherwise you just
fought with it and but what she would do
is she would drive it backwards onto a
circular mounted wooden platform and
then it would just lose its downforce as
we drive onto the wood combat certainly
is probably the most famous because of
battle bots and robot wars on TV like
all of the competition's anyone can do
it one of the reasons why I say anyone
can do it is because that has so many
weight classes the TV show typically
showed the larger weight classes like
the 220 or three hundred and forty pound
weight class
but it goes all the way down to 5.3
grams or five point three ounces 100
grams and the the most popular weight
class a lot of kids get involved in are
the one pound and three pound weight
classes there's also 12-pound 30 pound
and 60 pounds so Shane for example
competes in the 12 and the 30 pound on
it three pound so it's one of those
things where you can build a three pound
robot combat combat robot for 200 bucks
or more I mean some of the robots even
the lighter weight robots will cost
thousands of dollars in the upper class
again you can do it for very cheaply
I've known junkyard guys who will build
a 220 pound robot for 200 bucks mostly
because they're finding old wheelchair
motor wheelchair motors things like that
that they're using for their drive
trains they're using old junk for their
infrastructure things like that and
sometimes those robots are better than
other robots there's a very notorious
robot from a calm multi-millionaire
called buster and I actually asked how
all the other day and he finally
admitted it Buster cost him ninety
thousand dollars to build it's a ninety
thousand dollar 220 pound robot milled
out of a solid piece of titanium and if
you if anybody knows anything about
metallurgy if you don't let me say that
titanium is one of the strongest metals
that you can buy and he was using an
industrial titanium alloy a
military-grade alloy and he doesn't even
know the dollar sign but when machinist
look at that you count the number of
bits that he had to have gone through
milling milling out a solid billet into
the hole inside and so um have been
having been a former professor of
robotics I was with the head of
mechanical engineering we were looking
at that and he estimated probably about
five thousand dollars of milling bits
just because bits break especially with
things like titanium so you can spend
ninety thousand dollars building a robot
that loses and you can spend two hundred
dollars building a robot that wins or of
course you can spend you know two
hundred dollars building a robot that
loses and ninety thousand dollars
building a robot that wins there's not
necessarily a corollary between your
ability to win and the cost of the robot
tetsujin is one of the most interesting
of the events that we do um
is not a purely robotic event for those
of you who remember aliens Starship
Troopers these movies what tetsujin is
is you actually strapped on a robotic
augmentation suit and then we have three
challenges the one shown is lifting and
so Alec so close ski the guy is shown in
this photograph is lifting I don't know
probably about 45 hundred pounds on that
barbell more so than he could ever list
lift by himself there's another guy who
competes Monty Reed who actually was
paralyzed in a skydiving accident and
we've actually got photographs of money
jumping and so he's built a suit which
doesn't allow him to walk interestingly
enough but it does allow him to hop and
so he hops back and forth wearing his
suit CBS actually just did a really good
um special on money Robo Magellan is a
more locally started competition and for
those of you who know the DARPA Grand
Challenge you know Robo Magellan it's
just a very scaled-down version of the
darpa grand challenge instead of
building a life-size autonomous car
you're building a remote-control sized
autonomous car and where we do the event
we do the event at fort mason in san
francisco right on the water all of the
events happen inside except for Robo
Magellan and then there's a park right
above fort mason and so the robots have
to go from one end of the park to the
other but it is not a straight line kind
of event there's about six cones that
the robots get extra points for going to
the cones and touching them they get the
gps waypoints for both the start the end
and the cones but there are lots and
lots of obstacles in that particular
park there's a giant sinkhole that the
robots can go in and if you go into that
sinkhole you can't see out there's trees
there's rocks there's pathways there's
joggers there's dogs we actually last
year we had a dog attack one of the
robots and there's a lot of great
photographs of that on flickr if you can
find them so there's lots of obstacles
just like regular darpa grand challenge
and as I said the beginning there's lots
of events to Robo games there's fire
fighting the photograph accompanying
this slide is the fire fighting arena
and firefighting basically it's a
long-term goal of
building autonomous robots that today we
have you know robot vacuum cleaners that
can sit in your house and then just turn
on automatically it's a three in the
morning and do your vacuuming or at noon
when you're at work however you want to
work it the goal of fire fighting robots
is kind of to cross that robot vacuum
with a fire extinguisher and a smoke
detector so that basically when most
household fires happen they're in full
conflagration by the time the fire
department gets there if you could have
a household fire fighting robot not
actually something where you're
retrofitting a building like this is
where you've actually got a sprinkler
system but just something that anybody
can buy put it in their house sense a
fire and then put out that fire really
before it gets too bad that's the point
of fire fighting robots and speaking of
anybody being able to compete an
interesting thing about Robo games is
we're on our sixth year now we've done
it five years in a row we introduced
firefighting the second year so it's
only been a challenge for four years the
picture there is of a little boy named
Tony Pratt canas Tony Pratt canas when
this photograph was taken was I think 13
I seem to think he's 17 right now so I'm
doing the backwards math most of the
people who compete in firefighting
robotics are professional engineers I 40
year olds with professional engineering
degrees because it's a very difficult
challenge you have to be able to
identify the fire versus the hot spots
of light so it's not strictly a bright
point you have to actually have heat
sensors you have to be able to solve the
literal maze of going from room to room
to find the fire you have to be able to
put out the fire all of these autonomous
challenges so most of the people who
compete are either grad students or
professional engineers tony is a the
first year was a 14 year old home school
student who took the gold medal and has
taken the gold medal every year and all
of the professional engineers especially
two guys who own a very successful
robotics company called illogic Bob and
Ted their goal every single year is to
try to beat Tony and every single year
Tony still beats them so this is again
one of these things where just like the
Olympics just because you're the best
funded or the oldest or the best known
doesn't mean that you're going to end up
being
the winner Tony every year nobody nobody
used to know this little kid now
everybody knows him just walked in and
said okay I'm here to win and we get
that a lot you know everybody comes in
and like they're gonna win the gold
medal blah blah blah blah blah Tony came
in and we're like okay nice let a nice
little boy and now you know if Tony says
something I'm just like dude go do it
you know whatever there's micro mouse
which are maze solving robots the biped
race which is again reusing all of these
humanoids and so it's a straight line
race we also have a one one thousandth
scale marathon which is about 4,000 feet
I think and then I just circle the
circle for I think it's 11 times through
the through the house and it's actually
a big challenge because getting a
humanoid robot as you'll see when I'm
done talking to walk a few steps is
fairly easy getting humanoid robot to be
able to do a 1000th scale marathon is
nearly impossible because the robots
keep falling and collapsing and and just
slapping all over the place the
triathlon as I mentioned before never
actually take nobody's ever taken me up
on it line following if you can talk
about the darpa grand challenge you have
to understand that line following is an
intrinsic ability to go anywhere and
most people don't really realize how
many lines we follow in our daily basis
of we're following the line of where the
wall is we're following the lines on the
road of the little yellow markers on one
side of the road and little white
markers down the center ribbon climbing
which is a space challenge if for those
of you are familiar with Asimov stories
about ribbons going up to the sky and
eventually they want to do that we have
X and Lego challenges I bow performer
challenges which is basically making an
I bodu cool tricks to wheel balancers so
for those of you are familiar with
segways it's kind of a make your own
Segway event best of show a lot of times
we get robots that don't fit into
anything you know you're not a walking
robot that can run a marathon you're not
a fire fighting robot or a combat robot
you're just a guy or a gal or team of
people who built a cool robot and it
doesn't fit into anything else so we
created the best of show competition to
just give everybody else who has some
kind of robot a way to compete and so
that's really the if you don't fit into
everything else then you go against
everybody else who
doesn't fit into anything else and then
we figure out which is the best of those
robots the Walker challenge is actually
for hexapods and things like that so not
the bipeds and here's some pictures of
some of the robots that have competed
interestingly enough the lower left hand
robot is a steam-powered walking robot
so what you what you see on that is
actually a small steam engine it's
actually driven by steam and yet and
it's strict and there's not a single
piece of digital software on there or
any microchips it is self balancing and
it can walk and it's really a brilliant
robot we also have art robot
competitions and that's that whole form
follows function ever after a thing is
we wanted to take all of the cool acting
robots and make them look better and so
we wanted to influence as well as give
the artists and a chance to compete so
we have kinetic robots which are robots
which look cool and have at least one
motor or pneumatic or hydraulic device
attached to it static robots such as the
one shown which just looks cool musical
robots have to play a musical instrument
of some sort bartending robots which
have to make and/or serve a drink be it
like a mixed cocktail or even a beer and
painting robots which is actually a
robot that makes art you have a blank
sheet of paper and that robot Miss make
might make some sort of art over the
course of the weekend beam robots which
are stands for biology electrical
athletic and mechanical which are
strictly analog based robots there's no
digital programming in there like I
program these robots and I have huge
strands of code I think this is about
seven thousand lines of code to make him
walk and do all of the tricks he does
beam robots there's not a single line of
code but using strictly analog
engineering you can make those robots
actually respond to their environment we
have kids events unlike us first another
competition we charge nothing for kids
to compete so we have I think at this
point about 15 different exclusive kids
events for kids from 0 to 17 to compete
at no charge everything from combat for
those kids who want to participate in a
combat environment against each other
rather than it is not fair to send a
twelve-year-old kid with a combat
robot up against a team of professional
engineers there's just no way that
that's that's going to work so basically
segmented that off not one hundred
percent of the divisions but basically
it's probably about ten to fifteen
percent of the divisions that we have
have kids exclusive events and you know
the importance of sponsors is one of the
big things is basically my wife and I've
been paying for this out of our own
pockets for the last six years so we're
always looking for sponsors such as
Google and other companies to help pay
for this the future there's cards on the
seats of the event is June twelfth
thirteenth and fourteenth in San
Francisco at fort mason will get at
least thirty countries historically
speaking and probably somewhere in the
neighborhood of 500 to 600 robots off
the top of my head I know last year we
had 450 something robots I'll say 450
with about 850 humans and about 500
teams and again sometimes you'll have a
team of one human and two robots one
human and one robot ten humans and one
robot and so on and so forth and any
questions and then I'm going to do some
robot demos
how many of your competitions highlight
some practical fast um not to be snarky
but I guess it depends on how how much
you define practical case in point the
combat robots several combat robot teams
are now US military contractors who are
building bigger better robots
specifically that are lighter more
easily carried by soldiers that can be
entered into combat and have a higher
sustaining rate of combats of actual
real live combat so if you look at robot
combat as it stands right now one does
not think that it has any practical
applications and yet it can and it's not
just you know in the combat let's kill
people events a lot of the robot combat
guys are finding better ways to make
speed controllers and batteries which is
all the electric cars so we're going to
talk about Tesla cars Tesla is always
going to need lighter batteries that can
carry more amps per kilogram as well as
better speed controllers that aren't
going to incinerate and for those of you
who don't speed controller is robots
fundamentally operate radically
differently from an internal combustion
engine in terms of acceleration and
speed and so what a speed controller
does is not to give you a long
engineering lecture but basically
instead of increasing voltage from the
batteries to the motors it pulses a
constant voltage between the batteries
and the motors the example I would give
is if I had an incandescent bulb and I'm
turning it on and off fast enough that
will appear to be that same bulb at
fifty percent light value rather than a
hundred percent like the value or zero
percent like light value and the problem
just in combat robots is the number of
speed controllers that just absolutely
self-destruct and incinerate and the
number of fires that we have to deal
with every single event not just in
combat but and everything else in the
case of the humanoid events you can you
can extrapolate both it's nice to have a
robot that can operate in a human
environment a lot of robot roboticists
argue against humanoid robots because
they say it's just vain rather than
using wheeled robots well it's I don't
consider it vein or unveil I considered
practical because the world in which we
live as humans is based on bipedal
movement
and if you are confined to a wheelchair
ever you understand just how much you
are confined to bipedal actions that if
you want to get up to the second floor
if you're in a wheelchair you now have
to find an elevator go up the elevator
and come back bipedal movement a biped
canal walk up and down the staircase
right here so whether you're having a
robot perform day-to-day tasks which can
now operate in the same environment or
whether you're extrapolating this making
this into a tetsujin suit and taking out
the motors as superstructure and using
your own bones as superstructure and
then using lighter weight motors to flex
muscles which are now dead you know it's
it's a very practical thing so I would
argue that one hundred percent of the
events to some extent are practical it's
just a question I mean search engines
when search engines started most of them
were not you know the Lycos based model
of going out and looking for web pages
they were the Yahoo based model of
people had to register with that search
engine to be found and so search engine
work considered practical until
originally Michael Mauldin went out and
said I'm going to create a web engine
that goes out and crawls you know and
now that's what Google does know it's
what everybody else does so there are
practical exploitation of all the
robotic events here that I could not
ever imagine but every year somebody
comes up with and finds a new a new goal
for that so I would say that one hundred
percent of the events have practical
applications I don't necessarily know
what they are I could probably go
through every single event and find at
least one practical application I guess
my observation was there was a lot of
government-funded research on
an economy that didn't achieve very many
results until the Grand Challenge had a
specific non-trivial task they're
required you know look just write a
paper and say look what I'm not and I
completely agree in just on a very
personal basis I don't think a lot of
government grants end up with with good
results because it's in your best
interest as a recipient of a government
rent and remember i come from the
university background to not come up
with a result because then you can get a
grant extension and continue on that
little gravy train so I think the darpa
grand challenge was good in that
capacity because you had a deadline and
you had a competition and it wasn't just
okay go research how to do line
following its go research how to do line
following in a real world environment oh
and by the way one of you wins and the
rest of you lose and that's why
competitions like you know robo games or
the Grand Challenge or anything else are
good because you're pitted against
somebody else you know and if you take
that even in the business degree of say
google versus yahoo you need to be
better because you know if not they're
going to make more money so you know to
that end you know you're exactly right
the you know the more these kinds of
ents force people to be better
we posted RoboCup events before for a
lot of reasons RoboCup doesn't have any
interest in co-locating with other
events and that's very true of many
events which is to say we always try to
be very inclusive of basically anybody
who wants to do a robot event at Robo
games I will say yes to so long as I
believe that that person organizing it
is capable of doing it the mech warriors
for example is not my idea again I by
the name of Andrew alter said hey
wouldn't it be cool if we did this and I
said if you can find the contestants to
do it and you were willing to organize
that as a sub event in the same way that
the Olympics Committee doesn't organize
all of the events at the Olympics
Committee they organize the Olympics and
then you know the professional gymnasts
Association whatever they may be are the
ones that actually organize the
gymnastics at the Olympics and so we've
always done outreach to every major
organization and say hey you know we're
not trying to compete with you we're
trying to augment you and we're trying
to you know highlight that to another
audience and so I've talked to everybody
at RoboCup I mean manuela at Carnegie
Mellon she doesn't like us because she
really despises robot combat and doesn't
want to be in the same city with robot
combat you know so we've done and we've
but we have had RoboCup teams come we
have done I bow soccer before actually
i'm going to show you guys a video to of
like an eight-minute video of some of
the events so we have we have done both
RoboCup and fira for those of you who
there's there's two competing robot
soccer organizations fira which is a
play on fifa the Federation
international football association it's
Federation international robot Football
Association and there's RoboCup which is
play on FIFA's World Cup organization
one of us started Korea one of them
started in Japan and they have very
little in reach actually into the u.s.
fira has like two or three universities
that compete and robocop has maybe 10 US
universities that compete in robocop
most of the soccer contestants just like
human soccer it's a very non US kind of
sport so I mean Carnegie Mellon
University of Texas at Austin Villa are
two very big Robo
supporters but unfortunately there's not
many more that i know of i'm going to
show you this video actually and then
I'll have to take more questions and I'm
fairly good on time for change her long
and welcome to games across America our
little coast-to-coast quest to bring you
this nation's honest games and craziest
competitions a San Francisco sports fans
they love their Giants and their 49ers
but recently the city was teeming with
superhuman athletes all running on juice
no none time in steroids I'm talking to
my eyes
robots right this way the Robo games is
really scientific exhibition there is a
wide variety of different kinds of
robots a lot of people from other
countries are coming out where are they
coming from from every continent what is
the name of your robot limo a robot
we're the paranoid Android's this is our
robot Marvin number two number two okay
does he ever go number two sorry Oh is
he peeing on me he's a little
territorial drop and give me 20 humans
still have control it's a hobby it's an
art form but then it's also just the
thrill of being at the cutting edge of
the technology and being able to make
these robots do things that nobody else
in the world for you anytime you get
geeks thinking in mass you get societal
benefits from that you prefer the
company of robots to humans yeah yeah I
mean with David Hawkins he is the
organizer of the Robo games and it was
started out as the Robo Olympics did the
Olympic Committee get on occasion
changes the olympic committee gets on
everybody's case
tell me a little bit about how the robo
games is evolved last year we only have
31 events this year we have 43 events
robot soccer is probably the hardest you
have to do both the artificial
intelligence as well as all of the
sensors to find the ball we've got sumo
competitions which are two instead of
two fat guys pushing each other and
going into skinny little robots which is
where the mawashi unfortunately not
we've got Robo Magellan in which robots
are given to GPS points and they have to
go from point A to point B combat robot
combat everybody knows it from those two
popular TV shows it's kinda like NASCAR
you know it does a lot of fun to watch
is there any cash prizes for any there
are cash prizes but the real prize are
the gold silver and bronze medals these
are all personalized with a little
scrolling LED displays so if you win
it'll have your name on it yummy nipples
amigos and amigas ropa para la football
hi Bo soccer is a part of the Robocop
initiative with the ultimate goal of
getting robots to be able to beat the
World Cup champion soccer team on a real
soccer field the robot that can play
soccer can do nearly anything a robot
that can kick a ball the conoco lisanna
fears can also localize in any other
environment
Oh
here comes the judge vipin sued steel
piranha Devils plunger Leatherface
indestructible crazy blue monkey MC pee
pants I watched too much TV it's off the
TV show
any fighting style better for robots and
it's pretty much anything goes that's
why we do it behind steel cages and
bulletproof glass all right put a
rotating weapon on the back the idea is
to throw some robots up in the air our
idea is to get under the other guy and
the ball breaking this is obviously a
robot that should not be left alone with
kids absolutely not it should be left
alone with me
now that you do in your last competition
the guy was so beat up he couldn't be
repaired I'm used to beating people but
that was a good I mean I sprayed him all
over the arena what's cool is this for
CSUN cal state northridge they're
probably getting graded on this do you
feel sorry for them at all yeah because
the problem oh goodness this is an
outlet for geeks and engineers because
nobody wants to see two geeks fight fist
to fist
we're here robo sumo I know it's a
little different because these robots
aren't very fat what does it do it finds
them such as the opponent off the sumo
ring i hope this gentleman's robot is
lost Brock great dishonor to his family
I'm hoping he doesn't come in Harry
Caray we're trying to do here is trying
to navigate this course and autonomously
find these codes along the way there's a
starting come here and there's a
finished cutting up there the real
challenge is going from point A to point
B around all the trees the bushes it
looks like a laptop on a
radio-controlled car on top of it we
have a few sensors like a webcam and so
unfamiliar with weapons okay oh okay oh
oh you mean for all right yet over ones
can walk they can dance they can stand
on their heads they're just very very
advanced he has 17 degrees of freedom
and a degree of freedom is each one of
these toilets I had 17 degrees of
freedom before I got married maybe three
are you robot shy please checking right
now yeah he's a little nervous he
decided to give it a weapon if you put a
real blade in there it could possibly
cut some sushi first place with the
robo-one demonstration weird 72 do you
go to the other robot one guys and you
go in your face your robot stinks but in
here we all know no no limit never
thought about that
can you do the robot
Jimmy in the dance the robot is a way
back to Dunston I am really cute now he
give you the robot but can he do the
human he can uh it's surprisingly hard
to give a robot soul we've got four
different kinds of art robots we've got
static robots for this robot sculptures
cannock robot spare goal is just look
cool musical playing of us physically
play and it's robots that can sing so we
no longer have the need for Ashlee
Simpson my favorites bartending class
already perfect martini if you're
looking for anybody to judge the
martinis this must be a human thing yes
though I wouldn't that's around touching
people there what do you call one of
those small robust short circuit I know
it's good you built a robot that could
play games yep connect core drop went in
there then hit the blue button over here
it's just going to stick that down it's
looking to see if there's an odd or an
even number of chips in each column
that's what you're going for isn't it
robot you're an evil bot aren't you so
far you're not doing bad i may look
stupid but I've bested my fair share of
robots you're a little probably going to
go right here is this going to give him
a diagonal and a horizontal as you can
do whatever you want to maybe you won't
see it I think you will see it your best
mate foster robot again first one stole
my girlfriend out if you can
few people gender eyes the robots as
they say they'll have soy la tenderize
the robust is it a boy or a girl bond
it's a car bot this one is a boy bot oh
it's definitely a boy bought I would say
more males born in all but expensive it
boy bot
and not the segway was full so I built
my own this about a little electronic
controller that senses which way is
tilting and runs the wheels quarterback
word to keep it level all right
don't don't fight it just hold still no
no I need to do this with all your
knowledge of robots have you made a
pleasure but no this is my budget and
only but how far away are we from a
pleasure body this cool sigh hope I
think you need to get out more or find a
date
these are robos that I have captured in
the field they have intermixed and have
mutated in creating robots yes you
trading you have a cell phone on you not
at the moment oh good good no then we
can be this close they go crazy for a
cell phone oh hang on a second you get
rid of your that's helpful you're right
y'all call you back
Softspots is 16-ounce robots 16 ounces
of fun fun and pain and damage it's a
little underwhelming Oh FCP fence crows
about quickly your champion how does
that feel it was good man I'm here with
the champion smashbox who gets all the
robots girls and stuff obviously he's a
celebrity well he's kind of a geek so he
doesn't get a whole lot of women this is
it people the championship the super
heavyweight match super mega byte ready
to take on shovelhead that beat him a
couple other times he's being a couple
times too so good even match
shovelhead is the first to attack but a
brutalist everybody show that using
sheer force here comes super mega back
now on the offensive sparks are
literally flying there goes show us
weapon fa
robo games everyone's getting better and
better we have to be getting better and
better the good thing about losing is
you learn something but it's much better
to win um more questions short answers
no because everybody else is going out
of business nobody's nobody else is
obsessive also as I am I honestly I mean
it's the robot combat guys after battle
bots went off the air about 16 companies
around the u.s. who started all whom
built their own arenas all of whom have
since folded all of whom since I bought
out um yeah it's it's a it's there
unlike many business models it has a lot
of unique aspects to it such as the fact
that unlike say a normal entertainment
business model for the Rolling Stones
you know you have the five guys on stage
that's it right so you do to show part
of our business model is other people
have to do to show we have to invite
other contestants to come and it can be
very difficult getting other contestants
to town sometimes part of it is the cost
of doing it in other parts of the
country and things like that so it's the
shortest answer is is there's some small
small teeny tiny like little events that
happen at science museums and things
like that but this is this is the
biggest
a few pyramid even there's a lot of
small ones the guys aren't doing any
more no how would you suggest start um
depends on what kind of robot the quick
and dirty answer i'll give you is the
best way to start is still Lego
Mindstorms Lego has its own unique
robotics program which is not your
normal Legos okay you're putting the
trinkets together then you're holding in
your hand flying around you know like
like an x-wing fighter or something Lego
Mindstorms has multiple inputs and
outputs sensor based technology you can
program of the mind starts pregnancy as
well as about five other languages you
program java has its own national
instruments stripped-down version of
LabVIEW
multiple I think so that's the canary
way I know many professional roboticists
putting a Shannon eyes different that
Nick who prototype all of this full
machined aluminum robots in Lagos
because if you screw something up in a
big log Luminum tube you've just thrown
away several hundred dollars and the
aluminum is gone but you can get all of
the basic mechatronics down and play
goes and then extrapolate that if you
want something a little bit more direct
to a pic microcontroller i recommend the
parallax Pro bot which is a small 1600
based pic program directly from your pc
if you want a humanoid we sell these
kits so you can buy them as a kit
unassembled or you can buy the employee
assembled ready to walk and they come
with 24 built-in routines and you can
just reprogram them
if you want a combat robot I would say
by an ant wait robot the one pounds
start with that so you can figure out
the basics of mechatronics and then work
your way up it really depends on which
aspect
the
pretty hard work center Shuba diamonds
then I more flashes the robot this is
there is there a a more pure software
venue for competition ah I mean I would
see it at these twenty percent of the
events are actually all software is to
the fireman
most of those fire fighting robots are a
shoebox we provide
and then your programming
in the case of like these guys again
by this
software
so certainly combat is
there are high school builder most
beaten colors
it's ninety-five percent partner based
so in that range he gave us there
i would say about twenty percent of
those events are our software challenges
soccer stuff you can buy like Paris on
by all those hardware things so this is
actually what anything originally
founded me that when I was talking about
how the hardware guys never talked to
the software guys and software guys turn
onto the sensor guys and so on and so
forth that's the thing is there are many
many software challenges most of the
soccer challenges really are sovereign
challenge what you saw with I pose
replaying you buy oh so I boats and you
reprogram absolutely what drives me
crazy actually about to Sony AIBO guys
is it talks to them if the igo breaks
they have no idea fix them I think they
should raise that bar a little bit more
like okay if this like a car now you
should know where it for the gas and a
lot of them don't actually know how to
replace the circle
but above it beyond that yeah absolutely
do much the soccer challenge or the
software firefighting strictly software
may solving a strictly saw software
I'll expensive are those I
you can buy the monthly days in the 400
it's two thousand dollar rate and I will
also say and I'm not related to some
sony I boat is probably the single
greatest of the super product it's also
probably one of the worst marketed
products that has ever come out people
that really just seen it up here don't
realize is out of the box with abilities
he has very good facial recognition
software built into it and recognize 75
basis so inconvenient I always consider
that a great cocktail robot if you have
a cocktail party and you bite a whole
bunch of people from work and you don't
remember this guy's name you can have
them be like you know the town crier
robot so when this guy walks through the
door the robot say hey it's shane from
marketing because robot has a facial
recognition from those new styles so
then you go Oh a say the long time you
know you don't have to worry about
forgetting names it has a text-to-speech
software it came out before a span
became a real problem and a real real
problem I mean I have like 33 spam
filters through server side
so it can read you your email reason to
be spam copy obviously you know
unfortunately you're getting 100 pieces
of email of which only three your Valley
you have to assign v8 the times you
won't read the full email it will read
you the titles take your 20 it has voice
recognition so you can say yes I want to
hear in this email no I don't want to
hear that email um you can roll over it
can it's got software to be party dog so
it like give all these tricks and things
like that it can be tella it so you can
get work the robot can be at home you
can control the robot through the
internet so long as your home PC has a
Wi-Fi connection and hook up for that so
you can walk the dog around your house
and find out if your wife is sleeping
phenomena kids are doing homework if
there's you know a burglar announced
sony never told anybody about that so
people would walk into the sony store go
twenty-five hundred dollars for toy
screw that and they never really
realized exactly how column about the
robot knows if you can find an e RS 7
which is the ones you saw there Snoopy
dog lucky ones
the last time i looked on ebay which is
over a year ago you don't know at that
time the price was holding at about
3,000 okay i don't know if there's been
significant depreciation prices in
center time I know that the robocup guys
would always be buying on ebay RoboCup
recently changed from that platform with
different platforms so they're not as in
greater than manner
so
is your winners on website or something
too in particular absolutely I look at
this in the past it was motor technology
that was the big problem I would say
that although all the technologies are
issues and they all are interrelated but
yes I don't know if I'm if I'm connect
to the internet through here not but
yeah we list all of the winners year
after year both by robot and my country
so
but I was more like a how-to on these
murders are useful these sensors
um that's almost a religion war and
there's so many companies out there now
that provide essentially the same
services that I mean motor technology
there's either just in combat there's at
least 20 different really good motor
manufacturers all of which are very good
and it's religion you know it's jus
Christian Muslim I mean you know we got
I know guys will absolutely only ever
use NPC motors and don't you dare
mention another another brand I know
other guys will only ever use macs and
motors and don't you ever mention
another brand or e text and so on and so
forth so certainly that is really not an
issue
but as far as the winners yeah we always
really try and highlight the winners n
by country as well so mostly I would say
that the u.s. dominates by virtue of the
fact that this is a SAN francisco-based
competition and it still costs a lot of
money to fly to San Francisco so you
know I like last year the Koreans who
came out early completely dominated the
humanoid events so those were the
humanoid events from last year and we
had one Korean University team that came
with I think six robots and what it I
think USA won five of the possible
medals and Korea just took everything
else and of those five they're all
different teams whereas all of the the
other Korean metals are from a single
team they were just so dominant now
we've had japanese contestants in the
past same thing like here you can see
the japanese dominate in sumo robots and
i think that's very much a corollary to
both the cultures of varying societies
as well as it correlates back to even
the regular olympics where the US will
typically dominate in these olympic
sports and Japan will dominate in those
Olympic sports and Russia and these
other ones you know and so for instance
like hockey you know exclusive of you
know 1984 you know Russia has always
been a very 1980 whichever the dream
team was Russia has always been a very
dominant hockey team canada's always
been a very dominant hockey team you
know i mean it's cool to the jamaicans
feel the bobsled team but they're not
going to win any medals you know and
it's it's that kind of thing of their
definitely dominating countries
mark questions
anybody in South Carolina
no I'll have the robot do some tricks
i'm gonna be really brave and try this
on the stand
you
