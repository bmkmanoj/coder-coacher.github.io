is implemented and what the possible
ways you can compromise the security of
quantum cryptography okay so this is
just a basic overview of my talk okay so
I'll just begin with what cryptography
was cryptography why the encryption keys
you guys probably know that much better
than I do
well now what I'll try introduce is what
can quantum cryptography do which is
different from classical cryptography
then I'll talk about the BB 84
implementation which is a very standard
way of implementing quantum key
distribution nowadays the commercial
companies are willing to sell you
products ok based on this BB 84 protocol
I'll try and explain how the p84
protocol can be implemented and what
some of the ways you can try and hack
the system and then I was trying n with
something on how and how quantum key
distribution can be implemented using
more fundamental I should I say more
fundamental physics ideas so let's go on
okay so the whole idea actually started
back for secure communication started
back in the 70s when a guy called
Stephen whitener he thought about how
you can train in code
alright polarization states of photons
inside money so you can make money they
cannot be copied okay now but in the
whole field actually took off only in
1984 when two guys called Banner and
Prasad came up with a way to distribute
encryption keys for quantum to
distribute encryption keys in a way that
cannot be hacked based on the principles
of physics so let's have an overview
first or what secure communication
usually is basically there are two ways
to do it okay these symmetric encryption
methods and in the asymmetric methods
okay
in the symmetric methods you can have
the one-time pad okay
or the volume cipher or you can have
something like three des or AES okay
what happens is that Alice and Bob on
both sites they share a key they share
two keys which are the same and where is
that's if she wants to send a message to
Bob she wants a message to the key okay
and why you get a random string of bits
which can be sent to an insecure Channel
and once Bob receives that when disturb
its he using his key which is the same
and he gets the message this one's now
the other way to do it is using always a
elliptical curves and Bob has two keys
since it's one which is this private key
okay and this
public-key she sends to Alice and Alice
can visit for encrypting a message and
she sends it to Bob now what is wrong
with all I say well there's nothing
really wrong with except that the
security of this symmetric method of
encryption is based the difficulty or
the perceived difficulty of factoring
numbers so dedicated okay are you fine
some clever algorithm or you can have a
quantum computer and then you take some
time of it and then you can finally
extract the key so the security of the
communication can be compromised in some
ways now so the problem is this if you
want really secure methods then you
probably want to try to use symmetric
encryption methods okay and then that
means that Alice and Bob must have the
same encryption key okay so how are
anything about going to get the same
encryption key and there's the problem
that quantum cryptography tries to solve
okay actually I don't like the name
quantum cryptography because you don't
in this thing we are talking about you
don't try encrypt any message the only
thing you're trying to do is distribute
an encryption key between two parties so
I prefer the name quantum key
distribution okay so to do key
distribution there are two ways at least
can make make her encryption key and
give it to a trusted career who bring it
over to Bob okay or Alice and Bob can
Twain obtain the keys in some kind of
temporal safe devices okay now it turns
out that you can use the principles of
physics to encode the key either in
front of a trusted courier or in the
form of temple safe devices okay so I'll
walk you guys through this now that's a
quick reminder what is a good key okay
so bad key is of course something which
is always the same and
a better key something which is look
slightly more vendôme okay so now it
turns out that again using the
principles of physics you can get pretty
random outcomes which can form your
random key okay so how do we how do we
do this okay first of all we have to
understand that information is physical
and it's encoded inside into physical
objects okay so if Alice wants to encode
her random key and give it to Bob she
can you know encoded either is in holes
in paper or ink okay in a classical way
and then you know she can have a piece
of paper with holes inside and then she
sends it over to Bob Bob can be when
there's a hole is zero and with no hole
is one but these are what we call based
on classical physics these are classical
objects okay
and basically they can be copied what we
want to try and find a finest for a way
to distinct include the information into
physical objects that cannot be copied
well when copying is done the coping
leaves a trace okay so what we try to do
is we try to use quantum particles as
the courier for the information okay so
the idea is basically that if you can
encode the key into quantum particles
and these quantum particles cannot be
copied perfectly or cloned perfectly
okay then the measurement then the
measurements and the copying will
actually disturb the state of these
quantum particles okay
and what what happens is that when Bob
tries to beat out the state or the
quantum particles he finds that he's put
the state he expects is not the same as
what at least would have sent to him
okay and so if there is dropping effort
actually leaves traces and it's how the
information the eavesdropper is reveal
okay so one way to do this is to include
the key inside the polarization state of
single photons
okay and so let's see how it's done
with single photons now you can think of
photons as photons are simply the
smallest indivisible packet of
electromagnetic energy and
electromagnetic energy can be viewed as
a wave so now the polarization state of
a photon can be viewed as whether the
electromagnetic wave is vibrating
vertically or whether is vibrating
horizontally okay so what you can do is
say when I send a photon in the vertical
polarization state when is vibrating
vertically
I will encode the zero bit okay and when
it's vibrating horizontally I will
encode a 1 bit now how do you read out
the information of zeros and ones when
is based on photon polarization if you
send a photon into something called
polarizing beam splitter and it sorts
out photons which are vertically
polarized or horizontally polarized so
in that way you actually detect photons
which are carrying the zero bit or the 1
bit okay
now the key point is this if it is da /
twice to do this and she she puts
detectors after she detects the photon
in the particular polarization state but
then the thing is you can only detect
the take a photon once once this
detector is destroyed okay so keep that
in mind because it turns out that for
quantum key distribution what you do is
this you don't include your zero and
once only in the vertical and horizontal
polarization States you can also include
or you should also include your z1 ones
in the vertically in the past -
45-degree polarization States so
basically you think that the horizontal
and vertical polarization
you have transmitted or reflected okay
now these afters been transmitted and
reflected for example look at the green
photon which comes in hits the PBS and
it is transmitted
now this transmitted part even hits the
second PBS is transmitted again there is
no longer a 50-50 chance of being
transmitted or reflected because what
your van is you projected the stable of
1445 into the vertical an attempt to
measure the polarization still actually
changes it
okay now the photos on a vertical state
give us the polarization was in a state
which is different from the state that
you choose to measure okay then you have
disturbed the state so you can you can
see in this way how what we mean by a
disturbance on the polarization state
when you are trying to measure it now
this point is actually kind of important
okay Dov how the whole qkd scheme works
so if you have any questions right now
I can take some questions yes
okay and the question is very long but
let me try and see what whether I
understood completely you are saying
that is very important to get the
polarization state measurement correct
yes that's right okay yep so he's right
okay the question was is it important to
get the polarization measurement states
are really correct yes you have to get
it correct this when you you have to
make sure that when you're measuring HV
or you're measuring pass - 45 okay it's
important to get those states correct
but it's not so crucial in it because
using working on photons
okay there are optical elements which
are actually very high quality which if
you exactly HV or press - for your five
yeah okay actually in this table if you
guys have any questions along the way
while I'm showing the slides just stop
me at any time
well sometimes I do fly along a bit fast
okay okay so let's go back to how we
encode information now I was saying that
you can encode zeros and ones in either
the vertical or the horizontal
polarization states but you can also
record the zeros and ones in the minus
and plus 45-degree polarization States
okay so you have two ways of encoding
your information and how how this whole
qkd system works is that you can pair
your single photons in the states which
you see
and then what this does it she sends all
this signal for football and then pop
must make a random choice of measuring
either in this basis or in this basis
okay now what happens with choose this
photo dimension in this basis when
Alison in this then there's a 50/50
chance when he gets either the those
pieces analysis did not make any sense
of the of the the measured photons they
cannot really communicate anything
because there's a 50/50 chance Alice
actually send this States and measured
in the C polarization states then they
always comma beta and if those
conversations from those coalition's
election
so disappear in but the t-distribution
of the time you can get covered at least
40
okay so this is actually no describing
just now is actually called the bb-8
affair protocol see so it's also called
a measure protocol because what Alice
has to do is she super play the
polarization states of a single photons
okay and then she's to say across to Bob
and then Bob has to measure the
polarization states so what happens is
you see here is that you have your
single photon sauce you pass it to some
optical elements okay now in some state
which Alice knows okay then she sent
across to Bob okay and then what Bob
does is Bob has to choose again which
polarization States to measure in so
when you see the dices up there okay
that means that you need a random choice
okay so every step here and here you
need source of random number generators
okay
to make a choice and what happens is
after you have done bob has done the
measurement the polarization states they
do classical communication this can be a
open channel it doesn't have to be
secure where they discuss so Alice will
say okay for the first and the second
photons I sent to you though in the
horizontal and vertical basis and then
what Bob will say okay first and second
I measure in horizontal and vertical so
they agree to keep the measurements that
they did and for the first and second
photons but if they in the discussion
they find that the polarization States
the Alison was not measured in the same
state that Bob did then they will just
discard those photons and in that way
they discard
at least and 50% actually remains for
the encryption key now of course in any
practical implementation there are
errors okay and so what happens is that
the next step is that as our collection
and privacy amplification now privacy
amplification simply means that you must
assume that all the errors in your key
that you have okay come from an
eavesdropping attempt okay so what you
do is you use the ever fraction to
estimate the information of an
eavesdropper and from once you've know
the information there is dropper you can
try and correct and actually suppress
all the information that she has and
that step is called privacy now this is
an example of how a practical BB
eighty-four system we can do quantum key
distribution over five centimeters this
was actually started by was Bill in 92
by the guys who actually came out the
theory itself or BB 84
okay there's been a and Prasad and the
guys so basically you can see that they
use a simple led as a light source okay
then they have a filter okay and what
they do is they they filter down a very
classical light source it sends out
millions and millions of photons and
what you do is you filter it down you
put notes and lots of filters such that
in any single time interval when you're
trying to detect for photons let's only
on average one photon inside that time
interval so that's how the standard way
of trying to build a single photon light
source okay so that comes to our first
way to tryna take this BB 84 protocol
okay now remember I said the standard
way to try and build this single photon
sources we use a classical light source
which is very bright and then you put
lots and lots of filters okay but this
is actually a sadistic ulm ethel or
trying to get single photon sources and
for example it's one with the statistics
is described by a Poisson distribution
and what happens is that most of the
time maybe 90% of the time okay
you have zero photons inside the time
interval but maybe nine percent of the
time you have a single photon but the
remainder of the time you can have two
photons or three photons or four photons
okay so what happens in the cases when
you have two or more photons that an
eavesdropper can actually put a beam
splitter at when speed of some of the
photons which are in the polarization
state that you prepared and in that way
she can actually know exactly what was
the polarization state that Alice had
tried to send to Bob okay so why do
people use this method is that is much
easier to prepare as single photons in
this way because I know there's a lot of
experimental going to trying to prepare
real single photon sources and that's
not so simple so so the first way you
can try and hack a BB eighty-four system
okay it's just by a simple photon number
splitting attack
okay so BB 84 using this method as
potential to be insecure okay now the
other technical detail about the BB 84
sauce I showed to you is that I said
that you need a random number generators
okay to try and decide whether to encode
the photons in the horizontal or
vertical or in the plus and minus 45
polarization States now it turns out
that you don't have to use a single
classical light source to do that you
can also use small diode lasers okay
nowadays diode lasers are quite cheap
and easily easily available and the nice
thing about dial is is that they come
out we were very well defined linear
polarization state so simply by rotating
the output by simply rotating your your
diode you can get the light coming out
to be either horizontal
and you physically rotate a diode it
becomes plus 45 and it becomes
horizontal and because minus 45 so you
can get all four polarization states
just by rotating a diode and so what
people now do sometimes is that the the
by four diodes and in the oven them in
the four different polarization
directions at a1 and then what they do
is they pass it to special filters such
that the light coming out from all four
diodes at the same mode okay and then
they transmit across to Bob so Alice
would have four diodes okay and then she
just has to randomly decide which of the
diodes she's gonna select to and send
out the light over to Bob so that cuts
down some of the need for random number
generators okay so on this side and
there is now the method to cut down one
random number generator okay but on the
other side for Bob one at a simple way
to cut down the random number generators
use a passive element okay it's called a
50-50 beam splitter now if the beam
splitters I talked about just now are
polarizing beam splitters so the dip
depending on the polarization stare of
your photon it is either transmitted or
reflected but you can use a different
type of beam splitter which is
polarization insensitive so that no
matter what polarization or state of the
photon it has a 50/50 chance of being
transmitted or reflected now in that
case what happens I've half the photons
will be transmitted to another PBS where
you measure in horizontal and vertical
and other half of the cases you send the
photons into a measurement setup that
prepares the plus and minus for the five
polarization state
okay now the thing about this system is
that there actually is quite robust and
people are actually done long distance
quantum key distribution in this way
this is a result from 2002 where some
guys put now I can't remember which side
Ellis was I think all this was at the
mountaintop and Bob was in the valley
and this managed to send single photons
okay across 23 kilometers and they
connect they could actually reconstruct
an encryption key so some of the latest
developments in this field was that
people are trying to think that you can
do quantum key distribution between
earth stations and a satellite so
there's an interest in 20 codes or
longer and longer distances I think the
latest result for recall for distance
was about 144 kilometer demonstration
between two islands okay in the in the
Atlantic okay then there was a the other
way to try and improve your quantum key
distribution method is to go to larger
and larger bit weights okay and which
was done by guys at NIST okay and they
have megabit per second key exchange
okay so that's the two of the so-called
benchmarks for quantum key distribution
nowadays okay no let's take a break from
there and let's talk about another way
to try and attack quantum key
distribution remember that I said that
one of the nice ways to implement the
for polarization states was to choose
for single diodes and just rotate the
polarization that's what physically
rotate them so that the light coming out
of different polarizations now it turns
out that there's a flaw in this method
okay simply because laser diodes are not
identical they do not give you the same
spectrum no matter how you try to
control the manufacturing process
okay so in any particular batch that you
choose okay they're going to have
slightly different optical spectrum and
what you're seeing here is a measurement
on on the optical spectrum of four laser
diodes which is used in a quantum key
distribution experiment and you can see
that the peaks okay are all slightly
different so you could imagine an attack
where the eavesdropper doesn't try and
measure the polarization state but
simply send a single photons that alice
is sending to Bob just to send them into
a spectrometer okay and then just by
seeing weighed that photon ends up in a
spectrometer she can actually this she
can achieve tell what was the
polarization state of the photon okay
that's a good question
now the thing is who know that's a very
good question but it's not exactly right
so you gotta think what a photon
actually is okay
a photon is simply excitation of the
electromagnetic field
okay now you're not trying to measure
something like a polarization stare the
photon in which case I agree you need a
non song but we are talking about
wavelength okay then the photon will
actually obey the same you will have the
same frequency as in a classical fuel
and you can actually send single photons
into a spectrometer and as long as
you're using single photon detectors you
can actually pick up the direction
emission photon goes yeah
okay what what are you trying
distinguish is actually remember I show
you the graph just now let's go back
okay you look at Flair the graphite the
peaks the peaks are different cases you
can try and and from the peaks you can
actually tell statistically what's the
proportion okay no you can use a single
photon yeah use a single photon you see
we ends up in the spectrometer okay and
then from there you can tell the
probability or which polarizations from
which our laser diode was emitted
the spectrometers have to be calibrated
in the first place yeah
mmm where were we I was here oh yeah I
was here okay okay now we're just shown
that BB 84 has some some technical
problems about security and all that and
but then if you implement it correctly
you know you know this spectral attack
that I was talking about you can
actually correct for that quite
trivially you can put into a bandwidth
filter which only transmits the same
amount of light from all laser diodes
but the bigger problem for BB 84 which
is a prepare and send protocol is that
you need a very large number when we
need sorry a very large set of random
numbers okay continuously because
remember that what you're trying to do
is you're trying to filter down this
laser diode that you have such that most
of the time there's only a single photon
inside the time interval when you're
detecting photons so that means that
most of the random numbers that you are
generating and put into your system to
decide your polarization States or your
measurement outcomes most of the time
those random numbers are not being used
to generate any key because most of the
bins will have to be 0 there's no
photons inside so the question is do you
trust your random numbers ok I mean
where are you gonna get a high bandwidth
source of random numbers now it turns
out that is this is quite interesting
because you can actually use a very
special physical state to get around
this problem which I will talk about
later but this is just the key minor one
of the problems is where you get a large
source of random numbers ok so let's
talk about quantum key distribution in
the second way so the first way using
trusted quarries is BB 84 ok where L is
encodes information into single photons
and sends it to Bob but are they ways we
encode the information into temple safe
devices okay Sasha Alice and Bob can get
the key and they have correlations from
this tempo safe devices and it turns out
that yes there is such a system there is
such temper safe devices available and
they employ a concept in physics called
entanglement
okay now entanglement actually is
something quite complicated
I'll try what you guys - what
entanglement means because even within
the physics community there's a huge
debate of what entanglement actually is
and how you can measure all that but the
easiest way I can think of the describe
entanglements consider a joint system
composed of two parts okay now the thing
is these two parts described by a joint
state a joint quantum state now if you
take the two parts far away from each
other okay and you try and describe one
part by itself then it turns out that he
has no structure you cannot really say
anything in particular about that part
so imagine you have a pair of photons
for example in a joint state okay then
you take a and B far apart from each
other then you do you try and measure
the polarization state of photon a and
you will find that the polarization
state of photon a okay it's always in a
mixed state there's no well-defined
polarization state and you measure the
polarization state of photon B and you
find that again there is no well-defined
polarization State so what happens now
is you look at the measurement on
polarization a condition on polarization
P then you can find that the
correlations in the polarization State
for example if photon a is horizontally
polarized and photon B is always
vertically polarized and vice versa so
this is what we mean by a entangled
system it's strictly and quantum effect
okay there are no cross there's no
classical models to describe the system
okay and the nice thing about is that
you can actually build such systems in
practice okay how do we do it
well this I'm showing you a diagram
based on nonlinear optics
okay which is actually called a quick
ninety five method of generating
entangled photon pairs and the nice
thing about is is not only entangled by
entangle in the polarization States okay
remember ABB 84 forget the polarization
states Alice had to like really decide
what polarization state she had to incur
in a photon but in this case it comes
out straight from the physics so what
you do is that you take some kind of
nonlinear optical crystal like Bibi Bibi
oh okay nonlinear optical crystals are
the sort of things which is quite common
in nonlinear physics or laser physics
where you try and do you know you try
and change the frequency of light some
of you might be familiar with things
like second harmonic generation okay so
what happens that you don't do a second
harmonic generation here you do
something called spontaneous parametric
down conversion which is the reverse so
what happens is that you take a pump
beam okay which is well polarized you
pump a nonlinear crystal and all the
millions and millions of pump photons
that you have sometimes one of them will
decay into two photons now these two
photons are highly correlated okay not
only in time okay but also that obey
momentum and energy conservation now
what happens is that in this particular
case one of the photons is always
horizontally polarizing they call that
the signal and one of them is always
vertically polarized so you can call the
idler okay so for example the photon
which is coming out in this direction
okay
is if twin photon is the one which is
where the top okay right about the pump
now those two photons are not in any
kind of entangled state you can describe
them by a separable state okay so if you
don't have a well-defined state you just
look at this photon here it is always in
the horizontal polarization you look at
this twin is always in the vertical
polarization now the nice thing about
the system is that there is a point
where this photons overlap okay there's
two emission rings they overlap such
that you look at the photons coming out
in this direction you know that the twin
comes over here by you want to measure
the polarization state of the photon in
this direction you'll find that it is in
a completely mixed state is neither
horizontal nor vertical okay you only
get information on whether it was
horizontal vertical if you condition the
measurement on this on this twin photon
so this is how we create this entangled
state of photons here okay so basically
this is the equation where we try and
express it you can see that it's
actually this is what we call maximally
entangled State okay so it's if this is
photon 1 this is Photon - okay so the
photon white horizontal photon - is
always vertical and vice versa okay this
is the hv basis the nice thing about
this system is that is also entangled in
the past - 45 states so they've won four
times in the plus 45 there are the ones
in the - 45 ok so this is actually very
nice because what I wanna say is that L
is no longer has to actively encode a
choice of polarization States just by
collecting the photons coming or the
crystal is already random she can
there's no way to say that the photons
coming out here are always in this in a
fix
polarization state it's already when
okay so in that in that sense
you make use of the physical properties
of a system to encode your Random
randomness okay so how do we do in
practice this is one of gadgets that we
have in the lab okay we Twain make it
small small enough such that we can
carry it outside and do fill experiments
okay just some numbers is that we use a
40 milli watt laser diode and we can get
about 24,000 of this entangle pace a
second okay closer look at the system is
what we do is we have our blue laser
diode on the lower deck we ship the beam
and we send up to the upper deck on the
upper deck the nonlinear crystals in is
held in - holders so when the blue
photon the plum beam falls on the
crystal your entangled pairs come more
in the direction which is shown by the
red lines and then we collect them into
single mode optical fibers and then
after that processing of the
polarization states of the photons is
quite easy okay so how do you do qkd
photon pairs so imagine you have photon
paste a source of photon placed in the
center okay one of them is sent to Alice
and one of them sent to Bob okay and
then again you just do passive choice of
measurement basis so Alice can choose to
measure in plus minus 45 or HDV same for
Bob and then they continue what happened
in VB 84 the public discussion of
whether they chose the same basis and
then you do our correction and privacy
amplification yes
yes that's what it is okay you end the
measure in the plus minus 45 so what you
do is you do a rotation on the
polarization state such a plus minus 45
actually because PPS is only the
horizontal and vertical so okay
basically there was the idea of how we
did now one of the problems of this
method is that we don't have any timing
information in BB 84 at least no she
encodes the polarization States actively
and so she knows when she's sending
photons so she has timing information
and she can send this information over
to Bob and say look for photons at this
time at this time at this time now in
the process that I just described photon
pairs are born randomly okay they are
born at the same time within a hundred
five milliseconds of each other okay but
the bond randomly so how what happens is
that there's a bit difficult is a bit
tricky because Bob doesn't know when to
expect photons so he's single photon
detector just go click click click click
and by here it doesn't know when to look
for coincidence okay so you can imagine
that how should I say you can imagine
that at the beginning the photons the
photon prints are all you know aligned
with each other but after transmitting
like over tens of kilometers one of them
is delayed by a lot okay
so what you have to do is you have to do
time stamping on your photons so
analysis site she x times the photons
and Bob also puts a time stamp on his
photon and then they have to actually
compare this classical information this
timing information to grind get
coincidence so that's what we mean by
coincidence identification so this is
just
a diagram of how we do it we have a
times time you need off about accuracy
125 Pico seconds and we need a reference
clock okay to make sure that both Alice
and Bob actually start out at the same
time now these reference clocks are
atomic clocks okay but it turns out that
using these atomic clocks we only need
for like the first 5 to 15 seconds
because once the the software has found
the initial coincidence you can do
software tracking quite well yes so we
don't really need the atomic clocks for
much more that we just need for the
initialization stage well this is just a
basic diagram of the software that is
used on both sides okay now the reason
why I'm bringing this up is that this is
only software we use for our quantum key
distribution it's now open source it's
up on our website so if anybody wants to
see more detail how the coincidence
detection is done
they're welcome to have a look at it ok
bye I won't spend too much time on this
slide unless they're the specific
questions ok so this was just talking
about how to find the coincidence
between the photons which have been
delayed by each other ok ok so this is
just a little bit about how the average
detect ever collection interaction is
done so what happens is that you know in
in practice you know you send a single
photons to light sometimes there's noise
or the polarization states change
especially because you know we collect
them in a single mode fibers and single
mode fibers are actually they're like
optical elements which you rotate your
polarization States ok so the thing is
you can't actually distinguish between
an innocent ever caused by no your
single mode fibers
the polarization state from
eavesdropping attempts so you have to
treat all these errors as a presence of
an eavesdropper so what you do is you
try and correct for the errors by you
know discussing the parrot you divide
the keys that you have into blocks and
then you discuss the parity or the
blocks okay now this is just to show you
that based on the section of LSU you
measure out in your in your key you can
actually find and estimate the knowledge
of an eavesdropper okay so how we think
we notice using this I be
for example that's just a mutual
information within a LS and bebop and is
the mutual information between if and
Alice okay and by looking at the error
fraction okay you can actually work out
the maximum theoretical mutual
information that the eavesdropper we
have with Alice and Bob okay and from
there you can decide how much privacy
amplification you you would like to
perform so Polly simplification in case
you don't know why this very simply is
just that you know after our collection
all that you have a string of random
numbers we shooting sting random bits
which we think can be used as a key but
from your you know your error correction
part you found out that the certain
fraction of errors so you suspect that
Eve may know a few other bits now you
don't have to know which exact bits that
she has information on you just have to
know the fraction and what you do is you
multiply it with a random matrix and
then you get a final secure key now this
random matrix can be public knowledge
the eavesdropper may know a structure
but what you do is you're mixing what if
doesn't know okay we what she knows so
in the end in the final key she still
has to guess like whether that bit was a
0 or 1
in that way you're trying to compress
and remove all the mutual information
that you will have okay so the thing is
this looks easy in practice but one of
the problems I would say with coven qkd
system is that privacy amplification in
this way has always been analyzed
theoretically in an asymptotic limit
they assume that you're in finite set of
row bits but you know in practice you
don't so the question is still open I
think on what happens if you only have a
finite set of all keys and you know a
certain fraction is known to Eve and
when you do this style privacy
amplification is it secure so what is
the minimum length of the key that you
will need ok so there's an open question
I think so this is just a schematic of
our system setup ok so this was the
source of entangled photon pairs that we
have we collected in the single mode
fibers we do measurement outcomes ok and
this is analysis sight she does the time
stamping and then she does
classical communication with Bob and
it's a classical channel which we have
up of 1.5 kilometers so this was our
test range on campus on this side is the
transmitter which is on the roof of the
administration building and on the other
side is my supervisors house you can see
the swimming pool over there
ok so we make sure send single photons
entangled single photons across 1.5
kilometers and any name we get a secure
key out of it I'll show you the results
in a minute there's a short brief photo
of our kind of setup our single photon
detectors are in small modules you can
hold in your hand ok they're in here
there are this the actual place inside
this aluminum blocks cave and why we put
them in aluminum blocks is that we want
to cool them down for single photon
detectors can be quite
noisy so you have to suppressor the duck
counts and you can you can you just may
be able to make out there's still
beamsplitters here beam splitters I was
talking about our single photon
receiving and transmission devices does
these telescopes okay so just just
simple optical telescopes and what I'm
showing you here is a diagram okay of
the cross-section or the light coming
out a telescope so you can see that it's
about seventy six millimeters in
diameter so the single photons that we
are sending right then there might be
single quantum states but they're
actually not very small okay you can
think of them is flying pieces of of
people flying through the air okay so
they have a sunny six millimeter
diameter so this is the first graph on
experimental results just to measure of
all coincidences first okay we are any
security we get about 2500 per second
okay this is just a background count
which we call accidental coincidences it
goes click click click you think you
have a coincidence but these are things
which come from stray light the noise in
your detectors and all that okay to
suppress all these accidentals we
actually use interference filters so
this is a result of like the secure key
after you know full error correction and
privacy amplification you get about 800
bits a second okay so just some details
like for example of the error correction
code something called cascade is the one
in the cascade algorithm
okay so why we think this is nice it's
just that you know a lot of the
complexity in the system is not much
more difficult than what you'll find
inside a CD player there's a lot of is
based on solid state light sources okay
another nice thing again to emphasize
that you know you don't need random
numbers in this particular case okay is
Lin sifting mud and the guy who did the
programming for this was very proud of
it because you know all the classical
communication forever collection and
time I mean coincidence
you only need to exchange about 15 or 20
bits per detection event it's compact
okay it's free space you don't have to
go to a fibers in our case sometimes you
can implement it two optical fibers well
in our case is compact and you can
install it in at hoc situations for
example we ship the kid to the Chaos
Computer Congress in Germany three weeks
ago and it was very nice but it worked
straight out of the box so you can ship
it around and exchange a key over
arbitrary distances and arbitrary
locations yeah and it went reliably
hands-off it for this is key
continuously one of the things I should
say let's go back to the last graph is
that you'll be wondering what are all
these little dips here this is because
in Singapore we get really heavy
rainfall okay and so sometimes when
there's heavy rainfall you can see the
other side so you can send photons
across so the key we just dropped by
recovers after a while now that is
you'll see that from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m.
things start to go bad simply because
right now we're only operating at night
we can operate during the day because
our entangled photon pairs have to wider
bandwidth so we need we can use to
narrow interference filters maybe just
after you live with that for now
so no other nice things to do is whether
we can build entangled pairs you will
never bandwidth then we can work
throughout the day as well so now the
thing is entangled pairs or qkd
is it really secure well
we're pretty sure that there's no
spectral fingerprint in the photon pace
okay because if they are then the
quality of the entanglement goes down
and you can't really exchange a key now
we don't need any untrusted random
number sources but the problem is that
of course you know they are always
software bugs around in our software one
of the things that to notice that
there's a lot of timing information is
exchanged you know to get coincidences
so I there's a good chance that you can
be able to you know tell or derive some
information and the key that you're
sending but you're invited to look at
our software fine holes if you want it's
on this website over here okay well I
guess that's all I want to say today and
thank you for your attention
okay we do our software stuff all in
their laptops so the empty piece of it
just to make sure that the laptops start
up at least with roughly the same time
okay the actual time stamping is done in
a separate electronic unit and the time
initialization day is done using atomic
clocks so the NTP server is actually
right now just to get the the laptops
that were using to have roughly at the
same time then they can start processing
it now one thing I want to say is that
we really would like to get rid of the
atomic clocks because I mentioned that
is only used for the five first five to
ten seconds and so atomic clocks
actually expensive devices and you don't
you want to try and get rid of them you
can so I don't know I think the
challenge is is how I know it's open to
everybody I guess you can look at a code
you can find a way to get you know
really precise timing information from
the coincidences you find a way to do it
my supervisor says you can have the
atomic drop that is a good question has
come up before the thing is are qkd
people who are interested in qkd are
typically very paranoid and they don't
to rely on an external timing device I'm
not so sure whether that's such a valid
argument because now you can think that
you initialize your clocks is in GPS and
then you discard the keys that you get
there from there but you you already you
know establish sync synchronous you'll
be synchronous and then you can start
finding a key so yeah
GPS is wanting to try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
