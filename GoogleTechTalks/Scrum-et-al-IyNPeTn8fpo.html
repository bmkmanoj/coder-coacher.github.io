know ken actually invented the scrum
mythology and some of the google groups
have actually started using scrum
internally and it'd be very they've got
very good results of scrum and so I
thought of inviting Ken over here and
telling in person everyone what scrum is
this talk is rocky by the alias Brooklyn
who actually put posters all around
campus enticing this talk and right
after this chop their special sessions
with Ken and the a gel group is posting
that on 4:00 p.m. so if anyone wants to
actually join into the Q&amp;amp;A session with
Ken later talk to Mark Shriver and he
will tell you which oh wait is it do you
know what commit is what think it's
alpha we around where we have our scrum
meetings with our area in Billings 45 or
46 somewhat accepting filled in 46 fine
check back with more market adjusted in
a Q&amp;amp;A session with that one more
announcement is that this talk is being
recorded and it will be made publicly
available on Google Video
so if you have any questions of
confidential nature then please hold on
till after the top there yeah so is
everybody okay with that great but
that's it I'll pass on to
you don't know if you want to do that
you are very polite of you though you
all know that scrum is not an acronym
it's it's an event in the game of rugby
where like-minded people get together
and politely discuss ownership of a ball
I did not invent scrum that's there
would be arrogant beyond belief so scrum
is is probably a collection of best
ideas of what a number of people in our
profession have come up with over the
years the urgency of it and agile and
extreme programming came with the
ascendancy of methodologies and process
gurus and project management
organizations and waterfall and so it's
more of a collection of those ideas in
reaction to that there were two Japanese
gentlemen nanaka and Takeuchi who
published an article the new new public
new new product development team in the
Harvard Business Review in 86 and later
book called the knowledge creating
company in 1988 and in it they described
an approach that embodies a lot of the
ideas in scrum they had studied
companies that were in tight competitive
situations that is they were losing
money and in certain products and this
included included Fujifilm Toyota 3m and
Xerox
and all these companies that they had
studied he had come up with competitive
responses to the encroachment of their
market share using a very similar
approach all of these companies tried to
look and see what the competition was
what the threat was as clearly as
possible
and then they pulled together a team of
their very best people and it wasn't
just you know the engineers or just
wasn't marketing people instead it was
across
functional P team and they wanted this
team to come up with a competitive
response for their company and the
reason they chose a cross-functional
team people who knew their company from
all different angles is they didn't want
to come up with a great financial
solution that was absolutely useless
from a support point of view they didn't
want to come up with a great engineering
solution that couldn't be
quint wasn't of any value in the
marketplace so they wanted something
that was a value overall within the
company so they got someone from finance
and they got someone from marketing
someone from sales someone from support
yes even someone from support who li
guessed that some of the engineering
research and development inventory
management and they got them together
and said as you guys know by the way
guys is appropriate in here but it's not
meant to be pejorative okay guys we have
a horrible situation and we are counting
on you to save our bacon we're counting
on you to rescue our company from the
corner that we're backed into so we want
you to come up with a competitive
response to what that other company is
doing by the way you don't have forever
we're in a bit of a financial crunch
here so you have three months and and so
what we'd like you to do is is go to
this facility we've rented for you
across town and we want you to come up
with the response that we are going to
introduce the marketplace to regain our
market share oh by the way in three
months we don't want from you a position
paper we don't want the PowerPoint
presentation we don't want a discussion
we want the product ready we want it
ready to be shipped you know we're not
going to review what you've done you're
our best people why would we have to
approve or disapprove so simply and do
it by the way during the three months
that you're in this facility across town
we're not going to bother you because
it's amazing you're actually working on
something that is of great importance to
the company so we're not going to
interrupt you however if you're doing
anything at all that needs external help
these resources that you don't
the support that you can't get again
since you're working on something that's
really critical to the company come to
us and ask for it and then they took
them outside to a bus that took them
across town and at first the people on
the team is like eight or nine people
were like concerned maybe this was a new
form of layoffs that they had made aware
of and then he settled back and they
were you know pretty happy to be with
each other and you know how's your wife
and my kids are in school and you know
they're talking about that and also one
of them's like hey guys you know we have
two months and 27 days left now if we
don't come up with something really good
one we're going to be letting our
company down because we were sent here
to to regain market share the second
thing is we are going to be utterly
humiliated in two months 27 days we stay
and say well we couldn't think of
anything you know that's kind of a bad
situation being now of these situations
that were studied not one of those teams
failed to come up with something that he
had a significant impact on the
marketplace some of them were you know
stellar some of them were okay but none
of them were situations where they were
like well you know we didn't know the
month couldn't quite get it done you
know they all came up with something
that was a competitive response all of
the aspects that are in scrum the key
ones are in there they were in a kind
box everything in scrum is a time box
and that's so things don't go on forever
well you know we could think of the
design but we need another you know a
while more come back so everything is a
time box everything is done with
cross-functional teams that are
responsible for managing themselves kind
of interesting concept it it's borrowed
from Lean Thinking and just from
observing people that the people who can
best figure out how to do the work are
the people who are doing the work
themselves
it's done with a constrained size of a
team so you don't get more than eight or
nine people matter of fact as small or
if you have three or four people that's
really neat but you still need the cross
functionality it's a team that has to
have something that is done at the end
of the time box there is no such time
box as one that comes up with something
that has something which is an
abstraction that's only known to the
people who built it like an object model
or sequence diagram that's not done
that's an internal artifact that's
working process so in scrum at the end
of every time box you have to have the
team have something that's done and can
potentially be shipped so you see all
the aspects of scrum there Jeff
Sutherland and myself who pulled scrum
together from a lot of these ideas both
of us were managing software companies
this was in 1991 before some of you were
born and and we had read about scrum and
we both had products where the customers
wanted large numbers of changes we had a
large code base that we had to maintain
sustain and we had a lot of competition
you know affecting us the only reason we
were able to come up with scrum with
that fit all these characteristics
though was we are both developing
software using small talk and small talk
was the first I think list might be the
other one their first integrated
development environment where you could
rapidly build and deploy and even test
this test product so that was the
instantiation of scrum and Jeff and I
used it ourselves and and we used it
with some of our customers later it
by-and-large
went nowhere we used it competitively to
help a number of companies but it wasn't
until you start seeing a number of other
good IDE s so think of Eclipse and
things like that now that you start
seeing yet pickup in the marketplace
so it's an idea that if we didn't have
the technology would have gone nowhere
now at the same time that we're building
scrum which is a management process for
managing product development Kent Beck
Ron Jeffries Ward Cunningham were
engineers in a small talk environment
and they came up with extreme
programming which are a set of
engineering practices that work in that
same type of environment so we use scrum
to manage product development and
extreme programming practices are often
used and extend extensions of them to
help the engineers build and come up
with engineering disciplines that fit to
support and work with a scrum type of
environment so to our hand-in-glove
mutually compatible things like that
scrum isn't a methodology if you have a
methodology and you've got a problem a
question of how to do something you know
you can go to the methodology you can
turn to whatever page like page seventy
seven point six and there's the answer
on how to do it pretty good
scrum is is much more like a small baby
process or like a framework it's really
really simple so think of the game of
chess it's simple it doesn't have a lot
of rules I mean you know they've got a
night two one one two can't land on a
player of its own color there's not a
lot more to it and a bunch of rules like
that and yet you can find incredibly
detailed complex strategies and tactics
about how to build how about how to play
chess because every situation gives a
rise to different types of circumstances
and different types of thinking people
can study it people can think about it
but how they execute it how they play it
is up to their own intelligence skillset
whether they've been drinking you know
all those types of character
sticks and scrum is very much the same
way it is so trivial I sometimes wonder
what the big deal is except that it
frees us from the belief that someone
else can tell us what to do in every
circumstance and that it'll work scrums
assumption is that you are intelligent
or at least as intelligent as you'll
ever be and that you will use that
intelligence and your experience to come
up with the best solution for whatever
circumstance you're in right then
when we first came up with announced
agile 2001 there were there were a
number of comments that agile was really
really good this was from berry beam and
people like that who were kind of little
troubled by agile and they said really
really good if you have a team of
outstanding engineers that are using
excellent engineering tools have
engineering practices down pat
understand the business don't mean the
technology domain inside out in our to
interupted have all the resources they
need then you can use scrum well it's
true that people like that can build an
increment of software every iteration
that's good however scrum works with
idiots you can take a group of idiots
that maybe even didn't go to school
don't understand computer science to
understand software engineering
techniques hate each other don't
understand the business domain have
lousy engineering tools and uniformly
they will produce crap every increment
this is good you want to know at the end
of every iteration where you are and
part of the point of scrum and this has
nothing to sarbanes-oxley and all the
rest of that that came afterwards it
borrowed this from scrum is transparency
so that everyone knows where you are all
the time so one of the intentions of you
know like these those people we sent
off-site for three months to build
something is we want to know where we
were at the end of that time box so at
the end of every scrum sprint which is
its iterations name we want to know
exactly where we are so we ask the team
to have something done in the sense that
it could be sent out to the marketplace
really done and to the extent that those
are good engineers with good engineering
skills and so that all the rest of that
tell us something pretty good done to
the extent that they have trouble tying
their shoes they're not going to have
much done at all and you know that right
up front so I'm at a I get asked really
interesting questions like what do you
do for a living I'm in a bank and
they're replacing the trust system big
system right and they're going to put in
a new trust system that they bought and
they're going to use a new set of
software to build user interface to it
and it has 28 feeds to existing legacy
systems of course none of which you have
testing harnesses around them so if you
modify any the data or you get
referential data problems you don't know
it until a customer complains that
they've lost their account so they want
to ask how scrum would fit in with this
and what their very last question this
was an hour right I love these
conversations it's in an hour and their
last question is should we use scrum
this is a 30 million dollar of team a
17-month project and I advise them
absolutely definitely not to use scrum
and of course that's not what you're
supposed to say you're supposed to sell
it you know all that that sort of stuff
is well why is it inappropriate I said
this project this doesn't stand a
snowball's chance in hell this is this
is the thing that kills careers turns
people into into alcoholics hair people
fleeing down the street gets women are
leaving our profession elaborate if you
use the other version of waterfall if
you use that by the 13th 14th month
you'll get a good sense of how bad this
project is going and you're going to be
able to then start laying and place all
the plausible deniability you know new
career path other people to blame other
than yourselves and that will give you
time to do it I said if you use scrum
you're going to know what sort of deep
trouble you're in right after one month
and there's nowhere to go because
Aaron's been saying you convinced us to
do this project and this is all you can
build in a month let's see one 17th of
the total budget we gave you we should
have had more than this and so you know
it's going to be very transparent that
the project is a non-starter and that's
the sort of thing that the transparency
that scrum makes open let me draw a
picture of scrum it's it's real complex
there's a list of work to be done and
this list is prioritized just like you
know our to-do list around the house
over the weekend so it's prioritized to
the stuff that's a most important or
maybe the stuff of highest value or
maybe the stuff that's have the greatest
risk that we want to make sure we can
get out of the way first
is at the top of the list the stuff that
is probably not very important or we
actually don't care if we don't get to
destroy the bottom of this but we have
it there to prove to our family that we
actually were listening to them and we
heard
okay this list is used as fodder as
inventory for starting iterations every
iteration or sprint a team
cross-functional team of people with all
the skills needed to build something
that's done for that product set get
together with the person who is
representing the customer and they say
so what's the highest priority stuff you
have next and the person goes it's this
stuff they say okay so we think we can
do about this much of it over the next
iteration or sprint now normal sprint I
like is about 30 days with a good solid
team if I'm get worried that the team is
having trouble I'm shorten it to two
weeks so they can't go too tight too far
out of balance but it's always the same
length so the team says well you you
said you'd like to have this much done
we this is all we think we can do over
the next sprint do being the operative
word there do means change it from a
requirement of what's needed in a
product to something that's done and is
ready to be used in that product QA
documentation refactored meets standards
all of those good engineering practices
then the team goes off and they have
this whole period with minimal
interruptions moment you start
interrupting them they start you know
it's like letting air out of a balloon
you all know this so they have this
period to create it and at the end of
the period they show the customers what
they did and again the word done is
critical there because they can't show
them something oh we got a lot of it
done but we weren't able to test it
that's not done all we got a lot of it
done but there's no documentation that's
not done oh we got a lot of it done but
it doesn't meet the standards because we
didn't have time that's not done so it
places a lot of pressure on them to
exercise their profession competently
if it's not done customer doesn't take
it so the customer looks and sees what
they've done and based on what they've
done
then we prioritizes this list so that it
now reflects what are the next highest
priority things to do meets again with
the team and says ok so this is now the
highest priority things view and the
team then selects what to do next and
goes off and builds it for the next 30
days so if I were setting a goal like to
ruin our pie competitions day and I
started here the way I might go with
this list is like this honing in on it
as the competition does different things
as I find different technologies does
different things they find different
opportunities so month by month I'm
going to hone in on my target and that's
all there is to scrum and a few rules
like one of the rules is that and this
is called an inspector adapt loop it's
called a feedback loop it's a way of
dealing with complexity frequent changes
in environments inspect what the team
has been able to do and adapt one of the
adaptations for instance out that bank
might be you guys are fired another
adaptation might be you guys are
wonderful where can I find more of you
another might be based on what you did I
seen opportunities to do this in this
this next so it's where you get
collaboration between marketing and
customers and prospects and engineers on
what is the most valuable thing they can
do next but you need to actually have
something that's done to have them one
of the things we don't allow in this is
review our powerpoints of what it might
look like if it were done we don't allow
prototypes of what it might be if it
were done instead we want to know where
we really are transparency
the other type of meeting that happens
in this is every day we ask the team to
get together and make transparent to
each other where they are
hi I'm I said I'd do these things during
the sprint during the iteration this is
what I did do and this is what I didn't
do
hi this is what I did this is what I
didn't do this is what I'm going to do
next so it's a synchronization of the
engineers the developers on the team on
a daily basis and that's again
transparency I remember I was in one of
those meetings and this work done again
wants meeting because if you say in the
meeting well I did this yesterday and
I'm going to do this today there should
be some meaning to that so I'm in a
meeting with a bunch of engineers and
one person says well I did this
yesterday and I'm going to do this today
and sarcasm is a great leveler and I
listen what you want to QA people's at
that chance said what do you say so I
said that chance so what I mean fail
chance you our definition of done is
that it is coded to standards it's been
reviewed it's been documented through
have documentation in it it has a unit
test built to it and it's been checked
in and successfully built he has not
checked in his code whoa you see a
little conflict in the team you know
like he's going about /or Tigers for
that sort of thing and I'm like so so
why why have you checked your stuff in
Soho well said I normally do you know
but we're in a 30-day sprint and and I'm
in an area of the code that everyone's
working on and and you know if I had a
check in it every day I'd have to be
reconciling my changes to everyone
else's changes on a daily basis so I'm
going to wait till a 22nd 23rd day then
I'll check it all in and the rest of
team's like
so so scrum has a lot of good neat
things like good news everyday good news
at the end of every iteration at the end
of every sprint but it's also got some
really rotten things like on a daily
basis finding out that the person you
were counting on didn't get done the
work that they were expected to do like
finding out that they have no intention
because they think that person is a rat
you know personal conflict you get that
you exposed every day at the end of
every sprint finding out that the team
is not progressing as marketing had
hoped so how many of you are familiar
with scrum okay so you know what a
burned-down
is standard way of tracking progress if
I take this list of work that a
customers wants in a release in
something we're going to put out and I
put it on a horizontal axis and estimate
it for the amount of work it represents
and I take the team's ability to
transform it into something that's
shippable across every sprint and I
track this month by month by month by
month by month that gives me a burn gap
and if I take the trend length of that
burn down I can pre effectively predict
as the trend line starts settling in
when that will be ready that's good
that's also potentially terrible
traditionally a project starts and you
don't know where it is till close to the
end here after one month two months
three months you know where the project
is going where the release is heading if
it's heading this way
there's a problem there's a big problem
at tum your neighbor down the road Yahoo
you're friendly they work gotta think
these grump
they have one person on each release
that's responsible for making
intelligent decisions about how to
invest money for every release and this
person is responsible for at the end of
every sprint looking at where they are
compared to where they want to be and
making decisions this person is called
the single ring a bull neck right so in
some releases you know it doesn't go
quite the way it expected in servants
like disheartened and upset if a release
doesn't go the way you anticipate that
it's going to happen with the
functionalities of highest value by a
date when everyone knows it will be
ready that's the person you come to
that's the person who at the end of the
second sprint sure said oh geez we're
not going to be ready on the date that
we expect and because of the outward net
to invest more money in this release
than we anticipated because of that the
return on investments can be lower than
we anticipate because of that someone
else is going to get some new
functionality out before us oh my god
what do we do
and for rate making that visible one of
the really great things about scrum as
it gets all of the news visible whether
it's in good or bad it doesn't consider
that there's good or bad news it just
considers that there's news and that
intelligent people will want that news
so they can do the most beneficial thing
for the entire organization now that's a
test of the character of an organization
of the organizations that are tempting
to implement scrum probably 30 35
percent will successfully implement
and that's because of this core problem
most organizations don't want to be
faced with something that they don't
want to see and this puts it up there
and says are you going to do something
about it or not
how coming if you like working for
google
how many of you view it as a special
place
it's good it's very good
if you are in the bathroom can you see
this so if you are on a velocity that's
going to give you a date of this and
your marketing department your product
management department has told the world
that it's going to be released on that
date that's awkward news now
traditionally what happens when that
news is faced is marketing product
management asks you to increase your
velocity right the assumption being that
you normally sit at a very comfortable
table with your feet up drinking beer
bullshitting with the guys and all they
have to do is say work a little harder
you take your feet down you start
working this is reasonable right normal
thing and the reason they know that's
true is all they have to do is ask you
to do it and by god your velocity does
increase and and kind of if you give any
of that whiny crap about you know you're
doing it as best you can and this is
going to undercut quality and stuff like
that all they have to do is they
actually go to your boss or your boss's
boss and say you're not on board you're
not really part of the plan and you're
not part of the program and you're not
all these things and and then you know
gos even worthwhile you saying it
because now suddenly you're visible as a
bearer of bad news wasn't on board but
you still have to do it right there's no
way out
we have time-honored traditions in our
profession for increasing our velocity
under pressure one of them is we drop
quality we do that by not following
standards we can stop documenting codes
we can when we have more stuff to apply
to an area we cannot refactor it and
correctly design the way it should
instead just plastered on top of it
knowing that it's not the right thing
but somehow we'll get back to it so we
have all those techniques we can also
not build unit tests we cannot put all
the automated tests in for acceptance
tests that's all okay we can work long
hours that's okay it's like about every
game company in the world now uses scrum
and one of the reasons was high Moon
Studios came out with a killer release
using scrum that they got out before
time with much better quality than
expected
they are owned they were owned by Sammy
Sega Japanese company and the CTO King
bags that were in use scrum this is the
right thing part of it a sustainable
pace you know you send these people
off-site for three months to work on a
problem and they work on the problem
like eight or nine hours a day you know
thinking about when they get in their
car their motorcycle their bike whatever
to go home the problem is still rolling
around their head when they're
scratching their key out stomach playing
with their dog whatever the problem
still going on when they're sleeping the
problems still going on so if I work
them 12 14 hours a day that problem gets
worked less effectively to design the
way the implemented gets less good the
way they write the code becomes less
effective so they're writing eight or
nine hours a day sustainable pace and
the Japanese management says in parallel
in Japan they worked in long hours it's
a mark of being part of the organization
said you have to work 12 14 hour days
otherwise you're not really buying in
say one up to 12 14 hours hour days and
they found that the defects increased
60% and the cost of correcting those
defects more than offset the additional
functionality that they were building
they drop that down to eight or nine
hours
Sammy Sega management drove by at night
and they're looking at the buildings the
buildings are dark
and the parking lots are empty these
people these people are not good people
so they sold the company to management a
management bio because it culturally
couldn't stand them two months later
management released the product sold it
to produce over twice the cost of the
bio which of course caused a huge spread
of information throughout the game
industry and every now adopted scrum the
idea is that one of the ways to increase
velocity is not by working longer hours
all that does is create produce more
crap
but that's one of our time-honored
traditions so we use all those
approaches and we produce more crap good
ok this this is some interesting but so
what right that's our profession that's
our faith in life unfortunately as I've
been helping organizations implement
scrum I've ranted to run into a very
common problem with every organization
now the reason I mention this to you is
so that you can think about it of course
that is not happening here ok
and you should be listen to this problem
to make sure it doesn't happen here what
these organizations have is a problem is
something called core or infrastructure
software and in this burndown chart they
can build new functionality on the fly
they are really good developers that's
the burned up unfortunately all this new
functionality has to link into this
infrastructure of software to really
make effect you know so the
infrastructure is the core processing
where everything really happens the
problem if God is the velocity of the
core software is up like this
so if you want to if it takes you to
build one piece of new functionality it
takes one of these it's going to take
you 20 times longer than than you
thought because your throughput is
throttled by that core functionality and
this is bad news so I looked into where
core functionality came from because
most organizations seem to have
including many of your competitors and
it all seemed to have three
characteristics the first was that it
was fragile if I changed one thing in
that core piece of functionality it
tended to break other things pretty bad
the second characteristic of the core
software the infrastructure software was
it didn't have good test harnesses
around a good automated test harnesses
around it so that if you went in and you
broke something you tended not to know
about it until it was up on all the
servers and then your customers would
let you know about it that's not good
the third thing that was characteristic
is there were only a few suckers left in
the entire company who still knew how to
and were willing to work on the
infrastructure everyone else had fled to
newer stuff that was easier to use and
easier to build and that all those
reasons reasons why the core
functionality has a much much lower
velocity
I remember one one company that's a
competitor of yours has about 120
engineers developers of all kinds of
whom 10 are still able to work on the
core functionality the other 110 are
working on new stuff ok so you can
imagine the problem with that if this is
the burndown for the new stuff but this
is the throttle on it how do they get
the new stuff out because it's really
constrained by the core functionality
and we're having a hard time with them
understanding that until we just started
one sprint and sprint planning meeting
we brought all the engineers into the
room we said okay so of the stuff you
want to do during the next month what's
the highest priority second highest
priority third highest priority fourth
we just listed eight or nine items that
were in priority order we said okay the
product manager for the first area and
the lead engineer for the first area
come on up here now select the people
you need to do this work over the next
month including of course the core
engineers and they did we said okay now
leave get out of here start working we
did that with the second team the third
team the fourth team we got to the fifth
product manager in the lead engineer he
said we can't do anything there's no
core engineers the DBA people the people
would change the user interface part
that we need to make these arguments so
we can't do anything okay so we looked
around the room and there were 60
engineers left
they were thoroughly constrained by the
core piece of functionality so I've
looked at this problem we come up with
engineering workarounds if you have
enough money you rebuild your core if
you don't have enough money in your
competition's breathing down your neck
you shift into another market or you
sell your company venture capitalists
are into this now buying dead companies
called design dead software but I was
always troubled on where did this core
software come from I mean did they buy
it you did someone you know pull
hoodwink them pull the wool over their
eyes how come they bought this core
software you know that was a dumbest
thing I could ever seen and then I
started thinking about about it and
checking this out at a couple of
companies and what I saw was here is
let's say one of your products certainly
not here and you've got a velocity of 20
but your product people your marketing
people need some more functionality they
just need it okay they've got to have it
and so that's going to require because
that's more stuff that's going to
require that you have a velocity of 22
to do it well geez everyone what do you
get how are you going to get a velocity
of 22 or you can be smarter when you
wake up that's probably not going to are
you going to put in new engineering
tools or your work with no none of that
will work so what you actually do to get
the increased velocity is of course cut
quality because if you remove quality
you can do more crap right so you get a
velocity of that now if you do this and
then that release goes out on time some
grumbles from the customers you know
whatever but customers always grumble
and the product manager is promoted
becomes you know drives a new BMW parks
and wear the fancy spots and all those
things happen so what happens is
released by release
so what happens thinking of really a
velocity of 22 the next release that you
start because you're working from a
slightly worse codebase with clever
tricks in it unruhe factory code no
tests the best philosophy you can really
do is 18 well that's no good and no
one's going to get promoted on that so
the product management people come down
to you and say guys you just got to do
it
so you cut quality again but this time
when you cut quality the best you can do
is 20 because you're starting from a
worse codebase now takes about five
years released by release for you right
here to build your own design ded
product you don't have to buy it you can
build it yourself and don't forget as
you do it and put yourself into a
competitive corner this is in a book
called the innovators dilemma to leave
behind someone else who has to fix that
because it's horrible and I'm not sure
about your codebase but this is a real
problem in our profession and it's the
core of our difficulty in implementing
scrum it's got two aspects to it one is
when we are told to do more we cut
quality without telling a soul it's just
second nature I have trained over 5,500
people and put them through an exercise
like this more very subtle very sneaky
where push comes to shove they have a
choice of saying well we can't do it or
saying we'll do it in cutting quality
only 120 of the 5500 have said no all of
the others have just cut quality
automatically it is in our bones
muscle-memory the other part of this
habit is the product management then
believing in magic that all they have to
do is tell us to do something and this
is you know what the illusion we support
by cutting quality it'll get done and
these are good what's called good
short-term tactics these are horrible
long-term strategies because it's back
to your company into a corner strategy
now I'm not sure if this is true of your
product management they produce MRDs and
PR DS things like that it turns out that
they're real option isn't necessarily
pressuring you to do more with less
quality but instead to change what they
actually put in the release
remember we said they have a product
backlog that's prioritized they can only
put in the stuff that's of real high
value and then stop putting stuff into
the release and ship it one of the
industry statistics is that over 65% of
all functionality that is delivered and
then has to be maintained and sustained
is rarely or never used so this pushes
it won't you say no to dropping quality
it then puts the onus on product
management to then think about given the
velocity given the time given the
marketplace what can I do that optimizes
our marketplace impact within that
rather than just coming up with a
laundry list
these are big changes and it all comes
out of doing stuff iteratively
incrementally self-managing team with
transparency you will have if you use
scrum someone on each team whose name is
cut it's called the scrum master also
known as the prick and this person's job
is to make sure that you don't cut
quality darn and they have no authority
but they what they can do is if we've
defined that an increment he has a
certain level of quality for it to be
demonstrated to our product management
their job is to make sure that quality
is there and if the quality isn't not to
let you demonstrate it but instead to
say to the product manager
we lost our heads we're not done it's
going to take us another month to finish
this and let it bubble up that way this
person is probably the least loved
person in the world because they stand
right at the nexus between product
management believing that any amount of
stuff can be done and our willingness to
cut quality to help them support that
belief the burnout rate on these people
is usually like 13 14 months from way
we often get them from hopeless
professional areas like QA people in QA
are used to doing incredible things with
no authority no respect and no hope of
success so that's what we take these
people I could talk forever but I'm
getting a little hot what questions can
I answer for you about scrum about agile
about the way it's going in the
marketplace about its impact on your
career paths about its impact on your
functional areas things like that
and for every play
this guy's needy KLC he said that you
get a PRD and there are often during the
release changes to it how can that be
35% of all requirements changed during
the average project I'll tell you where
this comes from this comes out of
waterfall 25 years of waterfall okay
where you're the marketing department
the product management department the
customer and we're engineering and we're
going to take whatever you tell us to do
and we're going to lay out an
architecture for it an infrastructure
detail design we're going to actually
write code you know all that stuff if
you change your mind and we're down here
it's going to have a huge impact that
the statistic is if you change your mind
in the start of a project it's $1 that
same change 70% of the way through the
project will cost 16 it will cost $100
so we stand you up against the wall and
we gradually lock so tell us everything
you want in this release everything
because it's going to make you really
incredibly pained if you to change your
mind so you go home you know you talk to
your friends you talk to your kid you
think of everything you could possibly
think of and you put it in the PRD it
doesn't matter that it's not very useful
you just know that if you don't put it
it's going to be horribly painful so
we've trained you to spit it all out
thank you
so so one he's giving us tons of stuff
to do that doesn't have much marketplace
value because we told tell us everything
the second thing is we made you fearful
of changing your mind right now if we
let you have instead of a PRD we give
you a list of things that you wanted to
release and we just say just list it you
know like use cases or user stories or
things with some details but
prioritizing prioritize it so the things
that you really want are at the top the
things you could care less about or at
the bottom and this can be as long list
as you want and what we're going to let
you do then is if this is your date
based on our velocity you can choose
what stuff will be in the release since
we're delivering it increment by
increment by increment you can select
and add it up piece by piece by piece so
you get the highest value stuff and you
can change this you can put new things
in remove old things this is at your
shopping list we are just engineers that
will build it so analogy is we're like a
Ferrari you're the driver you can get
enough to drive us over a cliff that
would into a cliff even worse in circles
kind of dumb to a place where everyone
is enjoying where they are and it's a
good thing to do that's a good product
manager so we give them the
responsibility of driving a sprint by
sprint by sprint to something that gives
the highest value if we were able to in
their statistical techniques for doing
this to evaluate this this list of
things that are now in the PRG and we'd
say well this one has a marketplace
impact of 72 million dollars this when
he has a marketplace impact of $1,400
this one is marketing place of $1 as we
start building these and you build a
graph of cumulative value delivered by
the teams
that make sense you'll see a chart like
this where you build infrastructure
architecture up front and then this is
value delivered this is time you start
delivering all the very valuable things
up front and then at some point you
start delivering things which aren't
worth spending the money on and the
thing we train product managers on is
when you get to this point stop they're
used to standing back this says you're
in a car drive it inch by inch by inch
by inch and that's a real change so we
say change your mind
don't buy weight in lean manufacturing
mean thinking inventory is a viability
not an asset so this list of things that
they want us to do if they spend a lot
of time thinking it through the way you
can think it through is called analysis
right and then they document it they
have sunk a huge amount of money into
that PRD and then if we say let's not
build some of it that's waste so we
decompose this list of work to be done
which used to be a PRD top 20% he has a
lot of thought put into it the next 20%
has less thought into it bottom 60% are
one-offs that we don't even think you in
detail until and unless it bubbles up to
be likely to be done thank you yes don't
give any insight into how to actually
kasher and design for the top priorities
for funding that it helps you eyes know
how
I'm feeling
yeah other questions has been about all
agile is where do you do architecture
infrastructure and we drive architecture
and infrastructure with non-functional
requirements so for instance if it just
has to support five million simultaneous
customers in a secure environment that's
a very high Prarie non-functional item
so that will probably be worked on to
some extent in the first sprint in the
second sprint in the third sprint
however there's a rule in scrum which
you hit is which is you have to deliver
a piece of business functionality
something the customers can use every
sprint this means you might deliver a
layer of the architecture and
infrastructure in the first sprint with
one piece driven down into detail
working and demonstrable the reason we
do that is one it may keeps the customer
engaged and secondly it proves that the
architecture infrastructure you're
devising works as a profession we are
able to think with no impact for long
periods of time and this causes us to
bring it to a conclusion every month so
if I'm looking at a chart again
on the amount of time spent in an
architectural intensive piece of work
this is work this is time the amount of
time spent on architecture
infrastructure will go like this amount
of time spent on business functionality
will go like that but every sprint will
deliver a piece of business functionally
demonstrates that architectural
infrastructure working yes all over the
place
some are really good some are some are
great engineers some are good QA people
some are good product management people
it's more a determination that they will
do whatever is needed to help the team
deliver top quality software that meets
the customers needs every sprint and
that anything else is an impediment and
they'll remove it now one of the rules
we have started implementing lately is
it dead scrum master is a useless scrum
master so going up against an
organization for no purpose is useless
and what's kind of facetious but not
really QA is a great source of them
rather location not a lot of location
alcohol of option L so for sound
republication solvation have only live
now it's questions can be how do we
optimize and how to recoat we've worked
with teams that range from Lithuania
through Helsinki all the way into China
one team and it's horrible but the
domain knowledge is necessary so they
work together and they work together I
mean when they are at work they do
tricks like leaving a VoIP enabled
intercom active amongst all the peoples
they can easily talk the clear two key
answers always are they have to be
working in the same development
environment again at the start every
release they have to be brought together
for at least a month to two so they can
talk things through and figure out how
they're going to do it before they parse
back to their homes
otherwise you know it's not worthwhile
pursuing one last question
they're having experience
yeah insert blew up
try it in a project try it with 18 trial
with a release see what works make sure
that you know that the problems that
emerge are usually have nothing to do
with scrum it causes problems that we're
already existing there to become obvious
and the question then is do you want to
fix them or do you want to hobble along
with those problems almost every
organization that has stopped using
scrum it's because it's unearthed either
some cultural problem an unwillingness
for management to stop telling the
engineers how to do their work
unwillingness of developers to work
together cross-functionally it's an
inability of the engineers to actually
pull stuff together every iteration and
unwillingness to improve their
engineering practice is to do so scrum
is like the canary in the coal mine it's
a test of whether it's a competent
engineering organization it may not be
at the start and it will give you all
the things you need to do to get to it
but that work of getting to it is that
organizations that's their work and the
question is whether or software is
important to them and whether they're
competent enough in their profession to
do it it's really hard thank you very
much
