managers or QA managers individual
contributors mixture okay good so um one
thing is that whenever I go to these
conferences always say hey the cool
thing about these conferences get to see
your photography blown up they never get
a screen big at home so just indulge me
for a minute there I promised Harry I
wouldn't do those standard jokes but I
couldn't help myself so I'll just
introduce myself talk about some common
quality issues talk about what I'm
calling classical test engineers talk
about what my opinion of what an ideal
test engineer is developers perception
of testers some organizational support
requirements eight reasons why I think
what why test engineering is better and
this started from a conversation that
Harry and I had maybe a year and a half
ago and evolved into this talk actually
so I think my host speaking career I
could blame on Harry and and some
alternate alternative approaches that
I've come across some of a few retention
tips some some common issues I run into
you know just wrap up conclusion and
then QA however I'm happy to take
questions and challenges at any time you
know this is just my opinion my way of
doing things also I should say I'm here
with my colleague knit tunic RT and so
we'll have to you know his approach will
be a little bit different from mine I'm
sure your approaches will be different
so feel free to chime in whenever you
like so who the heck am i I've been
programming for 24 years professionally
since 1981 I've been a in software test
for six years and test automation for a
little over five years now and I've been
married for three years old my wife
likes to hear that that's how she lets
me travel to these things that I'm
advertising her and so my current
position is managing a group of 41
engineers located in San Jose netanya
Italy netanya Israel Bangalore India and
what I'm working on is it's a network
management operating system what I work
for Cisco so Cisco makes
routers and switches our customers buy
anywhere between a few to a few thousand
of our routers and switches anytime you
have more than a few that meaning of
anything you need software to keep up
with it and so we the department that
knits and i are from right this manage
the software to manage the network and
manage these devices on the network and
umrah and my specific specific
responsibility is around a new network
management operating system it's
basically a java application and
distributed java application talks to a
bunch of devices at one end and taz an
api in a in a GUI on the top end and
then like Nitin to just spend a minute
and also I should say that six years ago
Nitin hired me at Cisco so he gets to
blame every time I make a mistake ago I
didn't hire me so uh so here just the
same thing yeah this is all night hey I
joins his school about 11 years back and
more or less same background but I don't
know what language Jeff was programming
but I started with assembly language so
that really puts you apart from the
current development trades because one
of the my experience is that when you
develop a similar language and you start
developing C C++ and look at the code
and you realize that enormous wastage of
resources while writing the code in
assembly are in NM c and c++ and one of
the reason i'm in test engineering is
that after doing development for so long
this was the area which can really give
you the bird eye view of the product the
customer the technology and everything
in one shot so that's what my little
short introduction yeah thanks so I I
had a little different approach to test
basically I was i I was my introduction
to test was completely under duress I
spent from 1981 to 1999 as a developer
avoiding tests like the plague and and I
was successful for that amount of time
in 1999 in 1997 maxing should say that's
81 yeah 81 297 in night 90
in 1997's i was living in Santa Barbara
working Francisco they shut down the
office and asked me to move up to the
bay area I wanted to stay in Santa
Barbara so I left left Cisco in 1999 I
get a call from Nitin who says you know
come back to Cisco it's going to be
really cool you can stay in Santa
Barbara life will be great I really like
to have here and then he said will you
be a tester and I said well okay I like
the company at that time i'll come back
and test so so it wasn't something I
wanted to do wasn't something that I
picked out but I wound up doing it so
I'm sure all you guys are familiar with
this common quality problems bugs in the
software found too late regression bugs
are introduced while while we're moving
along in other words the software itself
progresses we may have some insufficient
performance poor scaling poor response
to stress in other words what happens if
a system is designed for a thousand
users and you put two thousand on it
that's what i call stress testing and
poor long-term stability we call that
soaked testing in other words we try to
in our case it's a commercial
application it's not something we have
control over the way a lot of your
software is is it's more like a more
like a google map software that's given
out to you know sold to thousands of
people and we can't control it anymore
it's all its out and and so what we try
to do is simulate two years worth of
usage or one year worth of usage in
three or four weeks and we call that
soak testing but I might have missed a
few but does anybody disagree that these
are problems have you guys all seen this
okay good so um so what is a classic
tester in mice in my case I basically
they are they do everything manually
they come from the program space instead
of or a busy or the they come from the
the problem background the problem
domain instead of the business it's and
the business instead of programming or
engineering I think they're often
experts in the product and they may
understand and use the product really
well or understand the problem space
and because of that they can get very
good at designing tests and writing
writing test cases because they know
they've used a product they know where
it's going to break and they know where
to look for those errors they know where
those cracks are going to be or the
opportunities for error I think they can
be really creative about around ways of
killing a project I've seen that at the
you know people working for me and and
in working at Cisco as well as task
conferences people are really good at
breaking software and they weren't
necessarily software engineers or or
even computer scientists you know when I
first started testing at Cisco one of
the guys who work for me with marine
biologist and he somehow backed into a
networking career and then he became a
tester there's a lot of that going on
and then the next sort of level in the
hierarchy in my mind in terms of
automation or people that are writing
scripts so some people without a
computer science background have figured
out that you know they you do the thing
you run the test of first time and you
do a terrible job because you don't
really understand the application run
the test a second time you're doing a
really good job because you understand
it it's all new you really get glad you
got a handle on it third time you're
already getting bored you know and I'm
missing and missing bugs again at least
that's what I was doing when I was
coding for knit and luckily I got moved
out of the way before you noticed and
and then the next level is you know you
somebody might look at that the third
and fourth time ago I'm tired of doing
this what I'm going to do now is
duplicate what the human does inside a
machine so i'm going to write some
simple scripts to do the most repetitive
task not a lot of software engineering
not a lot of innovative test approach
basically just caught just doing what
the user said a typical example this may
be a scripting a GUI scripting tool like
rational functional tester or win
mercury Interactive's win run or a segue
has won something like that in other
words somebody that's basically coding
in a high-level language like pearl or
one of these scripting tools but not
necessarily at doing any advanced forms
of testing so in my opinion this is
where when I gave us talk in New York
people going to love Ababa so didn't
agree a lot in my opinion ideal test
engineer is
going to be a software engineer why
because I think that software engineers
are good at making sure that a prod
product is designed for testability
right from the beginning it's hard to
understand conversations with software
developers unless we run ourselves I
think it also ensures that in our case
we have developers doing a level of
testing before it's handed off to test a
unit and integration test and if you
have another developer sitting on the
test side they can ensure either
automatically or through looking through
reports or at least integrating the unit
tests inside the functional tests they
can see ensure that that's done
correctly another thing that you can do
is and this is a big point that I use
when I'm trying to recruit people is
that you will the software engineer can
design test systems at least as
complicated as the application itself
one example of this is the space shuttle
that is still running on the same
program it runs five computers that they
built in the 60s and they vote on the
right answer the navigation for the
space shuttle and it runs on unlike it
still runs on a magnetic tape in a loop
and the software to sim to test that and
simulate the environment that space
shuttle has to be in is you know huge I
don't know how big it is but it's got a
lot of people working on its way more
complex than the actual navigation
software itself and I think just
simulators in general flight simulators
the same thing way more complicated than
the software that's actually flying the
plane because you have to do a lot more
work so their systems like that where
the testing is actually where the unique
stuff lives not so much in the
application and and also I say you know
the space shelter work twice out of a
hundred and fifty times roughly so
that's not too bad I mean fit worked 148
times out of 150 they only had to
failure so they're doing okay is anyone
is it's working so basically also i
think that test engineers can come up
with ways of simulating a customer
environment automatically i know in the
case of
of my network management application and
where Harry used to work and he worked
on this the mom application you know you
need a lot of computers two of you need
a lot of users to either a lot of
computers or a lot of devices to get a
lot of them get a lot of activity
running in your application and if you
ever try to keep 40 pcs running at once
you'll know that you know I'm sure you
guys have tried that it's nearly
impossible you do that for 23 days and
one of the you know the either software
crashes or power supplies that going out
or something so you need a way of
simulating a plus with you guys using
you know thousands hundreds of thousands
there's no way you're going to fill up a
lab big enough for that so you have to
have a system that's simulating
classroom environment I claim it's
easier to do that as a software engineer
than not does anybody disagree with any
of this think that I have it wrong I'm
happy to hear challenges because I'd
like to learn as well but this is my
approach finally yeah okay so what
percentage of test automation would you
say is actually at least as
sophisticated as a system under test so
what percentage of the automation that
I'm building or what percentage is out
there in the world I don't know about
out there in the world they only really
know about what I'm its why are the
disadvantage of my six years of testing
it's all in one company and other than
the conference's you know where we met
it I'm a little bit under a rock and so
I would say that it's still a minority
even at the even at our level but in my
group it's it's most of it in other
words we designed a test system right
from the beginning that probably as
complicated as the application itself
why because we have functional tests
built right from the beginning and we
wanted to reuse those functional tests
in a model-based scenario so we've
basically built all that in a framework
to handle all that all at the same time
as well as a you know when you're doing
everybody familiar with model-based
testing yet okay good so in a case where
model-based testing is you know at least
I spent most of my time messing around
with the finite state machine keeping
that running every time the application
changed I had to change my finite state
machine so we wrote a little
infrastructure to do that automatically
for the programmer so in my case is
pretty automated but but my boss knew
that I because of this I didn't have any
patience for people that have that
aren't software engineers I don't even
know how to talk to him that well I
guess and so he gave me basically the
guys that were from the beginning
software engineers and they wrote tools
in the past and now they're doing
testing in in Newton's case people are
more heterogeneous and he's been having
I'll he's been having more people learn
to become software engineers as time
goes on so what percentage i don't
really know in my in my group it's about
it's over two-thirds of my test team and
software engineers ideally I'd like to
keep it because our problem space is
complicated around 85 to 90 percent and
the other ninety percent of what we call
a you know networking guru Cisco you can
get what's called a ccie a certification
at Cisco it's pretty hard to get it's
like getting a master's degree in
computer science called ccie and we want
to have a few of those around and they
don't necessarily have programming
skills but other than that the people
have program skills l and the one-third
that don't work for me is because we
hired we newly acquired a company that's
the basis for our for the software that
I'm writing and in there they did and
they weren't so careful about about
hiring software engineers for test most
of their testing was manual and anything
that was automated at the company we
purchased woods pretty much built by the
developers themselves yeah yep right how
do you test the system
motivated to stay in QA rather than
going jump me to actually building a
system boy I'm glad you asked ask that
question could you hold on to it for
till I get to the eight reasons thing
why why I think testing is better and I
would say the short answer is that I
really do think testings better now and
and we'll see why when we get there
that's a really good question yeah yep
as well as the simulation space exactly
yeah that's a good question if you
testing samba tonight yep that's a
really good question and and in oh yeah
so the question is testers have to be
expert in both the application that's
under test and the simulation space or
the problem space and how much
influences developer have on what a
tester is going to test and the answer
is I think quite a bit because the way
the philosophy from my scene SVP like
our boss's boss is that developer men
and tasks for every application sit in
the same room and actually the way he
laid out my group is that there's a row
there's a set of cubes on the outside
and a set of cubes on the inside and
test is on the inside and on all the
developer individual contributors are on
the outside there so right from the very
beginning their training their trading
information the testers go to all the
same training as the developers do and
there's a lot of hey here's my API you
know you should do this or what about
this is this is this a develop unit test
that I should do or is this a new
gracian test or functional test or
performance tests that you are doing and
the other influence that they have is
there's two places where we where we do
formal documents one is called the
master test plan which we do before the
project is committed and and developers
review that so everybody reviews
everything and and then and then later
on we write detailed test plans before
we do that and developers are reviewing
that so they do have a lot of influence
on what's happening i should say that it
in our group in Cisco it's what's called
the team environment everything's run by
something called a program team and it's
made up of a program manager who's a I I
call the I call her in my case it's a
woman Diane Wingfield I call her the the
you know Microsoft Project expert right
the one with the project and those weird
diagrams I forget the names of them and
and then there's someone from there's
marketing product manager he's marketing
guy there's development there's test
there's tack which is our technical
assistance center support and each each
group sitting around the table has an
equal say in what in what happens next
and everybody reads everybody else's
documents in other words everybody reads
the prd everybody reads everybody reads
the functional spec everybody reads our
our spec so you know when things are
running well everybody's got a lot of
influence on on all of the areas does
that answer your question here the other
thing is in the other direction now how
much influence as a testing organization
has on the dif design requirements in
prd definition of the software itself
now because they know the domain space
exactly so one of the areas is that I've
talked about is that right here on the
first bullet is that a tester their job
is to ensure since they're working right
from the very beginning isn't sure that
the tests that the that the design the
developers are coming up with are
testable what does that mean in my case
that means making sure that the GUI does
nothing but but the GUI is nothing but a
presentation layer of information that
it doesn't do any logic or any business
logic and that all the business logic
takes place behind the scenes through a
published API the the other things that
that we do is I have my team look at the
PRD which is the product requirements
document that's how all products start
at Cisco and it's basically the document
the software on the test has to meet
these requirements and space Callista
requirements and so I tell them look at
that for the following things one is
clear do you understand what the guy
wrote second is it testable in other
words you see that requirement can you
think of a set of test cases to
to verify that the systems meeting that
requirement if not the guys got to work
some more on the marketing guys got to
work some more on the requirement the
third thing is does this make sense from
an overall system point of view in other
words step back a minute and take these
a lot of times there's a lot of
individual requirements that may
conflict with each other that may be
incomplete that are written by two
different product managers even though
it's one product and they sound like
they're two different products so those
are the things that that I tell my guys
to do at the at the prd level and
basically you can't execute a project
until test signs off on marketing a
development signs off on marketing you
know development and marketing sign off
on tests and and then everybody signs
off on development to everybody's got to
sign off on each other's documents there
and basically each person has an equal
say of what's happening make sense and
also I'm talking about the ideals right
sometimes we get into fights and deal
breaks down a little bit but that's when
we're out recruiting that's what we say
and so what is developers perception of
test engineering this is what I've seen
before it was when when I first came to
Cisco certainly like this testers are
idiots you know I I remember getting
that from some of those people we used
to work with I can't remember their
names anymore luckily and I guess they
were parsley right foot but I'm still
here and testing is boring manual and
repetitive after be honest thought it
was like that from 1980 until until 2000
pretty much till after the first year of
testing and testing is not creative one
of the things I really liked about my
job in programming was that one is I
didn't have to deal with people and the
second thing is I thought it was very
creative creative ways of coming up with
solutions to a problem and I really felt
good when I at the end at the end of the
week or the end of the month when I went
home and I really wrote some cool thing
you know I liked it it was fun I know
innovation takes place in testing
testing is nothing but verifying that
the application works therefore I can't
be doing any innovation so testing is a
necessary evil that stands between me
and the world seeing my beautiful
product if only test would do the right
thing I'd get
that thing out there testing isn't a
career you know testing you may do it
for six months a few boss tells you to
hopefully get a bonus at the end and
then move on to the real world which is
development and testing test engineers
are pencil-pushing quality geeks or ten
pence pencil-pushing process geeks in
other words they said did you tie your
right shoe and then your left shoe this
morning because that's what the that's
what the standard says you got to do
even though left shoe right to works
just as good you have to do it this way
so did I miss any so there's two sets of
things that I was telling folks in New
York about this and I don't know how you
and there everybody was different
company so everybody had different
viewpoints but I think there's some of
this in recruiting and keeping people in
tests that's organizational in nature in
other words that you have to convince
your boss to do and your boss may have
to convince her boss and basically up to
the SVP level maybe you maybe you're
already doing a bunch of this first and
foremost and I feel like those suffrage
women in the 1990s you got to be paid
equally and that's how it is at Cisco is
there's no difference between a software
engineer and a test engineer in terms of
hope I'm not getting you in any trouble
here sufferin sea air and test engineer
in terms of great salaries or pay scales
in other words we're in the same pay
scales the same ranges and you actually
get to pick your your title and it could
say QA engineer it could say test
engineer could say software engineer and
there's one two three four and it's all
the same I think this is really
important for a person for a test
engineer to feel equal to the developers
and for the developers to take on to get
the right people and for developers also
to give the respect that's demanded also
I think there needs to be a career track
inside the company so it's cisco you
know my boss has 320 people working for
him he's a he's a director which is a
pretty big deal there it's um there's
other directors in taxi he has got one
director working for him and other rest
or managers there's
the others at the director level at
Cisco Cisco is basically a hardware
company and we're a little weird that
we're software developers inside a
hardware company and but on the hardware
side there's VPS of what they call
quality assurance which basically is
testing hardware and quality assurance i
think that paradigm makes a little more
sense with harbor and so there's a vp
there so the bottom line is that people
come into cisco and see that there's a
that there is a there's a track they can
go and they can make a career out of
this thing it's subtle but i think it's
important it's also important like i was
saying before that testers and tests in
general have an equal say in the project
they shouldn't be viewed as a service
organization to development and a lot of
times developers will say just do this
just do that you know can you recreate
this bug for me or can you you know set
up this lab environment because I don't
know how to do it and networks kind of
complicated in my case and it's
important that that that that doesn't
happen that hierarchy that that
developments automatically better than
tests and in my opinion I don't know how
it is here too so I'm sorry from
stepping on toes but just my opinion is
that the that test organizations should
be independent of development I like
that at Cisco that all the way up to the
director level basically the engine
development engineering groups are a
completely separate part of of our
business unit then the test is so so the
VP who runs the whole thing has
marketing reporting to him development
you know several development
organizations and marketing
organizations some operations
organizations and independent he's got
test sitting right there talking to him
every day and what the reason I think
that's important is because when we used
to do it the other way at Cisco when
knit and I both work for development
managers it was constantly the
development project was getting later
and later and later and it got down you
know we had a three-month test schedule
development was two months late and we
were asked to test in a month and
although development antigens say I
promise I don't do that there's always
this implicit pressure to take away that
kind of importance from tests and also
to be honest its people you know that
development manager is not thinking
day-to-day about
person's career staying in test and what
they're doing in test so the bottom line
is this is the ideal I'm sure there's
other things that'll work but it's I
think it's one thing to keep in mind
that a lot of times test being
independent of development is going to
help a little yes yes but they're
reporting to a different exactly by
independent I mean I mean independent
reporting structure the way we started
six years ago was a development manager
would have 20 people working for him he
maybe had 15 of those be test be
developers and 5b testers or he may have
a bigger group than that and he'd have
one development manager in one test
manager and then that was it was
basically the development the first line
or second line development manager had
both and it and we found that we were
able to achieve better quality by having
a test engineering organization better
quality and higher productivity because
we there was more reuse among the teams
of test technology so also i think test
engineers in my opinion unless is
probably strong word i think it helps to
be co-located with the development
engineers i've also seen it work pretty
well where development was in san jose
and test was in India but that's under
very specific circumstances where the
testers are very there's a lot to travel
back in those days when we did that kind
of stuff money was no object at cisco
and we did a ton of travel we needed a
guy here for three months from india we
just bring him here even though it costs
double his salary to have them here than
there and so we had a few leads
basically a few test leads here and most
of them in india and that worked but
it's a lot better to have if you're
going to have a group in a in a you know
that's that's remote I claim the way to
do is have some development and have
some tests have a critical mass if you
can and have them work on a project
together it increases the the comptia
cooperation viewed as development peers
by upper management so I think that's
just basically another way
of repeating equal pay for equal work
blah blah blah and also I think it's
another important thing is that i'm not
a big fan of people that say their
quality assurance groups and the reason
is that i claim everybody's assuring
quality is everybody's job I think
marketing development and test all have
a significant role to play in the
quality of the product and I ever really
asked my boss's boss if that's if he
believes in that too but I think he does
because he keeps calling us test
engineering and we have a few people
that are called quality but they tend to
be what I made fun of before is depends
on pushing process geeks they're the
guys we go to our products have to be
what's called TL 9000 compatible it's a
compliant it's like an ISO 9000
specifically for the telecommunications
industry and like everything in
telecommunication spin around 100 years
and it's really complex I don't really
understand it so I have to go to one of
these guys and say what am I supposed to
do now and is this right is this
compliant with this and those tend to be
the that's the help that I get from the
quality guys and does it really increase
the quality of the product I don't know
but it's certainly not hurting it I
guess and and there and they're the guys
basically that are that's the guy that
we're calling quality nobody else on the
team is called quality assurance because
it's basically everybody's job so what
about the software engineer testing
software i think i put this picture up
before they accused him of being a drug
addicts anybody know who this guy is
this cell Lance Armstrong he's won the
Tour de France seven times and now they
claim that the first six times he was on
an illegal substance so whatever pardon
yeah yeah actually EPO which is the
cancer drug which when you're not on
cancer you're not allowed to take
anymore so whatever the weird thing is
there's now a tour of california which
is sponsored by Amgen in Southern
California amgen's the inventors of EPL
so it's you know I think maybe it's the
only people that could sponsor bicycle
bicycling races now so anyway
what does the software engineer do
that's testing software i claim we can
divide design the sophisticated software
to perform not only the functional tests
but also develops complex software it is
to stress the system and I and I claim
you need a level of sophistication in
that so then it's getting to my
questions of here's where i have this
eight points of why I think testing is
better and I really do one is as I said
before you still develop highly
engineered software it's still
sophisticated in advance and it's just
the purpose of it that is different
instead of writing an application that
people are using I'm going to be writing
you know the customers are using I'm
going to be writing an application that
ensures that the application on the test
meets its requirements and will meet the
customer demands and won't break down in
an adverse environment and I'll use
these things on the phone i'll use these
things in interviews when people think
they're coming to talk to a as a
development job i'll use it in phone
screening because we'll just ask for
software developers and then start
saying oh I've got a job that's almost
like development it's testing but it's
in a little different way I'll use it
when I'm asking when development
developers are inside Cisco that are
unhappy with their management for some
reason they come talk to me and I'll say
oh look this is what we do in testing so
I'll use these points pretty much
anywhere second thing is you get to
decide what to build I don't know how it
is a google at Cisco the developers
don't decide what to build it's a
product manager and they go and they the
product manager decides what their what
the dot what the products going to do
and yeah you have some influence to tell
the guy would be really great if it did
this or that but in the end he that's
his domain and he's going to tell you
what to build in test he doesn't care
product managers and carrots things
working that's fine it's not working
that's fine i think you basically for
those of us individual contributors we
want to do some neat thing we basically
have to show our boss said it's going to
increase productivity or increase
quality and if we get our boss to agree
to that it's we're going to build
something cool that's how I brought
model-based testing into cisco I think
it's how you brought it into Microsoft
as well hire basically I did
in what was called what Harry
recommended as a micro project I did
that in in my case where I spent a
weekend doing it just myself and then I
got an intern or two to do it and then
it started taking off from there so
basically I did something interesting by
just telling my boss here's a little
experiment it's going to be really cheap
let's move on developers in cisco they
don't get a chance to do that hardly at
all in general at Cisco the ratio is
three developers for every tester so on
any given project the test team is about
a third the size of the development team
that means that the teams are a little
bit smaller I think it allows us an
opportunity to stand out a little more
being testers because of that because of
the smaller team or a lot we're less
likely to get lost than the developers
in my case there's um I have out of
those 41 developers 38 or testing up out
of 38 testers excuse me 41 people
reporting to me 38 of those are testing
the product I'm working on right now and
there's about a hundred and twenty
developers I don't know those hundred
and twenty developers very well at all I
know their managers and that's pretty
much who I deal with on yep the opposite
is true in the testers most of those
development managers know who my testers
are because it's not that big a group
and so there's a little bit more
visibility there the creativity again
it's about the product manager telling
you what to build it's some I think Tess
engineering can be very creative about
what they're doing I think model-based
testing is one of those examples in our
case simulating our customer environment
with complicated networks is another
another interesting place where people
can develop software and and then also
we occasionally run across these people
and I'm sure Google's filled with them
we probably used to have lots at Cisco
it's getting less and less now where we
had folks at just we called them patent
machines you know you talked to the guy
for five minutes and he's got eight pen
eight patentable ideas just coming out
like this and and in testing you know
there's a lot of those you get one of
those guys and testing which we have had
in our past and it's just amazing we
just can't keep up with all the ideas
the guys having
how to test a product so also this is
probably the best maybe I should have
put this in the beginning you get to
break your buddies code you know what
could be more satisfying then your
friend going home all pious Eddie wrote
this really cool thing you run your
automation overnight he comes in the
next day and the thing you know you hand
them the cup of coffee and said oh yeah
by the way your application crash last
night here's the here's the LOB file
does anybody hate that part of the job
okay innovation I I'm not a very
innovative guy like I'm not one of these
guy Diaz guys that come up with ideas
all the time I'm basically a good
plagiarize er I played all my management
philosophy all the stuff you like from
Nitin anything you didn't like I made up
myself i plagiarized a ton of the
advanced kind of testing I did from
Harry that's basically me but in the
world of testing I'm able to get four
patents on testing in there all for
patent pending and that's saying a lot
for a guy that's not that innovative I
just don't think I am and I think that
if I can do that then others can do that
as well there must be it's a lot more
wide-open space I think because software
developments been around a long very
long time complicated testing especially
on the kinds of applications kinds of
systems we're working on i think is
relatively new and so i think they're
the cracks in what we've done our a lot
wider than before another thing which i
think is cool is you get to have the
customer interaction and the business
knowledge that developers don't have in
other words at cisco we learned to never
send developers to the customer site
because what they wind up doing is
patching something there nobody knows
what's there it's a little different
here where you have control over at all
but in our case we have these commercial
applications and the developer is going
to go fix something and we'll never get
back into the main line source code and
we're done another thing is that the
developers it's like if you go to a
cardiologist with a stomach ache he's
going to check out your heart you know
if you have a headache he's going to
check out your heart you go to a brain
surgeon with you know your foot hurting
is gonna go well something wrong with
your brain because he's you know those
are the developers a tester I think
tends to have a better a higher overview
approach of trying to figure out what is
customer doing and understanding that
customer so their little bit more
natural a person to send to the customer
to talk with the customers interact with
the customers and to me it's a good
break from the actual day-to-day you
know grind of doing the work and so I
think testers just get out more is a way
to say that number eight did I mention
you get to break your buddies code this
is the part you're supposed to laugh
again so is really only seven so let's
see some alternate approaches any
questions so far okay some of the
alternate approaches that I could feel
like one is interns I'm a big believer
of interns anybody here an intern still
in college here part-time good i'm going
to talk how about how we exploit you so
i would say that the people that work
for me now that I'm the least likely to
give up nitin and I are supposed to be a
team and we work for one guy and you
know we had this opportunity recently
where I could give some people up to
Newton and you know I just can't bring
myself to bring give my interns up I
don't know they feel like children to me
I have they gave them they quit you know
they left mcdonalds at three bucks an
hour to come work for me for 10 bucks an
hour super motivated you know they'll do
anything say it's just it's just amazing
they're really happy to get their job
it's pretty cheap because we're not we I
think at Cisco we pay them time off but
still it's it's very it's still very
very cheap to have them they're just so
jazz to get a good job that they you
know highly motivated and a lot of high
energy and you know they're willing to
do the testing is the bottom line
because they're like it's cisco it's
google off test i don't care it's way
better than then flipping burgers and
and and what we try to do when we can
you know since 2000 we haven't done too
much of this at cisco but we try to
convert people to full time when they
graduate and then by that time we've had
people in tests for two or three years
and they see all of these things i'm
talking about and they're a lot less
likely to leave are a lot more likely to
hang around because they've got that
experience at first they couldn't leave
and kind of like me I couldn't leave if
i wanted to work for cisco in santa
barbara and f
while they like it better it's not
everyone but it's most people and and
that's why i said they might enjoy
developing this automation and I think
there's basically two interns that are
still working working at cisco that
started with me i think five years ago
and they're really great they're you
know they're still very highly motivated
in there shooting right to the top
another guy that I don't know how we
talked him into coming his wife works
here now this is when he was single he
used to work for me and he works for
knit and now and figure Dale take the
test job he was right out of school and
it was a similar thing get right out of
school where people he wanted to get in
cisco really badly and now he's pretty
much one of our most creative creative
testers that we have you know i'm
talking about and so what's the second
alternative approach i found one is and
this I haven't done but some of the
nitin's team has done where they go just
come to us test first develop later stay
with me for 18 months that's all I'm
asking a guarantee you can move over the
development if you like it turns out
that very few people wind up wanting to
move in the one case we have a where I
have the most data on this is one team
in our TPS john beck and he said that he
would surprise at the end of the two
years that out of the i think it was
about 10 to 15 people that he did it one
switch to development and that's a
pretty good rate and then the thing is
that he didn't even mind if they're
switching to development because then
you got a tester friendly developer
there a guy that's been in the trenches
of testing who's now doing development
but it turns out when we use this
approach people don't want to move that
much because they also see the
advantages retention so I think it's
really important that the leader the
manager enjoy testing I think you have
to have people that liked it better than
development otherwise if they're just
faking it well if I remember Casey Kasem
who this guy used to do top 40 stuff
when I was a kid he said the most
important thing in show business is to
be sincere and once you face once you
can fake that sincerity you have it made
so same thing here
and I think though the leader really has
to enjoy their work and another thing is
I think it's time I think it's important
to make time for training no matter what
no matter what you're doing there it's
probably true in any job but it's really
important in a test job because we have
to understand the customer space a lot
better than the developers do and we
need to we need to do that as well as
maintain our software engineering skills
which which in a Java world how many
people testing java applications here
anybody yeah so the Java world has the
Seth doses you know of basically lots of
people contributing all the time and
there's always a new data structure
coming out because it's an interpreter
it's not really a language it's always
some new data structures some new
approach and you got to keep up with
that you know j2ee blah blah blah web
service is always new things happening
it's good it's also a place where
sometimes people want to learn the
business skills in other words learn
business itself nitin had a guy that
three years ago decided he wanted to get
an MBA you know and so he got that and
and his master's thesis was basically
his job at Cisco on testing inside using
it for a massive thing so that was
another way to keep this super sharp guy
one of our top ten performers interested
in the job I you know continuing the
training and and also management and
leadership skills people want to move up
to management people want to take
technical lead skills and there's you
know should make time for that training
as well any questions challenges a few
more another thing that helps keep
testers around is like we were talking
about before involve them very early in
the test cycle so at Cisco basically as
soon as the idea comes up that hey now
on we're going to use IBM web services
for our for our web application
developers go off and learn that soda
testers basically every class of
developers go the testers go as a matter
of fact when we went to purchase this
company I was involved with used to be
called shear networks on the very first
flight I went to do the technical due
diligence I went over there as a tester
and and I was I was the test guy and so
that shows you know that means that the
organization cares
enough about looking at their tests
organization when they want to buy as
their development so it's a way of
keeping the test is interested I went
over there couldn't figure everything
out so I had to send some of my guys
from India to help dig out some
information and then the next thing I
hear was from development individual
contributors complaining to their
manager about how come test keeps going
to Israel to evaluate this company and
development has it so key involving
tested early helped them a lot and
certainly a pissed-off developers which
is probably even better than helping
testers I'm teasing if if development is
researching or training so it's this
second bullet is what I've said before
basically simultaneous training what are
some of the common issues I don't get
respect the respect I deserve from the
developers those managers have you ever
heard that before who hasn't heard it
before you have never heard that oh
you've wonderful wonderful developers
here so I used to get that alot i go you
know part of it is you have to earn it
right you have to show the guy that
you're the guy or girl that you're as
good as him or better than him more as
smart as him or whatever so i think
that's really important to do another
thing I get sometimes is um I'm not I'm
not invited to the development meetings
well my answer to is you know again what
did you do did you talk to the manager
did he say you can't come to those
meetings so you talked to his boss said
he say you can't come most of the time
or maybe didn't even talk to the guy
running to me it's mostly time they
lecture come to me we'd like to have you
sit in maybe I'll have some good input
every none so a lot of times it's
basically around making our own life a
little bit more interesting I think
that's the kind of coaching I wind up
doing development wants me to perform
the XXX boring task I used to get that a
lot I think though sometimes there's
just a little bit of that that every you
know a bunch of development a bunch of
testing is just boring you know
sometimes that's what it is is mundane
but at the same time you know if we
teach developers and if we create tools
and create ways of automating that
boring task we're not going to have to
do it so that's one way of looking at
that and then also we need the
organizational support to make sure that
test isn't viewed as a as a service to
the developers so just a
cap is I claim the best test engineer
the best soft French test engineers are
going to be software engineers
organizationally Ella if it's not the
case already elevate the level of test
engineering to the software engineer I
think test engineering should have its
own career path and as think it's okay
and this is somebody to talk about for
it's okay to move back and forth it's
really helpful at developers be testers
testers be developers I think Harry's
mentioning a Microsoft that's one of
them that's a normal thing in arcade in
Cisco it's not normal to move back and
forth but when we find people either way
we encourage that and that's all any
questions did I finish on time get that
how do we get questions from kirkland is
there a way to do that oh they're not
watching it oh okay good I'm glad we're
not the only ones that have problems
with that yeah yeah yeah okay so um the
one who drives me the most so that's a
good question so we have at cisco cisco
follow of this is no secret the cisco
files a general electric model for
ratings and rankings so everybody cisco
gets a rating on 5 ratings and then
everybody in you know in a bu and a
grade level within a grade level gets
ranked as well and there's criteria to
follow at each level so we will have
things like and it's standardized across
I don't know the standards across all
the system it's certainly standardized
among the 350 testers we have
1800 developers there so i think the top
10% wind up being the people that can
out develop the developers they can
understand the customer space better
than the customers do they can design
test test cases and test systems like
there's no tomorrow they're bringing new
and innovative ways of finding some bugs
there a lot of times it's a matter of
attitude where it's like they never say
no it's always can do you know it's like
you know praveen having this big problem
here you know this this we have the bug
and it's crashing once every three weeks
and it's not off it's not happening off
enough to reproduce it can you go after
that thing and he'll say sure you know
and and it goes after it so I think it's
also people that get along well with
everyone around them they kind of dude I
think they tend to do all of these
things right in our situation am I
missing any it people who really bring
the time scale for example in a sister
we have a slightly different area where
company Google we are focusing on
application of software right we also
have to focus on the network ass-kicker
netbook in the entity we manage with
this piece of software so along with the
software skill set we also need a lot of
other spaces like flavor configuration
technology
and all that so we basically take the
older I get good skill set and aquas
based on couple named en were supposed
to save results you asked about the
content yeah so hardware testing I
always kind of had a better reputation
yeah the bed software testing do you
think that is part of why it's easier to
sell test engineering at communications
that's a good question i don't i don't
know because even though i'm at
basically a hardware company I'm a
hundred percent saw from a web
application so my interaction with the
harder to use is very very little and
we've had just recently we basically had
a move over into organization from some
from a test from a director of test who
came over to software and he brought a
couple of the senior people there and
that's really our first interaction in
the last six years with people from
testing iOS software in a hard world and
and you know I did I know that they're
also have a long history of software
development over there and probably
because that's the only way to test the
software when its iOS operators you know
it's basically an operating system you
have to automate that testing and so
they have a high degree of skill there I
think in general I think this is going
to work for google also it hasn't
already it's the one of the things we're
doing it I meant to put this in here
because this is specific to an
organization especially when you're
overseas i'm sure it works here but even
more so in india overseas people care
about the prestige of the company that
working for and you know cisco has a
great reputation in india's when cisco
calls or recruited call cisco they
people jump it down sure microsoft does
i'm positive proof of us too and i would
use that as an advantage say you know
and we've seen that before people can
work at infosys or we pro or Arnold's
Tractor Company or whatever but working
at one of these big American companies
HP Intel's really big over there
Microsoft's getting big Google cisco all
these guys have a lot of receipts there
there it's important for people you know
and I learned this my first trip to
India they
the Indian manager SAT me down and said
you know what this engineer he's here to
please his mother and it's important and
if you I'm not kidding that's what he
said and he said if his mother doesn't
hear that he's got promoted in years
she's going to want to know why why that
happened he's going to have to answer
the same thing is if the if the
engineer's mom knows the name of the
company's he's working for he's working
for she's working for it makes it that
much easier so I would definitely want
to go overseas to recruit I definitely
would use that you know if you have
surety fog but that prestige you'll see
it's a big deal yeah how do you have you
and then software India's right curate
this is different yeah yeah how do you
are even poisonous
so the one thing is I tell them that
that's a good question don't have to
keep your present another okay so Sylvia
I think that those seven points is one
thing there's a several aspects one is
that when we hire people right out of we
heart we used to hire them when we hire
them out of school we don't wait till
they graduate we go in as we get them as
juniors and we don't tell them
specifically what you're going to do and
then I think I was because it's talking
about this before and I we
euphemistically blind them up in a big
line you go developer developer
developer test developer developer
developer test and oldest ever saw darn
you know and so then it's their here
it's my job to cheer him up a little
pick them up up the phone ago don't
worry Weaver let's clean it off you know
and and so that's one aspect and then
also what I do is when I'm searching for
resumes I just go for the software
development resumes sometimes it have a
little test experience it's fine like oh
for software development resumes I
basically go through those seven steps
using the fact that it's cisco to
leverage what I'm there and you know
that I'm there and and I've noticed to
overseas especially what people like are
people that they can relate to you know
a developer will take a chance on test
if they like who the leader is if they
like the company that they're working
for if it just seems like it's a good
place they they interview another thing
is at cisco you have to interview 10
people you have to be interview with 10
people
in order to get a job here you know
that's good for the company but it's
also good when to give people the the
person coming on board a sense of yeah I
like these people so in the end I'll
take this chance that maybe that maybe
development is better am I successful
with I mean test is better mine
successfully recon no not even close and
especially in India right now especially
in bangalore it's very hot environment
very hard to hire people so we go
through a lot of junk resumes lot of
time so we go through a ton of junk
resumes it gets pretty good we get the
pretty good candidates and I'd say even
half the candidates that we want to talk
to won't come in for an interview and
they find out it's test job so it
absolutely taking more more work than
development in the beginning but it's
but it's doable from these things to
have anything after that yeah the two
basic things is first of all we stop
volunteering because that creates a very
between brigetta especially place like
India it's a QA they don't relate that
with engineer and second the feature we
usually say which of the fact that you
join the engineering there will be
engineering you have very narrow focus
of what you will be doing in a big part
you join testing and you made the bard
IBO plus your in-house custom you get to
know the customer and the industry
powers that is that my son successfully
first I'll come home any dinner with
your family yeah
when's your wedding I'll come to that
where do you call it secure fixing
that's engineer yeah we're testers or
test engineers and we have developers or
developers yeah
yeah so so once people are interested
then we have to do the other side right
I've done what I'm mostly talking about
this is the sell side and you're asking
what about the buy side or maybe it's
the other way around and so the x is a
similar is a similar in my experience of
similar interview process to the
software developers what are the
software development skills in our case
too because it's networking and at each
networking in schools now sometimes
people put something on their resume and
I want to make sure that they know
something about what's on their resume
and so we'll ask questions or buts about
that as well you know one of the guys
actually maybe this is what you're
hitting on one of the one of the
feedback that I got from in New York
last week was that hey you're dismissing
the skills of a test engineer which are
different from a software engineer in
other words software engineers build
stuff test engineers great stuff and
it's a different skill set and I that
there may be some truth to that but I
don't ask for that in the interviews and
I and I'm claiming that it's not really
a different skill set it's just a
different orientation to the same
problem in other words the point person
is looking at breaking it one person is
looking at fixing it and they and they
both do that from similar backgrounds
they're going to come up with an entire
five products
yes yeah that in our environment they
just saying they do that here yeah in
our environment they do that too and one
of the things I ensured was when we
first started this Mitchum was the guy
who introduced developers after writing
unit tests I was the first test
organization to do that and what they
did the first time was correct me if I'm
wrong with this memory is they sent us a
bunch of paperwork about how about how
the how their unit tests were in my
group who he took that one step further
we basically like I said plagiarize
everything he did and now we just
integrate their unit tests into our
functional test so feel complete we
automatically kick off the unit test
those complete well enough we have
certain criteria for that we
automatically kick off our functional
test out that completes will start up
the model-based testing
good questions I'm data stocks such a
minority of people sleep
