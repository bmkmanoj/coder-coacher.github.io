today i'd like to welcome megan prey
longer to google her book inside the
machine which she will be discussing
today is a visual history of the
electronic age that captures the
collision of technology and art and our
collective vision of the future the talk
is going to showcase rarely seen
illustrations primarily from the 40s
through 60s of the 20th century and will
reveal a chapter of American history
when art and technology commingled Megan
prelinger is a cultural historian and
archivist and the author of inside the
machine she uses co-founder and
information designer of the prey linger
library here in San Francisco please
help me welcome Megan failing her hi
Chris hi everybody thanks for having me
this is fun and funny at the same time
and hide everybody in san bruno friends
and neighbors you've all got a copy of
the book and i'm not going to give you a
reading from it give you more of a
process talk of methods and strategies
and kind of how i came to study this
material and extrapolate from it a
history of technology which is and how
that how that happened so i started out
by reading old magazines and you know
this is some of you five years ago I put
out a book I was studying the
relationship between art and advertising
and the history of ideas in and wow
that's loud in in the history of
aerospace and when I was studying
aerospace technology and its history and
the relation and how you could
extrapolate a history of space flight
from graphic art and old magazines the
idea came to study avionics or Space
Flight electronics and aviation
electronics and this book is what came
out of the set aside material that was
going to be a space electronics chapter
I but then I had to start
over again with the research into what i
was looking at I because I'd started out
studying this kind of dialogue on the
pages of the magazines between what's in
the advertisements and what's in the
articles and that was where the tension
was between the utopia debts promised
say in the ad on the left and five pages
later this topia this very same vehicle
advertised has been crashed in the
headline says it Mars the beginning of
the jet age so previously had been I
reading the old magazines and trying to
think about what kind of cultural
history of society and technology you
could map out by looking at at the
various points of tension between
advertisement and text and then
especially in the case of aerospace
between fiction and fact and the
interplay between science fiction and
emerging technological realities which
took in the late 50s and early 60s took
turns leading one another from the first
half of the century science fiction had
LED technology and then for a while
technology caught up and led science
fiction and so the the outcome of those
studies was this previous book of five
years ago I so then I had this idea of
doing a history of just the electronics
that had contributed to the mid-century
developments in technology but the
electronics artwork was far more
comprehensive in its time frame it
couldn't be understood what happened in
the 1960s without understanding what had
happened in the 50s 40s and 30s so I
started collecting it across five
decades and trying to figure out how to
read it I it was a really good thing
that even as a humanities major I'd had
to take science in college and learn to
build radios and learn to read circuit
diagrams because had I
had that not been the case I might not
have known how to read a piece of
artwork like this that actually contains
a symbol language and its symbol
language that tells a story about the
historical moment in time that this
artwork was made to communicate an idea
about technology in this case the
emergence of the transistor in the
waning of the vacuum tube and so that
insight this talk is not chronologic the
book goes roughly in chronological order
but I'm instead going to talk to you
about kind of the order in which I
learned how to read the images and there
was this insight about the circuit
diagrams that told me that for the
electronics artwork in order to
understand all of it everything it was
referring to I had to read the images as
language in and of themselves and the
dialogue was actually between not
between fact and fiction or between no
utopia and dystopia as in space stuff it
was more to read the artwork as a
language that tells the story about
technology and and the story is takes
place between the lab bench and the
artist and this book really became a
story about the mediated collaboration
between lab bench scientists engineers
and the artists who interpreted what
they were doing and this is my life but
is it art picture it's actually from a
moment in radio electronics when they're
each one of these different kinds of
circuit boards was made by a different
kind did a different kind of job but I
like this like as if we're in a gallery
I you know it changed the way that I
looked at the artwork and so as before
you know I worked on this as a FileMaker
hobbyist and made a database of over
1,300 images
and analyze them and logged them for
their technological and cultural
reference points and made a multi-year
study and then kind of let the reference
points cluster into different types of
narratives and those narratives became
the chapters I was mostly looking at old
magazines but I both trade trade
magazines engineering magazines I also
looked at pamphlet literature this
booklet the story of a giant is an
artist made booklet made for the martin
company there's my set of electronics on
the shelf with the april 65 moore's law
issue so this is a list of the
periodicals that were reviewed for this
kind of brain breaking study that I'm
really glad to be on the other side of
and although it was a real joy to work
on actually 60 years of these and in
each one of these titles i found artwork
that in in at least one case and every
one of these told some version of a
story that when assembled into a
composite i gave a total picture of a
history of electronics from actually the
1910s to the the book winds up with the
emergence of the mainframe in the late
60s and early 70s and again the reason
that the reading became so complex but
it was a complexity that pulled me in
and made the book possible with the
emergence of the transistor age was
because the transistor age was the
beginning of the miniaturization that
brought technology into a realm that was
so small that it was hard to visualize
it really the transistor really resisted
a direct depiction because it was so
small so artists turned you know here's
one brave attempt to work of physical
representation of a transistor into an
artwork that says something about
landscape that the westward turn of the
electronics industry in the mid century
and the emergence of silicon as a you
know replacing germanium as the basic
element of transistor technology but few
artists could manage this to say
anything about the waning of the tube
and the emergence of the transistor
without turning to a graphic symbol
language which is where I started and
I'll finish this first little section
just pointing out the symbols for the
tube and the transistor ended up having
a kind of visual charisma that the
little transistor itself couldn't have
and you know there are a lot of reasons
for that they're pretty ordinary designs
but you know they're not ordinary in the
sense that they in their geometric
simplicity they really express both
graphic modernism and the technological
turn to post-war modernity at the same
time and that was really helpful for me
to understand that there is a
relationship between graphic modernism
all the way along in different parts of
the book that goes back to the 1930s but
especially in the emergence of geometric
modernism in the 50s the graphic symbol
language could be adapted to tell these
kinds of stories this is a actually a a
booklet put out by the electron tube
information council and they put the
vacuum tube symbol on the top and the
dominant color of red and and the
transistor symbol underneath in this
kind of receptive color of blue to
suggest that maybe these two are going
to be co-equal and maybe they're going
to coexist and you know that never
became utterly untrue but neither was it
really true even in 1960 when this was
public
to try to present the you know these as
like a value neutral combination tube in
the transistor with maybe the tube
maintaining some ascendancy and I like
this is from a Lockheed Martin
advertisement framing a starscape with a
graphic symbol for the transistor you
know this was an ad to recruit people to
work on rocket and missile technology
missile technology that ended up
supporting the Cold War Titan missile
project but in the civil space sphere it
also supported the Gemini series of
launches the rocket that was being
recruited for 4 in this ad and then it's
got an audion tube the first vacuum tube
a little nod to history that the first
tube from 1905 front and just another
beautiful graphic modern transistor
symbol it's really here turned into a
repeating motif and then I'm going to
bounce back and say like I said this
talk is in the order in which I learned
to read the images and they'd been
looking at this vacuum tube vernacular
for a long time and trying to figure out
what to make of it really as a historian
of technology and especially in my kind
of early approach to the research of
trying to map the relationship between
technology and where art says it's going
culturally and this image does that it
actually that's from 1943 and it speaks
to the kind of question in the late 30s
and early 40s of whether vacuum tubes
were going to be kind of rounded organic
forms or if we were going to focus on
the angular mechanical machine look to
define our understanding of Technology
but after and it says something to you
about the alignment between the electron
the solar system model of the electron
and the idea that electronics as
technology would be what would get us to
space and that was an idea that had it's
a germination as far back as 1909 and
1910 one visit which is when physicists
started using the solar system as a
metaphor for talking about the internal
structure of the electron but then I
when I went back to this image and it as
if to read it the same way reading a
circuit diagram artwork and thinking
like so what is the device and what what
story is the device the picture of the
device here telling me about changes in
technology in that historical moment and
so the steps a little you know back in
time and back in the book to the vacuum
tube chapter because you know this was
if that image it also has a kind of a
corny aspect that kind of bounces the
critical eye back on itself it took a
little more time and I went into the the
answer to that was to go into the
technical literature in the I Triple E
journals which are actually the I are
e-journal at the time and and look at
what this tube actually was and what its
promise was and what I was doing so
there it is a new ultra high frequency
triode and published in 1941 the GL 880
and you know what this did this is the
tube that made FM radio possible and
it's the tube that allowed for frequency
modulation transmission in other words
and when it was written up in the
Proceedings of the I re it was here you
know published with a map showing how a
radio broadcast geography was changing
because of this one tube and so you know
after that
than the idea of kind of spatial izing
that tube in the you know and the idea
of thrusting it into the into space and
suggesting that it be looked at as
holding the earth inside of it and
reframing the earth in the solar system
it actually it made more sense when
realizing that the tube itself was
changing the way people heard you know
communicated each other as space-time
telecommunications speeds aids in
geographies and I'm going to skip ahead
to a little past the middle of the book
and just give you a window onto it yet
another different kind of reading that
took me takes the book into a kind of an
even deeper exploration into the history
of technology in this case the history
of computing and this is another
instance in which it's the language
within the image that really caught the
attention and an end prompted a turn in
the whole way that I was reading the
images but this is not a symbol language
it's it's you know alphanumeric regular
old alphanumeric and so I'm thinking
what's what's the alphanumeric language
saying here besides just being beautiful
and you know I knew that it was the
Italian futurists that had kind of
ripped language from its conventions in
the early 20th century and interrupted
the consistency of the printed page of
the 19th century and made language do
things that led to concrete poetry and
the use of text add text elements as
design elements so I thought okay here's
a you know a commercial artist making
reference to you know the Futurists and
the way the Bauhaus later also used
language elements as
elements but you know think back to that
database with the method of this
research had actually collected and
logged um you know hundreds and hundreds
of images before really trying to
interpret them and trying to interpret
them as sets and what I saw when I
collected all the ones that had alpha
numeric strings in them as part of the
artwork is that some of them had
mathematical strings and some of them
had alphabetic and I'll keep going with
that and that each of those parsed out
to a different kind of message that was
being conveyed in the advertisement and
this is one of my all-time favorites
it's actually one of a set of three
they're all in the book so if you have a
copy of the book you have your own copy
of them with the mathematical strings
and this is Royal McBee this is an
advert to this set of advertisements is
promoting a mathematical calculator that
was used for kind of pure mathematical
calculations at the univ research
university level and in particular this
machine that's being advertised the
libra scope but the LGP 30 is the one
that edward lawrence used the biologists
who figured out about the butterfly
effect and and these are the kinds of no
math problems that this machine was
being used to solve and then here's an
ad for the burrows that had arroz 205
computer of 1959 and it says does both
jobs equally well and this is where you
know it becomes obvious these images are
telling you something about the history
of computing and I
you know the research then they went
into it and all the technical literature
explains that which can read about that
the computing industry is we know it
today that had it's kind of early
moments of taking shape in the 1950s was
formed out of the process of combination
of two really very different industries
and one of those was data processing
which had started with punch cards
traces its genealogy you know to punch
cards of the 19th century and the 1890
US Census and the formation of IBM had
you know that that train of
technological history is all about
processing information and on the other
hand you have other companies that in
the first half of the 20th century
weren't really collaborating or talking
to the information processing companies
and those are the calculator you know
inventors and companies making
calculators for scientific calculation
and in World War two each of these kind
of domains of computing was I mean they
were different whole definitions of what
computing was and each of them was
really put to task for all the war
related purposes and an immense amount
of federal funding went into developing
them and then in the at the over the
course really especially of the war a
people started combining their strengths
and making information and information
processing and scientific calculation Co
existent in the same kinds of machines
and these new combined machines or what
became known to us as computers but that
process there's more detail on it in the
book but that's it's an advertisement
like this where the machine is being
promoted as doing both jobs
equally well the question to the naive
reader is which two jobs are those in
the you know the answer is you know lead
you to this whole half century of
history of the slow convergence of
information processing and scientific
calculation and the there were in the
Cold War and it's interesting to me that
a lot of the artists many of these
artists were modernist trained emma
grace who were new to the US and brought
with them European traditions of graphic
modernism that touched kind of many
corners of the globe and global artistic
traditions but it's not without irony
that an artist would deploy something
like this to promote a a Burroughs
electronic Theatre processing system
because this is a direct reference to
you know Russian constructivist
typographic art this is a famous poster
promoting man with a movie camera the
avant-garde movie by Teague of air tov
poster by the Steinberg brothers from
1930 and this you know is a direct
quotation of that thai style but you
wouldn't know that if you weren't
studying soviet modernist art so it's
kind of an in-joke again computation for
the space age if one way to read this
book or at least the second half of it
is that in in the in the late 1950s IBM
developed their 700 series and 7000
series of electro-mechanical and then
fully electronic calculating and dating
data processing machines and these
machines were of a order of magnitude
more powerful and had broader
applications than any other machine that
had come before them
and I you know at some level the whole
second half of the book is about a North
American technology and Industry
freaking out because no one you know
there's no giant labor pool of people
that knows how to program and run these
machines and there are no there's no
giant pool of working supporting
machines they can I you know translate
the power of the big IBM's to the
specific tasks so one of the jobs of the
burrows was machine was actually to plug
into the sage system and to NASA's
launch calculation programs and harness
the strength of the seven hundred and
seven thousand series and a whole lot of
these ads directly reference the 707
thousand series and IBM here is directly
bragging so a lot of these ads were
recruitment but a lot of them were just
like this is who we are and what we're
doing and take a look at this fantastic
image and whether really promoting here
is that there were how much labor and
technology kind of material value of
technology they were saving by enabling
gnats that are run virtual launch
rehearsals in emulator space and they're
actually saving hardware from expensive
and embarrassing Launchpad crashes and
explosions by you know by enabling a
technological assist to the process of
rehearsing launches so that's why they
say how to circle the moon without
leaving the earth I and one more so the
borough's be 5,000 as a machine that was
promoted advertised and explained in
advance for three whole years before it
was available and was a great big in its
day a game changer on par with
EMS and uh you know I just loved this
image because it brings in everything if
that combines the the dot patterns from
punch tape and punch cards that there
are there's a whole chapter about them
in the book combined with the alpha
numeric strings representing both data
processing and scientific calculation
and then there in those elements are
combined in this kind of lacy curtain
and behind the curtain comes out the
mainframe and it's a it's not a drawing
of a mainframe at the photograph and
this picture kind of says something
about where the art is going that and
then late 1960s when mainframes became
kind of populated around North America
and they started to have their own like
physical identities and they came to be
and photography was ascendant if you
look at all this kind of material in the
1970s it's all just photographs of
mainframes and like this is where it was
headed so that was a non chronologic
introduction to some of the three ways
of looking at the material that is what
turned into this book it is a book that
sort of starts with that vacuum tube
vernacular and the idea of you know how
does a vacuum to change space-time and
how does it relate and why does it
relate to the relate to how physicists
thought of the structure of the electron
and where scientists wanted to take
technology which is in many cases into
space for the sake of space exploration
and since that dialogue sort of starts
as early as 1910 and is much of what you
see besides radio cabinets in the
advertising that's the first chronology
then a chapter on vacuum tubes
and I mean cathode ray tubes the tubes
at sea and let me just point out about
that one that I in that chapter 2 image
which is from a 1946 in 1946 there were
no interstate highways and so the tube
is this ad is harkening back to the idea
of looking at how the representations of
Technology were referencing ideas that
originated in science fiction and this
one it you know shows that kind of
tension between the which science
fictional idea the green world without
boundaries or the built world with
freeways you know neither actually was
true at the time but the science fiction
of the time was playing with both of
those kind of ways of representing
possible futures ah after three on is on
crystals the transistor chapter it ends
up falling in the middle even though
it's where I kind of started really
learning to re-read the images as a
history of Technology same with circuit
boards which are really interesting I
you know I haven't talked much here
about so much of this in every chapter I
tried to map a meeting point where the
practice of the artists making the art
had points in common like craft bench
easel material origins in common with
the work that the scientists and
engineers were doing to make them as the
machines and here with the in circuit
boards where the board kind of reference
in its very shape references and easel
or a painter's canvas that relationship
comes into pretty sharp focus especially
once I learned that even in 2015 artist
to make their own electronic instruments
can sometimes still make their own
circuit boards by hand
in workshops gaaah you know that's where
that relationship between art and
technology I you know stops off in the
mid century on its way from the early
20th century into the world we're living
in today there was actually enough on
automation and paper tape and punch
cards to make a whole chapter believe me
when you get there the that this little
section title said a book with three
endings and you know at one level this
image by the artist she with Jacqueline
Casey for Lincoln laboratories which is
recruiting people to work on the 709 s
to adapt them to the sage system among
other things but this image it when I'm
almost done I'm going to compare back to
the vacuum tube vernacular and she is
actually putting together a lot of the
same elements all of the same elements
that are in that big vacuum tube that's
being thrust into the sky but she's
doing it through collage and she's
pulled scientific papers that refer to
the 709 and that talk about the
structure of the electron as it relates
to surface physics as they relate to the
development of new kinds of transistors
and another paper about celestial
mechanics so the idea of electronics
harness to map space exploration is in
here the idea of the relationship
between that the solar system and the
electron are adjacent to one another in
the art as in the minds of the
scientists is in here and then this idea
that you know kind of with this image
that the age of graphic art is kind of
over and it just it's going to turn into
technology a few days later I mean
Photography a few days later and the
work of the artist can be accomplished
entirely through collaging the evidence
and this really speaks to me because to
me the whole process of researching and
writing the book was a process of making
a collage of the evidence and then using
that collage as like a roadmap to
technology and she kind of does all of
that here in this one image the space
electronics chapter brings me personally
back to the germ of the idea that
started back in his facebook seven or
eight years ago and also concludes the
geospatial narrative that takes us from
the earth to space you know in 1963 the
Ranger 3 was aimed at the moon was
supposed to land at the moon but it over
flu and went out forever into the solar
system and it missed its landing and the
reason i point that out is because it
had a tube in it so like that's it the
furthest tube you know after that people
didn't put tubes in space it was
all-transistorized and then to bring us
at least to touch the present day and to
touch the historical trajectory of where
electronics are going that the horizons
of today are about integration with the
human body the last chapter is a kind of
a redraw of the whole through line that
goes but emphasizes robotics and the
emergence of cybernetics and the
emergence of the relationship of the
human body as a as an expressive force
for the future of electronic
technologies and this one I don't yet
understand it's not in the book offer it
here to amuse you and to point out that
sometimes it's
just beautiful look at maybe it was
something about May of 68 I don't know
and thank you thanks especially Kris for
bringing me over thank all of you for
coming and listening sure QA yeah the
question is about like how would I how
does my own pattern recognition process
work and how would i go about parsing
out an image that i don't understand and
you know my first that database it logs
kind of types of art and types of
technology that are obviously referenced
and then it actually you know and then i
would log you know questions but then
beyond what i can obviously i can only
log something into my fields in my
database if I know it well enough to
have set it as a field or as an option
you know so there's a limit there and
the way I would solve that and which you
know I offer that as an expression of my
the limit of my understanding is that
actually read the technical papers and
on try to understand what they were
saying about technology that related to
the visualization i was looking at and i
think in that one just the technology
was a little more obtuse than i was able
to follow exactly or follow a direct
line between but in almost every case
you know it can by reading the technical
papers behind the various inflection
points and inventions and usually in the
technical papers there's a ordinary
language discussion of what the thing is
and what it's what its relevance is
because all engineers you know want
their invention to be understood and
it's it's a potential to be recognized
beyond their sphere of acquaintances and
luckily you know I
read a lot of those kind of non
technical explanations as if as if i
were there you know intended reader even
though i won oh yes the question is did
I was I looking at a vision of the
future that existed only in technical
papers or did it exists outside of the
technical literature is that well you
know every chapter is about different
ways that are visualized the future the
question is about you know should there
be a chapter on visualizing the future
and you know at every stage at to some
degree those technologies had a kind of
a front end where they were understood
to some extent by the public or at least
by philosophers and social philosophers
and that's how cybernetics you know
cybernetics is a philosophy about the
integration of communication technology
with feedback systems and you know
that's an example where a lot of the
future ideas about what might happen in
the future were articulated far outside
the limits of the technical papers and
that that's true to differing degrees
all the way through through the book odd
question which I could take an hour to
answer I'll try not to is how did I see
race and gender playing out in the
history of the mid century of Technology
and uh you know that's what it's really
it's really its own book and it's
staggering there were for one thing this
both art and science in North America
were hugely infused with new talent
during the interwar my great migration
phase I think about that every time I
look at the
newspaper because people crawled on
their hands and knees out of Europe
after you know in between the wars and
during World War two to get to the US
and not just Europe the Asia as well and
you know all corners of the world during
different fluctuations and you know
there's a I yes there are a lot of you
know it's both art and technology or
dominated by white men in the 20th
century but not to the extent that
history would have you believe and
everywhere I looked I saw women in
people of color doing work both in
mostly in technology the artists were
more heavily anonymized by the systems
they were working within but I did find
women artists and I found
african-american technologists
japanese-american technologists all
working at the forefront along with you
know Russian Hungarian Chinese Japanese
immigrants people coming to North
America to make new lives for themselves
no it wasn't you know everybody was
there at some level even if history is
not always remembered that everybody was
there sure the question is about how do
I see how this historical material
relates to the kind of visual world were
living in today around technology and I
you know it's really so different all
the trains around a visual communication
have changed so much you know we're not
really in a magazine world exactly
anymore and starting as long ago as the
mainframe and the involvement of
designers like Raymond Loewy in the
development of what computers were going
to look like the the object itself
becomes the focal point of design
especially
from the 1970s onward and then you know
today you know I think art is if
anything much more highly valued within
the sphere of technology than it ever
was before but it's more highly valued
as a mode of making technology smoother
and easier to touch and easier to use
and that that relationship between art
and engineering has really become
consolidated into the this work of the
you know contemporary and emerging
engineers who are making you know the
devices that integrate seamlessly into
our everyday experience it seems to me
that's where more of the art wise even
our understanding of what advertising is
looks so different it's not an innate by
11 frame anymore for instance you know
so it's hard to draw a direct
comparisons but i think that the you
know the engineering world is really
absorbed the lessons or where it
succeeds best is where it has absorbed a
lot of the lessons of art in its own
practice thoughts on how artificial
intelligence has been represented
throughout history i try to touch on
that it's a it speaks to the early
history of of robotics and the emergence
of the robot as a figure as early as the
1920s in industrial advertising and the
really the whole last chapter talks
about that because early extraordinarily
rudimentary artificial intelligence was
the switching systems the westinghouse
made to control street car traffic in
pennsylvania and i know it's funny to
bring that in but if you look at the
know they made a robot to advertise
their switching systems herbert televox
and this robot went to work in 1928 to
talk about you know westinghouse as a
company that made artificial
intelligence although it wasn't
that at the time and there's a direct
lineage between the switching systems
that control streetcars and the switch
systems that ended up being bit
technology well it was a anthropomorphic
machine a person like a no as a
mechanical person a mechanical person
that could you know walk and do things
there's one in 1928 and then a more
sophisticated one that General Electric
made in the 30s actually went to visit
Herbert televox last summer in the
museum or he lives in Ohio anyway and
that goes all the way up to you know and
then in the 60s the idea of a I becomes
harmonized with the idea of networked
the idea of networks and all the
different ways that networks were
depicted in art work sure what happened
to the art and it's some you know maybe
there I hope that there's going to be
more to learn about that in the future
but I have worked on this for many years
and so far all I've really been able to
learn is that in most cases the art was
this is a sponsored art that's why it's
been overlooked by the art you know so
called self define art world and is
little known to historians of graphic
design it's this really niche sponsored
art but meaning that it was purchased or
it was solicited commissioned of artists
by technology companies for the purpose
of interpreting their work and and the
company is tended to then collect the
original artwork and then
we've seen you know 50 60 70 years of
consolidation and reorganization in the
corporate universe in North America and
I've not been able to find any company
archive that had any of that art that
they were willing to talk to me about
and the only original art I've seen is
was in the ownership of an artist I met
an artist Willy bum who is a Swiss
trained modernist who did did work for
lockheed and martin in the 50s and he
had kind of snatched one back because he
knew that it was just going to go to
dead storage and so he had one canvas
original that he showed me and that's
the only one I've ever seen okay thanks
