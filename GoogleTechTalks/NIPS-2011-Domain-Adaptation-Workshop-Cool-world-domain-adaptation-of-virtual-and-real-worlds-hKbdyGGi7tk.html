theory- ilion that we should be here at
the end that's impossible so I'm going
to do the tomtom of this work angrily
from the video official community not
putting machine learning and we just
take your results from the massive army
community I use them so I'm not going to
so theory or whatever just an
application ok this is the alignment
representation first I will introduce a
application after I willing to use what
we call that the domain also they saw
domain and what we have done for doing
what we have we understood as
communication and finally the conclusion
ok now we're application is a defeat of
human detection this is useful for many
applications like pedestrian detection
applications in multimedia civilians in
fact we are here the fear of driver
assistance so in our initial work was to
detect pedestrians on our moving car
well if you look to the capital of
Palestine addition the mods subsistent
of the art relies on discriminative
clearly this means that you need to
provide a sample positive or negative
suburb to be lapped by a classifier so
you have the samples and then they are
you strut your features there is many
people doing featured defining new
features if I'm new heavy machines and
on the end you end up with a classifier
which means that issue
very much and you take a small window of
they match the classifier is able to say
if inside this window there is a
pedestrian corner okay is the city and
anguish this what you do is given any
much you traveler arm and a match with
certain windows at different scales you
get even multiple detection from the
same digestion and then you summarize
them in a single detection this is more
or less well produced and detection is a
lot of course there are more things like
tracking and other or a feedback for the
top of a disease okay let's go to the
target of domain in this case ok perhaps
the target domain are images like this
one anywhere that were taken from the
photograph and for doing our experiments
we started with or we use the database
which is publicly available sometime
there they automotive comment okay this
is these are examples from this Dana
said you have a training set and our
testing set okay the program is for is
that to get this example to meet the
rain you have to do manual an impatient
man not man or a notation a list means
to put a boundary box for the
pedestrians okay I heard of this myself
is quite time consuming its aggressive
are quite boring t okay so well the
current solutions for that in fact it is
to use web-based annotation tools which
means that well you have a many a
notation from many people because you
can pay very very small prices but still
you have to deal with annotation errors
because someone is understood that ass
there are malicious workers there's some
activity whatever also you have to do
is through water strategies and addition
guidelines assault so this is a one way
but we don't want to follow with it this
to this way so we wanted to explore a
very different thing and this clear
brings us to the source of me our idea
here was the following okay in fact this
is this is a media that was around for
ten years in our health but yeah we
couldn't implement it before the idea is
the following we know that computer is
providing more and more realistic board
bill to almost forest and if you look at
their last video games many of them are
quite realistic ok so our India was ok
can we close now that the circle in the
sense that computer animation West basic
via in reality to build these genetic
models realistic genetic models can we
now learn in this bill towards and
applying our classifiers in real world
so that we closed a certain and this is
what we did in a previous work on CPR
2010 we will build OCD we travel through
this city with the Vigo a big topic of
course then we took pictures of the view
from the vehicle we have automatically
ground truth it's a wise long term which
is very hard to to take my hand and then
we build a classifier based on this
beautiful a information this is a
classifier and then we plug it in the
classifier in a standard pedestrian
detection fiber ok and then we put here
the geography matches and we get our
results okay this this is an example of
this big club city ok so is realistic is
nothing the most realistic possibility
but it's quite ok and here is how we get
the data well after this is from
subsequent but it's much less boring
that yeah yeah actually did this can be
done by the video game itself is on the
side what happens here at super yeah
yeah what happens here is that she's
actually coming from a video game that
was for shuttle and we don't we couldn't
go inside the code of this video game so
we just change this the gun by the roof
sometimes you say for some people you
know I'm greedy like this I'm from that
we get this result this this dataset so
ok and then I know that you know Big
Bang was ok for the universe that we
like to start always from the basics and
then we said okay let's go to use one
baseline which is not the state of of
the an investor detection the twist
which consists on using a histogram of
Oriental grampians by it allowed in CBPR
2005 to a sweet tooth this feature for
those that are not familiar with the
computer vision community are trying to
qualify a kind of global safe of the
person so it's not test two but mainly
say okay
and then using also a linear SVM for
doing the classification in this feature
space nowadays there are better future
spaces and maybe here other cameras this
is a white rose baseline in the sense of
new stuff many times it is just to add
new things to this so is this is there
still is there I'm not only for
possession detection but for obvious
detection in general ok then we did our
experiments which this is a typical
evaluation procedure for us here we have
the false positive very much which means
if i look at it to an image company
windows says our method at our
possession but upload and these are the
this is the Miss rate in person that
which means how many pedestrian enemies
okay usually we use this ranch of of the
Pew because it's the most interesting
one for our attack of applications and
here but we have this these vs. means
trying it with them lab data test it
with dengler data this means training
with the beautiful examples and tested
in the tangler data and this here and
this here is the area under this curve
okay so basically what what this number
says is that well this first side yard
works okay because we have basically the
same performance without doing any
innovation okay since this was good we
said okay let's let's go to another type
of application which means less use a
different data set for instance this in
Riyadh Drita said which is different
from the previous one in the sense that
this deserve
for the holiday and the bridges work
we're at images from car okay and in
this case what happens is that well we
did exactly the same experiment but yeah
we have a gap of seven percent of on the
performance is this dispute so in this
case the same exactly the same didn't
work or didn't work to do well because
after all this is not that partners of
this I mean this is very far from random
okay then we think with we were thinking
what welcome in at all maybe the problem
is that we are using you to our data and
then what we did after is to use the
allure data to test to train a
classifier and this in the nuclear data
set and then we saw that in fact for the
danger they take that is coming from
rehab or it happens the same time for
our people read data so it was something
like okay this is not due to the
beautiful day I just because they
realized if it doesn't matter if it it
comes from the view to Alvaro from the
real one hey okay and then we started
what we call the google the same that
means that we have this problem and then
I start to look in google for this kind
of digital then see what what is doing
other people with similar problems and
we gotta figure from this paper of
frustrating bc domain adaptation and
then we read it and we said okay this is
our problem we have we didn't know
we don't have prominent domain
allocation okay and will this lead us to
the this work on romanization what
happens here and if I look to the philly
dataset we have been working with it
turns out that they built one on the
table and conference from acid this
means that the typical poles of the
people and the typical background and so
is more similar between these two done
with this everyone why because here you
have first on a picture from the beach
pictures from indoors picture from the
snow and the backgrounds are different
they both of the people is different
because you don't stay like this in a
strip where you are located and here
they were posing for a photograph and so
on so you have different here the humans
you have give difference in the
backgrounds and also you can think that
this is a different sensor this is a
different sensor on this is a different
set so they they come in I mean and this
issue of the camera is quite important
because yeah we started to work ten
years ago with this type of cameras then
we move to another we move to another we
move to another and we are constantly
changing the camera because a different
person one a different company once a
different governments and this happens
with robotics in general you start as
you can and do for Laura progress but
you are changing and changing the camera
and yes by that time we also were
looking for information on computer
vision organization with some papers
here but not too many and now there are
more i have seen policing in the walls I
probably more and more will come right
buddy by the time we establish with this
there were not too much information
okay and then when we propose it was a
very pragmatic framework I mean we don't
have bones on the error on things like
that we just try something from your
return to and see what happens in fact
we call our framework VA lamb which
means butan war annotation jet learning
adaptively and we use this name because
you know is the main character of this
saga you know if you know the chip
children you know this era and Eliza the
main character is a prominent women that
grows with the older come on him at the
end a hundred art and then have to go
Hawking dominant so if this is not here
this is Raven of the ending of the story
but the message please she has to adapt
to a very different way of living I'm a
very much so is going to be useless okay
and in which what is going on here well
first again to make things simpler we
started by supervisor to main annotation
so we will assume some labels to do that
we know that there is correlation
between italian that testing domain
because even the gap was big fifty-five
percent of news ladies means that there
are correlations okay then our system
has too many stages in the first stage
is just what i have explained before
train with visual data based on real
world but now what we do is in this
domain annotation stage again for us has
two things one thing is to collect
samples from the tableau domain and
another thing is how to mix a beautiful
and the
samples in what we call the good war
because this movie that have muffins
okay in the in this case what we did was
to for one particular in presidio what
means that the results of this detection
are presented to another human horrible
and then the human oracle the levels
they missing humans okay I saw where we
got some background example for the
other domain okay this is basically the
idea so in this one we before we
focusing more on how to collect the the
real data basically we follow a touch
mode active learning that means that we
process the whole sequence not one image
and return wanna match our train here
well the Oracle what has to do is given
any much just to say if there is good
questions or not and if there are
pedestrian and someone is missing then
you have to undertake okay okay and for
this parameter settings what we did is
the following first I must say that the
active sample will come from the even
real training data from the testing so
we are really using the same data for
for train okay in order to be able to do
as many experiments are as weak as we
can of course we don't have a pencil
annotating there for each experiment
then what we did is a simulation of the
horrible because we have all the
training data of Maria annotated we can
somebody's data simulating the
active behavior or the random behavior
okay and finally we restricted ourselves
to labor as maximum a 25-percent of the
real world examples of the training of
angry okay because if this is the one
hundred percent they are moving hot
sense because when we are under braking
which is but we want to avoid okay and
he had on some resource first we did
some tests on how to decide what what is
that detection in other words the
threshold for the output of the sbm okay
and we found that gluten here the
threshold indirect we use one using the
college in the limit of the uncertainty
region of the day SVM then the the
oracle annotates the positive example
laptop here okay and usually when people
use active learning in this context
we're done there are no tablet and salt
domain is training and testing this from
the same I mean one way what they did
what they do is to annotate example here
inside the am beauty rachael but we need
including yours example here ok and then
yeah by doing that we got this result
here which is already pretty similar or
plug in this case even better than by
training with urea theta ok so we
capture the second you okay
and this is by the way this is the
number of annotated pedestrians in this
case even with 20 sided 37 examples
which is the two percent of the data set
we already improve from 36 to 33 with
the eight percent which are 97 Palestine
we go to the 50 tons and so so
annotating just these few pedestrians we
were already able to get to produce the
same resource we did more experiments
for instance what happens is if we only
add a positive examples from the real
world and then in this case we got water
salt again what happens if we only had
negative examples from the from the real
world that this this would be very nice
to do only that because this could be
not annotation at all but in this case
also he closed course and finally what
we did was go compares this by rather
with a random meditation and still the
active way is better than the random but
even if it is the same we prefer the
active because when the Oracle say see
the result is able to do similar things
you are like training the Oracle also
hope wanna take the missing fees because
you are sewing him up every animation or
you your algorithm another thing is that
probably the ingrian training data is
not as random as it could be because it
was annotated I think by a person that
was working in in the in the algorithm
for
that detecting the position so it was an
espero from vision so is why I think
that it's not that random the annotation
okay and finally we started to throw
active active examples what happens is
if I annotate less and then well this is
the result of the one hundred percent
good that we have seen up to now and
well it seemed that even throwing away
the 35 to define person of the all
possibility we are still too good but
beyond that yeah we start to go work
okay so this is all experiments this is
the final thing all these pyramids is
that we compared with we did an
experiment that we thought has no sense
for us because it consists on training
using our built or later and the ingred
data but has no sense for our because it
means I 22 labour the data so as some
sense but it's just to see what happens
and if we just mix together the whole
data we didn't get very good results
with respect to just using the annotated
x and cos using the active learning to
see you okay so it's kind of just
blindly mixing everything doesn't work
then we look at that what type of just
two more what type of examples where an
updated and we can see that from the
available indoor persons the fifty
percent we're fifty two percent were
allocated from the beach e 88 from this
now the 55 which means that actually
these scenarios were not in our view too
late
so it's kind that we are really
providing new things my dad Hitler ok I
will achieve this and just in conclusion
well we think that learning from you to
award is a promising paradigm for
building even appearance warrant like if
a pedestrian or other object also that
butyl work can suffer data say see us
any other data sip and then that domain
adaptation techniques given this theme
simple thing that they have used allowed
waddup this is real and bigger even real
world and just to finish yeah saying
that we have for another community we
came here just to learn all we are open
to collaborations and give thumbs to the
organizer because I also organizer for
supper yeah i know that this quantity so
