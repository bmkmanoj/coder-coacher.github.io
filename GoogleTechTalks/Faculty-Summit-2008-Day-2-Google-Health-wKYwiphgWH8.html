one of the product managers for Google
Health and I'm really grateful for the
opportunity to be here with you and give
you a brief brief overview and just
engage with you in terms of a direction
of Google help this is why I wanted to
cover just kind of give you a background
also wanted to transition into a brief
demonstration of the project largely
because I think that it makes a lot
easier to visualize and understand the
product if you are able to see it talk
about some of the research challenges
particularly around the UI and usability
and then close with some questions and
answers so a lot of times people wonder
why Google and why health one thing that
people may not know about is that Google
today answers more health related
questions than any other source on the
planet and so you wonder are we able to
do a better job if we allow users to
store their information we think so also
if you think about googles mission and
being able to help organize the world's
information and to make it useful health
information is clearly very important
and it's still at the stage where it's
also very much offline and of course
it's within Google's DNA to try and
embrace big challenges and clearly
healthcare in the United States is such
a big challenge so if you put all that
together Google's health midget Health's
mission is to help users organize and
store their health information and to
connect them to relevant services that
can work for them if we look at the
current landscape of health care today
this is kind of my biased view you have
the patient off on the side and you
really have the doctor in the center and
to just kind of illustrate this point
I'll give you two personal examples one
was when I moved from Philadelphia back
out to California I wanted to get my
son's medical records and it took a $25
check and took two months in order to
get that record to transfer your prior
to that we didn't have a copy of his
medical record in our hands the second
example is
my wife you know when she was pregnant
she had some pretty related
complications and has some lab tests
done when she was talking about the
doctor's office about this the doctor
said oh you know don't worry we'll call
you if anything you know is abnormal and
so you really see that the doctor in the
doctor's office is at the center of all
that information flow and then the
patient is off on the side and in the
several past several years now people
have been talking about consumer
engagement and we really wonder why
isn't the consumer engaged well maybe
it's because the information really
isn't flowing to the consumer and and
the consumers off to the side so the
vision that Google Health has is to
really put users in the center of their
information flow information can come in
through one of many different sources
whether that be a biometric device like
a blood pressure cuff or whether that
being a few labs through hospital
information systems through pharmacies
maybe through insurance companies a big
part of Google Health is to connect
users to these information sources that
they can more easily aggregate copies of
their information into one place of
course the question comes well if that
information is all in one place how is
that going to be useful how you know and
clearly if the person ends up in the
emergency room have not information
readily available will be very useful
but what more could be done about that
and so that's why we've really opened up
the Google Health platform to serve to
what we call third party services the
idea is that you know someone who's
maybe in the medical field radio or
maybe not they can come and bring their
expertise to users to help them make
sense of their information maybe there's
a medication organized organized without
reason my list of medications and
displays in the calendar view if I can
print out and put next to my medication
cabinets maybe on top of that it can
even send me an SMS reminder every lunch
you know saying you should take the blue
pill the green pill and yellow pill and
you'll just help me with compliance or
you know another idea is just a musician
dashboard I have a 22-month 22 old month
son and I have taken him for a lot of
musicians gee I'm not sure what
great if I could set up a health profile
for him the service can read it in for
my permission and can display you know
the shots that he's had against the CDC
guidelines and tell me you're up to date
on these new vaccines but you need to
get these done pretty soon that would be
pretty useful and that'd be an example
of how other people can bring their
expertise to help users manage their
health information just give you a
little background of health care in
America I mean I think these are all
things that you intuitively know it
features of some interesting statistics
that I found no one we see that there's
pretty high turnover among patients with
their health insurance companies to a
lot of lab tests are being repeated
three especially as the patient sees
multiple doctors you know even if he has
a primary care doctor he may see a
specialist but you know even under the
ppl model there isn't necessarily a
primary care doctor so there's there
were issues with coordinated care and
Americans are actually asking for access
to their online records and they think
that they would be able to get better
quality of care because of that so with
that I would like to just go in
transition to doing a demonstration of a
project so you can take a look and see
what is hopefully a little less abstract
if you go to google com / health today
this is what you'll see this is the sign
in page we have a very familiar sign in
box and so you can use new your gmail
account the calendar account or you can
create new account if you'd like I'll go
and log in here
and upon logging in i'll be taking to
what's called what we call the google
homepage so this is a google health home
page on the left here they're different
areas different links to help people
navigate different areas of their
profiles and if they want to see list of
medications they can do that conditions
and so forth you can actually create
multiple profiles you know maybe i want
to keep track of the health records for
myself but also one for each of my
children and i can go and create
multiple profiles as information gets
added to the profile the profile summary
will get filled out and now i'm just
going to give you show you what that
looks like let's say for example that
I'm suffering from hypertension high
blood pressure you can see that when I
added that information shows up here in
the profile summary for those people who
are just kind of learning about certain
conditions we offer what we call the
reference page this is a feedback that
we got from their advisory council just
kind of give people some grounding on
the Left there's some license content to
help people kind of just learn more
about it but on the right what we do is
we aggregate queries from a number of
different Google properties including
trends also google groups google news a
scholar and and just basically give
users starting point where they can go
and learn more about this condition
going back to the application let's say
that i also want to keep track of the
medication that was prescribed i can go
ahead and do that so obviously this is
pretty high level information users can
go and drill down they can specify you
know the details of their prescription
and you know maybe it's the case that
I've been taking my own pro for a long
time now so I can go ahead and indicate
that in that piece those pieces of
information gets stored obviously we
don't expect that users are going to be
very thrilled about typing in their
malko history you know piecemeal like
this so we've been really working hard
on this directory to allow users to more
easily import copies of our information
so today if you have an online account
with one of these eight institutions you
can go ahead and ask them to send you
electronic copy of the
details that they have you know
regarding your account and to show you
what that would look like oh go ahead
and walk you through the immigration
process through beth israel deaconess
which is a hospital system in boston
i'll go ahead and sign in with my Beth
Israel username and password and then I
want to establish the link between my
breath is real count in my google health
account and this just walks me through
that process now at this point I'm back
at Google Health and Google is asking me
hey Beth Israel wants to send you
information are you okay with that
information does not flow in information
is not flow out of the user record
without these are consenting on both
sides so yes I want a copy of my
information and so Google will allow
that connection to be made now now that
the link has been established I can
instruct the throes of the semi copy of
information so they've given me a choice
you maybe I don't wanna send all the
information in this case I do so I'll go
ahead and ask for all that information
to be sent over in just a matter of
seconds but this rule will tell me this
information has been sent that's great
what does that look like let's go back
to Google Health and you can see now
that the link has already occurred in
addition Beth Israel has some provided
some shortcuts you know if I want to
make an online appointment using their
system but for my email dr. I can go
ahead and click on these no take me back
to their system so when I do a refresh
you can see that this information has
indeed arrived and I can go ahead and
click on my list of conditions and I can
see the information that has arrived
from Beth Israel vs. information that
I've entered so we keep attribution
because that may be important later on
with with the day I guess interpreted
now some of you may have realized that
there was a red flag that's being raised
under drug interactions and I can go
ahead and click on that and this is
basically Google's hanging you know G
from what we know you said that you've
been feeling faint and that you're also
taking my apparel you know from what we
know that doesn't seem like really good
combination you should probably follow
up with your doctor on that
so this is an example of one of the
benefits of having all of your medical
records in one place you know the doctor
that prescribed modprobe may not have
been aware that you were you have a
condition of feeling faint and so as you
aggregate kind of different copies you
can truck for it you can check for drug
digeorge interactions direct allergy
interactions or directed conditions and
in this case you know I might be like oh
you know actually I took mine pro many
years ago and actually I stopped taking
it a few years back and just country
that this is all structured data format
you know and you can see that the
records disappear because I've indicated
I'm no longer taking it okay great so
we've seen how information comes in now
what can you deal with this information
well let's take a look at what we call
third-party services there at launch
there were 14 of them and the idea
behind here is just you know each of
these third-party services offer some
interesting piece of functionality based
off of the day that's in your profile so
i'll go ahead and link to a pillbox you
pillboxes electronic medication
organizer usually i would sign up for an
account if i haven't already done so but
since I've redone that I'm gonna do this
so again I'm taking back to google's
site and Google's asking hey a pillbox
wants to read your information are you
okay with that yes I want take a managed
of the service I'm going to do that and
you can see that this information has
come over so I can click on this and I
can see that this is display in a
calendar view but what's really nice
about this I mean in addition to being
able to specify my preferences like you
know actually I want to do late
afternoon or I want to take all my pills
out wines I can even give my cell phone
number and they can send me an SMS
reminder so this is a really good
example of functionality that you know
we may not be building but we would
really love for other people to provide
the service to users and the business
model is really up to them and it can be
free just want to develop the brand it
can be if they wanted to have
advertising supported they can do that
so you just feel like their content is
really good their service really good
and people are willing to pay for that
it's up to them as well I mean we don't
arbitrate among that
want we just really emphasize
transparency and we want the market to
decide who wish services should get used
whoops so let me go back to Google
Health site so that is basically the
demo information can come in information
can go out and be acted upon and you can
see how as we work on in this link
hopefully there will be more and more
connections and hopefully you know the
the farm see that you go to or the
insurance company that you that you're a
member of you know what would allow what
we'd be connected so that you can get
copies of for information so with that
I'll go and switch back to the
presentation and talked about some of
the research challenges that we've had
it's really unfortunate that I guess
that all the people were interested in
HD I laugh because that's actually the
buckle um because the challenge is that
we think expensing so far it was you're
really hard issues on around usability
so these are some of the topics so I
think are probably worth mentioning how
do you support your granular sharing how
much is your info size privacy if you
get data from about the same events from
multiple sources how do you help the
user visualize that you know in question
about security so I'm going to start
with a granular sharing one so if I have
all the information in one place who
this is a good idea that I should be
able to share it with people that I want
you know whether that be a spouse or
whether that be a doctor it was just the
show of hands okay it's not a trick
question you know I think that's what
you're very useful okay great so now
let's do a little more granular who
thinks that I should be able to share a
list of medications but you know if I
don't want to share my conditions who
thinks that i shall viability okay so a
little more granular how about let's
just look within the list of conditions
who's who thinks i should be able to
share that i have arrhythmia but not
that I have cancer or AIDS who thinks I
should be able to do that all right so
yeah so I have the ability to share one
but not the not the oh yeah okay great
so you know we all think that granular
granular sharing is great idea
additional functionality
we want to support that so if I would
you tell you that Microsoft currently
allows granular sharing but Google
Health is not you might think oh you
know that's that's one one area where
they lead and so this is example there
you are right who thinks this is a few
things that this is going to be
extremely understandable and usable you
know if I want to share one condition
but not another like how many people are
going to understand this and can't
really be able to take advantage of that
of that feature it just give me example
let's say that I have blood glucose as
measurements and let's say that I've
checked it under yes I want others to be
able to see that but not under my die
back profile well obviously you know
blood glucose is pretty important in
terms of diabetic diet ease so if I have
one check but not the other should that
information gets shared clearly this is
a problem that we haven't solved we
think that Microsoft probably hasn't
solved you either but this is certainly
a very real you I challenge I like do
you really want to implement acls you
know like my doctor can see everything
my spouse can see most things my kids
can see some things and you know it's
like how do you implement that in the UI
that so it's still usable this is a
previous iteration before we launched we
gave users different options you know
you can specify which profile you want
link to and then underneath that you can
specify different levels of access
privileges and then the information that
you get from that source you know do you
want to make that private or public
dollars we implemented this we tested
out and you know it was tough like the
user usability test people kind of got
some of it but not all of it and so we
were worried like especially with all
these practices concerns maybe people
would accidentally share information
that that they didn't want to so that's
why this is an example of flexion alike
that we actually took out when we
launched we just may really simple you
know my pharmacy is going to be able to
send information to you or my pharmacy
is requesting permission to read
information from your account and what
people read everything obviously
granular sharing something that we want
to support clearly you know just like
just have this you know widest audience
we
think it's very important but how do we
get it right how do we do it so in the
such a way that users understand what
they're doing and they won't
accidentally release that information so
this is a very acute user interface
problem for us another problem of course
is revolves around privacy so many of
you are probably familiar with New York
Times article that side the study among
college students the finding here was
that if you mentioned the privacy issue
even if you give very very strong
privacy guarantees you know people are
less likely to share information versus
if you just take a very cavalier
attitude if you give them no
reassurances they're much more likely to
share information including you know
that they tried cocaine so you know
privacy is obviously very important
issue for health you know we do worry
about your user perceptions and things
like that and there may be some in the
audience were thinking well we should do
full transparency you know you know make
a truly prominent and if it's the case
that people climb up and don't share
them then so be it but you know we start
with the premise that Google Health is
off actually offering a very useful
service and we think that we're doing it
we would be doing a disservice if we
were to cost people to shy away from
from usage of it so kind of given those
two premises or how do we start how much
should we emphasize privacy if you go to
the sign in page there's actually if the
privacy policy is linked to three times
twice here and then there's once in the
footer this probably breaks some UI role
about having only one link you know to
one place but in this case you know when
we launch we thought well we do want to
make sure that it's readily available
people can find it very easily and so
unlike other products we've actually put
a link right underneath the sign in box
so that it's it can be seen but you know
what should we do about this you know
should we you know so many people say my
sale you should put the privacy policy
you know on this page or you know put in
the box or maybe you should kind of
highlight more principles not sure
another area with the privacy policy is
what should we do about when the
information is being shared with third
party
services so you saw you know the screen
where says my pharmacy or whoever is
asking for my permission to read or
write should we put that organizations
privacy policy here right again that'd
be transparent but the mere fact was
just cleaning on there even if you know
hxt I in this case has a truly part it's
really strong extremely user-friendly
privacy policies and says you know you
can have your own key and no one else
can you know get this day unless you use
some supply the key just the mere fact
of meshing it may drive people to use it
less and we think that there may be some
useful services that are out there and
how do we reconcile that you know just
existe how many people actually we do
track that we do um but nevertheless you
know a lot of times la the feedback that
we do get from your help sir and so is
like you know is this how secure is this
who can see this information so privacy
is on the minds of people and how do you
dress absolutely and it's that's a
concern right and so isn't that just
another way where we can mess up where
users might be able might share some
information thinking that they're
sharing a limited subset but in
actuality they're sharing much more than
they realize well that's initiative
we're looking at and or thinking about
and and we want to be very careful when
we roll out you know sharing you know
when we roll out for first time we're
probably nothing i have have you the
right answer I'm going to move on and
so yeah sorry thank you so the question
was what about these third-party
services do they give you a structured
information about their privacy policy
and so currently we don't we don't do
that in part because there's so many
there can be so many variations on that
so that it's probably most easily
understood in English rather than as
structured area but that's certainly an
area that we could explore and think
about improvy so another you I challenge
is how do you visualize data from
multiple sources about the same event
you know if the doctor prescribes me
something if I go pick it up from a
pharmacy if I record that I take that
and if I go back to the pharmacy and
then I get refilled how do i see that
data this is how we currently solve it I
think it's a reasonable first AB clearly
there's room for improvement and the top
two rows you can see that you know one
was easier entered and one was you know
from another data source and then the
bottom four rows you can see it how
refills are treated a reasonable first
AB but you know obviously room for
improvement security some people are
worried about like well with you you
only have like you know username
password is that sufficient and you know
certainly a lot of people have fallen
prey to phishing scams so how do we
address that in a usable way right so
you can offer a second password but if
they got the first password fish what's
preventing with our second password from
being fished you want to restrict
t-shirt IP addresses you know you
register ahead of time with Wi-Fi on
vacation and I end up in the emergency
room when it be useful i baptized have
access to my data what about having some
physical device I have to plug in and
you know it's a it and then that gives
me access to this information maybe is
that is that really usable
one technique one technique which is now
commonly used by his age is that you
have a private key on a device because
most people like here typically have a
small number of mobile semi mobile
devices for use have you considered that
out it's kind of in between a dongle and
just a password yeah so that's great i
can have a certificate on my computer so
what happens if I'm out at the movies
and I get you know end up in the
emergency room yeah exactly right so so
so the answers aren't clear and more
think about and we really love feedback
you know in different ideas like that so
they're all I spend most of my time I'm
talking about you I challenges but there
are also challenges with the data you
know data that we that we receive can it
all has to be structured but it could
come in as uncoded text it could come in
AZ khodet X and Niklas come in as I mean
I coded or i can come in as text with
codes accompanying so what if someone
sends us you know a text in code that we
know that don't match right and and it
could be very well that the because a
lot of these codes are used for building
purposes the doctor just you know put
something that was a reasonable ballpark
but you know the text actually was what
he meant but then what do we show with
you the user in this case I mean do we
do we show kind of our interpretation of
alphabet code along with attacks or you
know or when we share this information
out like what do we do well you can also
send in codes is so for example you can
send in different cards from different
coding systems and so what if people
send us wine code from one system that
indicates rythme on one code from a
different system that indicates you know
feeling faint or something like that
again what do you do in that case and
you know a lot of times when we were
talking out with talking with
researchers is often there's a lot of
excitement balik oh and there could be a
really great public health implications
to this and it should kind of picky
about like how do you efficiently find
relationships within the data is that
are meaningful and that would be useful
about being out of area currently in one
of our problems is kind of a sales
problems and cents or a network effects
problem you know we've kind of sold 10
phones right how do we sell next
phones I mean once we sell like you know
100,000 files will be pretty easy to the
next cell the next hundred after that
but currently just having only ten how
do we convince people institutions that
you know it's useful for you and for
your patience to be able to get this a
copy of their information and so that's
that's also one of our data challenges
so with that I think this gives you a
brief overview of health and some of the
challenges really wanted to open up some
time for questioning the answers and
since all of you guys are really smart
faculty members and I'm learning since
I'm learning you know I'd really like
this to be I get asked a question you
can tell me the answer please go ahead
I've got many questions i come from a
jurisdiction different from the united
states it's always a kind of challenge
and many things that we hear from google
here because it's us centric although
google says they want to organize the
world's information not the United
States information so what that is a
preface under a couple of things that
you should be doing is looking at other
jurisdictions Canada is way ahead of you
yeah right but but they're ahead because
of the institutional organization of
Health and most Canadians would say it's
not your business to make derivative
answers when you ask the question of
machine learning and public health data
that doesn't mean it's not a good idea
to be people centric and managing it but
I don't want Google in the United States
managing my health records or anybody in
the United States for that matter so so
how do you manage what how you learn
from other jurisdictions because there's
two problems there the second one you
can think about is as most physicians
aren't going to trust this data if me a
standard person delivers it to him
somehow there needs to be a kind of a
focus on building trust right I think
those are you know very two very good
points and obviously areas you know for
learning on the first one just keep in
mind that this is all your user control
so you know even if we come out with a
very very useful application you how you
can get copies of your map
mission from all over some people are
like no I just don't want that
information all in one place that's fine
we're not we don't automatically get
that information does not flow in unless
there's user consent on the second issue
and and so in you know obviously as we
look into other jurisdictions and we do
want to internationalize and I think you
know there may be some implications and
part of the part of those ramifications
are why it's taking some time to
internationalize because we have to
figure out the legal framework and legal
arena in terms of the second question we
do treat attribution very carefully you
know we do want to keep this information
came from walgreens or Cleveland Clinic
versus this information is user injured
and obviously if these are going to take
a printout you know the doctor may or
may not trust that not sure but you know
hopefully there will become time where
information can flow more easily across
across interoperability barriers and the
physician can see in his/her electronic
medical record oh this is a structured
data that came in and this is a way that
you know makes sense to me and I can see
who is this from and maybe they'll be
helpful I mean certainly even if all
this information we're just treated as
these are injured that's gotta be better
than you know right now I can't when a
patient goes in and like oh I think this
green pillow looks like this you know
things like this is a lot more precise
information and we're very much in the
stuff in the lawn Charlie iterate often
no phase where like this is very early
on and we have a lot of lot of room to
grow in so Cleveland Clinic is is
working on importing this information it
so that if you're a clean a patient and
you see the doctor then you see that you
know clearly there are some attribution
issues that company but you thought
through it working through that yes I
have two questions comments 1 is you
didn't mention rly with the data
interchange issues I'm a networking
person so I deal with protocols and so
I'm curious is very sufficient
standardization of the kind of protocols
that allow variety of health systems
which traditionally I think have
everybody every large Hospital has
particularly large University Hospital
has built by own system which is
completely
utterly uncommon incompatible we've next
one over in the u.s. at least I built
many over the years when Columbia
Presbyterian being a prime example of
that right right so clearly there hasn't
been a you know an interoperable
standard that like has been widely
adopted by the market I mean there's
still standards are emerging in
ordaining adopted by the market and you
know we see movement in things like
certification Commission for health IT
it's encouraging the market to go that
way but clearly you know we're not in a
place like the other countries where
information you know any doctor can just
kind of hop on to a system and see that
information we'd love to be there we're
not there yet the second comment is what
I've read about electronic medical
records has been MonaVie particularly
because of the USB distributed and base
mall scale typically individual doctors
small offices type of thing that one of
a bigger challenges is actually not
patient access but if you look at most
doctors offices via information
technology hasn't changed since 1970s
the computer often looks like it hasn't
changed since the 1970s and so I wonder
if a combination with Google Apps and
this wouldn't be much more productive in
a sense of actually solving the largest
problem of us health which is the
unsustainable cost structure and doctors
offices from what I hear look at hundred
thousand two hundred thousand dollar
bills which nobody is willing to pay for
them because they have to build their
own hardware infrastructure as opposed
to go to kind of a more shared data in
the cloud model is that in my own
something this may be getting in
sensitive areas but this seems to be
from what I would see in a global
perspective much more productive and I'm
worrying about people getting access to
prescription as useful as it as it is so
that's question how we get often i would
say that google is more of a
consumer-facing company we don't really
have a lot of expertise and kind of
building systems for doctors for example
but i might think that you are starting
to see market vendors you move in that
direction of more asp base and I think
that really makes sense
so it looks like a lot of the early
features in Google Health using Google's
machine learning techniques and other
things are are doing functions that are
commonly reserved for expert systems
that are backed by tons of insurance so
like diagnosis and drug interactions
have you guys thought about any of the
liability issues for example if Google
gets really good at detecting drug
interactions and then for some reason it
fails to detect a drug interaction then
maybe Google's exposed to some liability
there or vice versa have you guys
thought it at all about those types of
questions yeah question why Bellevue has
come up before and in particular like
you know what drug drug interactions day
based you wanna use for example right
like clearly room for improvement here
we think that's the posture that we want
to take on eventually is that you know
Google's not going to be developing the
roles of South because it doesn't have a
clinical expertise to do that but would
much rather partner or let you know
third-party services you provide that
type of knowledge and and what and so
we're kind of focusing on building this
ecosystem and hopefully you know there
will be enough players to provide that
type of functionality so that user can
camps described to ones that they want
and they'll be useful but current but
we're not there yet so um quick comment
before the next question is that I've
also thrown up on the screen questions
that were posted on moderator and Jerry
you've touched on quite a few of these
already but feel free to answer for
example the first and last question
pertains to help great I think since
these insane for a while let's ask this
question and then we'll move on to the
monitor all right so i have actually one
sort of recommendation for you and then
one own questions recommendation I would
say that at the beginning you talked
about you know the doctors way of
thinking about paying our hospitals and
clinics and then the sort of the user
innocent in the middle i would say that
one half one prominent hospital where
the whole concept of having patient in
the middle which has been proper for
almost 100 years now is the mayo clinic
foundation
Mayo Clinic so if there's one hospital
and the set of doctors you want to talk
to they're the ones ok so that's just a
recommendation the second is that you
know you gave a lot of you I challenges
the one thing I was curious that you did
not have there was that the age the
patient population or the segment of the
population that is likely to benefit
from this is all 60 or 65 plus for that
age group you know if I want the clear
us challenges here was that you should
probably have had a single sign-on
because you to sign on so many times
right so that itself was not there but
just the fact of getting all the
information getting this whole thing set
up is going to a big challenge and in
fact you know in observing user
interfaces for many years I think the
only product organization i have seen
which has successfully brought a whole
bunch of people in their 60s and 70s
into the sort of the video game age is
Nintendo V and no one else has done it
successfully yet thanks thanks for those
odds I'm going to take a couple
questions from from the moderator in the
context of Google Health Google appears
to be focusing on electronic medical
records privacy confidentially
confidentiality issues and ethical
issues are especially critical in this
context how is google handling these in
the context of Google Health so in our
model we really want to put users in
control and we want you know de dictate
who can send information in and who can
send who can see that information so we
hope that users can understand that
control and and hopefully and we're
working hard on making it usable in
terms of their not accidentally sharing
information the second one is how does
how does Google plan and decide to
invest for large-scale projects such as
Google Health or general determining
factors and where the timeframes for
these projects on this question that
I'll involve Alfred since these are
inching executive ER but I would say
that you know we clearly understand that
this is going to be like a very long
term
very long you know we have to be this in
this for a little from long haul in
general we want look out you know what
is going to be useful to to users are
out there and the Metro can we track is
how much is the product actually being
used so that that's really a criteria
that we look at to judge the success of
the product offerings anything they want
to add to that no choice we got it now
okay so so yeah I think I think the
issue is a is it in our mission okay so
we really do believe and we do how many
talks have mentioned googles mission so
that's probably first and foremost in
our mind and second can we be effective
at it and three given the degree to
which empiricism rules this company can
we prove were effective at it and we
start small as you can see i mean i
don't think anyone I mean there's a ton
of work behind the interface you see but
you can see you know way more than a ton
of things we haven't done so we try to
start small and we we try to be actually
kind of humble in a project like this
and will grow over time based on usage
and and and we think it's such an
overwhelmingly valuable program I wanted
to make one other comment I know we're
pretty much out of time so i realize i'm
using up some of your time we'll take
the last question no matter what but but
i'm on a national academy study on how
to involve the computer science
community in medical informatics and we
could do I mean Jerry and I could stand
up here for eight hours and do just open
technical problems in this domain just
as Jeff Dean did a you know high level
view across the broader field of systems
and AI and what have you there are so
many fascinating and important
challenges there is a movement of money
at the NIH into more information
technology realm in fact this the NIH a
30 billion dollar enterprise so only you
know one percent
movement of money is real money unlike
say an NSF where it's much much smaller
enterprise in computer science so I
think it there's a huge amount of stuff
that that can be done they're just
tremendously interesting problems not
for consultants so again I make I'm a
little bit with Rob Pike on this if all
we want to do is find the technical
nugget that we can publish in the
classic computer science literature the
medical community and infirmity shins
and Googlers will go solve this
ourselves the best we can but if you
want to partner with the with the
medical informatics and physician
communities there's just a plethora of
fascinating problems and you know it's
one thing you know you just say what you
access control of course you saw jury's
comment on that of course you want fine
grain access control and then you
realize the extent to which the public
will probably not be able to handle out
I mean and we don't say that as a
paternalistic organization it's just
we've measured it and it's sort of
patently obvious that my 92 year old
mother would never get that right let
alone almost anybody else in the world
and let's get one last question for
Jared here CMU has a NSF founded
Engineering Research Center on quality
of life technologies and I think Google
with this program should be part of that
one of the important goals is for
example extending the independence of
elderly persons so that they go through
to nursing homes later every year they
spent at home as a smoking Turner see
some clearly is very beneficial and
cost-effective one effective technique
that we are using is defining a period
funding research goals but nevertheless
clinicians are pretty tightly coupled in
that world so we get a feedback opinions
before we proceed the specific topics
not only at the level of defining the
research topics but also views
testimonies from the users of the after
they try our our methods of our
prototypes that we built so there is a
lot of that has been going on in that
center is already two years in existence
hopefully should be five plus five years
but i'm looking forward to establishing
some communication between us and Google
traffic yeah and we are very much in a
learning mode and we would welcome
feedback in all areas not just HR
challenges but lawyers and you know we
don't necessarily respond to all
feedback immediately but we know you may
see product improvements you know over
the course of three or six months
without a dress that thank you all very
much for the opportunity to be here
enjoyed the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
