finance and I'm extremely proud to
introduce you this afternoon to mr.
alberto yepez it's a fellow Peruvian and
Alberto it's also is he is the chairman
of high-tech high-tech is thus panic ITX
Ava console and this is a group of
executives from leading 540 companies
that work you know in multiple things
and all of these guys are basically IT
engineers you know CIO type type of guys
and he's the leader of this organization
and at the same time his a venture
partner are at Trident capital Albert
also has a lot of experience in
intrapreneurship he got a couple of
successful companies that Alberto soul
and also he work in several senior
positions at Oracle as a senior VP of
security and also several positions and
Apple so extremely proud to use you
Alberto thank you very much for coming
and for sharing your insights on venture
capital in the emerging markets
intrapreneurship and innovation thank
you very much over to thank you thank
you well good afternoon everyone that
the topic at hand is a pretty broad in
and I don't know how to put the best
context and obviously try to make it
relevant to the work do you do I'll give
you a little bit of a personal
experience of how I got here so that you
know I'm sure you're all thinking about
you know you're in a great company
playing a very interesting role and what
could happen in the future but try also
to be in the context of how important is
diversity which is the theme in the
sponsorship of these of these event and
these talk and also what do we mean by
innovation what does innovation come
from this innovation only coming from
research also talked up a little bit of
the venture world and why it's so
important why everybody's trying to
replicate Silicon Valley around the
world because it's a pretty unique thing
even within the u.s. many many places
like Boston and
have been trying to replicate it and
they done it with mixed success in other
places and talk about little bit our
efforts are going on in foreign
governments in emerging markets what
they're trying to do the same and then
we'll with with being the emerging
markets theme so by way of introduction
and I think this will become relevant in
the talk just to share a little bit of
my own personal experience so i was born
in race in peru I was an engineer by
training electronic engineering and then
luck had it in they gave me a
scholarship to come to the United States
didn't get the chance to pick up the
school it was a Jesuit school so there
are multiple gesture universities and
there was one in San Francisco the
University of San Francisco what I was
completing my electronic engineering
degree in Peru and I ended up doing
electronic physics ausf but computers
were around so I ended up doing computer
science and computer engineering within
three years I got a triple mayor went on
for my master's degree in Apple came
recruiting on campus and when when Apple
came in you know they made it may be an
offer and never finish my masters and a
lot of a lot of you says well should i
do be doing my masters or not how
important it is should I get an MBA
little bit of context or personal
experience this is not a recommendation
but I always said you know I should try
to do that but you know I never finished
I never did my my master thesis never
got my master's degree because the
opportunity to work at Apple in 1986 was
an amazing opportunity he's right after
the Macintosh was introduced the Lisa
was a flop it was a great machine but
then the opportunity to be in a center
of innovation was was tremendous so I
spent ten years at apple and it was
every 18 months I had a different role
and again part of the discussions in the
recent you are here you're interested in
trying to figure out how to do
innovation how much you can take
responsibility for your own career let
me let me tell you something from the
outset you're responsible for your own
career sometimes we always blame it on
the manager or the manager doesn't
recognize me to do these or that or the
other obviously there's interest that
company has to do get something done but
you also have your own career
aspirations so you always need to look
for how do I diversify my own experience
but also how do I
you know take the next step in sometimes
we don't know I remember when I came out
of college I didn't know what what I was
going to do we ended up in a networking
group at Apple where we had to go
develop the network infrastructure
around the world it was a great project
because we needed to integrate voice
data video conference and consolidate a
lot of the engineering network say we
had a lot of manufacturing network that
we had and you know it took me places
far from Japan to Singapore to Paris to
all the places to be able to
interconnect it was a great time to do
to be learning a lot of different things
but I remember I always said you know
have this engineering degree and in my
particular case I wasn't a very good
coder I kind of could I could program
but I didn't see myself programming
forever so what I did was I got got more
interested in the business try to
understanding how i could support
business in and try to use technology to
do that so for fast forwarding an apple
you know I had the opportunity to move
from working in IT working in product
development work in international
distribution in ended up running
programs cross-functional programs when
we were trying to do object technology I
remember was taligent it was a lot of
different companies but all that again
was teaching me new skills expanding my
network and was getting to meet a lot of
different people and really try to
understand what the possibilities were
for me I was very fortunate in companies
like like like Google as well they
always try to identify the people that
are trying to take responsibility for
their career and I work with the exactly
there was a leadership program and they
had picked up about about 15 of us and
they said okay we want to send you to
school we wanted to do the NBA but we
don't want you to take the two years for
mba will give you an executive mba pick
where you want to go so at the time of
you know given that are bidding high
tech for eight years now i said i want
to go to neither coast was an option
because too high tech eccentric i wanted
to go to a place where it was less high
tech centric but also a lot of
international business so somehow i
ended up picking up Kellogg the North
voice is cool in Chicago and that gave
me again
another perspective he was it wasn't it
wasn't by design but it would have been
easier to go to stand for easy to go to
harbor or any other places but he was a
lot or well somewhat i already had
picked up giving been working at apple
so the killer experience was a
tremendous opportunity but the word
network you know the google of hispanic
network whether it were hispanic or not
the net were the people that you meet
make a big difference in your career and
i remember throughout my career I always
looked for mentors people they had a
little bit more experience than I did
and they actually made a difference for
me in order to do that so you learn and
pick up and that do you have a mentor
for you or your whole career no you
don't every time you go to a different
level you tend to associate or work with
sometimes your manager could be a mentor
but most preferably you need to do it
outside the group that you work with
because they gives you a different
perspective and hope you to do that so
we're coming out to innovation up to
that time I was implementing things that
people would tell me we need to do these
we need to do that so for this project
working with in R&amp;amp;D programs a lot of
collaboration cross collaboration with
industry working with IBM working with
Microsoft working with a number of
industries but you know not a lot of
inhalation of my own or trying to create
something they could actually you know
change the fact that I work for somebody
so around 95 you know in our industries
go to different turns we're enjoying
this is a downturn you know you're not
feeling it as much but you know latest
is the distance in the valleys they're
about we're experienced about twelve
percent unemployment in the reality
we're probably in 15 or 18 twelve
percent of the people that are actually
claiming a paycheck because they get to
do it within a period of time so what
are these downturns but oftentimes in
downturns people tend to think about
innovation what can I do differently and
even if I'd have a job then take risks
and how do you how do you move move
beyond that so in that time I got the
opportunity to to leave to leave Apple
and there were a couple of guys they
said hey we got some technology from
Apple let's go build build this company
so we I work with him for about eight
nine months in great experience learn a
lot about myself because sometimes when
we're in a big company like app or
Google Microsoft whatever it is
sometimes we wonder if people want to
talk to us because we're in Google we're
in our poem Microsoft when you're
outside do people even care so you need
to believe you you need to build your
own confidence that the reason you are
here is because you're good and it's
what you you know what you do and
eventually when you get out is the proof
is in the pudding when you're by
yourself without that infrastructure
that you already enjoy you know you'll
figure out and you learn a lot of lot of
things about yourself I learn a lot when
I left Apple that i could sell I could
get people to to part with their money
because like in any startup besides
getting capital from venture capitalists
you want to sell your idea you want to
sell the product and you want companies
to be able to give you money for what
you do that's the biggest test with it
what you're doing as value or not so it
was a great experience but he lasted she
was it was short sure sure live because
you know this is the power of culture
and I don't know in your case but for me
it's very important to work with people
I respect and I enjoy working with well
it was a great innovative place I didn't
necessarily agree how the company was
being run right you give choice to
people people can work hard but you
don't tell them you need to come back
there are people with with children and
we wanted to work until 12 one o'clock
in the morning it's okay you want to do
it but forcing people to do that it
wasn't the right thing so I said you
know I will move on so the best way I
could do was we went back to my former
boss at Apple who kind of warm is this
you are going to a space and I going
we're a group of people them you may not
necessarily want to one of you so she
ate it with but I didn't see it but he
kind of warned me but he became the CIO
cisco and in cisco he had a lot of
workers when cisco was a small company
this is circa nineteen ninety-five yeah
95 96 in cisco was just starting in
spending a lot of money so he gave me a
consulting job so this is the topic of
innovation so where do you find
innovation to happen right you know
either you do it you know you come from
research institutions and there's new
innovation that is happening in green
tech and putting silicone into batteries
so they can last longer or looking at
different ways you have to do different
cogeneration it's
error but another aspect of innovation
is when you listen to customers so in my
case we started a with my wife which was
interesting we started a consulting
business in the time which the internet
when she was taking off everybody wanted
to figure out how to do business with
internet at that time there was no
security nor infrastructure and you know
a lot of what people were asking us to
build was can you create an access
control and not access framework to
manage access to these sites so that my
suppliers can come in and in submit
orders or my the people that represent
us can did the technical support notes
to be able to support our channel and so
we started building these this V
solution for Cisco many departments at
Cisco Bay networks at the time was
required later for nortel or I call all
those became our customers but in
listening to the customer two years
after the fact we had built even
effectively what he became something
called access control with access
control it was a centralized management
of that and we said two years after that
we had had already 50 people working in
our company we said do we want to
continue to be a services company do we
want to become a product company and so
what happened at that time we say well
product companies get a better
evaluation maybe we can eventually go
public it was an interesting experience
what we said we're going to leave all
the services business all that
consulting projects and we decided to
move on and try to play the software
company luckily we had made our own
money and we invested in the business to
create the product by year later that we
have you know put the right
infrastructure to create products
product management it's not just coding
but you know you try to do you need to
bring all the commercialization aspects
from getting the product and cleaning
repeatable we actually said okay he
seems like in we sold it to 23 no
prudential job AT&amp;amp;T so big big big
customers starting to write write write
real checks for us the first our first
customer what's a university was a
brigham young university they played a
steady 70 thousand dollars for our
software but uh it was interested that
when the big corporation started coming
in then we said we need we need VC money
we need to go to venture capital we
didn't know anybody you know
you ever go in doing this path you will
know the venture capital it's just an
enabler because they give you money and
infrastructure to grow the company but
you are it's always important to get
introduced by somebody else it gives you
the not only the audience so you can
sell your idea and eventually people
could invest money so making a long
story short in 97 we raised our first
round of financing raised four and a
half million dollars it not only just
reached it from here we actually did a
lot of business in Japan actually we got
Japanese companies to invest properly
like Mitsubishi and enlarged venture
funds in Japan because he you know the
vc's here in the US wanted to for for
very little what a fifty percent of the
company has become and we already have
customers so we we decided to take the
approach of taking japanese money but
also work with some bc's here actually
eric was an investor indirectly in our
company can say the time he wasn't
novell he created a venture fund in the
well invested in our second round he
they lead that led the second round
which was the next year who were growing
really really fast so we consume the
four and a half million we raise 6
million the next year which was in 98 in
99 we raised 15 million dollars of
equity and then short of going public
we're aged 42 million dollars because at
that time to go public they was
fashionable to go and say I'm gonna give
you equity before you go publish today
when we go public then everybody makes
money it was see what's the bubble and
then short of finishing up our
investment the 42 million dollar around
we do with it in the year 2000 with
wonderful companies as investors we had
Singapore telecom we have tell you in
Sweden you had a Fuji too we had you
know a lot of companies like novell and
in others here in the US Accenture was
an investor so everybody wanted to get
into the action because the company was
supposed to go successful so it at that
time we were supposed to be public and
another a public humber communities
don't don't don't don't don't be public
but we want to buy the company as a
founder in SS an entrepreneur one of the
worst things you could figure out is
this is my baby I'm not going to let it
get to you but when they when they offer
some interesting returns especially to
invest
when you really invest with this gets a
little complicated because they they
give money in order to we get more money
to pay the people that give you the
money to invest so at that time while it
was an interesting decision it was a
great transaction for everybody you know
we sold a company for a billion dollars
in in April of 2004 life didn't
necessarily left the company decided to
stay in and tried to help the combined
company to do that it was interesting
the bubble the market crash eventually
had to work with with a combined company
ended up running the combined company
for a while it was a Canadian company
recruited a new CEO went back to the
board in in 2001 after a year of being
with them I left my operating role there
and became more of a director I was
recruited by a firm called warburg
pincus as an entrepreneur in residence
this is the term
entrepreneur-in-residence is somebody's
been in industry this created business
they can come in into the venture
capital group to become an advisor to to
evaluate investments and say okay you
know do you think we should be investing
here there and eventually they want the
interest you so that you can go run the
companies that they invest so what were
Pincus is a venture fund that manages
about like 35 billion dollars in the
investment so it's a big one one of the
big ones I never knew of them they
recruited me out of the blue and anyway
he started working with them I remember
really well what September first 2001
and we have big plans to consolidate the
industry aggregate create big companies
because of the ideas that we thought we
could continue to work on but 10 days
later the world changed September 11 in
the mark that the financial markets
completely crashed what we still had
money to invest you know there was a
misalignment interest of expectations
you know since the market crashed the
evaluation so public companies went down
the violations of private companies went
down so nobody wanted to invest so it
was a very tough time in our industry
like I said we have turns in downturns
but uh it turned out that with war were
we couldn't create a deal where was well
known because they created ba ba again
was another intrapreneur at three
entrepreneurs from son you know bill
it's God and Alfred Chang
dubby dubby EA and actually Warwick had
invested in them and they made multiple
billions of dollars in the return but
they wanted to repeat a b EA but it was
not that timing wasn't there right after
that I was recruited by bain capital
which is another large venture venture
firm to become executive chairman of
other companies in New York I lived in
the bay area for the last 27 years I
never moved but I started commuting back
and forth New York remotely trying to
help manage a company eventually they
can convince me to become the CEO of
this company which was in the identity
management in space and when I became
CEO which was around april 2003 of
course we needed to recruit the team
complement entrepreneurs at that time I
didn't created it was somebody else's
but I have to partner with them to make
that make it successful very interesting
experience in after two years so hard
work and labor you know Oracle came
around and says look we need these type
of technology would love to buy the
company so again I was involved in
another transaction where oracle paid a
significant amount of money and shawna
sign a nondisclosure so I cannot tell
you the price but uh it was a it was a
great transaction in that case you know
my team is stated Oracle everybody's
having pretty senior roles they're
running running significant pieces of
the company but as you see innovation
and entrepreneurship often leads to
wealth creation or you know new ideas
and and sometimes you think that's an
apron or entrepreneur you can take it
you know there's very few Google's in
the world where you can go and take take
take the bases in your vision beyond
that but a lot of times you see a lot of
thin in the news in the train news that
our companies get acquired that doesn't
mean they were not successful actually
they were very successful in because
corporate America right now because the
the market is the market valuations are
going down it's not an investment in R&amp;amp;D
it's pretty sad but we're losing our
edge in the United States because we
cater a lot of our our our financial
performance based on you know how much
profit do we make and we don't lose
money there for innovation venture
capital and all that begins to think
through that
either you become a successful company
become a public company and create a lot
more more more solutions to change the
world in a way that you did whatever
you're trying to create or a say in an
innovative small company you take it to
a certain level and there's other
companies that can take it to a
different level prices and the last
experience that I have with Oracle of
course we will continue to be successful
but within six months oracle Tuukka
businesses was less than 20 million
dollars into a two hundred million
dollars because they had the reach they
had the relationships they had you know
we would be automatically we became you
know access to all the Oracle customer
base forget it entrepreneurship value
creation has different perspectives and
there's different degrees of success you
know they as engineers we want to create
something that a lot of people use you
can save you see that I was involved
with that but at the end of they also do
this because you're you have a paycheck
you're happy you and you have a family
you have a family you want to have your
kids you want to send in college college
is expensive and so you had to have the
means in ways to be able to get to that
so there's there say there's an
interesting correlation of why you do
innovation and entrepreneurship is not
only just to create in great value by
the end of the day it's also too to
create certain level of financial
independence I wouldn't say it wealth so
that you can do more things that you
like without having to worry about the
future anyway so now you know fast
forwarding all this time I another
venture group recruited me to become a
member of their their their their staff
and now i'm looking at investments in a
number of areas clean tech mobile
computing etc so that's the context
that's why i'm here to talk to you about
it and in that context of hispanic is a
Morita from peru in like you I remember
we were very eager to figure out we look
you know how in the valley the Indian
community is very supportive of each
other they created a tie group creation
group also created that in Hispanics we
were falling behind i remember when i
was at apple we created a group was
called a ha it was
Apple Hispanic association or something
like that after i left that and have
done the first successful company i
remember that were a bunch of hispanic
intrapreneurs they wanted to come
together and try to share ideas best
practices introductions to VCS and we
decided to find a group called Hispanic
net which was say it was just a group
right now we have about three or four
thousand Hispanic engineers primarily
they're looking to getting to talk to
other people that want to be able to do
startups or do innovations and it's
actually center here in the valley after
starting that I moved on in very late as
of late I was approached by this group
called high tech which is primarily
executives in Hispanic organizations
they really wanted to say look they hear
that people talk about a glass ceiling
right you know minorities in women tend
to be never be recognized you never get
into the boardroom never get to the
executive roles and it says you know
wouldn't you be great I'm together we
have a lot of influence where I work we
have people from Procter &amp;amp; Gamble we
have people from large global goal
organization say this work let's network
together let's help each other this list
worry about professional development
executive development and how do we move
forward so all throughout talk about the
network in the concept of what you're
trying to achieve the diversity is an
edge it's not an excuse there's a lot of
a lot of I've been I never led with oh I
improving and I'm Hispanic and you need
to lend me into Stanford because there's
a quota for for diverse student never
did that I know that there's there's
chorus even in in certain businesses
even government to do business with
minority companies well that's
interesting because he gives chances to
for small business they're trying to
grow up I don't use as an excuse use it
as an advantage you know the fact a wide
diverse we see things differently we
have different cultures we bring things
that that you know sometimes being in an
environment it's you may not see it from
their point of view if you look at just
the general demographics here in the
United States the influence of it the
Hispanic population diversity is
made this value specifically what it is
diversity with some of the academia and
also the venture capital so what I'm
saying in the context of the diversity I
think is something that you should feel
very very proud of what you have in the
perspective you can bring in and but
please do not use this an excuse because
you're good enough to do it because for
the contest that you have so a long
introduction but I think I cover a lot
of the salient points for the next few
huge life will just be reinforcing the
themes so diversity is important because
you know you have a I guess you care you
bring a global perspective you but I
think one of the things about these type
of groups in general is that you know we
care about mentorship right or a
sponsorship I talked about you know
throughout my career how important the
role of a mentor is you're in different
stages of your career you may be in this
stage in which you need a nap or you
need a mentor but don't forget that when
you get to a point especially sometimes
you bring interns from colleges there
are never it never been exposed to these
these type of cultures you know try to
make an impact whether they stay here or
not oh they move on they'll remember in
mentorship is something that you could
always you know feel privileged to be
able to to receive but also something to
give so never forget who knows oh it's
the theme of giving back one of the
reasons why I decided to join high-tech
I said look I'd be willing to help you
be willing to open my network we willing
to do that and act as a mentor many of
you but don't forget to give that what
is your what is you giving back to your
community once Allah tells me that the
group you know goes out and works we
came through 12 schools and you can do a
number of different things one thing
that you should try to figure out how
you how to get you connecting with the
other groups Hispanic groups that are
within me within the Silicon Valley
which are very active and I'm sure we
can still make a difference in our
community with the contents of your
giving back because its cultural because
we care is very very important so in
summary this that's kind of the
perspective on diversity we talked about
innovation and just trying to make the
point a lot of innovation comes like
with Google different way of doing
search
and you you can figure out different
ways and you have the twenty percent of
time that allows you to think
differently and try to try to figure out
what can I do differently that people
can use it here at end of the day you
are trying to figure out if this
something that is not being done and you
can do it or is being done in a very
inefficient way most of the time
government sponsored research gets to
universities and a lot of interesting
breakthroughs come so the biggest
innovation is step forward tend to come
from research so there's no question
about it but the incremental innovation
comes from listening to customers and I
will tell you that a lot of companies
even companies like Oracle not very
innovative they ok you need to automate
that I can do that or i can buy a
company that's that but you know oracle
is doing pretty well you had companies
like Apple on the other end no it was a
grating of a lot of innovation we we hit
the wall we tank at that time but then
refocus on trying to say well the
machine is it that the ipod so
eventually you start figure wasting
which is not you know how can i do
things differently and how can i enable
new business models i think some of the
great things about the iphone is not
just the device is that is the network
the app store is the micro payments is
the the network of developers in the way
is changing in the world in the
incremental steps they go through the
operating system in the services is
making it a very unique different
platform of course you have microscopy
here as well but different wireless
platform but a hint the bottom line the
world continues to be mobile and we want
to be able to have a lot of information
to consumer so it's either research or
it comes from listening from
universities so where do i see one of
the questions that were saying before
preparing the talk says what word worse
venture capital looking for money or
where innovation is stressed is coming
or people looking for innovation i will
tell you that besides that the logical
ones you know health care because of the
Obama administration is taking a big a
big topic in our health care system
needs a major Rijo you know how
inefficient it is how much we have to
pay for a doctor is just amazing
walk into an emergency room you know by
the time you're done it's like a bill
for twenty thirty thousand dollars work
they just came in and gave you an
antibiotic or whatever bottom line is we
need to recall that right we need to do
it's not that it's innovation may have
been done in the devices but in the
cycle time of processing a patient in
the cycle time of getting the medical
records in a cycle button time that you
deal with payment processing and
insurance that's where you're gonna see
a lot of I wouldn't say breakthrough
innovation but there's going to be a lot
of step functions where the country's
gonna be able to save a lot of money in
companies I'm gonna be able to save a
lot of money so again innovations in
that it's a context of either you
something completely different out of
research out of you know academia or
something that you could actually come
out from just simple needs that didn't
require efficiency therefore expect a
lot of innovation and healthcare some of
the interesting things with healthcare
with mobility you know some of the
interesting demos that were done in the
Apple developers conference with the
iphone is the fetal monitor being
display in an iPhone because it wasn't
just the operating system but the
ability to bring the signals and create
the fully integrated environment so
again greentech I want to talk you know
that that's major focus because we need
to figure out how to how do we become
more more efficient in our use of energy
but you know in particular something
that I can talk a lot about you is
cybersecurity you know I always used to
tell people because I've been in venture
business have been building companies I
used to always go to New York because
New York had this huge concentration of
financial services telecommunications
company media companies to go sell stuff
where do I go more often than not now
I'm going to Washington DC why when you
start talking to people in NSA and the
CIA you know our country's at war many
people oftentimes we read we read the
paper and we said oh yeah we got
attacked by the Koreans and the fourth
of July
if we gonna let it be there's not a
single day the problem there not a
single hour with one of our critical
infrastructure sites or our presence in
the Internet is getting at an hour the
technology innovation that is Ben in
that in in dec in that area is good
enough to deter the attacks but they're
going to continue to come in and the
volumes are going to continue to it so
by definition there's a lot of new
thinking about how do you deal with with
with cyber terrorism and how can you
make the United States it in our allies
a way in which we can be more effective
in dealing with that so while the
context of innovation before and
security and cyber terrorism has been
more of a defensive move now we're
getting in the offensive so we're
getting a lot of vectors to determine
where the attacks are coming from and be
able to immediately respond and target
the places they're actually attacking us
therefore either you say look don't
bother me because I'm serious about not
only defending myself but I'm going to
talk to you so when you did yeah I
cannot speak can now give you a lot of
detail but the most innovative startups
that I've seen in the last six months
has been in this whole general area of
cyber security cyber warfare because it
requires our computing power a lot of
you know thinking of identity how you
deal with identity the devices they are
coming in are not the devices where the
attack is being being you know conducted
the central command of places there's a
lot of infected machines that may be
inside there's very funny things they
never get to see light but you know I
just got attacked by goldman sachs what
do you mean one of the infected machines
attack my business therefore liability
should be going with the goldman sachs
if I if I may you lost money or brought
your site down law says that you if is
something that came from going in myself
in Goma but it wasn't it's been somebody
that connected in start of the attacks
from from companies that are inside the
US but it re
did those start from different places so
if you're looking for areas where you
think would be interesting to apply a
lot of computer science you know
principles and just human-computer
interaction and just psychology that's
an area that it still is like like
gaming I would tell you cyber warfare is
probably an area that you know we will
be seeing innovation for the next you
know many years to come because it's a
complex problem it's a real problem
government is spending a lot of money
and not only a lot of money in academia
but trying to enable startups in the
area because what we have is good enough
to defend not not to not to be offensive
into the turret so and of course the
other innovations that come in is not
know if not all from technology but you
know how you delivered it people talk
about South cloud you know you guys
deliver a lot of it that but you know
even that thinking required to do that
but it wasn't until the computing
infrastructure of the bandwidth the the
computing power the storage became cheap
that we were able to do that people were
thought about that oh yeah what was the
main framework back to the main 40
there's a centralized place somewhere in
the power do you know that but again
it's how all these different innovations
come together to enable different models
of computing the United a 10 different
models of consuming information
different models of of selling that or
buying that type of thing no that's why
you hear a lot about SAS a lot of a lot
of focus on cloud computing
infrastructure and this is today is
probably that one of the cheapest times
to start a company because you can sign
up with Amazon and you can have a full
computing environment for what a
thousand dollars a month two thousand
dollars a month which before a computer
would it cost you that because they only
charge you on the usage of the time in
the the users of the story so I think
it's you see that innovation again
that's necessarily just come from
research and ideas but even business
models and delivery delivery mechanisms
so a little bit about venture capital
we're in a very interesting timing
our industry it's a tough time because
in an essence venture capital is an
agent so people want to give money to a
group of people to invest in those
groups are core venture partnerships but
the people that put the money they
expect the money in return we like we
know you put it in a bank you get up a
certain interest respected but in
venture capital was always the idea of
saying can you identify the next Google
so that we can get the returns because
the capital markets had kind of imploded
the valuation of companies have gone
down significantly venture capital lives
and is it is and it's successful when
they produce returns to the investors
into the venture groups in of course how
do you make that money when a company
either goes public there's liquidity and
the funds that you actually the you
actually invested or when you read the
company gets acquired so I think where
we're going to see a major shake-up in
our in our industry I would predict it
probably thirty percent of venture firms
will not exist in the next 18 months or
so and the reason being is that the
limited partners which are the investors
in venture groups are basically saying
well I haven't received any money and
it's been ten years as I give you that
money is not a liquid investment instead
I can I have different asset classes for
those of you in finance you can invest
in different things to diversify your
portfolio in venture is not such an
attractive place right now but you know
again we live in in cycles and I think
there will be an interesting time for
the venture capital community again and
so what why is so unique about venture
oftentimes you get people with operating
backgrounds like myself they start you
know listen to some of your ideas and we
like that it would take the risk and
let's go build the company and besides
the money what we'd bring is a number of
relationships and other people that we
know or I need somebody as good at that
of you see if you if you like each other
etc and helping build a team etc so
that's the role of venture capital and I
think we're very fortunate especially
here in Silicon Valley because we live
in a very
place in the world because many places
have been trying to replicate this model
like I said at the beginning and they
have not been successful governments
have been very aggressive and putting
programs money people hire advice or
assistance it hasn't been successful the
magic here is I guess people are willing
to take risks they work in big companies
they grow up they they tend to this is
the next stage of learning beyond
academia and eventually you decide to
take your own risks and decide to go
move on and create that so I think is
the ecosystem that we build not only
with money entrepreneurship the culture
and I think the just a general
infrastructure about even the lawyers
the accountants they do understand how
to structure this type of company so
then when if when and if they get to a
public stage there there's certain
return so it's pretty unique and you
know I know next next talk here in the
in this series will be you'll be talking
to Jorge zavala in the front he
represents tech PA which is a technology
business accelerator the government of
Mexico has invested a lot of money it's
time to invest on the startups in Mexico
to try to access the the US market but
you don't have that bridge it can take
you there so innovation is happening the
problem is how can I create that same
infrastructure she's in the valley so
that these companies get to access
different not only the markets but grow
to a point in which they can go public
or they can get acquired cetera so
you'll get to see and I'm sure what he
will give you a lot of detail and so in
that context I don't think that this is
something that is gonna be that
important unless you start deciding to
to start your own company but in the
diagram we have the typically typical
sources of funds venture capital is not
often the first place you start maybe
almost the last one at the beginning is
an idea you invest your own capital you
start your idea and eventually once you
get that you start with the founders the
friends and family friends and families
in fool's is the 3 f's usually tend to
veteran
on you and then after you get that
proven there's an angel network and
again this is another one of those
things about the value that is so unique
we have a very active angel network I'm
an active angel and when I see
entrepreneurs I like something I tend to
give money early on and the eventual
venture capital comes in in some of them
i will tell you that majority don't go
anywhere but there's two or three they
make it through and and and it makes it
worth it this is the matter and then
after the angel or the early stage we
see comes a traditional venture capital
group they're basically is the one that
has more formal normalization or so just
to give you a perspective and then
there's private equity which we won't
talk about it north of distance let's
move on a little bit about emerging
markets because I know this was a topic
that people were very interested in so
we don't want in sometimes being in the
valley is good and bad because we think
we aren't although we don't innovation
just because of different dynamics it's
created just because we'll be in there
when you look at innovation first and in
the mobile environment you just need to
go to the Nordic countries just to go to
Korea you go to Japan you go to China
yes because the infrastructure there is
newer within the legacy of the United
States their leaps and bounds beyond
beyond where you know Skype came out of
the Nordics right there's a lot of
technology they were you see different
pockets of areas in the world just
because of the fact that they live where
they live in the infrastructure is
different innovation is coming through
so you know I think you know answer your
interest there's pockets in the world
where you will see innovation coming
through right now a lot of the urban
design innovation which I don't know how
much you love architecture in new
communities in plant communities both
India and China are the government's are
Indian China are creating these
communities I was with the group at
cisco a couple weeks ago and they are
building these communities of the future
where the whole place
is an automatic place everything is
network everything is controlled by by
computers and and this is a model design
besides green technology besides
measuring that consumption besides
turning on all your digital media etc
from just the computing power and the
bill to access information they're
trying to do it is scale so they're
creating very aesthetic architecture a
very pleasing environments often outside
the main the main urban areas but I
would say that you know you should just
go to some of the communities of the
future this is chris building i know
there's some some projects as well where
Google is involved but I urban
innovation is happening just because of
necessity because they have the the
density of population the fact that the
middle class is growing in India and in
China where you can actually begin this
wealth therefore we can get it to that
but instead of just trying to do it one
at a time why don't you wondered whether
why doesn't the government partner with
technology businesses to change the way
we should be living yes but not because
these building X is it that way and we
retrofitted and put the panels and on
top is there a different way where were
you just build in everything is already
insulated as the right consumption it
could be measured to be different things
so again think through that innovation
is can come from anywhere and in based
on your interests tried to figure out
what it is you can deal with now is
specifically in the context for Latin
America because some of you come from
from from from the environment you know
it's interesting because I've been
personally involved with several of the
initiatives that have been several
countries have been trying to foster
innovation I would give you the cold
chili she'll it's been a very
progressive country and because they had
the wealth with the copper they put a
tax of every every ounce of copper than
a soul and they created an Innovation
Fund a venture fund it was about a two
hundred million dollars to invest in
companies in Chile unfortunately chilis
you know small country doesn't have a
lot of you know maybe a schooling they
make a big big effort to come to that to
the valley
every year they talk to different people
but you can see how government is
proactively trying to create innovation
but it's not just the money people say
oh so we just need to get venture
capital somebody has ventured abroad to
bring it into Chile it's beyond that is
that the academia is the the thinking
the business environment that will allow
you to do that so they still pretty
active try to move forward one of the
places where I was blown away in terms
of innovation in the role of government
what's a very small country in that
America for your way your way has three
million people total in the country
there are three main industries they
deal with forestry because they have a
lot of wood they have a lot of horses in
and there's the second one and the third
one is technology in in their centers
there where they do a lot of development
for wireless applications or mobile
applications a lot of work focus with
Microsoft was invited by the president
of your way was Oracle Cisco IBM where
were three or four speakers there and it
was interesting how government was
taking a very proactive way of creating
an industry to help the country is a
small country three million people but
you could see the technology business
accelerators the different places were
you know you could great and they
created some innovative innovative
companies some of them have been blood
or or or they try to get to the markets
Argentina has done a lot of working in
call centers and you know there's a lot
of people are moving because there's
that the talin X is there but at the
same time it's it's it's just a role of
governor to be able to do that I will
tell you that even the government in
Singapore offers you today even if you
even to you and me if we decide to put a
center in Singapore they will pay for
fifty percent of all the developers and
you tell them which which kind of
developer the unity if they don't have
it in the country they'll recruit it
from anywhere in the world and they'll
do that for the first two years why
because they want to bring innovation
into Singapore the government is very
very proactive to be able to do that I
guess that the the message here is a lot
of innovation happens outside the United
States people want to come to the United
States because we're pretty much the
largest IT market sumers of Technology
the second largest
market of consumer of technologies Japan
we always think of Japan as a little
island second largest aggregate IT
market consumer is Japan even though
they've been going through certain you
know flatten of their market Japan as in
a great purchase is second only to the
United States things are changing china
is beginning to evolve and consume a lot
of Technology India's coming through but
you don't always think through the g7 g8
or we think or Europe is the secondary
market what do you mean Europe Bureau
business in a loose lucy couple
association of multiple countries none
of them having that the power of
purchase the US Japan and now India and
China are coming in very fast to be in
consumer for this all the time when you
also create innovation in the field who
ain't going to sell these two and which
are the most important markets to be
able to deal with again think through
where the innovation can come from in
the role of government to to encourage
innovation I think that's the last slide
that I had so I kind of ramble through a
lot of topics because there was no
general theme but I think if there's a I
guess thoughts on departing toss this is
we're really lucky you know we live in
the valley Google you should be working
right now you're talking I will tell you
a little bit of your life story but I
also tell you that is possible you know
you know companies like Google are
created a company like Google often
exception out of the rule but it's not
impossible it's because the
environmentally you live and a lot of it
is taking the risk take the risk there's
an especially here there's there's an
environment where rewards the fact that
innovation is it something that we want
to live and try to take the United
States or just in general to the next to
the next level because most of the
innovation came from from people that
came in to study and decided to stay
here so i think it's risk-taking the
fact that you are a diver we ought we
are at the diverse is something that you
should value and encourage a network
spend that time build a network and
you just be open to to the global nature
of the opportunities that we have at
hand and I think you are in a place
where i know the company is very
supportive and has men multiple programs
for you two to gain different insights
and again your career is your
responsibility is not it's not the
company's that's something that you know
you need to to take a proactive role
look for mentors will not be the same
mentor all the time you will graduate
from mentor mentor every 2-3 years but
there are people that will make a big
impact in your life now we we have
questions with any questions
I think the question for those are you
in the phone arm is whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo do
you see be the biggest promoter of that
innovation so they did not to lose the
edge of the United States whose
responsibility that is that yeah i think
the responsibility lies everywhere of
course that the government some
proactive role but i think the
government does you know the US has a
lot of unlike many countries we have
things that you know like the internet
was part of our government research
right it was a grant that was given we
have the NSF the National Science
Foundation a lot of innovative
innovation your ceiling clean tech is
coming from the Department of a energy
etc right now because we felt that we're
falling behind all these tarps stuff and
sometimes we hear the negative things
about how Wall Street is taking these
and give you bonuses the positive part
of all these is the fact that government
is taking a proactive role to try to get
to get jobs to stay in America it
doesn't mean that everything has to be
staying here right we hopefully were the
creators the designers and you can
implement it anywhere else right because
maybe there's bigger scale and maybe
more economical ways of delivering
things but I think it's a combination of
government it's a combination of
Education then the biggest risk that we
face as a nation is our school systems
now I wouldn't say our our higher
education I will tell you is our K to 12
that area is in big big disarray this is
an area that requires more innovation
than ever and then we can make a huge
difference it will be that because you
say who's the you were if you measure
students for proficiency who you think
are the best students they score in the
world singapore singapore is number one
every year they score number one in in
math and china singapore consistently
there they don't have innovation that's
why the governor is trying to figure out
what to do
in our place we have some innovation but
you know our school system is especially
in the K to 12 environment is pretty
pretty in shambles and why you look at
every time you go to school says we
don't have money where's all the money
going he's going to the publishers
sixty-seven percent of the well the
money goes to the book publishers I
don't know if you went to school here or
not plus you know I didn't but I had
children that actually did if you go to
public school they gave it two books one
book for the work for you to stay in
that 14 home sixty-seven percent of the
budget there goes into education goes
into a book polishing you guys are
changing the world because this this
whole issue about you know books open
source big time we need it because the
moment we reduce the budget there goes
to books that money is going to be
available for more computing is it even
government even steps in I think the
ratio be in in K through 12 or computers
to kids is like one two three so were
it's not like there are no computer so
there's no internet even the government
is paying for that the big issue is you
have all that but you're our teachers
are not trained so I would tell you that
besides government and what it takes in
trying to to drive you know innovation
in the green technologies and research I
would say that I and I want to say is
government borrow and supposed to be
asked we all have to take a proactive
way in which how can we continue to to
contribute so there are a UK educational
systems become more and more effective
if you see that competition that exists
in China and India to get to the top
schools in the amount of money that the
Chinese parents and Indian parents is
spend in in tutoring so that they can
get it to the top schools it's amazing
almost thirty three percent of the
discretionary spend goes to tutoring and
they move the kids around so that they
can get to be the best tutor so that
they can get to get to the best schools
and eventually get to know it we
we're really fortunate we have a lot of
academic institutions and and they have
tremendous resources when it comes to to
to hire it but when it comes to cater 12
we're facing a big crisis and you know
we need more vocations for teachers but
again the system has to fundamentally
change just because of where the money
is going so I gave you a broad Bo answer
I think our own responsibility
government has a role but uh there's
some some fundamental things that we
need to talk before we can we can
continue to to do hnnn you know govern
the Congress right now is trying to
figure out you know there's issues about
h-1b visas all these are actually I run
around entrepreneurship and innovation
you know we you know eric is very very
active and tried to go to Congress the
same we need to get more people they're
more capable the fact that matter they
they come from different countries
that's actually makes it better make us
it makes us richer in a way but
government needs to take a brat role
does he mean it takes away about
portunities from us well I told you
don't use diversity or us an excuse
you're good you're good anywhere right
and in you need to stand by yourself
tall with the innovation that comes from
from from foreign countries but I think
there's there's a number of things that
we can practically support in and try to
give the government some of the insights
of what makes this place a unique place
that has been to have tried to be
replicated around the world but but you
know unfortunately fortunately for us
has not been successful and the other
the other environment so any other
questions so my question is
very good question so when you talk
about emerging markets in innovation
entrepreneurship you know we don't have
to go that far you know Mexico Canada or
even forward what is worth it starts
with what you think you're creating my
believe is is if your entry if you're
building so you need to recognize the
fact that there's a global market in the
fact that you start from in one place
doesn't mean that that's the place you
need to just stay if you try to build a
business that it's only going to stay
within their environment your chances
for exiting in your chances to succeed
are they become explode exponentially
less right then you won't have a lot of
assets and in there you can go to be
listed in a public market in a very
small volume of a stock market that may
not give you the returns you want but I
think in the context of emerging markets
what we're seeing in the VC communities
reading very very interested it's going
out to those markets to understand who
has who solving a global problem and to
what degree I can enable that team to to
be able to access that the global
community in certain cases countries do
not have the same even though was
complaining I'm a short moment about
h-1b visas and in other things that they
were not being as proactive etcetera in
other countries we don't have the
legislation to actually provide a tax
incentives for businesses to be created
and so some some some specific regions
are not only learning that it's not
about money it's about the role of
government is the role of how can they
provide incentives for people to take
those risks yes I remember you know when
we would have said in Peru we would have
been working for one of the probably
American companies and luckily we could
have been coming executive here or not
but there was probably the best but it
prevent from an innovation
trenary who probably would have been
building our mom-and-pop business that
it would have been a lifestyle would
make good money well but that's it right
so i think it's it's a combination of
things it's a combination of things and
i think it the successful emerging
market entrepreneur will be the one that
recognizes the world is the market is
not the market or the region where you
were building it and i think more and
more just because we're getting
interconnected and information is being
shared we'll see more more that
innovation come yeah yeah yeah so you
know there's many many examples where
you started in a specific markets and
you get to your exit locally but you
know our stock markets do a lot of dual
listings to do that and even in the u.s.
you know i will tell you like oracle
went public in japan again yeah because
they wanted to get into the japanese
market and they said yahoo did went
public in japan again there were a few
exceptions but it's not only one way was
the other so you want to access a market
you incent local investors they do that
you get listed eventually you move on
you're right so in the in the in the
context of innovation you could actually
you should shoot the world for them be
in the market and try to why not be
enlisted in the New York Stock Exchange
the Nasdaq worry for what is worth it
Canada is giving you more more
incentives on the tsx why not do that it
eventually come in to access that the
rest of the North American market yep
totally any other questions
yes
yes
it's specific it specifically in Peru no
but uh uh what's his name Jorge is gonna
tell you next time in a month from now
whenever the talk is the government make
sure he has given him money in his call
eh it's like a business accelerator they
only it's a great deal I think you pay
five thousand dollars and they give you
access to consultants they give you
access to office space internet access
they give you business plans templates
to give you everything in the idea is
that for the Mexican entrepreneur not
everybody gets there's a lot of
applicants very few get through but it's
this why incubator concept where you
begin you know launching into your
business so many governments are taking
that proactive also a way for you to
learn will be to get engaged with
involved that would love to be working
or or or talking to it Google engineer
or Google something to see how can you
collaborate you can learn from that so
it that's only one example there's
several of those that exists here in the
valley Japan has several into various
here Singapore heading the birds here in
the valley unfortunately the ones the
Peru and all still not not there yet but
there is a number of this and actually
there's a group here call it Y incubator
as well there's a number of those that
exist and not only just here in the
valley in multiple places if you are
interested give me your car I'll tried
to forward you a couple of those and I
think or it would be actually good
resource for you when it comes to figure
out how they are trying to bring
technology companies from the Mexican
marketing to the US market in and he has
to provide all that infrastructure all
the way from how do you do a business
plan how do your marketing plan how do
you recruit directors how do you sell
your stuff how do you set up a strategic
relationship so that you don't have to
be the one spending the money in selling
but another company will be the one
reseller your products etc so I think
your your talk will be something that
people would look forward to that yes
yeah just you know for Gasol is their
work is going to be with us on September
18th talking about you know Mexicans
tariffs
now take VA so thank you very much
Huerta for being here with us it was a
