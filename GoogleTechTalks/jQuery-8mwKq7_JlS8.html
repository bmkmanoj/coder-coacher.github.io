welcome to this fabulous Tech Talk by
mr. Dmitri Gaskin 12 year old Drupal
core developer what Dimitri's permission
I'm gonna pontificate a little bit about
how I actually met Dimitri so I am a
program manager for the open source team
and we run various initiatives to help
get students involved in open source
software development and we thought you
know we do this great program called
Summer of Code which focuses on
university students but why don't we try
to do something that would be
interesting for secondary school errs
right pre-university students and we did
a very small pilot and one of the
projects that we worked with was Drupal
which is a content management system and
you know they came to me they said you
know we've got this really smart kid
who'd love to be a part of the highly
open participation contest but he's
sorta too young he's 12 and the age
cutoff is 13 is there any way we can
make an exception and I went to our
lawyers since our lawyers are really
cool and I said so can we make an
exception and they went no this is one
of those times when we can't be cool so
we went ah all right what a bummer and
then all of a sudden I heard well that's
okay
Dimitri is cool with it he's just gonna
mentor other students until he's old
enough to actually participate so
without further ado I'm gonna leave you
in the hands of this gentleman mr.
Dmitri Gaskin who's gonna tell you about
jquery Dimitri hmm so first of all I
would like to thank Leslie for
introducing me I would like to thank all
you for being here um and I'd like to
thank Leslie for inviting me so now I'm
gonna talk about jQuery and jQuery
Zomato is the write less do more
JavaScript library so now a little bit
about me so I am 12 years old as Leslie
said I'm very involved in the Drupal
project Drupal is a content management
system um but it's also a content
management framework so it we focus on
being really extendable and it's I would
recommend checking it out it's really
neat unfortunately that's not what I'm
here to talk about so know a little bit
about you how many of you know and can
write JavaScript that's most of you
okay very good so I will skip the my
part about like um what javascript is so
um part of me I'm just gonna flip
through a lot of slides this is the
agenda for if we were to go over the
JavaScript basics but we're not going to
yeah that's how you deal with the race
you probably know that already that's
how you deal with objects so yeah then
there's a demo okay so here's out our
agenda for today so first I will talk
about jQuery basics and just the basic
use of jQuery then I'll talk about
plugins and advanced jQuery I'll think I
figure I'll bunch of those two together
because advanced jQuery is very fairly
short so the basic function is the
dollar sign now there are three ways you
use this you can use it with a CSS
selector any
sudo see it Oh css3 pseudo select or
anything like that
you can put some HTML in it I'm not
really gonna go over because of how much
time we have I'm not gonna go over how
we use that or you can use it with a Dom
element that's fairly simple so let me
just show off basic use of that so here
I have my list of organizations that are
involved in Summer of Code this year so
let me use a CSS selector this is a
table by the way if it doesn't look too
clear and in there's my little
JavaScript console and that's where I'm
going to be typing the JavaScript so
inside of the dollar sign function I can
pass it a parameter of a CSS selector
lets just take table whoops it would
help if I could type so there it gave me
an array with the table and I just build
this little thing that if you mouse over
this then it should highlight you can't
really see that color can you but it
highlights if you would see it would
highlight the whole table here then we
could for example let's take a table row
and this has all the table rows and
it'll as I mouse over them and I'll go
over the next one that I can take let me
just clear the screen I could take all
the all the data every single cell that
takes a while because there are
obviously a lot of those but then like
that whoops yeah so um so you can use
classes CSS like that now you can also
use like classes and IDs and stuff like
that so let's say I have a class which
is a project project
I think it's project name yeah so all
these only the first table row the ones
in this column have the class project
name and then I could do project yeah
project ideas and that's everything in
the second row
um for some reason audacity is selected
but everything in this row where it says
ideas so in that cone um call him sorry
not ro so then I could also do it by ID
so let's see my favorite Drupal Drupal
has its ID and Drupal whoops okay that
was not intended um so now you're not
gonna be able to see Drupal let's do
something like the patch
I think it's Apache Software Foundation
so that's this row that one right there
cuz I gave the whole row the ID ASF so
yeah those are some basic CSS selectors
you can do you can use css3 pseudo
selectors I'll cover that a bit later so
back to the presentation so I guess I
better cover that was pretty soon so you
can also do action so when you select
something you can do an action on
everything you selected so here's some
basic actions the first set of basic
actions I'll talk about is traversal so
how you traverse the dom so you can use
children which gets the children
children by it and then an expression so
this is um you get all the children and
you filter them out so you only have the
ones with that match this certain CSS
expression parent um this gets the
parent quite obviously parents
expression and so now I should note for
all of these if you have for example say
I selected all the table rows now this
didn't only select one thing so doing
that parent will go through each one of
them and get the parent of that one and
make it the new selection so now we have
a new selection which is all the parents
of all the table rows and this happens
to be just one thing which would be the
tea body tag so you've got parents
thought and then with the expression
that means you find all the parents that
match a certain expression so I could do
dot parents and pass in table and I
would find all parents that are a table
and they're obviously
one of those so at least in my case
there's also defined expression this is
pretty much the same as dot children
expression thought filter this filters
out everything from the current
selection only the ones that match the
expression so say I have I selected all
the table of the TDs of the table cells
and then I could filter with the class
project ideas and this would then give
me only the project idea cells filter
function so what this does this you can
pass in actually a function and you call
this you can use this and that is the
die is just one of them and so it
iterates through that function for each
one of the selected elements and then it
if that function returns true then that
that element is in the new selection if
it returns false it's not dot EQ index
that just gets the element of position
index in the current selection so say I
have selected three table rows and I
want to get the second one then I just
pass in two dot not expression get
everything that does not match this
expression so if I again if I selected
all the tables the TD cells and I did
not and then dot project ideas what that
would do is what that would do is it
would get all the ones that are not
project ideas it would get all the
project names dot add expression what
this does is it adds everything that
matches to this that matches the
expression everything not just ones that
have to do with the currents lecture
selector to the current selection dot
next so say you have the table row and
that has the idea Drupal if you do next
and it gets the next table row dot next
all the ones after the current one got
pre the previous one dot prove all the
all the previous ones don't slice that
just like slices so start and pretty
self-explanatory got siblings this is
basically like dot next all and dot
Preval in one so
then there are also some pretty special
ins n so what I call that all the I hole
all these perverse things destructive
operations because they destruct they
destroy the current selection and they
change it so but you can use dot end to
end the the current only you can use
that to go back to the last one so say
you did all table cells and then you
filtered by project ideas and then you
can do a dot end on that to go back to
all the table cells and so you could
call any of these traversal ones any
number of times and do dot and always to
reverse to the last one there's not an
self and this just selects the current
one and the previous one so let me show
those off so let's say let me take the
first one
a diem I'll call a diem dot next and
this gets the Apache Software Foundation
and if you can't see that what I'm
highlighting I'm highlighting this one
let me reload the page and see if
audacity is still selected there we go
so then there's let's get children's so
let's do a diem dot children and this
just gets all the children and there are
exactly two elements if you cannot see
then there is this one a diem that's the
project name that's the first TD and
then there's the ideas which is the
second one then we could do for example
let's get dot preet let's do dot préval
so let's see
so this gets all the ones before that
one so we could look at it and it this
is the first one second one if you can't
see I just ran my master everything from
here to here um let's clear that is this
making sense okay I'm glad okay
next manipulation this is actually doing
stuff with the things you selected so
for example say you selected a table
data and you want and you want so
currently I have it like an a href is
something like code.google.com
a link to the organization say I wanted
to change it to I don't know like foo so
I can do dot HTML Val and I I can pass
any HTML on this and it will go in
unescape now dot txt is the equivalent
but with the escaping so they do exactly
the same thing except dot text escapes
the HTML dot append content this just
append stuff to the end by the way the
these operations they do it on
everything you select it so say you
selected five table rows that if you dot
append content then it'll add content to
the end of each one of them dot append
to so what this does is it takes all of
them and it appends them to a certain
other object so say I want to append the
text ideas and that link from one
project to another projects ideas like I
have no idea where why I would do this
but I can you can also append it to a
jQuery object so you could append it and
inside that put like a jQuery selector
with some minute with some traversal
stuff dot prepend content pretty much
self-explanatory this one too does the
same thing as append and append to yeah
so dot after content this so say I have
a table I have the table selected and
then I do dot after this we'll put it
actually after the table tag instead of
at the bottom of the table tag right
before the closing one dot before or
same thing wrap this this wraps it with
the with some HTML and it'll
automatically find the innermost area
for example if I have a div and
side that a span and inside that I'm a
bold then it'll wrap but then it'll
split it so div span bold put the
content here and then the end fold and
span and div dot empty this just empties
it dot remove this removes the elements
from the Dom completely not remove
expression this only removes ones that
match the expressions I've a feeling
this is deprecated because you could
just use like dot find your dot filter
with the expression and then dot remove
that so let me show those off let's see
so I'll use dot HTML so I'll take Drupal
and I'll put in dot html' Drupal is
so we go to Drupal - Apple is awesome
so now let's reload the page so that um
you can see let's use dot text and let's
do the text with the exact same thing
actually I don't think this this just
removes the HTML it doesn't escape it
but let's test out because Drupal really
is awesome no it doesn't it escapes it
so there's that let's use some of the
more complicated ones let's use Adium
dot let's just remove that table row and
it's gone um let's do wesnoth dot empty
and it's still there it's just that
there's nothing in it
let's do like I don't know maybe that's
enough for a demo but yeah it removes
the children and the children text notes
maybe we really should get two selectors
so selectors you can use pound ID a town
class element type for example table
table row this is just in case you're
not up to yours
um css3 last that first removes gets the
first so if you do table row dot first
or colon first that gets the first table
row same with last not you can put a CSS
another CSS expression nested inside
there parent-child where child is a
direct child of the parent not a distant
child um even odd contains stuff that's
empty hit invisible and then there's the
attribute and attribute is value and
attribute is not valued
sorry um let me show that off so let me
get the first table row
so this gets the first table room
let's get T body so you can also combine
these so the first table row of the T
body and this this one and then the we
can do all kinds of things like that I I
hope you know you're up to your CSS 3
because css3 is becoming more and more
prominent so that's done now I'll talk
about how to get attributes in CSS
so there's got attr that just sets the
attribute the HTML attribute name to
value name and function name and
function and whatever this function
returns and then there's like an you can
use an object so say if you want to set
multiple attributes because really
jQuery focuses not only on writing less
code and doing more but also on being a
lot faster so with something like this
you don't need to call the dot attr
function many times you can call it once
with just an object you can remove an
attribute so you can set the value on
like an input element you can do CSS you
can set the element of name to value and
again you can do it with an object of
properties you can add the class remove
the class and now I'll show that so
I'll do this let's see no teacher no
I'll do dot CSS background color so you
can either you do it like that the CSS
attributes like that or like this like
camel case if you're doing it with an
object because then you can't really
have a - and unless you have it quote
and gets all complex um really pretty
color very beautiful so that just shows
how to do that if we had an input
element I would show you how to set the
value it's really simple you just call
dot Val okay so um there are a couple of
more that I could show off if you really
wanted me to but I don't think they're
what okay let's see let's let's do CSS
with an object practice software
foundation CSS and I'll let's say
background color is green and color so
the text color will be orange well that
it would be orange but I have some a
elements the anchor elements so that
doesn't really work actually it looks a
lot better than on there and then it
does on my screen because you can't
really see the difference between the
text and the background but okay so we
could add a class if I had classes
defined I don't really define very many
classes so there's just a few more
really useful functions now all of these
return something that's that um that's
not just a jquery thing so this returns
the HTML in the current selection text
of the value if you have input elements
the attribute of name the CSS and name
the height of the current element the
width if it it returns true if it if the
elements match the expression otherwise
it returns false if it has the class and
the browser offset so like a top and
left let me show that off so let's get
the browser offs at audacity so this is
an object it'll just say object object
so let's get the left offset and so it's
270 pixels that probably looks a lot
more up there but I haven't enlarged
that offset dot top so that's the offset
function then I could do bbbc not BBB
dot dot HTML and it shows the a links
let's use dot text so we can see the
actually the escape that HTML oh I guess
here it doesn't escape it it just
removes the HTML it's consistency I'll
file about when I get home so let me
talk about a new thing now this does not
this is more complicated so this is how
you really get your code fast and and
you also get your code smaller and it's
and it looks pretty and it's because
it's readable and it's fun so you can
attach multiple functions to a single
selector so you can do CSS selector
action one dot action too and I'll talk
about why that works later um soon so
the action so say you select like a
table cell and dot action one we could
do dot HTML something dot action to is
we could do like dot CSS and set like
the background color to be purple and
then we could we could do as many of
those as we want um so let me show that
off
so let me take wesnoth wesnoth dot let's
let's set it the HTML now that won't
work because that'll not validate so not
what's not let me show off these
selector powers D first so get the first
table cell in the West snuff table row
what the heck let's just put a little TR
there okay so now let's set the HTML to
let's see what's our little Warcraft any
game that doesn't really rival this but
it's still a game so somewhat rivals
I know if you wanted like a real website
you probably wouldn't want to set the
background color to be purple but who
cares yeah so we did two things we
changed the text and we and we we we set
the background color to purple in case
you can't notice this big purple block
here it is you can do as many of those
as you want and any of the functions I
just covered I know it's probably hard
to remember all of them I wouldn't blame
you for not remembering a single one
okay so now bindings binding is is the
jQuery way of responding to user
interaction so um with Dom oh this the
classic thing you could do like a
document dot get element by ID and then
you could set dot on click equals
function but what if you want and bind
what if you want to make multiple
functions for when you click well jQuery
can solve that you can solve it even
better if I water so the basic function
you use is a CSS CSS selector bind so
you can bind it to a click and
everything that happens inside that
function right there that happens when
the user clicks dot CSS selector and you
can do pretty much any event now I'll
run through a really quick list there
are tons and tons of them and I'll tell
you where you can get a list of them in
our resources section which is at the
very end so here are some events click
mouse over Mouse out Mouse enter when
you first so this is I think a jQuery
specific event when there are a couple
of those so what you can do like TD
mouse enter this a background color is
purple and then Mouse out this
background color is white and so that's
just the first time that you enter it uh
yeah Mouse leave blur for just input
elements change again for input elements
double-click focus
keydown keyup keypress scroll resize
load and that's for example um if you're
used to setting with old-style
JavaScript for the body onload and some
is something that's exactly this
unfortunately when that happens that's
right when the page loads and the
JavaScript executes um sometimes the CSS
files haven't loaded a lot of times the
images you have any haven't loaded and
so jQuery has a specific function to
solve that which is the ready event and
so this is just like the load event
except it's when it's it's after all the
images and CSS and everything like that
have been loaded so let me show the
events off so let me let me use that
example I used before so teeny first dot
bind mouse enter function and again the
bind function is chainable so this so in
any function there there are a bunch of
functions like this where we're binding
is one of them were inside the function
you can use this and if you wrap it with
the jQuery thing then this is a Dom
element and if you wrap it with the
jQuery then that Jake horrifies the Dom
element and the Dom element happens to
be the thing that the event happened on
so it would in this case be the specific
table cell that you entered your mouse
into dot background color or CSS
background color and let's change that
to green
oh that only did the first TD so we'll
want to take the first TD of all table
rows
hello yeah so um let's just do all
tables this takes a while because there
are a ton of organizations 175
organizations got into Summer of Code
this year so yeah every time you put
your mouse in it turns green
now let's reload and so we can chain
this and bind it again to Mouse out and
so we just demonstrated chaining and
binding in one and so this dot
background color again CSS background
color yeah it would help if I knew
jQuery myself white
binding to all of these okay so when you
look when you first put your mouse in it
turns green and for some reason this
didn't work
Oh first of all it's Mouse leave and
second of all I pasted the wrong thing
so yeah mouse leave
okay now little bind to events which is
really slow okay so yeah whenever you
put your mouse over one it turns green
in case you can't see the green this is
the green
okay now effects cuz I really like them
things look pretty so here's how you add
basic effects so they're they're
basically expression dot function and so
this there's basically three ways you
can call these basic effects there's
this one and then you can say a speed
for example we have some default speeds
like slow which i think is maybe like
five seconds fast which is maybe like a
second or two or you can put your own
number in milliseconds in and speed and
call back so what callback does is a
callback is executed after the animation
is done so say you want like say you
want nested animations then you could do
expression dot the first animation and
then set a speed and do the callback
inside the callback do this as I said
this is relevant and it is relevant in
this case dot and then do another
function so here are some of the effects
shown you can show the element and this
expands like that
so vertically and horizontally hide it
like that vertically and horizontally
toggle this just if it's shown hide it
if it's hidden show it slide up don't
slide down slide toggle if it's shown
hide it if it's hidden show it fit in I
can't really demonstrate that with my
hands
fade out now you can't see them fade too
so this this fade to function this is
actually really interesting in between
the speed callback and I mean the speed
parameter and the callback parameter
there's another parameter opacity so say
you're at full opacity and you want to
go to half opacity but not all the way
to zero then you could pass in like 0.5
or something so let me show that this is
the fun part
um TD let's do like dot mouse over oh
yeah
so I forgot to tell you and I fired put
a sign for this but see the little mouse
over function um any pretty much any
event you pass in to bind it also has a
shortcut which is just that function and
you just pass the callback into it so I
can do dot by mouse over and then a
callback or I could just do da mouse
over in the callback so I could this dot
fade out and again and it'll take a
while cuz that's the bind to all of them
okay so whatever I mouse over one it'll
fade out
that's pretty fun um yeah and so you can
use these effects to do really pretty
things all this web 2.0 stuff so that
there are also advanced animations if
you really need that little extra
something so there's basically this
function animate params duration easing
callback so the params is an object of
CSS parameters you own an alter so for
example you want if you want to fade the
background to be yellow then actually
this is not going to support the
properties you can however download a
plug-in for this but say you want a fate
you want to make it animate to another
position then do dot params params so
you could pass in like position is
absolute oh no first you would do dot
CSS Plitt position:absolute and then you
do something like params is like top is
200 left is 200 and that was just
animate it to that position duration is
how long again we have our presets and
you can also pass it a number in
milliseconds by easing makes me want to
drink water using I won't really go this
this is pretty complicated but it's just
how you want to get from one place to
another so for example one easing is
linear just go like that
well or rather say um this is my zero
opacity key this is my water opacity
linear is just like that there could be
an easing for like an exponential curve
like that or like that
or there could be there's one called
bounce in so that goes all the way and
then bounces and then bounces again and
then stays then call back to you execute
this after the function is done so that
the the main easing yet you'll use is is
linear so now let me show off advanced
animations so say I want to do a
dot let me get the first a and I'll
animate well first let me set it to CSS
positioned and so since I don't want it
to lose its current position I'll set it
top is a first this element dot offset
top and left is again a first now if we
wanted to be really fast we would put
this a first in its own variable and
this offset in its own variable so we
only need to call these this is the kind
of thing that the jQuery core library
does so then we did the CSS now we'll
animate to top 500 not too much 300 left
is 300 and then duration let's make it
take four seconds and linear and when
we're done we'll do a function
yeah so now you see it travels there and
it alerts that we are done um so let me
shoot oh yeah I already showed you the
more basic functions okay so I think
that now we're gonna do Ajax so most
people like to be buzzword compliant and
of course that means using Ajax so Ajax
the basic here are some basic functions
used owed and so this basically takes
what you have in the URL and you can
pass like any data to it like get in
post data and this happens after you do
the load so what it does is it gets the
stuff at the URL with the HTTP GET and
it sticks it and what's in here the CSS
selector and then the callback is
executed after it's done and again then
this is relevant here then dot post and
you see that this right there does not
have a CSS selector and that is correct
you do not get CSS to use a CSS selector
here but here in the URL you just up
here's the URL you can post some David's
key URL and then the callback is what's
executed after and in the callback you
get a parameter which is the data you
got back I'll demonstrate this no I
won't demonstrate this but I'll doesn't
demonstrate its companion to get and
this is the same thing except it uses an
HTTP HTTP GET instead of post and
there's not Ajax and this is more
complicated
Ajax so let me talk about that so when
you pass into there is simply a list of
options and one of these options one of
these options is the data and this is
like get or post data another is type
like get or post in all caps
another is URL which is the URL you want
to get or post to
sorry um so Ajax events so when you're
doing Ajax you have certain events so
there are the global events and what
these are is you can use the CSS
selector and bind to the global Ajax
event name and you can do a functions on
that so here are a list of them
so there's Ajax start so maybe if you
had a little loading widget that pops up
that pops up whenever you're loading
something you could you could bind the
loading widget to the or the loading div
which is currently hidden to the Ajax
start function and then whenever it
starts an ajax request you can put in
the callback this dot show or something
and then Ajax said when it's sending the
data then there's Ajax success and
here's probably where you like you'd
like to hide it and then Ajax error this
happens when there's an error with the
Ajax so what you'd like to do here
probably like hide it and then somewhere
append in an h1 tag there was an error
so then the other type of Ajax events is
local so this is one of these are the
options you can pass in to Ajax they got
a checks function so before send this
happens right before you send it success
this happens when the request is
successful error this happens when there
was an error with the request and
complete when everything is complete
regardless of whether it was successful
or there was an error so let me show off
Ajax
let's let's do first the dot load so
table got parent dot load and I've set
up a handy html5 file data dot HTML and
let's pass nothing into it and let's do
the callback something like
and it would help it was split spelled
loading right downloading so here's the
contents of my data HTML and it load it
in and then it alerted that it was done
loading and this actually even returns
the div that was loaded so we can do
stuff on the stick let's try that out
table about parent dot load data HTML
that function no let's not pass all of
the parameters after the first and get
post and load are optional and I think
even the data parameter is optional so
if you pass in a function where the data
parameter should be jQuery is smart
enough to detect that it's a function
and it'll instead of saying that to the
callback and make and make there be no
data so then we can do like CSS
background color let's see what's a good
one um blue ok that didn't work and I
know why because the table is gone there
see now it's blue very pretty very hard
to read to so now let me show off some
advanced Ajax so let me just do dot Ajax
and I'll just say just for starters URL
is data dot HTML or even better what we
could do is we could load some JSON how
cool would that be so we could do
projects I set up a this same table and
in JSON JSON and so we could do URL and
we could request
I'm some JSON and we could type will be
get and the URL no I already said the
URL and so then of course we need the
success function so for the success
function we'll say some so we get the
data here so to parse the JSON we'll
just do JSON equals eval
I'm sure there's a better way to do this
this is just a quick and dirty one
so let's iterate so I made an array of
all projects and I in in there I had the
name so no so table that parent append
JSON I dot name and yep and I depend so
so it got the JSON it evaluated it and
there we go so now it appended all the
names now if we wanted to be extra fancy
we might want to add a line break so we
could actually read it there we go of
course this is from the last request now
these are from our current request so
let me show off the global events so
let's say table parent and remember how
a pen can take a jQuery object well the
cool thing is that I could and remember
how I said that I wouldn't get to the
HTML I actually will in the query
function so div and we can do loading
let me show them off my loading example
so we could do this dot CSS
position:absolute
so it's a pending this and then we'll
want hide that so now we could do
now let's bind let's say div text or
contains loading let's make sure that
works
oh well okay so let's reload actually
let's add a class to this div let's add
a horrid ID div ID is loader so now we
could do like loader make sure that
works
now there's the loader so we could do
loader dot bind Ajax start function this
show and now whenever it starts Ajax
then it'll show and again let's bite we
could chain this index success so that
let's just do simple Ajax URL is
projects dot JSON
and the loader did was right there but
if you saw it really quickly hide that
was because it ended the request and are
the Ajax success function executed okay
are there any questions on this part yes
okay yeah that's another thing we focus
on is actually a cross browser
compatibility and on pretty much all
modern browsers I think Jake works
really well oh we have lots of testers
to test that theory out that should work
yes
uh it's this left to right so it it'll
first execute the selector and then
it'll do the next one the next one and
left yeah left to right so any other
questions yes couple slides but can you
demonstrate the dot end demonstrate the
diamond yeah okay that is a very good
idea that I should
so here's also where it would be useful
so let's do a TD let's do background
color learn I keep messing this up CSS
background color green dot find a dot um
wait let's depth just the first one so
we could use dot find a dot and then we
could do something to the a tag we could
do like a CSS color red and dot n so now
it's back to the original cell and then
we can do dot H no that wouldn't work
dot append hi
so it took it took it it went from left
to right it selected it it it changed
the background color to green it got the
a it changed the color to red then it
ended that first one and it upended hi
does that make sense or does it go yeah
it goes to one previous but if you nest
them so for example if you don't do dot
find and then dot find again and then
dot end then it goes through the
previous one and if you can do dot and
again then it goes to the one to the
first one and you also you can do
something like dot find well select it
dot find something not find something
else dot end which goes back these first
find
something else dot n which goes back to
the first find again dot n which goes to
the first selection any other questions
yeah the question was can you bind as
many events as you want to and yes you
can find as many events as you can
possibly think of I think that's it for
questions are there any more ok
now on to the next session building
plugins so if you really think jQuery
should do more this part is for you
because I'm going to show you how you
can make you a crazy more um so here's
how you um here's how you build
functions plugins so a plugin is just
basically a function whoops
uh so you extend jQuery FN by I'm doing
jQuery dot F n dot my plugin is a
function and so if for those of you who
learn into the nitty-gritty of
JavaScript jQuery FN is basically an
alias to jQuery dot prototype and then
each one each plug-in returns this so
every function returns this in the
jQuery so it wraps this in the jQuery
function so that means that what it does
is essentially it returns this which has
which is a J instance of jQuery so it
has all these other things you can do to
it I does that make sense
yeah yeah you're adding new functions to
the jQuery core objects so that you can
chain them together and um jQuery unlike
most JavaScript libraries a prototype
has one object defines exactly one
object and it has all its stuff inside
that one object so then you can call
your thing dot my plugin because that
selector returns this and this is a
jQuery object which has leave my plugin
so here's the magical help or plug and
helper and I will demonstrate how to use
that so here's the typical ployment now
I actually emitted something in this so
right where's my little pointer thing
well oh yeah
so right here and right there if you're
looking on that screen there should be a
return so what that does is it returns
this dot each and dot each also returns
this so um as well what you do what that
does is basically it iterates through
all of the items of the selection and it
does and now this this this is just that
one element so now let me show it off
and for this I will just go into my text
editor so so I'm gonna go into my text
editor because I'll do be doing multiple
lines of code so this index dot PHP all
this code is fairly complicated whoops
let me bring up the size so you can see
so another thing to note that I haven't
talked about yet is when to do it so um
the onload function so what you can do
is you can do document document dot bind
ready function so here's what you do
after the Dom this is what what this is
when the Dom is initialized so you
really don't want to do any JavaScript
out of this cuz it won't have
any effect and the effect because the
brother hasn't even parsed the HTML so
that was just a quick side note and here
you see I have a dollar side of the 9000
and past function and that's just an
alias to document that ready so now
let's do decree so by the way the dollar
sign is an alias to the jQuery function
so if you want if you're feeling really
across Jake crossed JavaScript library
if you're really like want to use
multiple JavaScript libraries then
instead of using the dollar sign you can
just use jQuery and then decree and then
passed up into there so but I'm not
really feeling like that today okay so
I'm not really feeling that like that
today so I'll do this the j qf n dot my
plugin is a function return this.each
function so this is what the typical
plugin now we can do stuff with this
here so this dot CSS background color
green
and let's go back to the HTML the page
and reload it and that we can do the the
table data and we can do my plugin and
it takes a long time because we have a
lot of them and it's they're all green
and you see we returned all of these
would be from we're turning this so now
we have a full plugin that's chainable
and everything so I would I would go
into more detail about building plugins
but we were kind of constrained on the
matters of time so no advanced jQuery if
you're wondering how everything works
sorry for leaving like leaving and
hanging
I'll answer that right now so the stack
this is this is how these selectors and
the dot end function work so what this
holds all the destructive operations
like the manipulation whenever you do
one of those it it puts it it puts the
previous selection in the stack and so
it's just an array so um it just pushes
just does not push on the LI stack and
it and whenever you call what this is
actually a jQuery object and inside the
jQuery object is contained the stack and
if you go into the source code you can
see all sorts of references and utility
functions for that so the dot and what
that does is it just returns the stack
dot pop so it just pops the item off the
stack and return to that instead of
returning the the current selection next
is advanced scripting so you can use get
script what this does this is really
neat this is a function that I don't
think any other JavaScript library
provides where you can get another
script and it'll automatically load the
other JavaScript script and when and
after that's done and then it'll call
the callback and dot get JSON and
that'll get some JSON so it'll
automatically send all the request
headers properly okay and so using
jQuery with other JavaScript libraries
so well you do that is you wrap your
code in this so what this does is it has
temporary function that has the dollar
sign passed in and there's jQuery there
and what you can do is if so say you
want to name your jQuery function
something else not the dollar sight then
you can actually do like JQ equals
jQuery dot no conflict so what that does
is it removes the dollar sign and it
just makes it to Jake it makes it JQ and
you know what's even cool that you can
do is you can pass in Jake read no
conflict true and then that Jake Jake u
equals jQuery no conflict true and what
that does is that totally eliminate even
the jQuery object so the the jQuery
object is gone and all references to it
so what you can do then is you can have
multiple versions of jQuery running on
the same page and this is useful for
like speed testing and stuff so inside
there then you can do your document
ready in there and you still have access
to the dollar sign so are there any
questions yes
the question is does jQuery do unit
tests and the answer is yes jQuery has
like I forget like 1500 tests written
for it to test like every single
function multiple times and yeah we've
actually focused a lot on writing tests
any other questions
what is draw okay
that's a very good question what is
dropped so um for the Drupal project we
have an extension of G hop or however
you wish to pronounce that so what that
does is we just I'm Kelly I'm starting
something like this for jQuery in the
future whenever I get time of course I'm
over committed so whatever I get time I
will start something like this so drop
is basically we're extending you hop
we're taking little bite-sized tasks of
things week people can do and we're just
uploading them and saying hey you want
to do this as a task and then you get
points for it and we currently don't
know what the points are for but you get
recognized in the community if you do a
drop task so yeah if you if you are
feeling the Drupal awesomeness and you
want to try it out then I recommend
trying drop for getting getting your
hands wet and getting people to
recognize you
any other questions no I think that's it
so there's one last slide I would like
to share with you which is resources and
there's only one resource and this
resource is like the best resource ever
know there's to research what the other
I didn't put on it and the other is
googling for victory but I can assume
that you're you all are advanced enough
to be able to do that hmm don't answer
that no I wasn't trying to thanks for
