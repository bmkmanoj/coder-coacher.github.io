heart center in Mountain View
dr. Cesar Molina and Ashish masseur dr.
Molina is medical director of the South
Asian heart center he has a medical
degree from Yale University and
completed his medical clinical
pharmacology and cardiology training at
Stanford where he was a Robert Wood
Johnson scholar in 1990 dr. Molina
established his cardiology practice at
El Camino Hospital Ashish Mathur is the
executive director of the South Asian
heart center and is actively involved in
promoting awareness of this epidemic
within the community prior to his work
with the center Ashish worked for over
25 years in the software industry he's
been a board member entrepreneur and an
executive at many technology companies
she chose the BS in electrical
engineering from the Indian Institute of
Technology Bombay and in MS in computer
science from University of Southern
California please help me in welcoming
mr. masseur and dr. Molina who are going
to discuss and further elucidate this
apparent paradox Thank You dr. Sinclair
can you hear me okay all right and
members of the Google team who have been
kind enough to have us here to talk
about this issue just before I get
started how many of you know about the
South Asian heart center already it's a
few and have you been to the program
already or you okay so you know I as dr.
st. Clair introduced I'm not a medical
doctor but I took part at El Camino
Hospital to start this effort because I
suffered from a heart attack myself and
so since then I've been looking for ways
to prevent the second one and as part of
that search we have been able to put
together this program as a nonprofit
organization at El Camino Hospital
okay now this is work oh yeah thank you
so we've talked about the epidemic and
how severe this epidemic is in South
Asians compared to other populations
I'll give you a brief overview of what
we do at the center and how you might be
able to avail of our services there dr.
Molina will then talk about therapeutic
lifestyle changes which is what our
program is really based on and he'll
present to you kind of the evidence
behind it and then finally we will talk
about what you can do to help prevent a
heart attack and help have better heart
health so one thing that I just wanted
to point out was that South Asia
consists of the Indian subcontinent
countries like India Pakistan Bangladesh
Sri Lanka and Nepal it constitutes about
17% of the world population 2.5 million
South Asians in the US and they carry
60% of the disease burden the global
disease burden what we see is there
seemingly healthy young South Asians
present themselves with a mi or a heart
attack at early ages 50 percent of the
heart attacks occur before the age of 55
in this population and 25 percent of the
heart attacks before the age of 14 at El
Camino Hospital where I'm at when we
started looking at this issue
while only 3% of the district population
was South Asian 6% of the cases that
were reported in emergency room with
heart attacks with South Asian we did a
recent survey in 2009 and we found that
17% of the cases that were reported with
MI 41 out of 217 cases were South Asian
so that's a disproportionately large
amount of people suffering heart attacks
in the last three months I personally
know of three people within my family
and
circles that have had heart attacks and
one of them passed away as well and I
hear this constantly I'm called into
emergency when a 35 year old or 30 year
old shows up with a with an MI and they
don't know what happened and they don't
know why it happened to them
so we are looking at this very very
closely at the South Asian heart center
and some of the statistics around that
are really so severe twice the amount of
mortality compared to other populations
when you have a heart attack three times
the chance of having a secondary heart
attack four times the risk of disease
compared to general population six times
compared to the Chinese and so the
question always comes up why is there
this greater risk for heart disease and
there are really three reasons that we
can talk about the first one is that
there is early onset of the traditional
risk factors and this has been shown by
multiple studies the most famous one of
them being inter heart and dr. Molina
will take you through some of the
numbers corresponding to that diabetes
and cholesterol levels the second one is
the shortage of protective risk factors
again a thing that inter heart study
pointed out that we have a vegetarian
population that is not vegetable eating
but grain eating no fruits and
vegetables in the diet and a very
sedentary life time and the third aspect
is the genetic predisposition there are
many other risk markers and factors that
are typically not looked at that present
themselves in the South Asian population
so the South Asian heart center was
formed with the mission to reduce this
high incidence of heart disease through
a program that raises awareness through
a program that actually prevents by
valuating risks of different people and
then facilitating lifestyle changes
where and coaching them through it so we
are at El Camino Hospital which is right
here at Mountain View
and it is really the first program that
was started in the Silicon Valley to
address this need our program has some
guiding principles we usually are we
call our participants participants not
patients we are preventing them from
becoming heart patients and it's really
a three-way collaboration between you
the participant asks the South Asian Art
Center and your physician we are not a
medical facility we do not provide any
medications you have to work with your
doctor on that but we work will actively
with your doctor on that and we work on
the lifestyle aspects that can really
dramatically change your profile
specifically as it relates to nutrition
the coaching that we do to help you on
your exercise programs and stress
management so we have created a
methodology which is more comprehensive
that you might find at your physician's
office which consists of a very detailed
heart health risk assessment followed by
a physical exam and laboratory test that
includes the lipid panel which you might
get at a physician's office but also
some of the genetic factors that we have
started looking at and some of the risk
markers that are emerging as part of the
risk factors for this disease and we are
also introducing now the ability to
actually detect the disease you know we
can find risk factors but it would be
really nice to know whether you have the
disease or not and then you can start
working more aggressively on managing it
so once we are done with the assessments
we identify your level of risk and then
we start working with you on lifestyle
changes and we do that through a series
of consultations all of these that are
actually provided to you all the
consultations at no cost at the center
we go over the risks and that's a
consultation we create a plan with you
we do a nutrition consultation and maybe
one or more depending on how much in
need that you have we do an exercise
consultation and we do a stress
management consultation to kind of tell
you the total picture and how you can
benefit by getting on to the
lifestyle changes I'm sorry
this child is actually going to be
covered by doctor Molina so I'm gonna
skip it but this is what our program
looks like so there are series of
consultations like I told you the only
cost to the program is the blood tests
that we have to get you to do first and
that has been subsidized for South Asian
heart center participants so that it's
only 73 dollars out of pocket for you
the rest of the cost is borne by
insurance companies as well as the lab
provider and with that I'm going to let
dr. Molina continuous talk
so today we're talking about prevention
of cardiovascular disease can be also
said about the prevention of cancer and
the enhancement of longevity as well as
diabetes mellitus this is actually a
very important topic at least important
to us but I think it should be important
to all of us because actually health is
a vital principle of bliss so we can
have this and that but if we don't have
health we actually have have nothing you
can actually go around the world you can
run go around this country and look at
these great medical centers many other
big buildings have names of individuals
who have been very successful who have
ended up being patients there are no
longer around but there their name is
sort of graces our building so today
we'll be talking about our therapeutic
lifestyle changes TLC these are lifetime
methodology for the Prevention of
cardiovascular disease this is actually
a combination of our program the South
Asian heart center as well as the
American Heart Association if you need
to remember anything after this talk
please remember that number 12 you were
to take a quiz the number 12 is actually
a very important number because this is
how much you can add or subtract to your
life expectancy on the basis of how you
live you can actually live twelve years
less or you can enhance your longevity
by 12 years depending on how you live
and also that brings up the point about
how many nuts to eat we'll be talking
about nuts in a little while twelve
months 12 years you need a mnemonic for
that one so we are going to discuss the
possible factors responsible for the
increased risk of cardiovascular disease
among South Asians we're going to
discuss the risk factors and lifestyle
associated with successful aging and
longevity we're going to review the
American Heart Association and the South
Asian heart center PLC program we're
going to define successful aging and the
importance of daily regular routine
we're going to talk about dietary
strategies for improving cardiovascular
and overall health we are going to
discuss the role of fitness on health
and longevity we're going to define
stress and stress with option and its
health implications so we're supposed to
do this in about 40 minutes
I hope you can stay awake so I sheesh
thought showed this slide this light is
actually an interesting slide because
you ask yourself why why do South Asians
were expected to have a lower incidence
of cardiovascular disease in this
country vegetarians tend to actually
live longer than non-vegetarians both
South Asians many of them are lifelong
vegetarians to not have protective
effect from the vegetarian lifestyle and
they're actually these are sort of some
of the reasons well there is excess
burden of conventional metabolic risk
factors that is when compared to the
world population looking at individuals
having a heart attack that is in the
15,000 individuals with a heart attack
versus 15,000 individuals without a
heart attack looking throughout the
whole world actually we see that the
incidence of diabetes among South Asians
is a little higher than that of the
general population there the ratio of
LDL bad cholesterol to good cholesterol
in South Asians tends to be skewed so
there is actually a higher ratio of bad
to good cholesterol among South Asians
and they tend to have an earlier onset
of coronary artery disease by actually
by six years there's actually a shortage
of protective inherent factors for
example exercise tends not to be a
prominent component of the South Asian
lifestyle only 6% of South Asians
exercise for 21 percent of the average
population they have a grain-based
vegetarian diet that is a non vegetable
non fruit containing diet that is the
consumption of just one vegetable or
fruit per day is 26 percent in South
Asians fresh is 45 percent in the rest
of the population and they also have a
lower alcohol consumption per week is 11
one drink per week 11 percent versus 27
percent the other thing is that alcohol
seems not to be protective among South
Asians and the reason is that is thought
that the way South Asian drinks alcohol
there's more of a binge drinking rather
than a regular daily drinking and we
know that excessive one once in a while
warrior you know we can wire your drink
it's associated with increased risk of
bad things happening to you you just
have to hang around the emergency room
and a Saturday morning and you realize
that and then there are also some own
recognized risk factors now we call it
and recognize because they are usually
not measured in the typical physician
visit so what are those well there is
actually abnormalities in impaired
cholesterol transport that if your
abnormalities in the active moiety of
HDL cholesterol the good cholesterol
that takes the cholesterol out of your
blood vessels back into your circulation
and that's the HDL to be there are
elevated and this is a genetic marker of
lipoprotein little a this lipoprotein
little a is also known as the deadly
cholesterol so we know about cholesterol
LDL we know of good cholesterol HDL and
we also know about this LP little a or
deadly cholesterol
high up in little a is higher among
South Asians and also Northern Europeans
the Scots for example also have a high
risk of cardiovascular disease and they
also have a high incidence of high LP
little a levels then there are other
things like inflammatory markers
metabolic abnormalities such as
homocysteine emia and diabetes metabolic
syndrome and abnormalities in the LDL
profiles and I will just go with up very
briefly with you and this is actually
from the inter heart trial actually the
question is a what is the role of South
Asians having smaller coronary arteries
and the when we started this program
five years ago as a cardiologist naive
to this data and to the literature from
my experience in the cath lab an
interventional cardiologist I was under
the impression that South Asians had
smaller coronary arteries the fact is
South Asians do not have any smaller
coronary arteries and the general
population for the you know body size so
that actually is not
real it's not a real finding the the
issue though brings up that when South
Asian a South Asian has coronary artery
disease they tend to have diffused
diabetic looking vessels diffuse
arteriosclerosis and then you get the
impression that the copy that the
coronary arteries are smaller but that
is not the case then the other question
is well how about the consumption of
trans fats and that actually it is true
if you have brief you know if you are re
frying and refrying on the same oil as
you refried in the oil you're producing
all kinds of toxins in that oil you're
producing trans fats and they are
consumed consuming that the the fact is
that the crispier the fry carbohydrate
the more trans fat there is and in the
American bacon industry you know if you
want to make a nice crisp a flaky crust
then actually that is where the trans
fats and I'll you know Crisco and
although special you know so-called
vegetable shortening were very rich in
trans fats the highest incidence of
transplanting or food supply is actually
the stick margarine and I would advise
you to stay away from vegetarian ghee
which is high in trans fats and also
stick margarine so I'm glad you're
asking the questions because they'll
give me an excuse not to finish in 40
minutes but go ahead last question will
continue why the ratio the question is
what is this why the abnormal LDL to HDL
ratio there could be a genetic component
to that which we don't understand yet or
it also could be driven by diet the dye
being a high carbohydrate low protein
diet drives lower HDL and the higher
triglyceride levels and higher insulin
levels so those actually that the diet
may be driving that and if it is
genetically mediated this is a beautiful
example in which you can actually turn
on and turn off the gene by your
behavior
so hopefully that sort of answer your
question now going to the inter heart
trial which is sort of the basis of
many of the points have been discussed
so far you can actually see the data
here in red where South Asians tend to
be at a disadvantage higher April B to
April a one ratio that is LDL to HDL
ratio higher incidence of diabetes but
look there is a lower incidence of
hypertension there's a lower incidence
of on smoking there is actually a lower
incidence of obesity when you compare
our South Asians you know if you can
sort of you can just to go great to go
to Great America and you can see how
obese Americans tend to be now the
negatives behavioral ones there is
actually decrease in activity decreased
physical activity versus the you know
population there is half of the
consumption of fruits and vegetables
there is half or more than half a third
of the consumption of alcohol and this
actually appears to be less stress than
in the general population now we talked
a little bit about emerging or
non-conventional risk factors things
that are not usually measured at the
doctor's office and here we go to the
red and that is triglyceride levels tend
to be actually no South Asians tend to
have higher triglycerides than
consultations LDL doesn't seem to be a
problem there's no difference in the
back Palestra between other populations
and South Asians the HDL level the good
cholesterol level since not to be any
different statistically speaking between
other populations and South Asians so
what is going on well we need to look a
little deeper and you can see that the
level of the HDL to be the good
protective HDL cholesterol that 92% of
South Asians tend to have abnormal HDL
to be versus in this study population
76% had abnormal HDL to be the presence
of lipoprotein little a it tends to be
higher among South Asians that non South
Asians and homocysteine emia represented
if a poor vegetable intake actually is
twice higher in South Asians than non
South Asian so in summary we can say
that there's not an LDL problem but
there appears to be a reverse
cholesterol transport problem there
tends to be an issue with glucose
metabolism and increased risk of
diabetes and it tends to be a
genetically mediated higher level of
lipoprotein little a this is actually a
also some dominant condition we all have
helped in little a but the high levels
of LP little-a are genetically mediated
so these are actually or drivers of
recommendation these are the things that
we looked at we looked at problems of
the HDL cholesterol we look at problems
of LP little-a we look up our
normalities of glucose and insulin
metabolism we're looking at inflammation
and we also look at disorders of LDL
cholesterol and on that basis we then
give lifestyle recommendations and
suggestions to discuss with the
physician regarding our pharmacotherapy
and this is actually how we approach the
laboratory findings in the participants
that come through the South Asian heart
center not included here is our
interview and that is we do a complete
lifestyle health assessment family
history and we do some biometrics
looking at your abdominal waist your
height your weight and your blood
pressure so let's just sort of talk
about how to sort of live longer and I'm
not going to mention much about tobacco
here I'm just going to show you the real
reason why dinosaurs became extinct um
the fact is that if you smoke and you
have a family history of coronary artery
disease you decrease your longevity by
15 years so if you want to live
15 years less than your peers and you
have a family history of heart disease
the best thing to do is to start smoking
that will guarantee you that you won't
get your Social Security money back now
let's talk a little bit about successful
aging and
what do we mean by successful aging and
successful aging is actually really
important because if you're a lifer at
that when you die you don't really well
I think some people most people don't
feel it or we think we don't feel it but
the issue here is do we want to be
successful ager because a successful
agent number one has to be alive number
two has to be self-sufficient and
independent and one of the things that
the human church is the most is
self-sufficiency and autonomy when you
lose your autonomy here at work or at
home or in the nursing home that tends
to be a source of great suffering and a
great stress to the individual so in
order to maintain self-sufficiency and
autonomy it is actually a good at
actually that is what defines successful
aging so actually this study was done
here in Northern California in Alameda
County and they looked at 7,000
individuals and they followed them for
25 years so sort of interesting the
investigators had to be young so that
they could sort of take the court a 25
year course of the study and be able to
write the paper at the end which was
written in the 1980s so what they found
was that there were seven factors that
were associated with and husband of
longevity and were associated with
successful aging those seven factors are
a liquid sleep seven to eight hours per
night regular vigorous activity
maintaining recommended weight not
smoking non or moderate alcohol
consumption eating breakfast daily and
eating meals regularly and not snacking
if you think about it out of the seven
five of them have to do with your mouth
now if you are a 45 year old person and
you have three or fear of this healthy
habits you're expected to live to the
age of 67 this is in 1980 if you have
four to five habits you're expected to
live to the age of 73 if you have six to
seven of those habits you are expected
to live to the age of 78 now I told you
about the 12 year mark where there's
only 11 year difference but you
the question doesn't have the number
eleven twelve years is a good guess so
there you are that's an eleven year
difference just by adding these seven
regular routines to your life x2 your
daily living this actually has been this
Alameda seven has been replicated in
multiple studies now the question is boy
I am a you know I am at this age now I
mean middle life is there any way to go
back am i all done did I sort of like I
screw it up and I cannot enhance my
longevity well actually that question
has been asked and has been answered and
was published in 2007 can we turn back
the clock so they look at a population
of 16,000 subjects they were
representative of the American
population and they asked them they
question them about some four simple
factors the consumption of five or more
fruits and vegetables per day regular
physical activity not being obese that
is not being not having a no BMI greater
than 30 if you have a BMI of 27 your F
80 but you are not considered to be
obese and actually I am f 80 and not
having a current and not smoking
currently so unfortunately in America
and this actually has been replicated
also replicated in Europe only about
eight point four eight point five
percent of the population actually
fulfills these four simple markers or
factors so then after actually what they
did is they tried to change they tried
to convert there are other individuals
who actually were not following this
sort of four simple factors and they
were able to convert 8.4 percent so then
what happened within four years there
was a 40% reduction in overall mortality
in individuals who were able to
incorporate that is they were able to
stop smoking not become obese have
regular daily exercise and to eat fruits
and vegetables the other individuals who
were able to do that who were not doing
that before they enhance their longevity
by 40% and their cardiovascular
enhancement was about 35% in fact most
of the benefit there was a greater
benefit in the onset of cancer than in
the in cardiovascular protection now
this is actually what Hippocrates said
he said eating alone would not keep a
man well he must also exercise so we are
now going to talk a little bit about the
evidence behind the recommendations to
exercise you know you go to the doctor's
office they always say you should
exercise you should improve some wealth
well many times they don't even tell you
to eat fruits and vegetables but they
you know the usual thing is you should
have a well-balanced diet so let's look
at the data behind exercise so this
actually was the first experiment that
was done that demonstrated the health
benefit of exercise for physical
activity and this actually this
double-decker boss was the site of the
experiment this was in the United
Kingdom and it was published in 1953 it
was published in the lancet what they
did is they looked at 31,000 London
Transport workers and they actually look
at the driver versus the conductor so
this is a perfect experiment this
individuals had more or less the same
level of education live more or less in
the same neighborhoods and were more or
less the same age one drove and the
other one collected the tickets going up
and down that ladder that you cannot see
over here this is stair here but it up
and down collecting so what happened to
them in the in the green here are the
conductors this is the incidence of
coronary heart attacks versus the
drivers they actually by going by just
going up and down they decrease the risk
of a heart attack by more than 50% more
than 50% now what happens to their
longevity that is if they have a heart
attack do they tend to live longer yes
they survived the conductor's had a 50%
improvement in survival versus the
drivers this was one of the first
studies demonstrating the health benefit
the non-japanese the longevity benefit
of being physically active now this is
actually in a different population we're
sort of dropping everything over here
next thing will be my pants but this is
actually a study on seventy seventeen
thousand Harvard graduates and they were
studied for sixteen years and this was
published in the New England Journal of
Medicine in 1986 there was also a
follow-up study that was done in also in
Oakland among the the stevedores in the
in the docks in Oakland when dog workers
had to work really hard and this is what
they found
if the Harvard graduate exercise or walk
three to eight miles per per week he
reduce or she reduced his chances of
dying by fifteen percent only three to
eight miles per week one to two hours of
light-sport per week reduced the chances
of dying by twenty four percent one to
two hours of vigorous sport activity per
week reduce the chances of dying by 35
percent and the effect was most evident
over the age of sixty such that if you
are over the age of 70 and you burn
2,000 extra calories per week you
decrease your mortality by forty nine
percent right off the bat if you
actually burn 2,000 calories a week you
enhance your longevity by fifty one
percent if you are over the age of 70 so
the older you are the more benefit you
get from exercise so when you're 20
years old you're just practicing so that
you can also do it at 70 is that for me
go ahead question what can you give us
an example of a light sport and a
vigorous sport alright so actually a
vigorous sport is playing squash our
life sport is playing dolt table tennis
uh excuse me or golf check now with golf
if you walk you probably are walking
more than three miles but there you go
if you run yeah you're just actually you
know the only thing you're you know
you're getting the social experience
which is really good you're relaxing
hopefully some people have to go to see
a therapist so that I only get that you
be giving but it can be it also you get
some Sun and actually so on exposure
it's actually now we know that Sun is
good for you
so there is actually some benefit to
that I have a friend who actually had to
go to therapy for his ebdb so the
question then is how about the weekend
warrior well the weekend warrior there
is someone who just exercises on the
weekend you know the usual thing is hi
doggie I go up the PG&amp;amp;E trail once a
week they do benefit but they benefited
there are lower risk individual if there
are high risk individual then they don't
benefit in fact they put themselves at
risk when they're going up and doing
they're sort of like weekend where in
activities now how about changing that
is if you're you know if you are not fit
what happens if you become fit so this
study was done in Texas at the Cooper at
the Cooper Institute what they found was
they actually look at 10,000 men and
they brought them in and they exercised
him on a Bruce protocol and they
separated them as fit unfit unfit and
then they actually brought them back
five years later and they exercised
again and they actually found that the
people who were fit on both testing
actually had the lowest incidence of
heart attacks the people who were unfit
at both testing had the highest
incidence of heart attack but that the
individuals who actually were initially
unfit and subsequently turned and became
fit they had a significant drop in their
mortality rate and in fact from this
data they were able to calculate them
for every one minute that you increase
in your Bruce protocol exercise stress
test you enhance your longevity by
by 8% so if you actually can exercise a
minute longer on a Bruce protocol you
are actually biologically 8 percent
younger and that's actually pretty
impressive pretty great benefit in fact
the level of fitness is the most
important predictor on how well you're
going to live on how long you're going
to live you have a question this is
actually mainly for aerobic exercise now
the question is they have looked at they
have looked at other things such as
which is a better exercise aerobic
exercise weight training exercise or
stretching exercise but not in this
context it has been done in the context
of cognitive capacity and brain mass
with MRI they have been able to sort of
measure brain brain growth and of the
three exercises I aerobic exercise is
the only one associated with enhancement
of your brain mass I'm probably also a
cognitive capacity and I don't want to
insult anyone here but you know it's a
typical example is is the bouncer sort
of you know big huge bulky dumb guy at
the entrance of the bar and then
compared to this sort of like a bright
sort of marathon runner now the next
question is if you're physically active
that is good but can you actually
inhibit the benefit from being
physically active and this study
actually was done in India and what they
did actually they separated people who
were physically active but also how
different levels of sedentary activity
in this study sedentary activity was the
finest sitting in front of a TV for
three hours which in the Silicon Valley
would mean sitting in front of a
computer monitor for three hours and
what you can see here is that being
physically active and then sitting in
front or a television monitor or
computer monitor for three hours cost in
half the benefit of being physically
active you still have some great benefit
here it is being physically active and
not spending less than
ninety minutes in front of a of a TV set
and you actually have a significant
almost sixty percent drop in cardiac
events here is being sedentary and also
not and but and also exercising and you
can see how you compared to non
exerciser and being sedentary so there
is actually a you can diminish by half
being sedentary as well when you are
also being physically active so the game
plan is when you are sending an email
you send the email you stand up you go
to the person you send the email toll
and you tell them hey you know I just
send you an email go ahead how linear is
this can you sit opiod come up with a
predict you know I sort of can you put
it into a mathematical formula and the
answer is on the basis of this study
know just can't you just can't but could
you do a study probably and you can sort
of separate it further but in this study
that was not done but it does make sense
and in fact it goes back to this issue
about what do you mean by physical
activity and how is it that we should
prescribe physical activity and this
comes to this next slide and item number
one which is a lot a little bit
difficult to read says home-based
exercise is more affected than gym based
exercise programs for greater exercise
adherence and weight loss that is if
your physician or whoever or your spouse
recommends to you to be physically
active at home or at work versus someone
gives your recommendation to go to the
gym the individual who is receiving the
recommendation would be more physically
active and will lose more weight if he
enters and gets a recommendation for a
home base or work base exercise program
so you actually tend to exercise more
and you tend to lose more weight
and the more important thing is that you
know it's always it's easier to lose
weight than to keep it off and actually
individuals were prescribed an exercise
program at home or work tend to actually
be better at keeping the weight off than
either prescribed a gym based program
and now this is also another thing and
that is what to do about timing timing
of exercise and there was a study that
was just recently published they put
individuals on a high fat calorie
intensive diet and they have three
groups individuals who actually were
under control here have nice you know
burger king and that's it will follow
how much weight you gain another group
they actually said okay here is your
high fat high calorie diet let's take
you to the gym we'll have you exercise
bond will give you some carbohydrates
you know we'll sort of pump you up with
Gatorade and sugar water and stuff like
that while you exercise and the other
group they had to exercise on an empty
stomach the fact that what they found
was that individuals who exercise with
an empty stomach did not gain any weight
individuals who actually had no exercise
in their studying arm gained the most
weight but there was some weight gain of
about 1.8 kilograms in individuals who
actually went to exercise on a fed
stomach so if you're going to exercise
have a big glass of water and just you
know start you know exercise on an empty
stomach and then you have your meal the
other issue is about skipping breakfast
remember one of the first slides looking
at keeping breakfast and that is the
longer you wait to eat after you wake up
your higher the risk of gaining weight
so it appears that exercise tends
actually that dumb eating before too
long not skipping breakfast it's
associated with a decrease our risk of
obesity and then lastly and this is the
issue about fish oils the consumption of
six grams of tuna oil is associated with
an exercise program
associated with increased body mass as
compared to safflower oil so if you
actually want to take this into into
your life then you can either have fish
oil so you can actually have you can
have a some you know smoked salmon
sandwich for breakfast there is more
official in salmon sandwich for
breakfast and there is in any pill that
you can buy across more go ahead
fish oil excellent that's actually a
very good question and the question is
what is the are there any non-vegetarian
of vegetarian sources of fish oil and
there is you can actually get algae
marine algae our base fish oil you can
buy it online you can search for it
it's available on amazon.com I'm sure
you can google it and you can ingest it
that way or you can actually look at
krill oil really as a plantain so this
is you need to decide the plantain is
animal or vegetable but there you go now
this is we're running out of time but
you know I just told you that exercise
is associated with enhanced longevity
well it affects your genes this is
actually telomere length telomeres are
at the end of chromosomes and they
actually are they mark the adopt osis of
the cell as long as you have long
telomeres that cell will that will
continue to live and replicate as the
telomeres get clipped as you are not
able to maintain the telomeres and the
telomerase becomes inactive your
telomeres become smaller and then you
become older and you can then and that
sort of sort of program therefore many
organisms you look at telomere length on
heavy exercise versus very little
exercise and you can see that these
individuals tend to have longer
telomeres the same can be said about
stress in stress individuals tend to
have shorter telomeres than non stress
individuals and lastly here about
exercise
if you actually want to maintain your
cognitive capacity there's nothing worse
than you know being demented physical
activity
these are self-reported these are
individuals were not cognitively normal
at the age of 65 and who reported being
physically active three times per week
versus less time less than three times
per week and this is the onset of
dementia and there was a 38 percent
decrease risk in dementia in people who
were physically active three or more
times per week so this is there you go
not only do you live longer but and you
you know you can keep your marbles and
you know where they are any questions
regarding this go ahead yeah yeah yes
yes well you can think of it you know
you can think of mid seviche meaning
that is your your ancestors used to walk
they used to work for their food they
had probably a lower carbohydrate more
may possibly more dairy based
vegetable-based diet they were actually
maybe eating less you know fewer samosas
and there may be a lower level of stress
and you know here we go again about that
you know or behavior and particularly
with these abnormalities of diabetes HDL
to LDL ratios they actually tend to be
genetic but they can be turned on and
off by your behavior but what you eat
how you live how much you sleep your
extended family the support of your
family and that you know is unimportant
so those are very
factors the incidence of coronary heart
disease in India has changed and in
presently in India there's a big
epidemic of coronary artery disease I
wasn't there before
and in you know India is the best place
to be a busy car interventional
cardiologist I mean it's just in and out
you know now you know those hospitals
are extremely busy they account for 60%
of heart disease in the world so you can
imagine go ahead any other questions
regarding this go ahead yeah yes yes no
so we actually have develop a protocol
for coronary constant scoring and you
have to be for a male you have to be
over 40 and you have to have at least
one clinical significant clinic a
clinical factor for us to recommend a
calcium scoring for a woman we recommend
that over 45 because over 45 the age
bearing it you know that is thinking
about having a baby significantly and
the chances of getting pregnant
significantly gola down we're worried
about the use of radiation so we are
selecting individuals because there is
some radiation exposure and there is no
real safe amount of radiation in the old
days we had a image run and we could do
electron beam tomography which we use
less radiation than going to the dentist
to get some dental x-rays but
unfortunately a big company bought them
and took them out of business so they
could sell their expensive 64-slice
scanners so we don't have that available
at this time
now there's another question and the
question is about vitamin D and we
talked about going out to play golf and
being out in the Sun vitamin D is sort
of an interesting thing because those of
us who have been around for the vitamin
E story we thought that everything to be
treated with vitamin E and multiple
people took multiple vitamin E doses and
there were multiple initial studies
showing how great it was and
subsequently on multiple meta-analysis
of the data the consumption of vitamin E
in a pill form is of no bad
to anything and in fact if you're taking
cholesterol-lowering medications such as
niacin and statin the consumption of
vitamin E and vitamin C cause in half
the benefit and the reduction of
arteriosclerosis and the reduction in
cardiovascular events provided by the
pharmacotherapy
so taking antioxidants and vitamin E in
a pill form is not recommended and
individuals for taking niacin and a
statin and in fact they prolly should
not be recommended to anyone
now the story about vitamin D is sort of
interesting because we know that people
who have vitamin D levels over 30 tend
to have fewer problems and people who
have vitamin levels vitamin D levels
below 30
so there's lower incidence of heart
disease hypertension multiple sclerosis
and almost anything that we look at this
tends to be lower in people who have
hired by them Indy levels versus those
who have lower vitamin DS the question
is is it the vitamin D or is there
behavior that leads to higher vitamin D
because the studies does post but the
studies have not been done and that is
if you're outside playing tennis jogging
gardening on the weekend having some
nice you know great healthy diet that is
dairy containing then you have higher
vitamin D levels if you're eating junk
food sitting at home watching TV playing
video games or in a cubicle all day long
not taking any sun exposure you will
have lower vitamin DS and also you will
have a higher incidence of bad things
happening to you so we don't know
however if you have vitamin D levels
below 10 you actually that's the number
that is associated with increased risk
of rickets and we have had cases
described in the pediatric literature of
children with rickets in New York City
from playing video games which is more
or less like sitting in front of our
computer so if you have vitamin D levels
below 15 it is definitely recommended
that you take a vitamin D supplement and
that you get to know you know to meet
the the Sun if you have levels of
vitamin D of 29 they are presently the
Institute of Medicine suggests noir
therapy but now commonly out in the
population
anyone who the vitamin D level below 30
is recommended a vitamin D supplement
now I have found in my practice that
South Asians tend to have lower vitamin
DS than my other patients and most of
the time that I see a vitamin D level
below 10 is usually on South Asians and
there is actually in this valley there
are mainly three reasons one is the fact
that as your skin gets darker the more
sun exposure you need so it's
recommended that in the tropics the
individuals get any in the you know any
individual get 15 minutes of sun
exposure per day in this area here in
this latitude is recommended that be
doubled to 20 to 30 minutes per day but
if you are dark-skinned you need to have
more sun exposure but in this population
where most of the South Asians are
engineers or people who are working in
places like this unless you're playing
out volleyball outside during your lunch
hour there is actually less sun exposure
and then you see you know you see this
problem and it's also that the
vegetarian diet the ideal vegetarian
diet should be a dairy and nonfat dairy
based vegetarian diet high in fantastic
protein minerals and if it is actually
nonfat because milk consumption
throughout humanity's age has always
been nonfat until recently when we learn
how to bang the fat into the milk and
sell it as homogenized full flattened or
full fat milk actually that is actually
a very very good a diet is a full
complete protein and it tastes really
good
any other questions yes yes yeah there's
the question this is actually a very
good question and that is there before
we came up with this and when I went to
medical school and when any any student
goes to a medical school in any place in
the world they teach them about the
Framingham risk factor formula where you
can actually look at the harvested
individual day cabaco hypertension HDL
cholesterol presence or absence of
diabetes
and you can calculate what is the
10-year risk of having a heart attack
low risk below 10% intermediate between
10 and 20 and greater than 20 when you
look at certain populations and you
apply this formula to Japanese where the
incidence or Chinese for that matter
where the incidence of coronary artery
disease is lower the Framingham formula
will often overestimate the risk of
coronary artery disease events when you
apply that formula to South Asians we
will underestimate so we have you know
done a couple of things we actually will
either add one factor and we'll take the
LDL and subtract 30 and then use the
formula or we have not used the formula
at all and what we have elected to do
whether South Asian heart center is not
to try to predict what your 10-year risk
is we just number the number of risk
factors there more risk factors you are
you have the higher your risk and then
the fewer risk factors you have your
lower the risk and that's how we have
decided to proceed rather than to give
you a number which in fact isn't
actually not when you look at the NCP
ATP three recommendations that
incorporate the framingham factors they
actually failed to sort of predict those
were going to be having heart attacks in
almost 60% of the cases so we tend not
to use that formula on the South Asian
heart center that's over there in the
back
you know I can I can hear you but
there's a microphone right here so by
the way if you cannot find a way to
exercise you should get a dog dobe
owners tend to actually exercise more
than not dog owners it's a Canadian
study another question is what breed
well this study did not incorporate the
breed but I have been an owner of a
terrier and Terriers make your life
miserable until you take them for a walk
so I would recommend you buy a terrier
the smaller the terrier the better there
they have the highest nuisance level and
they bark like a baby you know a crying
baby and then you enhance your capacity
to exercise go ahead yeah so I guess
I'll just summarize my question do you
think doctors in the Bay Area in general
are aware of the fact that auditions are
at a greater risk of heart diseases and
should we be paying more attention
regarding what kind of which physicians
to be choose for that the question is
how about the knowledge in the
population how about the knowledge in
the medical population and there goes
the phone again the mission of the South
Asian heart center is not only to bring
awareness among South Asians but also to
educate the physicians and as a result
of that we actually had gone yearly
continuing medical education seminars to
educate physicians of the increased risk
of cardiovascular disease among the
population if you ask me overall what is
the knowledge base of the physicians in
the Bay Area
I think that he has significantly
improved over the last five years most
cardiologists are aware of this because
they see it did you see it in theirs you
don't you never forget to see when you
meet a 34 year old engineer with a
spouse and two kids in their waiting
room with a heart attack
that's unforgettable and then having to
go and tell them what's going on so
cardiologists know about it now they may
not know what the underlying factors are
and we are actually trying to sort of
bring this up
to their attention these
non-conventional risk factors but there
is an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease that is actually relatively well
known among the cardiology specialists
among others but then not so much this
actually started El Camino Hospital
because I got an ecologist who was
delivering a lot of babies a South Asian
gynecologist and you know many you know
she was seen that the Hospice of their
herd young patients were having
cardiovascular disease and they she
brought this up to her attention and
this was actually the origin of the
South Asian heart center
go ahead so the question you know the
question is actually how about
supplements and cardiovascular disease
how about supplements and longevity
there is no data showing that
supplements will enhance your longevity
or will decrease your risk for
cardiovascular disease if you think of
fish oils as a supplement there have
been actually a few trials the GC trial
for example showing that the consumption
of omega threes in individuals who have
had a heart attack of about 850
milligrams of Omega threes per day
significantly decreases the recurrence
of cardiovascular events but if you look
at changing the diet and if you look at
individuals who are prescribed a
Mediterranean type diet versus a
conventional American Heart Association
recommended diet those individuals will
have a 53% drop in the risk of
cardiovascular disease just by
incorporating a Mediterranean diet so I
would pay less attention to
over-the-counter home remedies and I
will pay more attention to what is in
front of your plate in front of you once
you sit at the table and your physical
activity you know we actually have run
out of time you know this is like it's
taking us a long time you're
welcome to stay here but the next part
of the talk was about diet on the
importance of fruit and vegetables and
then also about stress with options so
I'm just going to give you a summary and
I'm going to show you many slice about
and it's light about that maybe I will
at the end but what to do
nutritionally speaking you actually it
is recommended that you have two cups of
fresh freshly cooked vegetables per day
so who walks around with a cup nobody
knows what a cop is for the most part
but everybody has a fist so you look at
your fist and you're supposed to have
two fists of vegetables per day now our
vegetable is doing a fruit a vegetable
is a vegetable because when you ask
people how much what how many vegetables
use the old dark I eat a banana every
day that's not a vegetable that's a
fruit okay so it's important about that
so two cups of vegetables per day that
will decrease your risk of stroke by 24%
right off the bat okay now how about
fruit a cup and a half of fruit would
actually have a significant benefit in
your longevity and blood pressure okay
so it's two cups of vegetables a cup and
a half of fruit per day oily fish twice
a week if you are not vegetarian
otherwise then you can actually have the
Omega threes in another form or not have
them and then lastly you should have 12
knots per day so we're talking about
three knots
now they say how about macadamia nuts
well macadamias do not grow in a tree
they grow in a palm so that's not a tree
not so and they're very high in
saturated fat so the recommendation
would be 12 knots per day a cup and a
half of fresh fruit per day not from a
can and two cups of freshly prepared
vegetables per day exercise 10,000 steps
per day because 10,000 steps is almost
three miles per day you multiply that by
seven that's 21 miles per day because
your body your your physiology even
though we'll know if you're a sprinter
or a marathon runner you can go to the
Olympics and see the body of the
sprinter versus the body of the marathon
runner the physiology will adapt to that
kind of behavior for regarding your
cholesterol and your blood pressure and
all that your body cares about amount
not intensity so 21 miles of physical
activity per day just you know part
really far away and walk into your
office ride the bike or walk to the next
building next you know two blocks away
go up and down the stairs they all add
up and you have benefit from that and
then lastly this issue about stress and
stress reduction in the inter heart
trial there was actually the incidence
of heart attack in these young
individuals stress psychosocial stress
accounted for about 28% for the
increased risk of cardiovascular events
and the issue is what is stress well
most of the time stress is when you have
a deadline that is you have no control
so the loss of autonomy is very
stressful and self-sufficiency but
stress is defined in this in this
context as that which actually stress
resource from the inability of the
physiology to maintain a steady state or
homeostasis and I'm sure you all study
biology and you know what homeostasis is
a steady-state and psychological stress
response from the lack of creativity to
actually address a challenge so there's
a challenge and you know the way out of
it if you know the answer is not
stressful if you like if you have a
creativity
it's a joy not stressful if you lack
that creativity if you lack the
cognitive capacity you like the
intelligence or the education you then
accumulate psychosocial stress that way
and then your experiences we actually
don't have enough time to go over this
but there is a lot of beautiful data
looking at a form of yoga called
Transcendental Meditation which is in
fact associated with decreased
psychosocial and physiologic stress and
its associated high risk people with
coronary artery disease with a 43% with
auctioning heart attacks stroke and
mortality in a recent study that was
presented American Heart Association so
anyhow this is sorta like the gist of
the talk you have a question I have too
many questions so I'll hold back instead
I will ask how do we follow up with you
after this talk to ask you our questions
well it's actually the best way to do it
is you go back to your computer and you
go into South Asian heart center door
org and then there you can register for
the South Asian heart center you can
make an appointment online you can
actually have an appointment to go
through the 250 question questionnaire
that we ask then we bring you into the
South Asian heart center we don't do
some biometric measurements you get this
comprehensive test that usually cost
about a thousand dollars and you get it
for $73 then you have a chance to you
will be talking to a health educator at
a clinical educator you will be talking
to an exercise physiologist and you'll
be talking to a yoga teacher that's all
part of the program and then after that
if you are found to have multiple risk
factors all this free of charge to you
you will be assigned a heart health
coach who will be going so you'll
relieve your spouse from nagging and
this heart health coach will be helping
you to sort of fulfill the
recommendations of the traditional
recommendation stress reduction
recommendations and exercise our
recommendation so this is actually how
you do it and if you have any questions
after that then you can also ask the
health educator and she'll give me a
call send me an email and I will respond
to your question so actually the another
thing is that back there and that corner
here has actually or brochures if you
want to take one of our brochures and I
give you all this information or how to
how to reach us and how to enroll in the
South Asian heart center go ahead
they actually so the question is do you
count legumes you count the down
well you've the problem with the dal is
that if you take a quarter cup of dal
that makes super for people but you're
only having a quarter cup of dog they
distributed among four people so that is
actually why it does count some but it
actually doesn't count for all and now
someone has a question about supplements
and this issue about fenugreek and other
spices in Ayurveda which is the national
medicine of India there are actually
routines that are prescribed for the
prevention and treatment of
cardiovascular disease one of the main
texts of Ayurveda is actually is written
by Shahrukh and Shahrukh was actually
the first of Tamala gist and it's not as
direct some heeta and in his text he
says that eating vegetables that grow
from the vine is associated with
improvement in cardiovascular health so
what are those vegetables that grow from
the vine and how then do we married
science to this Charaka Samhita well we
didn't have a chance to go over the diet
part but if you invite us we'll come
back and we'll talk about that it is
recommended that you have 25 grams a day
at least 25 grams a day of soluble fiber
so where do you find soluble fiber and
vegetables well soluble fiber is found
in vegetables that grow in the vine such
as eggplant grows in the vine okra grows
in a vine are squatches they grow in a
bind you want to push it further
and think about the wine country the
fruits creates actually are also on you
know wine red wine
it's associated with increased
cardiovascular health
so you actually will find in those text
information that then you can actually
marry where the science and this is
actually as part of or a mission
statement that achieve read at the
beginning we are actually the South
Asian heart center is determined to
address this epidemic of cardiovascular
disease using a culturally appropriate
lifestyle recommendations and we
actually you can think of this as
providing evidence base are you reading
medicine recommending lifestyle which is
the cornerstone of our Veda how you
exercise how you eat you know you wear
that with the appropriate diet you don't
need that medication because food is
just like high properties food is
actually medicine any other any other
questions both thanks for coming and I
hope to see you the South Asian heart
center</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
