attorney advisor at the Federal
Communications Commission and I work in
the office of engineering and technology
the group that I work in is the policy
and rules division I personally am in
the spectrum policy branch so my day job
is working on wireless proceedings I've
done a lot of work on satellite matters
and fixed wireless issues sell things I
was a principal offer on the cognitive
radio proceeding back in the day so I am
extremely happy to be in Mountain View
today talking to people who share a
passion for technology and an interest
in how to deliver technical solutions to
people and are focusing you know their
career interest on on how to make sure
that technology is making a difference
in people's lives about 10 years ago it
was out almost 10 years to the date we
left the Bay Area and moved out to DC
and so the weather out here is much
nicer my wife is reporting than in DC so
I think I've got all kinds of happiness
levels today we're talking today about
the digital television transition though
and I think everyone has probably seen a
few of the ads on television and if you
are working at Google you probably have
access to people in your lab or
somewhere that could probably help you
connect a converter box if you're having
trouble but the focus of the talk today
is kind of a kind of a general
introduction to begin with we'll talk a
little bit about how the digital TV
transition is an opportunity for people
who are technologists to experience what
is you know non precedent and you know
100-year event in a lot of ways and
learn something about a new technology
maybe and also reach out and help people
in the community so I'd like to keep it
you know very informal and if I'm
stepping through the slides and you have
a question that relates or maybe doesn't
even directly relate don't hesitate to
raise your hand I'm happy to take
questions through the talk
but the the main point is on februari
17th across the nation all full power
television transmitters will cease
transmitting in analog ntsc and will
transmit only an atsc a digital format
and the event is remarkable I think for
a number of reasons I'm not a great
scholar of video engineering but we're
talking about technology that you know
kind of surface you know radio becomes
practical and as being you know why Lee
used kind of the beginning of the last
century through the you know 20s and 30s
a lot of engineering techniques that are
kind of with us today are kind of
formulating and coming together and then
in 1941 you have the establishment of
the NTSC standard initially you know the
the standard was a black-and-white
standard it moved to color at one point
there was some minor changes to that but
that that standard has been with us for
quite a long time and if you think about
all the things that changed you know
even since maybe we're in college or
high school in terms of technology this
event is dramatic for a lot of reasons
but here's a technology that's in on
most measurements almost in every
household throughout the United States
over-the-air viewers are of course
directly impacted by the events that
will come up next month because if they
don't have either a converter box or
have made a transition to another kind
of transmission technique another
provider their TVs will stop working and
if you think about that in terms of how
many times have you had an event that
touches every American household and is
a huge leap in technology you know this
kind of transition is a very very
exciting event for us to be
participating with and of course you
know the the transition it's going to
have some other things that will want to
talk about you know in terms of making
sure people can to make the transition
successfully and maybe a role for the
tech-savvy volunteer in that but I just
wanted to pause for a moment and you
know how this reflect a little bit about
you know how radio has come together
basically is something that started very
early with like a lot of experimenters
and hobbyists active in developing the
technologies that basically form the
basis for cell phones and Wi-Fi
technologies for the radio and other
kinds of stuff used for distributing
images and sounds everybody can have an
opportunity I think here even to get a
little bit of background on this and
participate in the event in a really
direct kind of techie way so the
transition deadline is next month the
process has been you know going on over
more than 10 years there's been a lot of
activity on the regulatory side there's
been statutory legislation and that's
what requires this change on a certain
date there's been work by broadcasters
and trade groups and volunteers
personally I've been leading a outreach
efforts in the North State area as well
as working over here in the bay area for
last several months and so you've got
FCC staffers that you know typically
myself I'd be at a desk right now
writing some kind of a rulemaking or
something like that and instead I'm out
having the opportunity to share you know
information about the DTV transition
with people over north state and all
over Northern California but these this
event with the transmitters going silent
on analog and then moving to digital
there's a lot of pieces and a lot of a
lot of things that you know can kind of
pop up as gotchas so we definitely want
to make sure that the public is aware of
what kind of problems can happen and
then make sure that there's you know
some way to make sure the transition
occurs smoothly we also want to point
out that the requirement to go silent on
analog is directed at full power
transmitters and we'll probably we can
talk a little bit more about that as the
talk goes through if you have more
questions but television transmitters
you have these gigantic towers and let's
say in the Chico reading market some of
these transmitters are putting out
150,000 kilowatts or you know they're
you know there's a lot of energy that
gets a
it emitted by these transmitters are
really big if these gigantic boilers
that you know cool cool the process and
generate RF energy but they're they're
really interesting those are the ones
that are going to be going silent on
analogue from analogue on the februari
17th but there's also a class of other
transmitters low power transmitters that
the requirement doesn't quite effect yet
translator stations in particular our
stations that are essentially
retransmitting a broadcasters signal on
usually a different channel in an area
where either because of you know
mountainous terrain conditions or
foliage or other kinds of concerns the
main transmitter isn't reaching a
particular area and then there's
basically a smaller transmit or a lower
power transmitter that are called
translators that are directed in those
areas those won't be are they're not
required to transition on the 17 so
probably over the next course of you
know six months or whoever knows those
those will probably also transition to
digital but there's also you know a
number of kind of stages that are going
through the process in the Chico area
for example in the areas up north these
are highly mountainous around Shasta if
you guys have ever been up there for
snowboarding or anything but it's a very
very beautiful country but it's very
diverse terrain up there in terms of the
mountains in the foliage and then you've
got a valley right underneath it there's
a fair number of translators up there
and so even last night an event we hear
from viewers that they were trying to
watch the Fox station they had it on the
digital 20 was cutting in and out there
having some troubles and at some point
they just stopped watching when in fact
the analog trends the translator station
is still active of course and they could
have switched to channel 38 and watched
the rest of the broadcast but of course
it was going from digital to analog and
these kind of what seemed to be kind of
simple problems when you figure them out
can be quite daunting to people
especially if you know they're not
comfortable with things like setting the
VCR to begin with of course there's a
one of the important questions that we
have is why are the full power TV
stations
transitioning from from analog to
digital the the first thing is of course
the analog spectrum and you have
spectrums if you're setting a signal
that's modulated an analog way you know
it's traveling over the airwaves if the
content signal is also something you
could compress or reorganize in such a
way that it would take up less space or
be more efficiently transmitted over the
same spectrum there's an opportunity to
gain in terms of efficiencies
engineering and technical efficiencies
so you can get more television out of a
single six megahertz channel than you
can with an analog standard so moving
from digital t from analog to digital TV
you get tremendous benefits to the
viewer in terms of the quality of the TV
the amount of programming that they
could get because again to use a
reference from the chicco writing market
the fox affiliate before you in the head
you know some stations they had a you
know their channel 30 they can now
multiplex more than one station on their
allocated frequencies and increase the
amount of television that they can
provide to consumers in addition the TV
you knows is crisper I mean the images
are sharper you know so the quality of
the content that the person actually
gets to experience can also be improved
that's a huge benefit and you know if
you if you think about it in terms of a
video format that's been around for
almost a hundred years at least
standardized you know for you know since
nineteen forty one you can can of course
you know understand how you could make a
lot of improvements updating a technical
standard from something that we had been
from the 40s to something that might be
modern that takes advantage of more
modern video compression techniques
coding gains that you can get on you
know content later even below that so
there's a lot of benefits to going from
a digital format from an analog format
to a digital format the other angle is
of course when you've provided more
opportunity for people to to be
efficient and how they're using the
access to spectrum there's an
opportunity to you know maybe
accommodate new uses there as as you
know the broadcaster could add more
channels if you've essentially increased
the overall efficiency of the system you
might also gain in terms of adding new
users or new services and of course
that's the other angle of you know one
of the benefits that we get from moving
from analog to a digital TV format of
course there's already been a number of
reallocations for Public Safety the
advanced services as they're usually
call advanced wireless services and such
like that they're used people want to
use for wireless broadband those are all
opportunities that you can kind of
explore when you when you move from the
analog to the digital format so I don't
know when I was growing up I grew up in
rural Kansas I think we were lucky to
get probably three stations and
sometimes but I remember you know the
UHF being like this expansive area and
so there's already been a lot of new
changes up there especially in the UF
bands but you know historically there's
been sharing in the VHF as well and so
this progression from one tech from one
technical approach to another brings a
lot of benefits to the system overall so
with that transition from this
historically you know robust well
explored 60-some your old standard to
the new standard of course there's there
are things that we have to address in
terms of transitioning to that that new
approach for the viewer that has an
analog television with an over-the-air
antenna if they don't get a device that
is able to demodulate the DTV signal a
new tuner in effect they won't be able
to demodulate that on their old analog
TV in most cases so their TV will stop
working which is that's bad we want to
avoid that so one way that you can avoid
that kind of a scenario is is get the TV
tuner installed and then
connected up to your existing analog
television and continue watching
television of course you know a lot of
consumers have bought new TVs any TVs
that have been sold since about two
thousand seven have required you know to
be DTV compliant talk a little bit about
the differences between HDTV and DTV but
in addition to that you know there's a
large number of TV viewers that are also
subscribe to cable or dish net I was
talking last night at an event and one
of the general managers we were
discussing you know how the DTV
transition generally it's obvious that
it'll impact a viewer that has an
over-the-air antenna and will lose
service if they don't take some kind of
action but last month on December 22nd
these three stations in chico turned off
their analog signal and went totally
digital it's remarkable in that there's
basically one market that has done that
in effect on early in advance of the
februari seventeenth required date and
so chico was really kind of a new
territory in terms of exploring a real
transition in terms of all the stations
in that city when digital they had a lot
of interesting issues pop up on the day
with the cable and the dish subscribers
as well because you know a dish net
subscriber in that area who's got a
local package and is watching the local
stations from their dish side in the
morning hours of the 23rd the folks that
essentially man the facilities that take
the over-the-air signal and convert it
and then pump it into their their front
ends had some problems getting their
boxes scanned in time so it's the same
problem that a consumer might have had
in the morning they wake up and they're
TV didn't work but this is something
that even addition at subscriber
experienced in some cases or the cable
subscribers who you know hadn't gotten
their boxes scan quite in time so it's
an event that you know it's it's got a
lot of different interesting policy
angles the technology is very very
exciting and interesting and it does in
fact impact
of people so the FCC of course is is
very active doing outreach throughout
the u.s. trying to make sure that things
go smoothly and helping out whatever way
we can so these converter boxes are a
big deal and the coupon programs which
we can talk a little bit more about here
shortly have been going on and there's a
lot of things that people can do in
their communities to kind of participate
in this transition and make a difference
with people in their communities we have
i've been organizing events over here in
the Bay Area focused on folks that are
you know more technologists oriented
folks and connecting those people up
with people who are you know in need of
help whether it's connecting boxes up or
they have questions about antennas or
they're having trouble with their
coupons program issues there's a there's
a real opportunity for people to share a
little bit expertise and make a real
difference in people's lives and I think
at the same time it's a real opportunity
for us that enjoy learning about new
technologies to step in and participate
this really unprecedented a technology
event and learn a lot about radio
spectrum myself I kind of had started in
physics and then was in a computer
science program and ended up graduating
with economics degree and then worked
you know developing software and stuff
after that over a number of years but I
was always kind of always I think a lot
of my friends may be shared little
heebie-jeebie feelings once you belong
beyond the pinouts and didn't have as
much experience with the you know
hardware oriented type stuff and
especially analog sinusoidal type signal
processing was something you just I
didn't really get into and I always
liked it when data was already in some
kind of binary you know data structure
and did not like manipulating any kind
of analog streams but having worked at
the FCC and had the opportunity to take
a lot of engineering courses that are
offered I personally found it very
exciting and interesting to have you
know been able to learn about radio on
the day job and I think this offers that
same kind of
opportunity and to plug a couple of
things that we have coming down the pike
in the next couple weeks the Oakland
technology exchange West is an
organization over in Oakland that
collects old PCs donated pcs refurbishes
them and then through an interesting
kind of training program provides those
those pcs and monitors and Printers to
folks in need and they have been
cooperating on a number of events with
us to do analog TV drops where folks can
bring in their old analog televisions
and we do kind of a triage and check
them out and then connect those TVs up
with people who might otherwise not have
a good one or they don't have a
television we've worked with the
organization called the international
refugee community which places refugees
in the bay area mostly lately uh I
understand Burmese Bhutanese and Iraqis
but say thousand or two thousand people
a year new to the area come with the IRC
and they get set up and acclimated to to
life life in the bay and so we've had an
opportunity to kind of identify people
in the community that could benefit from
having you know this TV and places that
we could basically provide support and
getting it to them now from a reuse
versus recycle angle obviously there's
their state law prohibiting people from
just chunking their TVs and up in chico
and reading we had official from the cal
state government at an event i did in
december talking about the costs to the
state for for going out into the
mountains and picking up tvs that people
have ditched out in the middle of shasta
somewhere that kind of thing of course
is illegal obviously in something that I
think you know if you're someone that
has you know access to two friends and
folks that would feel comfortable
fidgeting you know installing operating
systems and fixing things for computers
this is another event where you've got a
TV angle that you can help people with
and we've organized a couple events on
that we're part we're putting together a
workshop
probably we're going to do it on
februari 14th at this otx place in
oakland but probably maybe trying to set
up some other areas in the peninsula
where we could get together and learn
how to make antennas and so just a maybe
to go to the next slide if you think
about the TV spectrum over here you know
channels one through six usually kind of
thought of is the lower VHF if you think
about 44 megahertz a one-week that's
from a from a radio kind of engineering
perspective it's really different than
somewhere up here with 800 megahertz and
if you've had any exposure to how
antennas work the electromagnetic energy
that's passing through the air obviously
molecules absorb it the power degrades
that kind of a observable you know pace
you have these lost models that you have
and the physical way you put those
antennas together is there's a lot of
art / science i think in antenna theory
and i'm not sure to talk necessarily
about the details of that but it's a
very interesting opportunity to look at
how you've got different spectrum bands
that have different you know propagation
characteristics and they're actually
something that's in everyone's home and
there's a lot of people you know we just
talked about folks that might need a TV
in a converter box to get kind of setup
and transitioning through the DTV
transition here's an opportunity to go
and maybe do an event and make an
antenna and give it to somebody who
might really really appreciate that and
the other thing I think we're seeing
some synergy with is places like makers
faire makers media up in sebastopol
everybody's I had I should have brought
my set och book up because I met with
Dale Dougherty the other day who's now
the director for for the makers media
side stuff up there there's a lot of
people now I think that are getting a
very very interesting you know
activities together in making things you
know and there's a lot of different
avenues and and projects that people
could be involved in
but certainly I think there's a lot of
stuff in this DTV thing that you could
do and learn something about radio and
also be you know doing something
practical learning helping people out in
the community so we've had a lot of
interest from from Make Magazine makers
that kind of area obviously PBS has us
you know basically has a new station
create that is focused on you know neat
little do-it-yourself projects that you
can do in your back room and my son
recently made a trebuchet that launched
his Star Wars figure through one of our
windows so I think for now kinetic
energy I think we're going to pull back
a little bit on that one and we'll see
what we can do with like electromagnetic
energy for a while but here's you know
something you could have a nice talk
with you know folks if your Boy Scout
leader or you know if you if you're
working with you know people locally on
stuff it's a real opportunity for
someone you get a practical view of
something that's extremely complex
antenna theory and and and have a real
angle that you can deliver on so you
know just looking at the different bands
and thinking about you know what the
propagation characteristics might be for
you know VHF as opposed to uhf think
about how you could twit various antenna
designs how you could have for example
in the chicos scenario a group of
stations there you know located way way
up north and then another group of
stations that are clustered on a
different mountain you know basically
geographic separation when groups are in
the UHF and the others and the VHF a lot
of folks up in chico writing are saying
well I'd like to have a VHF antenna
pointed at shasta bali where the ABC
affiliate the PBS affiliate are and a
different antenna a uhf antenna pointed
at cohasset where the CBS and NBC and
the fox affiliate are it's a practical
concern people in chico right now are
having trouble some of them getting the
PBS or that maybe the ABC affiliate in
some parts of the southern area pointing
you know their antennas in certain ways
up towards reading and at the same time
the writing folks if they could get an
antenna and point it out
the cohasset they might be able to
improve their reception you know if
you're sitting down watching you know I
don't know 24 is not on I guess but you
know your TV show and it's cutting out a
little bit and you can make a minor
change to how your antennas pointed or
made and improve your reception that
might be a neat opportunity for somebody
that would go in there and really enjoy
learning about maybe the problem in and
fixing and finding a solution for
someone their small-scale in some cases
but you know we've got events that you
know hold in several hundred people so
here's a practical scenario where
somebody could go in and let's say make
a VHF antenna a uhf antenna put them on
a pole run your pigtails down and then
have a essentially a combining element
that you could make also and take the
signals together of course you can buy
this stuff at Radio Shack but again it's
an opportunity to to get a soldering
iron out play around with you know what
the differences are for propagation how
the lengths of different components of
the antenna can affect reception in
certain areas the properties of
different materials so I think there's a
lot of things that you could you can you
can learn about and especially for folks
that come from or computer science
background who didn't have you know EE
labs and things like that for me I think
it's got a lot of a lot of draw to be
able to experience that kind of thing
maybe in your 20s or 30s now and also of
course you're helping somebody along the
way so that's kind of the the
engineering discussion I think how a lot
of people are kind of getting involved
right now and kind of my pitch for folks
to start getting maybe some think some
thoughts together about stuff we could
do over here in the peninsula the
converter box program which I I'm sure
people have heard some about this is a
program that's basically administered by
the Department of Commerce and the idea
here is you sign up for a coupon and
there's web-based signs that you know
ways to sign up over the web or over
your home phone you can mail forms and
what have you
and you get up to two coupons per
household and they're good for forty
dollars towards the block the purchase
of one of these converter boxes
typically these costs you know depending
on the retailer and you know what kind
of a special to running forty dollar
seventy dollars something in that range
and even something as simple as signing
up for the coupons we've experienced a
lot of response from just having
somebody there you know walk somebody
through the web interface well it says
that I can't get it because i'm at a p.o
box no no no it says click here if you
are at a p.o box to certify your address
and then just click and then it says
certify and then you're fine but
something like that you know is can
sometimes be daunting to somebody that's
not familiar with web interfaces and if
they're a senior working you know and
maybe alone they don't have somebody to
call upon that can that can be an event
where somebody could make a difference
even signing up for a coupon so we've
had a lot of response from events that
you know someone will come in and
they'll do the coupon sign up they'll do
some other kinds of things like the
recycling kind of things they'll do a
demonstration of the converter boxes or
help walk with you know walk through
some questions people have with with
those kinds of things and those kinds of
events are pretty easy to pull together
and especially if you're just in the
neighborhood and you know folks in the
neighborhood maybe might might need
somebody to help them hold out and give
them a little hand-holding this is a
great opportunity to kind of make a
difference I don't know how many times
everybody's had a neighbor come by and
say please fix my internet but these
kinds of things come up and definitely
the DTV transition is offering a lot of
opportunities to go over and fix
people's DTV I think the converter box
program of course there's been an
announcement from NTIA about exhaustion
but I think we're I'm still trying to
get people to sign up for the coupons
they'll be on a waiting list at this
point and I don't have a lot of
information outside of that but forty
dollars for somebody who's on a fixed
income or otherwise maybe doesn't have
the same flexibility wouldn't go out and
just buy a box it makes a difference in
their purchase patterns so we definitely
want to encourage folks to
for the coupons early we're kind of down
to the wire with basically being out a
month away but if you do do an event do
try to assign people up for the coupons
some of the real common questions we get
with with the DTV converter box things
these are again consumer devices that
that the average you know my mom and dad
and still call me up now my dad's been
calling me for a week Jim I can't get my
converter box to work so I'll take care
of California dad and then I'll fly over
to Kansas City after that and fix the
box why my brother can't just go over
and do it yet but I'm working on him
right now but a lot of a lot of times
you know there's you know you've got RCA
jacks in the back and then the coaxial
cables so that it's not especially
complicated and usually it's something
that's easily resolved but you do have a
fair number of questions about just
connecting things in the right ports and
then getting the television tuned to the
right station another thing that's real
common you know of course impacted even
a the providers side is rescanning boxes
now this is usually described as the
virtual channel scenario and I should go
back to my slide with our megahertz to
channel discussion but when the full
power stations started transmitting in
digital usually they were provided a
channel up in the UHF somewhere that
they could transmit in digital a lot of
stations you know we're you know in the
cheek or for example have been
transmitting at their full power
basically for you know two years or more
and then some stations have often to
keep their branding and their
association with the lower VHF and ship
or the VHF and move back down
essentially from there their digital
channel which usually people are
describing is kind of a virtual channel
down to their VHF channel because that
up until the 17th basically they've got
their analog channel that they're
they're transmitting on and then they
also would have maybe this this D TV
channel that they have up in the UHF so
it presents a scenario where the
consumers got his box he's got it set up
it's working and then there's a channel
change and for somebody that's having
trouble maybe even connecting the box
it's a common problem that we have with
people just get telling the box to
rescan and essentially update its
channel list and again you know there's
a variety implementations for the boxes
and some other problems we've seen or
when this was just discussed last night
some of the bot the boxes will
essentially cash the channels all the
channel jump lists and it's hard x it
doesn't expunge when the auto scan so
you physically had to go in and delete
the channel all the channel selections
before you could get it to auto scan
correctly I don't think I don't know if
that's a real common problem that was
one that was voiced last night so
there's these kind of really you know
quirky problems that you have with all
kinds of technology events but this is
something that's impacting almost every
household and so the virtual channel
scenario again is interesting from the
from the engineering perspective because
then we had a lot of feedback from the
Chico station managers in particular in
their engineering staff saying we love
UHF and UHF historically may not have
been the most popular bands because
initially the technology wasn't there
there's a lot of development you know
that's I don't maybe 20 30 years ago and
today there's a lot of activity in the
UHF bands in television and so the
station manager for the fox affiliate in
in chico for example every event we have
now he's raving about UHF and how
everyone should be in uhf for DTV but
again you know you know for a station
that's you know abc7 or they have a lot
of branding you know there's of course
you know equipment issues and things
like that people are still moving down
to the VHF party
well and again just to give a little bit
of the propagation background lower
frequencies generally carry farther at
the same power so there are some
engineering advantages to having a lower
frequency or historically that was one
of the assumptions about the VHF was
that you could have less power and you
could propagate farther and so one
concern people have you know if they're
spending twenty thousand dollars a month
on electricity maybe the VHF was a
better better scenario what I what we've
heard in terms of feedback from those
stations and I'm not I wouldn't say
that's necessarily a general view or I
can't really represent anything outside
just reporting what he said at every
event now but when you're talking about
these radio propagation concerns the the
wavelength of the band of this of this
electromagnetic energy its propagated
correlates closely to the antenna size
and also how the the the hardware is
manufactured and what kind of
requirements you have on a hardware side
to give a you know it kind of a little
bit off topic but a comparison for Wi-Fi
which we're probably more familiar with
and the 2.4 gigahertz the wavelength for
those waves is about 13 and a half
centimeters so usually if you look at
antennas or things like that if you're
looking on the web and saying I want to
you know make a little you know little
aluminum foil covered cardboard box
essentially to redirect energy from my
Wi-Fi box so I can put it in my basement
those kinds of things if you look at
them closely are very core they're
highly correlated to this wavelength
issue and so in terms of the and again
this is kind of basic stuff that you
kind of learn when you kind of get into
the radio course but the number of
wavelengths and things like that coming
to a lot of the antenna analysis and
propagation issues so from his
perspective even though you've you know
theoretically still you know you have to
use me a more power maybe the VHF is
he's he would say was noisier for his
for his station and the equipment that
he bought at the UHF was
smaller so I was looking at some
pictures of their transmitters any of
these big coolers chillers for process
that generates the RF energy the ones
for the VHF er I think there were a
little bigger than a large water heater
and then the ones for the UHF were
considerably smaller maybe the size of
like a dishwasher so that's interesting
you know if you think about like
colocation space or anything like that
you've got a huge facility that's full
of these giant refrigerators and you can
shrink that size down maybe there's
interesting business considerations that
they may die I can't really speak to it
outside of just reporting what he said
the other thing that I think is
interesting that they talked about was
you know again the antenna issue the VHF
especially if it's lower VHF you're
talking you know some cases what 60 60
some megahertz compared to 600 the size
of the antennas is going to be larger
because there's a relationship again
between the size of the antenna how much
energy is needed to kind of propagate
through that antenna and you know if you
have a small if you've got a higher
frequency you're going to have smaller
antenna so if you go out into these
towers shasta bali for example or
cohasset or close to these national
parks where there's snow on every
mountain top you know from basically the
end of fall or so and they're like you
know several hundred feet up in the air
if you've got this gigantic antenna that
you have to work on as opposed to one
that's maybe smaller he's mentioned that
as a consideration so i think just in
terms of the transition there are things
that the broadcasters are also
experiencing i'm having working through
these issues at a real practical level
decisions break for the other five
equipment to go any further they will
switch masturbation today by output
generally I and again I can't really
answer the question is it sure and the
question is I think in terms of
transmitters are they flexible enough to
transmit both analog and DTV signals
from the same transmitter whether or not
they be in VHF or uhf is that set the
question transmitter will you could you
also pump analog through it in general I
don't know this area very well it's not
an area that I've you know regulated
directly a lot from what i heard
recently the the transmitters that
everyone was installing her new
transmitters of course and they weren't
able to use the analog transmitters they
had before there's a couple and this is
maybe an interesting discussion that's
not directly related but in general any
device that uses spectrum of course has
to have you no permission from the
government it's a there's a licensing
requirement for devices typically you're
required to have them certified has to
be some kind of check that the device
complies with the rules in place you
know if you've done anything with with
Wi-Fi radios for example the rules in
part 15 or our rules describe all the
technical standards that a device would
have to be checked to certified you know
that they were compliant with I don't
know if those devices are generally
certified for use with both analog and
DTV transmissions but you know assuming
they were I don't know what the cost
differential be I think from the
engineering perspective and again this
is not an area that I'm authoritative at
all but you know frequency stability and
things like that I think was a problem
for for older older transmitters and the
engineers because I'd ask this question
myself and they said generally speaking
you'd have to tweak I'm pretty hard and
you probably be replacing components in
the transmitter and I don't know how
that would impact you know the overall
analysis of the business case or
regulatory case but but that's a that's
a good question and you know another
thing that pops up then is well if
you've got all these old transmitters
that
you can't use what what could you use
him for and I think before a lot of
people would they repurpose them I
understand that the station in chico the
engineering director there had explored
you know taking them down to places that
were still doing analog transmission and
using him in latin america for example
but i don't know i don't know how people
are approaching that right now but i
think it's an area that i personally
have some interest in as well the
receiver side stuff you're talking about
a lot of televisions and so of course
you know people can continue to use
their analog TVs by just getting a
converter box but if you had some
surplus of old transmitters what would
you do with them maybe there'd be
interesting things you can do with them
outside of just scrap I don't know
that's a good question though again the
the radios are generally I think you can
think of them as divided in two maybe
three sections and the TV parts stuff
the ATSC standards basically an MPEG
kind of stream that's usually you know
the baseband usually a baseband kind of
that's the area we usually think of as
baseband and then there's in many cases
an intermediate frequency so you'll take
your baseband you kind of change it into
the preparatory stuff you're going to
use for pumping it into the RF chain and
then below that then you have the RF
which is an amplifier and oscillators
and things that are basically tweaking
the signal property so that it will
transmit at the right frequency and at
the right power there's of course a lot
of other components in there and it's
it's complicated area but if it's the RF
layer or the if' side I mean I think you
probably have different analysis and how
you look at that problem but I can't
really speak to it whether or not it it
would or wouldn't work interesting
thought though but again that's you know
one of the examples of how there's a lot
of pieces to the pie and it's an area
that I think for for me I didn't have a
lot of exposure to especially having
come from a company that's making load
balancing intelligence scheduling
software for
hp-ux and AIX and solaris boxes 10 years
ago it's it's an area that's its whole
different animal and I think from my
perspective but my ee friends have
really interesting insights that I don't
always pick up on right away but there's
a lot of things to learn in this area so
the coupon programs the converter box
stuff scanning and then antenna issues
or something that I think we're
increasingly hearing in the Chico market
and I think we're hearing more over on
the east bay side two people have a lot
of antenna questions and it's
interesting i was going to include this
neat graphic that i found on on the web
recently it was from an RCA television
basically warning the consumer not the
fidgets with stuff to call their TV
repairmen and I think you know in the
day that was a trade you know you'd call
the plumber to fix your pipes and you'd
call the TV repairman to fix your
television and I think we're seeing
again how you know transitions you know
introduce these roles for people that
that you know require twitting and
technical knowledge and application and
antennas are definitely an area that
we're seeing a lot of questions about I
think it the events we're doing and we
talked a little bit about you know that
there could be some different problems
depending on whether or not they're UHF
for VHF VHF you know there's there's
different kind of characteristics in
terms of how the waves propagate whether
or not they're absorbed by certain
things where they reflect off certain
things there's an interesting discussion
about ducting and how atmospheric
effects sometimes can affect the
transmission of of energy / / VHF or uhf
so that the antenna stuff there's
surprising a lot of people that you know
might have a really simple question that
after you've explored a little is
something really interesting it's an
interesting topic and then in addition
you can really help somebody out because
it might not be something they would be
able to stumble on independently so if
you're looking at the antennas generally
I think you'll find them in some fine
diamond of course at radio shack
the loops and usually some fins or
something VHF in general you know the
rabbit ears technique is basically
putting two long strands basically at an
angle and trying to pick up the
electromagnetic energy as it comes over
length is an issue some people you know
have discovered that they've got the
rabbit ears they don't have a UHF
component in their antenna by shortening
the length of those rabbit ears you can
improve the reception for uhf you know
then there's other interesting things
that I think we're even discussed at
this town hall I was at in Reading last
night you know you're really close to a
station sometimes you can pick up uhf
over VHF antenna just being really close
to it so a lot of these are our art /
science questions in experimentation and
kind of twitting which I think are
things that you know can commute a lot
of fun especially if you're trying to
get into it and learn learn from a new
perspective another thing that we have a
lot of questions about is the difference
between the DTV acronym and HDTV I think
probably everyone's here probably
familiar with HT TV is you know
letterbox high-definition you're talking
about a different kind of content it's
you know sometimes the people that are
transmitting their digital signals are
doing it in HD TV sometimes it's a
standard definition signal but in any
event there they're both digital
standards to pull another Chico reading
example the PBS station up there
transmits three stations until eight
o'clock and then they basically they
trunk two of those channels after eight
o'clock to send out a HD signal and so
there were even questions last night
well if i buy a 1080p now can I actually
get any 1080p content I don't know in
this area if you know what the details
of that are but that particular stream i
think was 720 but it's interesting that
you know things will start evolving in
it also goes back i think to another
point about whether or not the DTV is
kind of impacting just over the air
viewers or other people as the stations
are transitioning to dish
upgrading their equipment their
production rooms are trying to
transition from you know even maybe a
linear editing type environment to
something that's even more advanced
there's a lot of changes that that this
change itself are kind of are going to
help to accelerate so for example if you
have an HD stream that's available from
your local station you may or may not
have that on on your package if you're a
dish or a cable subscriber but you could
plug your antenna in we were speaking
with the director of services for
reading was talking about how he plugged
some rabbit errs into his DTV so he
could get the local PBS station in HD
after eight and because he wasn't
getting it apparently what the service
he had so there's a interesting you know
kind of quirky things that I think
coming come up and that you kind of
worked through especially at a local
level but in any event digital
television is the discussion about how
we're both you know formatting the
content and then you know delivering it
we've talked a lot about you know of
course the the frequency changes and
things like that and again we talked
earlier about the low-power television
there's basically three varieties the LP
TV stuff can be upgraded in in effect to
a class a station I think we talk more
about translator stations earlier and
again in any event a lot of these
stations won't won't be transitioning on
the seventeenth and probably will delay
a transition after that but in the Chico
area for example you know we had several
stations that we're planning to move if
they haven't already transitioned their
their their translators to digital will
be doing so in the next couple months
over the six-month period and so one of
the concerns you kind of have if you're
out and you're asking people or if
they've got questions and you're trying
to help them one problem that we
definitely want to kind of raised
somewhere and it's about is the quote
analog pass through so in fact you've
got you've got a DTV box that's plugged
into a coaxial cable and from there the
coax into the TV if the converter box
doesn't have an analog tuner you have to
be able
pass that signal into your TV to its
analog tuner if there's an analog
station you want to watch and so clearly
the translator station is a scenario
where you have that kind of a concern so
if a consumer is having problems
watching you know we talked about the
Fox translator station up in the north
side towards reading the viewer was
having trouble watching that well did
you did you turn did you did you try the
analog translator channel like wool yeah
but it didn't work well did you unplug
the box and then it worked yes okay well
then your box isn't isn't really analog
pass through and of course you know
sometimes you know experimenting with
things you can unplug the power to the
boxes and that that resolves the
pass-through issue in some cases but
again there's there's kind of a lot of
what are on the surface may be easy easy
problems to resolve that we can really
help people out if we just kind of take
a little bit of time and walk through
that okay so I think we've talked about
most of all these things these are
really kind of it closed captioning
another point on closed captioning that
I might mention is for the stations that
are getting a station info also
sometimes people have there were some
comments last night about not being able
to see the right channel information for
for a station that was selected the
station's I think we're working through
those kinds of problems at the local
level but the broadcaster's if they're
getting a stream from network or
somewhere like that they're not always
able to resolve those questions so I
think there's some things that come up
that relate to closed captioning in that
contacts so I think we're getting
towards the end of the time I just maybe
we could open up the floor for for
general questions we had a couple coming
through I think you had some questions
earlier did you want to sure yeah sorry
they're going to do like emergency
Broadcasting System test except the
years of visual tbo needs house right so
the question the question is are there
any kinds of like tests in advance of
the transition that are kind of give
consumers a heads up whether or not they
might be impacted we're generally
calling those soft tests and we did one
last month in December and then just on
Monday we did another soft test in in
most markets most of the stations have
all participated so in effect what
you're doing there is you're turning off
the analog stream or you're turning the
video off you're putting a you know a
placard up or something like that to
alert people that they're watching the
analog over the air this is going to
impact you in another couple weeks if
you need help here's the place you need
to call and the broadcaster's generally
provide a local number that you can call
in those situations we always encourage
people to come out to the local station
and volunteer if they can help out with
questions like that because it does
generally you know it's a good
opportunity for people to call in if
they do have questions or they have
issues they're still working to resolve
so the station's I think are very
appreciative of people coming in and
volunteering at their phone banks too
and we like to encourage that so yes we
are doing soft tests we've had a couple
so far and I don't know what the
schedule is for for future soft tests
but we do have a major soft test coming
on februari 17th so in advance of that
super hard soft test we've had several
so far already yeah
the question is am I am nishant or
otherwise omnipotent on the issue of
whether or not there would be a change
of the date well the date is something
that Congress decided so just from a you
know first level first order question
you know Congress would have to change
the date but I do understand that the
Obama administration spokesman said and
said something to the effect that they
would consider move or they would
encourage moving the date or support
that we have to work with the date that
we got and we've done a lot about reach
focused on februari 17th that's the
number that basically will happen short
of some other event so in any event I
would not I would not encourage people
to put off getting a box or you know
trying to resolve any kind of concerns
that they may have with the expectation
that something could change you know who
knows what could happen but we're still
we're still pushing forward with our
outreach efforts at every at any rate
oh no what no one will be angry I'm cuff
no I think the Chico scenario I can
share that from my personal experience
having directed the outreach there we
had several hundred calls in the morning
of the 23rd several hundred at the CBS
and NBC affiliates were related to a
scanning problem with addition cable
provider so in fact those were not over
the air viewers to begin with but they
had been impacted by it by some of the
technical change the over-the-air
viewing in the Chico reading dma is
about seventeen percent the bay area
generally speaking you have about
fifteen if it's over that then it's it's
kind of a high concentration and view
but in that scenario we did have you
know we had calls i was at both of the
stations that transitioned i think now
going forward we've had a total of maybe
a thousand for 1200 calls total so a lot
of the calls lately are I'm having
trouble getting your station after a
p.m. when it's foggy or you know that
they've tend to become more specific I
think as we went forward because early
on you had like I'm trying to plug it
into my TV and it's saying this is not a
DTV input well do you have it do you
have an analog television no but I
bought a box okay well so there was you
know it's our broad spectrum of
questions right
yeah and in terms of focusing the
outreach efforts we're very very focused
on on seniors non-english speakers
low-income communities minorities and
rural you know rule viewers because you
know for example Chico has basically
every angle there that's that's a
potential concern there's a lot of
seniors around paradise which is kind of
east of of Chico there's Glenn County I
think spanish-speaking bilingual
population something like sixty percent
or more up in the north area also
there's a lot of people that are rule so
that yeah that that's a that's of course
something that we focused a lot of
tension on I think we're we're at 359 so
well probably I guess we can pause here
if there's one maybe one more question
we can sure
mmm I haven't followed uh I haven't
followed the technical standards
development of that but you know the
other thing that's coming around if
you're interested in in looking into it
more is you know mobile mobile TV stuff
in Japan of course once AG is very
popular there's I think they're moving
towards a mobile discussion I don't know
if that's already work but based on that
you know you would think maybe that the
standards are are but again I can't
really speak to that but yes it's a good
question mobility apparently is coming
also so so let me again thank everyone
for your attention and again very
excited to be in Mountain View today if
you have other questions we can take him
efforts thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
