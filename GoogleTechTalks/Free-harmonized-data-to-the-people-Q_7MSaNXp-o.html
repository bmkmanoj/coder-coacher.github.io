spend a little bit of time kind of going
through the last five years of knowledge
bike sync harmonizing free data to the
people and what exactly does that mean
well first the way you free harmonized
data to the people let's break it down a
little bit we'll start with the people
so who are the people in your
neighborhood and who better tasks than
Fred Rogers and actually if we went to
youtube today and try to click on things
you would see that Mister Rogers would
take us to a neighborhood and to a place
that was kind of like Google Earth you
would kind of pan in from outer space
and you'd have all this cool ortho
imagery and then all of a sudden you
would end up kind of at his home and so
it kind of goes from this ortho imagery
to street view very naturally and
seamlessly using very old technology
namely a miniature model of a town but
when you get finally to his home and he
takes off his sweater and takes off his
shoes and all that sort of thing you
find out that this whole thing about
Mister Rogers is home is important
because he's home is in a neighborhood
and I think it's important to talk about
home and what that means and if you're
like most Americans home means you go
home and you do laundry and you have a
message your kitchen table and you go to
bed and I think that's an important
thing to remember what I'm coming in
talking at Google because a lot of these
things you do here at work
so with regard to your actual home your
home is a very important place not just
on the outside but on the inside but for
this presentation we're going to focus
on how no man is really an island and
it's important that the home is inside a
community inside of a neighborhood and
so let's let's talk a little bit more
about that that how do these communities
matter well one way they matter is with
regard to the price obviously if you
have a nice house and it's in Palo Alto
it makes a big difference and if it's in
the middle of a cornfield in Nebraska
the other thing about your neighbors is
there's there's neighbors right so you
can get to know them there's other
services if you're in a neighborhood
like hopefully ones you never have to
use there are some that you'll use all
the time there's some that you'll just
borrow on occasion and there's other odd
combos like the combo between
infrastructure and entertainments the
idea is that neighborhoods can make you
you know feel very cool you can live in
Noe Valley or they could make you feel
very boring or actually they can make
you feel quite destitute and the point
of all this of course is that homes are
homier when homes feel at home and what
does that mean that means again if you
go back I have what are the two
questions here well they are embedded in
this who are the people in your
neighborhood so who are those people in
the neighborhood that are delivering
your pizza or taking care of your
infrastructure or that sort of thing so
if you look at the map here you have
Woodside Atherton and the Menlo Park and
the people providing you these services
are probably not the same people living
in that neighborhood you know the
policeman and the schoolteacher and that
sort of thing probably can't afford to
live in your neighborhood in fact
there's probably even a barrier in
between these two neighborhoods of where
people have their homes and and where
the people providing services to them
are and that's an important that's an
important factor and while it's unlikely
that East Palo Alto will go under in
kind of kind of this ghost town
mentality there are actually communities
that do go under and the United States
so there's empty malls there's dead
malls there's a whole society devoted to
this there's blight and then likewise
when you have the sort of situations
that people look are more destitute and
whether they become homeless or
something really drastic you probably
can't see this thing but it says for
this particular census tract that's
being targeted here the average commute
time for people living in that tract is
135 minutes to work so that's 270
minutes for round trip average for
people in this community because it
takes a while to drive to Los Angeles so
it's important to realize that when when
neighborhoods fail or when communities
fail or even when they're good in their
by Edwards Air Force Base there's all
sorts of things that happen in the
strange part about this is that this is
this is the world we live in where
there's not even one county in the
country where a household full of
full-time minimum wage earners can
afford a one-bedroom apartment and this
is from a partner organization of our
home for working families so who is
responsible for this well you know
there's the city and there's the county
are they really responsible though
that's the Governator you know
essentially government has some
responsibility to make these communities
a better place and the you know as
Hillary Clinton told us about a child it
takes a village to raise a child's but
it takes it even bigger village to raise
the neighborhood and so when you're at a
neighborhood level you know what are the
what are the groups that are really
around this it's not just the government
and probably many of you there's a
myriad of organizations that support
communities like homes for working
families but likewise there's a number
of others so all these organizations are
geared around how do we make these
communities in a better place and
likewise there's a number of foundations
I didn't put Google up org that up there
but you know you get a sense that there
are organizations whether nationally or
even locally as Marvin world trusts does
that have great people and they're also
significantly invested in making these
things work but it's still not enough so
let's get to the to the part of the free
harmonized data to the people what does
that mean so in September of 1999 the
Fannie Mae Foundation was doing some
research and for me I remember back from
my childhood that this was an
inauspicious time because that was the
time when the earth was going to
jettison out of the Earth's orbit and go
into space and have all sorts of
adventures but in fact that's not what
happened
so the Fannie Mae Foundation when Stacy
Stewart came to the foundation she and
Peter Beard my former boss at the Fannie
Mae Foundation went to these
organizations and said how can we be
more help to people single grants don't
scale so you can provide a lot of grants
but after a million or a hundred million
dollars you can't help everybody and so
how do you do something that was scale
and so the results of doing this
research with those various partners was
that there were three things that needed
to be done one was you need to help stop
the reinvention of the wheel so don't
don't have something that goes on in
Dallas be some new project that someone
starts up and then have that same
project go on in Seattle when they could
have just borrowed from the project in
Dallas level the playing field there's
all sorts of people doing all sorts of
investment in communities that aren't
community minded so corporations and
that sort of thing payday lenders and
that sort of thing all our have various
data and information that they can get
about these communities that the own
communities cannot get because they can
pay for it and then likewise disseminate
expertise and what that means is you
know there's all sorts of experts around
community issues and community
development issues how do you make this
expertise get out to the people who
really need it well so in 2001 they
launched knowledge box which is an
affordable housing and community
development vertical portal which was
really a one-stop shop with news
information and that sort of thing to
really try and accomplish those three
goals
the so what you know wasn't to serve man
per se but really to help the
practitioners in the field the people
that are really doing the job on the
grounds and likewise the policymakers
that are supporting these communities as
well
the researchers and and scholars that
are around
and then likewise the press who's
reporting on these conditions so all
these people need to be served in
knowledge box to us a way of serving
them so it's this online vertical portal
that's still around today so if you go
to knowledge plaque start org you can
actually see what we're talking about
and of course one of the things that
happened at the Fannie Mae Foundation is
said when they first launched this
project they didn't really have any
technologists so in 2003 Stacy and Peter
went out and they tried to search high
and low for people to do this sort of
development for them and of course they
satisfice with some you know people from
bankrupt companies from Silicon Valley
and so essentially what they did is they
said okay we've brought you guys on from
Silicon Valley now how can you make
these things better you know we want to
be bigger stronger faster and so you
know we want to build a website that
will respond to this audience and really
get this stuff done and so when the
audience that make it simpler we made it
simpler when they said show me what's
relevant we did that and we made it
relevant and likewise we organized all
these kind of semantics around different
topics in this space of community
development make it work for me that is
that I don't wanna have to do a lot of
work about this so we provided
industry-wide calendars and other
industry-wide things and likewise tell
me what's important so we'll summarize
the week's news and send it out as a
newsletter and so that's still going on
until today well the other thing that
they wanted as far as the dissemination
of expertise is these expert chats so we
hold regular chats with people in the
field so they can talk to people whether
they're in some podunk place or if
they're in a big city or if they're in
some suburb they can come to knowledge
flex and they can find out about healthy
housing and healthy families and these
are all archived at knowledge plex as
well so we gave them all that right and
of course what did they say they said we
want more right it's I don't know what
that is human condition and you know I'm
like all what are we the giving tree'
and in fact we were because Fannie Mae
Foundation and so Fannie Mae Foundation
the mission is to give everything away
and so that we did exactly that and so
what we did what we had to do was to
rebuild knowledge box
and we did it without the messy and
costly licenses so that we could
syndicate not only this content to our
own site but to partner websites and
they became like technology grants so
we're providing content out in a variety
of different means so when we are
approached by Harvard University's Asha
Institute at the Kennedy School of
Government very long title they said you
know we want to knowledge Plex for
innovations in the public governance we
said okay cool you know we have this
lamb lamp architecture and we can
essentially repurpose these tools for
you so we could take the shell of
knowledge Plex and make it work for you
so this is a completely different
content area this is not about a
Community Development or affordable
housing this is essentially about
innovations in the public government so
if you go to innovation stop Harvard edu
you can find the site and it's being
served off the knowledge box and of
course these technology grants became in
vogue and so we did a couple of others
but as we start to review our list of
are we accomplishing the goals that the
foundation had set out for us you know
don't reinvent the wheel level the
playing field disome the expertise it
was yes yes yes not not only that but
you know when they said you know can we
do more well of course we comply and
that's the thing about Community
Development is that there's always more
to do so the next part is the free and
the data so so far we've talked about
people and to those let's talk about to
free and data so we got some feedback
I'm doing this knowledge plex project
and it was well it's great very broadly
it's kind of the national topics about
national news and we brought in
LexisNexis feed and now we're serving it
up to this audience all about the
affordable housing issues but it wasn't
so great
locally and you know that's
understandable we don't have editors in
every city covering every topic that's
going on on a local basis so what we did
at the foundation who is also getting
bombarded by a number of grant requests
for geographic information systems and a
lot of these grant requests from
grantees to the Fannie Mae Foundation
they want to buy an ESRI license
and hierarchy is engineers and buy some
data and put it all on Oracle and you
know you didn't have to ask Morpheus how
deep the rabbit-hole went you know GIS
is very expensive right and so we had
these two things when we're not serving
things locally in GIS is very expensive
and strangely every grantee wanted to
buy the cow it's not like the the
answers were actually free right all
right I mean these answers are actually
free or weren't they
so if you look at these organizations
and you look at them online now census
home mortgage disclosure act IRS and HUD
are providing data free of charge to
people in the world and they invest
billions and likewise they have
brilliant people working on these things
and they really care about getting this
data out there nonetheless until you
kind of cross that last mile is it
really free so the following
representations show how free the data
is and so and this is just by way of
example please tell me where blacks
should play anyone this is from the the
blood vomiting game the ear reddening
move game this is from the master of go
and this is a game of staccato aoes so
it's obviously quite obvious you know
what you do in these sort of situations
and it was likewise obvious on the data
side so you have this data and it's
really easy to use when you can deal
with you know code race combinations and
Co gender combinations and crate flags
for high cost etc code the purpose to be
consistent in 2004 create base files at
places codes based on which already
tracked it stands for MSA recode back to
the survey and divvy that up and and and
and know for good measure you know don't
forget to hew a and do it all in a
sentence and then you can crow to your
friends about how free this data really
is and that's that's really the point is
well yeah the source files are free as
long as your time is also free and get a
degree and learn and all that sort of
thing then the data is free so what does
it mean to have free data
so I imagine if you will how many people
in the community of dalam and sphere are
really good at these sort of things well
it's a very small sliver so we get to
our next point which is how do we
harmonize all that sort of thing
so and we want to enter our someone from
the foundation who actually had this
concept now is our director of
demography Patrick Simmons and so there
he is and he had this vision essentially
for meeting grantee needs and meeting
you the knowledge plex user needs
through a scalable freely available and
freely workable so but not just freely
free data sets but also freely workable
data sets and and what he needed was a
man on the inside who could get things
done and so he went to his Silicon
Valley Posse there at the Fannie Mae
Foundation and together they created
data place and you know and this is the
time before Google Maps and and pre
mashup and so we really had to do it all
by ourselves and so we did a number of
jobs so harmonize the data one was the
day aggregation so that's just pretty
simple we can bring in all these files
from these various sources but then we
have to go through all those processes
right and so this data cleaning data
normalizing Geographic normalization an
indicator building that's not something
that the data just do by themselves and
you remember all the steps after the
code boards you know that's just a
glimpse of basically what we do when
we're doing those steps and so as you go
through that you know and there's still
more these are made up steps and this is
just part of what we're doing and I was
thinking we should have a jackass like
warning for people that are trying to do
this and we haven't put that on the site
shut but you know the idea is that you
could you should tell people when they
try and get after these free data sets
what you know kind of what they're going
to get into because there's more steps
to do right so you have those initial
steps so then you have these other steps
you know you have to have the data
exchange you have to do all the
semantics on the Geo data you have to do
kind of the internal API is to do the
views which are the you
interface and then tennis of course the
biggest bucket there is it's the
miscellaneous bucket
so it's essentially ten businesses that
we're doing that's all to deliver data
place and so this is data place you can
go to it now it's WWE to place org and
really it's geared towards making this
as simple as possible for people in
community development so they really can
get at these free data and so you can
just type in atl and you can get an
autocomplete on the search or you can
browse to your geography you can put in
an address you know pinpoint for you
will do out of summaries will do tables
and histograms which are really cool
because if you have a value that's like
point eight percent it's that really
higher so i really low compared to other
places in the US we get our own maps
there was no Google mashup at the time
when we had this idea and so we've done
our own mapping application using all
open-source tools among many other
various views and so what we're doing is
we're essentially taking these data sets
and other data sets that we're getting
from like the Brookings Institution
who's now working on a blueprint for
American prosperity and putting these
data sets up and putting them in as a
layer on to the data place application
and you're maybe saying this is cool
alright well I'll go through the trouble
you little peon non-for-profit why not
just crawl it all well you know some
things scroll really really well others
are doing just that or similar and and
there are examples of that where these
organizations are actually doing a very
good job of taking kind of data that's
readable and putting it on to their site
but there are things that don't crawl as
well so if we're a quick pop quiz for
you all how many different genders are
there quick raise your hand yes you sir
I don't have an answer no okay - all
right well actually for the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act data there are
seven and so the data itself has these
sort of characteristics to them that you
might not expect and so some of these
some of these things are
be you know taking atomically and and re
package but there's actually some things
in here
actually need some human reading and
that's really what this harmonization is
and I try to figure out what the
definition of harmonized was it's
bringing two notes together in harmony
and so the two notes for us are really
data in place and both change they are
not steady-state things these things
that get reported out of these federal
agencies that are fantastic pieces of
work that people work really hard to
produce do change over time because
people have different different things
that they want to get out of the data
sets at different years and so they have
to be cleaned and here are some examples
so here we are I'm logged in as an admin
and I'm going to the data play site and
I want to do some of this QA on some of
the state of work that we're doing so I
go and I put in la s and it brings up
the different places that start with la
s in the United States by geography and
descending order of population and I
picked the Las Vegas Metro and I click
there and I go to this area overview of
the Las Vegas Metro for a number of
relevant statistics that are quick and
free and they've already gone through a
lot of processing likewise I can go to
the histogram and I can see where the
Las Vegas Metro is on particular
indicators so for the percent Hispanic
and Latino it's actually very high
compared to other metros in the US so
we're doing comparisons between metros
and likewise I can rank the metros so
there's 335 and 2000 and Las Vegas was
44 but you see like on the far left here
right above the Las Vegas Nevada Metro
is Richland Kennewick Pasco that doesn't
seem like a real metro I mean it's a
real metro when you go there and there's
nice people there but it's not big like
Las Vegas or you know Tucson so if we go
and we set the minimum population to be
a million then we see the big metro so
the metros with more than a million
people and you can see that Las Vegas
has crawled from number 44 up to number
13 for big metros and this is what we're
doing with regard to harmonizing the
data so it's connecting this data to the
place and then pivoting around and
showing you different views of that of
that same sort of thing and we do that
in a number of
and permutation so pardon me what you
have here is the list of where we have
data and when we have data so at what
granularity do we have this data is it
the Census tractor I said at the city or
the zip code or the county and then
likewise what years of data do we have
in the system currently well how do you
find out if something's primetime and so
this is the thing what we're doing when
we're checking as an admin we're going
in and we're looking at things like the
homeownership rate and does this look
does this look right but then we can go
and look at some of the unpublished data
sets so this is a National Center for
Education Statistics and we can put we
can plop the schools on the map and
likewise we can click on a point and we
can bring up all the statistics for this
particular school in the Las Vegas area
but then when we start to chart the data
we start to notice that there's very
nice line that's going up from 18 to 31
percent in 2003 and then there's this
crash in population in 2004 you know
what happened this is the percent of
public school students that are Hispanic
and actually if you go and dig a little
deeper you'll see that it's because
Clark County did not report their data
well how are you going to crawl this how
are you going to make all this happen
you're not the the point is that people
actually have to go and look at these
things and and account for these things
and while this data said looks pretty
close it's it's certainly not there so
don't forget the warning and this is one
of my favorite quotes it's supposed to
be hard if it wasn't hard everyone would
do it the heart is what makes it great
and this is Tom Hanks is Jimmy Dugan and
league of their own and that's exactly
the kind of work we do really hard labor
intensive people intensive work and why
I'll because we care about communities
and we care about quality and because we
want to get the information into
people's hands as soon as possible but
no sooner
but likewise this this leads to a
trusted product a trusted process in the
connection with communities that leads
to interesting stories and where data
amines place is really where we want to
go so I'm going to show you some things
that you just can't see on data place
there's some new views and some new
comparisons and what we're gonna look at
here and I I'm gonna look at the map I
want you to focus on Washington DC area
so it's this this is square right and so
what you're gonna look at is is this
part of the square and you can really
see that there's two sides of Washington
DC there's kind of the halves
and there's two have-nots and while this
data isn't talking is about that as much
you can see that there really is this
line going up right through Rock Creek
Park and so we're gonna focus on this
area right here on the right so try and
keep your eye on that as we go through
time so this is 1997 and this is the
number of subprime mortgage loans in the
Washington DC area and you can see in
just incrementing one year some of these
subprime loans have disappeared and if
you keep going you'll see that something
interesting has happened by 2004 what
used to be green within Washington DC is
no longer the stark green color it's now
very light and all the dark green is
kind of out here in the Maryland suburbs
now perhaps you didn't see that well so
I put a little help which is this yellow
line so that you can actually just see
where the the dark green is disappearing
and if you look again through time you
can see that it's getting lighter and
lighter well suburban Maryland continues
to be dark green and finally by 2004 the
have-nots part of Washington DC kind of
looks like the half now the interesting
thing is what is the story yes let me
talk about this so this is an important
thing so what does this green mean so as
you change this over time this is
reflecting the national octaves of this
data set so dark green means this is
high for the entire US of if you were
take an eighth of the u.s. percentages
and you were to apply
they would get this dark green color so
what's changing is that Washington DC is
actually moving out from that rock tile
and moving into the lower octaves as far
as a percent relative to the rest of all
the census tracts in the United States
it's a lot of work and it's a good
question so you know why you know what
why why did this happen in Washington DC
and despite doing these kind of 10
businesses on data prep going to 11 as
tough as nigel would have told you in
spinal tap you know this sort of thing
of asking the story you know why did
this happen
you know and it's tell storytellers are
really the 11th person in the field and
they're the people that we partner with
and they're the ones who are going to
really give you that view of why that
happened and there's a lot of different
reasons actually you know some of the
stories I've heard about this is that oh
well the city government should be
praised for its it's great work or maybe
it's just the gentrification of all
these poor people having to move out
farther and farther out there's a number
of different stories but what the real
story is is that we're providing this
ammunition for people to tell these
stories so that's what we did
so another new view which was previewed
in our poster was the dual maps or dual
maps maybe and so this is the look at
this corner of Washington DC
again this is tract 7800 8 and that's
the track 7800 8 and so you're looking
at 1997 versus 2004 and as the gentleman
already pointed out it's important to
know that this is the the uppermost acht
aisle of data for that particular thing
and those hoc tiles change year to year
but still seeing less of a percent
relative to the nation is important but
the other thing you can do is you can
link these maps together and so as you
move the map around you can you can see
them moving in tandem or you can move
them separately so what I did just for
grins is compare Washington DC in 1990
70 East Palo Alto in 1997 and so you can
put these two side by side and you can
increment the the time from 1997 and
then we can look at it in 1999 and we
can see that it's getting a little bit
lighter here but really
hasn't changed and then in 2001 what is
the situation again it's getting a
little bit lighter in DC a lot of the
subprime topic tile stuff is moving to
Maryland
whereas East Palo Alto stay the same you
can see that Menlo Park and Atherton are
less green though and then finally in
2004 you can see the situation really
has not changed much so no matter of the
year East Palo Alto has maintained this
kind of very steady state in the top box
Isles
whereas of course its neighbors on the
other side of 101 have a little bit
better situation with the exception of a
little bit that Redwood City Menlo Park
area whereas Washington DC we saw before
so these are the sort of things that
we're providing so putting it all
together how do you do this three
harmonized data to the people well with
all these elements in the in place I can
tell you about the future and I don't
mean guess so what will the future
actually hold I will tell you what the
future will actually hold is that these
data will become available and how do I
know that well I came from a stock
master which was an online financial
stock site and essentially I had this
enormous sense of deja vu in 1992 where
the same sort of thing happened with
stocks and so you know it's the same
sort of thing happening with stocks it
seems very similar with community data
so in 1992 you had public equities right
and what our publications their stocks
and what does that mean this like stocks
like ticker symbols Google Microsoft and
Yahoo or missed Huff or you know who's
Smith's or whatever it ends up being
maybe it's merging with CNET's but
anyway it's companies and company stock
prices and so the selling stock to the
public is what this public equities mean
unfortunately in 1992 this public data
was about as HMDA public as the HMDA
date was so unless you were an expert or
you paid you weren't going to get kind
of a free equities price I mean you
could go and pay your stockbroker for
this information or you could dig
through the stock pages right but unless
you account for splits and mergers and
other stock changing events a dollar is
not a dollar
so this is the Google stock price over
five years and if I told you that the
stock price of Google were $100 maybe
some of you would jump down the
stairwell but the other the others of
you may not be concerned because maybe
it just means if it's ten to one so as
companies do splits and and these
mergers all these sort of things are
accounted for when you look at public
equities data and in 1993 that's exactly
what happened
stock master was founded and took this
kind of public data which was really
kind of hard to work with and made it
not just freely available but freely
workable so in a span of 1993 to 2000
you had the odd finance and big charts
and quote and market watch and all these
other companies that were essentially
trying to one-up each other to get this
data to be more workable with more
information and so as part of stock
master I was really part of this feeding
frenzy that the public had for all of
this information and likewise companies
we're trying to fulfill it and get the
their stock prices up and so the people
were fed and this insatiable appetite I
see as kind of this virtuous circle
where as the attractiveness to us being
in this business so the attractiveness
to web entry which is that far right
thing makes more availability of the
data it's more attractive to Tayna
providers and attractive to data
collectors and therefore it makes it
easier for all of us to use and likewise
there's more user demand and so as you
start to do these things they starts to
take off and and so this is an
increasing returns to information but
likewise it's increasing returns to
transparency so it's the ride to
accountability as the data is more
transparent and more data is used to
gauge decisions and there's more data
requests and less opportunity to high
data you have more accountability so as
these things become more and more public
it's very clear what sort of happens and
so this is something that actually did
happen this is not a fiction and so the
equity analysts before when things were
very hidden from the public view they
could do what they want they could say
what they want but then later they were
guilty likewise are Bains Oxley came up
as a result of some of this
accountability and transparency stuff
whistleblowers became heroes
on the cover of magazines and likewise
you could say that's maybe the Google's
IPO stock price auction was this idea of
fairness right instead of giving it to
some firm and then jacking up the price
at the time of the IPO you could have
this stock price auction so all these
sort of things are when you make things
transparent then accountability happens
so today we look at public equities
there actually I'm going to actually
press the button
there are public equities right so now
they're really in the free space and so
you can really go and you can look at
them and you can go to any site
basically these days and find out all
sorts of information about these stock
prices so what is the future well the
same thing is going to happen with our
data I'm just sure of it
so with community statistics it will
happen and I would guess in less than
three years I mean already we're doing
it and we're doing it for our a lot of
different topics
and as we start to expose people to do
it it's like oh can I put my data on
there or oh how do we make it available
so we can do it and likewise it's
spurring all these competitors who want
to oh well we can do the same thing we
can do it better and so there's going to
be this kind of rat race and for reading
frenzy until you get back into the same
sort of picture now what have I done
I've changed the word public equities to
communities statistics so really there's
no difference and exactly the sort of
things that we're doing now and the same
sort of thing that I expect to happen
later so that's how the prediction works
I would say for the u.s. now the
important difference is the US has all
this kind of statistics available and
very easy to use whereas the rest of the
world well that's not really the rest of
the world there's the rest of the world
doesn't have these statistics as easy to
use and then not as freely available so
the prediction doesn't really work
outside of the US that will take part
right so that's the end of the bomb so
I'm going to leave you with this little
riddle
you can't crawl it and have it be good
it has to be solved with people and
there's two kinds data data and place
prepares and storytellers storytellers
and it's who you're solving for and
it'll be here don't don't don't mistake
me it will be here if you're ready or
not before three years time in the
United States it will change decision
making an accountability will permeate
and if done right the world will do it
too so feel free to visit us we're at
knowledge box store data place not org
and if you want to know what it is yeah
yeah
so as as I showed in the demo we do have
the school information available it's
just it's it's not quite ready for
primetime and I can it I know here I
will log in and show you and despite
showing you everything in PowerPoint the
site actually does work let's see that
we have a bunch of Engineers here in the
audience and I can hear them shuffling
uncomfortably so this is a school
schools by location and you have to so
there's there's thousands of indicators
in data place and so if I want to pick
on a particular indicator you either
have to know what it is or you have to
find it and we have semantic ways
actually of between that which are
really cool but that's a longer
presentation so here are the schools in
the US and we can obviously put a lot of
more pinpoints than you could on the at
Google mashup and let's pick on one of
these schools at random and so for each
of these schools we have have this
information from the National Center for
Education Statistics another agency that
is doing great work and so you can get
the school address and all that sort of
thing all that long but likewise some of
these other statistics like a number
number of students student to teacher
ratio which is maybe a corollary with
performance but then as you go to look
for the actual performance data by the
schools sometimes it's just not as easy
to get and so this is the first data set
that we'll have up but at some point
later we'll hope to have the education
performance as well other questions yeah
so I assume the data analysis is being
done by your people right yes are you
doing any work on enabling the general
public to help with the data analysis
and you know particularly if if any of
this is gonna scale outside the US you
know you can't do all of that work right
no absolutely and I think there there
are a number of things that we're going
to try and enable and again just to
repeat the question or to paraphrase it
to make sure I got it right you're
asking when we prepare the data are we
going to make it available for our
others outside of data place to prepare
their data for for these views and to
make it workable or are you saying
there's so much other world data that
how are you going to solve all the
world's problems well one we're not
going to solve them all - we're going to
probably provide a model for how to do
it and so I think that's an important
important thing data place is an open
source platform and it's something that
we're looking to share so you know with
regard to how to prepare the data and
how to be good about it it really does
take some subject matter expertise
depending on the topic so if you're
talking about environmental data you
want someone who's environmental
experience you're talking about housing
you want a housing expert if you're
talking about crime you want a crime
expert and but you we can be an example
for the rest of the world I think I
think we're in a good spot almost now
with data place once we've had some more
topics to the site where we'll be able
to actually provide these sort of
answers and be a model for others okay
so you're saying all of the software is
open-source are going to be so if a
norges organization in Nigeria wanted to
make a Nigerian version of data place
they could just do it well unfortunately
it's not that simple it's not we have a
number of servers in colocation facility
and
to kind of open source data place would
take a lot of work that said we'd be
happy to put in the polygons from
Nigeria we'd be happy to put in the data
from Nigeria we'd have to be happy to
work with them and obviously since we're
a not-for-profit would be great if they
could support us in some way of doing
that but likewise we've provided the
tools on data place to to do that for
the United States it's just that we
haven't quite open it up to the rest of
the world yet with regard to geographies
that we do but obviously just as in the
knowledge bytes example we did a
vertical portal and affordable housing
we could do that same kind of toe
braiding the bits and bytes don't know
where you are they just need to know the
geography you just need to know the data
and they need to know that's coming in
some standardized format so it can be
read semantically and all the other cool
stuff that I talked about other
questions if not I really appreciate the
time thank you for the opportunity to
present and feel free to visit us
wouldn't or catch up with us later all
right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
