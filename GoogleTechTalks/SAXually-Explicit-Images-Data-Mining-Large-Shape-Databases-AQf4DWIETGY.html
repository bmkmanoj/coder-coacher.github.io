today in angio from UC Riverside is here
to talk about data mining time stories
and images and as usual this talk is
going to be archived in google videos so
please don't say anything confidential
okay thanks on again I suppose me and
welcome to talk to admit a quick outline
and the first half talks to become more
let's review I'm going to talk about a
quick review of Time series data mining
and a way of looking at the generic data
my noggin I'm going to explicit
presentation of Time series data call of
sex again this is all kind of review and
then I'm going to talk about in the next
half a talk some new work would do it in
mine and shape databases and in
particular to problems shape this core
discovery I kind of find them unusual
shapes and shape motif discovery which
is finding near-duplicate shapes and if
i have time i have a little kind of a
DVD bonus feature which i'll try and get
to also so let's get right to it what's
about what is the time series I
apologize it oh ok so what is the time
series at times here is simply a
collection of data like this is
sequentially in time and so here's an
example here and of course the video
this is actually we can plot this Omega
now states actually a heartbeat and
maybe even though kind of a heartbeat is
actually is what kind of neem is so for
the rest of us talk i'm going to
actually tend to show pictures more than
equations and numbers hopefully you'll
go along with that so I want to spend 10
minutes making the Fallen point the time
series are ubiquitous they're really
absolutely everywhere and the reason why
this is the case because people tend to
measure stuff we measure how many web
clicks we get we measure our popularity
in Google we measure whatever it is and
things change over time so example
George Bush popularity changed over time
down down down down down and your google
stock stock changes over time hopefully
up up up up and so the world is full of
these time series in medicine science
arts but the other point I will make or
the next five slides is x is ubiquitous
for another reason because many kinds of
data
which are not time series can be kind of
massage it's becoming a fake time series
let me show you five examples so his
example one I took the Bible as a long
sentence I took a window of length 100
words and I slid it across the Bible I'm
now going to measure the local frequency
of certain words so for the first
example is God so for example in numbers
God is hardly mentioned and then
Deuteronomy it's all God all the time it
is like a suitor time series and I can
use this a various tasks so here's one
task if I want to translate the Bible
into Spanish or say we're actually want
to retrieve the Spanish text I can look
for a time series similar to the blue
one and I find in Spanish I get the word
this which of course is translation for
God now this actually have a trivial
example and there's a better way to
translate text but this could be
actually and a bercy time series a
weblog clicks and I could find certain
words so she ate it to other kinds of
queries oh sorry yeah so that means the
may have fun so actually when I did this
originally I noticed actually matches
overall quite good but in one local area
is actually quite a difference here and
so the question is why is that
difference there so i subtracted the red
from the blue and i queried on the
difference of those two time series and
on the closest match is actually this
thing right here which is el senior the
fodder a synonym for god and so for some
reason el senior is a synonym for God
but it's kind of locally bursty it
doesn't happen in the Old Testament very
much but it happens a lot in the New
Testament particularly in a vehicle so
actually is it nice extra bit of valuing
together there sometimes it's an example
come back to later but I kind of briefly
show you now we can also take shapes and
convert shapes in the time series and
again one waiting for doing this is
because we have a big arsenal of tools
that handle time series very well they
don't work well in video I shape
directly so we can actually handle
things more efficiently in this space
yet another example is actually every
professors worst nightmare a grad
student with a gun so in this case
actually on the top video the grad
student is pointing over there and
here's three examples are over there
here I'm tracking her hand and in the
bottom example just pointing a gun at
somebody and here are three examples of
the gun and in this example if you look
at the time series it's easy to actually
figure out which is which because
there's a little bump here you can see
which corresponds to the hand pause and
over the holster and then drawn the gun
out so we can easily classify this in
the time series space but actually hard
to do in the original video space this
is a course of a contrived example but
for example in Las Vegas there are
similar movies we make with your hand on
a blackjack table the people at you want
to know about automatically here's
another example of a data set which is
not time serious but we can kind of fake
into becoming a time series so here's a
handwritten archive I briefly mentioned
I know Google interested in doing this
because I was in Dublin gonna talk in
November and have her to the talk the
Dean of the College kicked the door in
and he said google has given us the
check and the whole room at wild so
obviously given these guys too much
money I mean it won't actually index
this we can transform a little bit
remove the slant and then we can make a
pseudo time series one above the word
and one below the word and I simply
index the time series which we can do
very very well it's a very simple naive
thing but actually works much better
than Markov models these other tricks in
this domain yet another example I'll go
very quickly over this but here we
actually have a four dimensional brain
volume and of course it's not a time
series but we can actually fill the
volume with a Hilbert curve measure the
local intensity at every part of the
brain and then take the Hilbert curve
and stretch it out as I've done here
into a kind of a pseudo time series and
once again the idea is simply that we
can't handle efficiently this high
volume data but we can handle one
dimensional time series by efficiently
so the conclusion from all this is that
the really is time series all over the
world and every kind of domain and let's
do something interesting with it so what
should we do this time series
what we actually do everything with it
we want to do clustering maybe cluster
similar customers similar web clicks
that are we want to do classification is
my heartbeat normal abnormal we want to
do motif discovery perhaps that is
basically are the only repeated patterns
in this time series we're going to do
rule discovery so descriptive lights say
if ever you see a double peak like this
then within 10 seconds we're going to
see this shape here with some support
and confidence we may wish to do queer
by content basically what I'm at Google
time series many time series data sets
are very very large we're actually want
to visualize massive data sets and
finally not the detection so here's a
heartbeat and something strange and not
what happened here the person that died
or a machine gun unplugged so these are
a diverse set of problems but they all
have one thing in common to solve these
problems we need to actually figure out
how to measure similarity if we can do
that in a meaningful way all these
problems unclaimed or trivial but we
can't do this in a meaningful useful way
then all these problems since you're
impossible let's talk about similarity
very quickly so the classic Samaki
measure is Euclidean distance and here's
the equation but the pictures very
simple to see we have two x series
seeing q we put them top of each other
bi-xenon ization and we can simply
measure the distance between the I'd
point I 2 I take that distance square it
sum it up square root of it that's
Euclidean distance you claim distance is
very simple but it's amazingly effective
you have to enough a lot of work to
actually beat this this is incredibly
simple and easy thing to do again we're
doing the title review here this point
look at the new stuff in a moment so one
thing about data mine is that most of
the time in data mining you actually
gone backwards and forwards on disk CPU
time is typically not even relevant it's
all this access time so to handle that
most of the online algorithms don't work
on the original raw data whatever it is
they working some kind of abstraction of
the data so here we have a time series
in red but we can't fit in the main
memory so we're going to put in spared
this blue abstraction of it and that
with into main memory
so here's one example of an abstraction
I'll show you others in a moment what
important idea is that if you want to
measure a distance with a between Google
stock and yahoo stock and we can fit it
all into main memory we can actually
have the approximations in main memory
and we can measure the distance
approximately in this space again a
simple useful trick now of course the
piecewise linear approximation is only
one approximation to cut abuse right we
could have also used wavelets Fourier
transforms SVD etc etc so we actually
have many many choice and things we
could do okay now I'm going to show you
the generic data mind algorithm and this
basically works and pencil of anything
I've shown you indexing classification
clustering rule discovery etc etc it's
kind of a basic generic paradigm for my
own data if I say I'm going to do it
when I played an approximation of the
data which actually fits in the main
memory so we can't fit all at that acute
memory we're going to proximate it and I
fit into my memory and now we're going
to in main memory a cockney solve the
problem at hand whether Lou discovery
etc etc at this point that we have a
naproxen solution which might not be
exact because we're working on
approximation of the data so the next
step we're going to go to disk hopefully
only once or twice to either confirm the
model or just slightly modify the model
a little bit and the hope is that we're
going to make very few access as a disk
in this stage rather than many many
accesses we would do we worked in the
raw data so if you believe this model
then all you have the answer is which
approximation to do use and there's lots
of approximation is out there this like
thing is a complete autonomy of them and
don't really can read this I'm important
the point is we have lots not the
choices and which one should we pick
there is one very very important
requirement for an approximation we use
and this is lower bounden it turns out
that if we do this generic framework and
our approximation of a lower bound on
which will explain the next slide then
when we do this we can guarantee the
answer we have at this point is
identical to the answer we would have
gotten
how do we actually looked at the raw
data and then all these accesses right
so there's actually a very nice result
again on sign is that it approximation
of a slow down the principle I can do
this very efficient thing and end up the
same answers I would have gotten on the
raw data so what is this lower bound on
thing what we see we can measure example
you could in distance right here but
again I can't fit all this law that the
main memory the supposed to example that
had a piecewise counted approximation
which does fit in main memory and I
measure the distance approximately on
that space here so here's a measure fit
lower bound and says that for any
possible to objects Q and s that the
distance in the reduced space is going
to be less than or equal to the distance
in the true space hopefully it can be
very closely approximating it but the
important thing is it's always going to
be less than or equal to if this is true
again we can now use generic data mining
paradigm now there's lots of
proclamations I mentioned this is not
even a complete list but one that is
kind of special symbolic and although
there's lots and lots of ways to take
the time series like this and convert
the symbols I haven't counted at least
200 miles of doing that unfortunately
nothing lower bound in contrast I can
lower bound wavelets for it transforms
SVD excel etc I can log on all of these
but unfortunately I've to tune the ways
out there none of these actually lower
bound in symbolic space so what do we
care well just think about what you can
do if you can actually use symbols right
but you can't do in the real space for
example I can hash symbols meaningfully
but you can't really mean ugly hash real
valued numbers i can use suffix trees
and symbols which again you can't really
use on real value things markov models
example more generically there are
people out there who are expert in need
with symbols people at Google example or
people in bioinformatics who are used to
dealing with four symbols all the time
and they have wonderful ideas algorithms
that does such as excited cetera and if
I can actually have a symbolic
representation I can steal all the
wonderful ideas and again I can't really
do this in this real space
so a contribution I want to talk about
briefly is we have created the first
import of sensation of time series that
actually allows lower bound of the
euclidean distance and this means we can
do all kinds of wonderful clever things
I'm going to give you some examples and
a little bit so representation is called
sex and again for clarity on claiming is
this that you can give me a time series
like this one here I can put it on my
little magic black box and I'm going to
spit out a symbol string instead and
furthermore I can measure the distance
between two sets of symbols and this
will be a lower bound to the true
distance in the original raw space and
if this is true that I can use all these
wonderful algorithms and guarantee i get
the right answer we'll buy generic that
amount of paradigm so the obvious
question is how do you get sex okay it's
quite simple we have the original time
series here in blue and I'm going to
simply take a window of a fixed size and
measure local areas look at the average
this is the average of this section the
average of this section and someone's
our fort it's a piece of approximation
once I do this I'm going to take a
little Gaussian curve here i'm going to
divide it into three equal areas for the
area here the area here an area here all
equal and I'm going to extend some break
points out and anything above this
breakpoint is a see anything below the
break point is an a and in the middle
here to be so I can take this real value
time tips and blue and eventually spit
out these symbols here so let me preamp
the question people often ask so why a
Gaussian it's true that for long global
time series they may be actually
non-gaussian but for small local sub
windows are virtually any time series
they do tend to be approximately
Gaussian and we've seen as actually in
120th and datasets invade over diverse
domains so he's going to visual kind of
proof of you like and I can show you
this in many many data sets so the idea
is by using this technique we guarantee
that we have approximately equal symbols
we have as many a's as B's CS and most
things you want to do like Markov models
and hash and suffix trees have the best
cases if you have econ
symbols ago public symbols so no this is
actually arbitrary and we can choose a
number of symbols we want to use one
thing oh this function is just to
discretize the data though right that's
all that stuff is it could be linearly
distribution it could be it's actually
am we taught about this adaptive at some
point originally but we made it adaptive
it always became a Gaussian basically so
we simply hard-coded that fact I should
say actually that if this actually is a
non-gaussian time series then the
correctness of all the algorithms
doesn't change everything is still
correct it might be less efficient right
but we're pretty safe there here's a
quick visual comparison here's a time
series and hit with slack presentation
and visually here's a comparison with
these other approximations individually
we are going to lose anything right the
reconstruction error is about the same
in most cases I can always find you some
examples that make one of these look
better than the other but on average it
tends to be that sax actually works as
efficiently as other things in terms of
reconstruction error again I told you
there's a lower bound here I'm not going
to be proven to provide it but i want to
emphasize actually is true that
euclidean distance between two time
series is measured like this as we
discussed and in the sex space this
function here the minute sumption
actually gives us a distance which it
approximates the assistance and will
always lower bound and we can prove it
by transitivity basically this is known
to lower bound this and we can show that
we can lower bound this so we know now
we have a lower bound presentation
are there are two comforters insects
like one is the cardinality alphabet a B
and C is treat example and there is the
number of them sections here and there
are choices that he made here
unfortunately although actually it's not
quickly sensitive choices in most cases
okay here's a bit of a history of sex
and then I'm going to go get on to this
new stuff with shapes so with the mint
in 2002 and efficiently as we show that
for most problems it basically works as
well as for it transforms in wavelets
etcetera etcetera for all the classic
but born problems that's location plus
an indexing and then 2003 we show that
actually sex allows noontime discovery
of time series motifs we have a time
series in having a repeated pattern in
it we can actually find those in linear
time it's been weapon 60 times but
actually most of these times actually
applications this people now use this
technique for motion capture the user
for a telemedicine money medical data
sets whatnot so people are you ready to
use this quite a lot and in 2004 we
shall have to use sex to the parameter
free data mining last year we had a real
explosion in things within with sacks so
we'll do an anomaly detection
visualization of massive datasets
joining streams etcetera etc and
recently for example issues Katie be
there as many papers actually submitted
at least that use sex as wavelets and
fourier transforms so I really think
that snacks get from critical mass here
that we actually take off quite a bit so
this all been review that i'm going to
show you that with sex we can actually
now do data mining on shape data sets
and do very interesting things not the
main
no I'm solution fine yeah and he just
really wanted one is fine right but in
general calcium lokito pub with symbols
and uniform would not but the a it will
be very rare and it be to be more common
and then up the other side the alphabet
those symbols a less common
represent the fuzzies seen unify
actually we can have the uniform you
want but in general virtually every time
she obsesses caption property it's kind
of hard to believe the reviewers often
don't believe it so actually build a web
page or 100 data set we showed us true
and hundred evans empirically and we had
a pointer viewers to that people's
intuition simply wrong there again
globally most answers are not gas yet
but small local windows virtually always
our intuition would you wanna fight
simples yes i will do is simply the same
maybe long piece wise i will take like
the high values and ABC be with if you
do that you will have symbols that have
different frequencies and you generally
don't want that you generally have equal
frequencies because again for our Markov
models for hashing for suffolk squeeze
it always thought to have equal Pablo
symbols but you could be that you want
to do and sax will allow that baby what
is it final question
empirically that's true you can't prove
because it could always be a special
case is not true for empirical is the
case if the lower bound is maximally
tight and that's true yes this relies on
the shape privacy's I mean the time six
starts in a very low values and then
rules
these symbols the number of symbols is
fixed as a user choice with the user
parameter so that isn't the case fits
the number of things to be only three
for example yes okay guarantee that the
number of the frequency will be similar
not for this time since so I mean either
way to figure out which number is this
in general we impose three or four at
number of symbols but actually you could
try to learn it use and say min
description left something Technic like
that and we've done some work on that
did it's nothing motivated because we
found basically three symbols virtually
any kind of problem any kind of data set
tend to work the best so we do we didn't
make it sex and adaptive distributions
different symbols but we need becomes a
waste of time the simple things this
works amazingly well so I hinted this
earlier on but i want to show you
getting in with detail that we actually
can convert time series sorry we can
convert shapes the time series so here
we have a shape and all we do is you
finally sent a point then mean value of
the shape and now we're going to
actually like have a clock hands go
around 26 degrees measure the local
distance here and that local distance
becomes the height of the y-axis so some
observations about this first of all
there's other ways of doing this but
it's actually I like quite a lot because
first of all there are no parameters its
go too deep m23 it's very fast and easy
and it's very very intuitive so why do
this why take shapes and map them in the
time series but again there's a whole
arsenal tools we can use intensity of
space let me give you some quick
examples this is the famous blood men at
image of two howler monkeys kind of
idealized here's the real deal here some
real howler monkeys and you actually can
see that euclidean distance here will
really be quite intuitive that how the
monkey is going to base it on to a
similar howler monkey and you clean this
and can reflect that and life is good so
we actually query with this will
probably find this thing here another
tool in our Arsenal is dynamic time
warping so in some cases actually the
shapes might be morphologically changed
so for example different gorillas might
have a different permanence of the brow
Ridge or a different permanence of the
jaw but in a time series space that
simply becomes the fact that these Peaks
move backwards and forwards in the wax
in the x axis and again we can
beautifully handle that within like that
i'm a time warping
so how do you
so another great questions I think the
questions rotation and variance
basically so if one skull is rotated
around 90 degrees lovely we absolutely
can handle that but I'm gonna just push
that aside moment actually parts and
papers to show you already talked about
offline this actually a general question
how do you make sure that the two skulls
are aligned in the right direction and
from another ignore that we actually can
handle at easily awesome it looks a
little bit it's um because if you can't
anything actually mapped correctly but
it's them because one of the bad ones
the love basically it's Hubble actually
changed around it looked at sorry i'm at
first but if i took this one here and
pull them down here double check the
lines working class it's a bit version
is done but if i cut this and pull it
down here and let me go
the hangover
oh sure especially with the normalizes
of your unit length so and the size of
shape makes a difference obviously have
a skull that's five times as big as
another skull it's obviously the
photograph was taken with it in distance
so we not like we all unit meant
basically it's about the you know McCann
walkman isn't enough this at least the
famous school five skull and when you
actually see the universities typically
we had this example here where they
filled in the missing parts of epoxy but
the real actual scholar was found is
basically missing all the nose region
now I want to match this it's probably
Maddox because if I insisted on matching
the missing nose region under the
pathological results so once again in
the time series arsenal we actually have
tool longest comes of sequence which
basically says try to match the shape
but if it's too hard to match something
basically give up and so here it matches
everything beautifully but just the nose
part it essentially gives up in that
part here it knows like a wild card I'm
not going to match this so again here's
some examples would simply show that we
can actually take these shapes convert
the time series and then product it up
in tools at them but I wouldn't point
that actually Euclidean distance tool
works exceptionally well by itself so
here's a question of primate skulls
based upon the Euclidean distance and
it's not the correct and evolutionary
tree so example the humans here should
be closer to the orangatang obviously
but it is subjectively sensible and at
the lower levels of tree all these red
things here all these blue things here
etcetera it is actually given to correct
sub tree or a tree of life notice by the
way to the humans or an outlier here
because a massive brain case so again
the point is simply this at this point
is that we can take shapes give up the
time series and then we can meaningfully
measure similarity in that space once
you believe that we're never actually
some real original data miner and shapes
and against some ongoing work we're
going to show some interesting things we
can do with ship shapes so if I someone
to look at we call image discords let's
give a database of shapes could be quite
large and the question is what's the
most unusual shape in the collection so
you can look as visually probably most
you will grab this one here
and this is actually correct answer that
was the most objective that we actually
have objective definition to this week
oughta shake this court and the
intuition is we want to find the shape
which has the maximum distance to its
nearest neighbor right so in terms of em
Island do you think of Hawaii it's been
a discord right its nearest neighbor
State if I be California of Alaska which
is very far away whereas Nevada has a
very close nearest neighbor so of all
the possible shapes in here which one
has the maximum distance to its nearest
neighbor and having to be the shape
right here so why it is useful let me
show you some examples so here's a
further large collection of em fruit fly
wings and often people modify the genes
and then see what difference it makes in
a phenotype of these insects right and
actually if you get the wrong geniune
like a LOX gene you can actually make a
antenna spell out of the wing bad
example so in this case actually we
mined this and this one popped out here
it could not a phenotype it's simply
someone damaged the wing basically but
the point is that we can actually find
this unusual shape quite efficiently as
well say oh
it is so much some of the outliers but
there are some kind of differences and
outlines new Cleveland space easy to
find roughly speaking but in this case
because of the rotation invariant metric
we can actually embed it you can in
space directly as well see in a moment
but it is my some of the outliers yes so
here's another example here we have a
very odd collection of petroglyphs
basically an ancient graffiti and we
won't actually find other unusual shapes
in this data set is of course is the
subset of it and so we found the number
one this court here is the shape right
here and the question is why if I take a
different shape let's say this one here
and look at it newest neighbor we type
of leads on here you can see actually
quite match very well some small local
differences are basically very similar
and this is true for almost all of them
they have some similar shape in the
database but that's what here doesn't
why is that so here is actually am the
red one and the blue one together is a
local difference here and the
explanation is that this one uniquely
has an arrow sticking into it it's a
bighorn sheep and someone stuck at arrow
into it which caused this large increase
in the time series space here as it
happens as a visual check and this is
the only one that actually has this
arrow in it two more quick examples and
here's a collection of projectile points
or arrowheads and it's hard to estimate
how many of these things actually are at
UCR alone we have a million of these
things unfortunately most of an not
photograph the index but with a small
set of these a few thousand of them we
run the algorithm and it pops out this
one here and I chose quite surprised to
know that Arrowhead can be asymmetric I
found some kind of special fishing tool
look like this and this example right
here is a subset of a large cell we
looked at a large slightly looked at and
most cells blood cells tend to be round
which is like a flat line in time series
space or a figure of eight shape this
basically corresponds to either two
cells put together or a cell divided and
again this is the unusual because it
looks like this and that's not unusual
because look like this and so on and so
forth but one of them this one right
here which comes from here is unusual
because actually tear drop shaped and it
has no near match ended
set and as it happens I think teardrop
shapes are indicative of them the kind
of anemia basically so I'll such an
example right now hopefully you believe
that this definition can be useful for
looking at large data collections I
guess the question is now how do we find
these things efficiently first of all
how do we find them in general here's
the actual matlab code it's very simple
to find them but unfortunately it's very
very slow let me explain the algorithm
by looking at this matrix we don't need
to build a matrix we can actually simply
compute things on the fly but it's easy
to understand that you look at the
matrix so the code basic is two nested
for loops which simply walk across each
column and then within each column visit
every single row and they look for the
smallest value apart from the diagonals
so here I come down I find that in this
column here one point once its smallest
value that's my best so far and I keep
looking for those at this point I'll
find here that 7.5 is a smallest value
in this column and it's actually the
largest smallest value so in this case
this is actually the discord in column 6
so the good news is the very simple
trivial algorithm the bad news is of
course is quadratic it actually comes
from space because I I not the key
distant memory but actually visit all
the cell's here have a quadratic
algorithm and the question is can we do
better than that and the answer is of
course yes so one simple observation is
going to help us here which is supposed
I'm searching across here so I've found
in this column 1 point 1 that's my best
so far and then here example I find two
isn't that so far when I get the next
column as I scan down if I find the
value here about that I go on which is
less than my best so far I can stop when
i find the 1.2 here i know there's no
point continuing on because this is not
going to be the discord and so i don't
have to visit this cell or this cell so
a very simple cool technique can help us
quite a bit
and we are kidding so it is an example
to the politics that's constructed but a
question on making something make a kind
of build it on the fly medicines on the
fly ok so this action tension could help
a lot and there's one other trick that
helped us quite a bit we can actually
have heuristics called outer and inner
which tell us the order in which they
visit these columns so I'm assuming a
for loop right now but goes from left to
right and then top to bottom but I could
simply pay me to that and go on any
permutation I could visit this one then
that one then that one and then when in
each column I can visit this one then
that one and this one etc and if we're
very careful it's like a huge difference
right if we actually visit them in a
special order things get a lot better
how much better let's imagine a magic
heuristic which is given to us by God
right what I haven't stick actually do
it would tell us that which admittedly
columns in order of discord value and in
the word we should actually jump to the
real discord first and then the second
best escort second and some support
right it happened then we would find a
large value here 7.5 early on I'm going
to do very good pruning and likewise for
the inner heuristic if you are magical
what we would do is that when we go to a
column we will jump to the smallest
value right away we'll go straight to
the nearest neighbor and it will be less
than our best so far and we could stop
we would have to look at the rest of
things in the call
yes so do the analysis basically is this
if we had this magical algorithm like
the first covered with until we actually
visit every single thing that's at r
over m and then an order to end number
of time to make one concept move we jump
to the nearest neighbor which stop so
basically b to n which is linear no I
crazy this is a magical object is that
what God can do we can't do this okay so
if we were magical and godless dinner
theater the heuristics there are always
things we'd not you go from quadratic to
linear right so my attention is very
good but the question is can we actually
do this so the answer is we can't
actually do we can approximate it very
closely so the observations are this
that all don't like that visit the
columns in this magical border as long
as we actually get a reasonably high
value early on it make some difference
so early on in our first few attempts
inning outer loop we're going to find a
pretty high value here and if we do that
we can prune quite well and your
observation is that for the inner loop
we already have to jump to the nearest
neighbor in constant time has obviously
jump to a near enough neighbor and maybe
but it's actually less than the common
best so far so it was a fifth nearest
neighbor or a 22news neighbor it might
be new enough to stop so beta only two
observations will not to try to
approximate the magic algorithm
you're just turning up around the space
to find the world no we knew that meant
I was ever charged so the pad to this
problem is actually based upon sex what
else we take our shape get rid of time
series convert the sex and I'm going to
put these sets words CIA into this loop
matrix here so it's the first shape CIA
and so CA goes here and I guess the next
shape was em c a b and that goes here at
some support so I'm going to populate
this could make things here are then
building this I'm also going to insert
these words into subjects file except
example image 1 was see a day I put a 1
here because image 1 came from there and
then for image to see Ivy see a big I
put it to hear an image tree it's all
the CAA CAA I have an overspill I have a
freedom okay don't we believe me
actually I can build these in linear
pattern and basically content space like
a very small confidence base so in
linear time I've built these i'm going
to use these two pucks make magic so the
first question is I want to visit the
outer loop where I'm going to find a
lightly discord very early on and how do
I do that well I had this count here one
two three and I can map it back into
here so everything that is here at CAA
this one here gets about a three it's in
here at the right of three there's
simply going to account of the number of
words that happen to map to that
particular the number of those words so
the intuition is that if I have an
unusual shape it probably had an unusual
time series which probably had an
unusual sax approximation so it's count
here is going to be very low in context
i have a very common shape is it have
HTML time series very similar sex words
and the count probably very high so my
outer magic heuristic is a bit this find
the smallest value in this column and
whatever that is i'm going to jump to
that value first the values typically
one and if it has some ties I'll jump to
them I'll take all the ties and go to
those first so my simple
information to the magic out of
heuristic is find a small value here and
then go to those values first in the
inner loop the same intuition kind of
works here so is I'm going to my search
and I want to see if this is the discord
or if not I want to find out very
quickly the intuition is I want to find
similar things with early on to base be
able to prune and how am I going to do
this well similar things to this CAA are
likely to be either one or I guess 731
because they map to the same sex word
they're probably similar they prefer a
small nearest neighbor distance and I
can actually abandon search early on so
this is my heuristic for the outer loop
so for security in a loop and my hope is
with those two simple heuristics i can
actually approximate the magical
algorithm so this going to ongoing work
I don't have a and detail results you
like now but on a small data set like
200 our heads we find out there to get
within like twenty two percent of the
magic algorithm and the good news is for
larger larger data sets we actually get
better and better and better we get a
statically close to the magical
algorithm essentially what solving a
quadratic problem in linear time now one
small problem is this is actually
empirically true all that we try but in
the worst cases of the quadratic it will
give me a database with every shape is
it identical I'm in trouble right but
for realistic data set some kind of
variance we actually get basically a
linear time algorithm
okay let me show you as company problem
and I'll do this is kind of a high level
details be a little bit faster now we
have a data set and the question is are
there any duplicates in this data set
right so trivially here I guess we have
this in this duplicate and then the
question is again how can we find
duplicates and find them efficiently and
once again we have everything that
permission for this basically we're
going to minimize you couldn't distance
between a pair of objects and one thing
and the question is is this useful and
I'm going to be very brief in shall use
one example so here we have a data set
about 4,000 given petroglyphs from all
over North America including Canada and
Mexico and the questions are there any
similar ones I mean subjective are
similar ones but what are the most
similar pair in this data set and
actually here's the answer an attention
quite interesting and what I'll notice
actually wet me rotation invariant
defined this so they're similar but one
rotated 90 degrees what's also
interesting is actually at these two
came two locations which only a hundred
fifty miles apart so potentially
actually simply some meaning to disk
basically although I should all know
this point okay so image more tips are
quite interested in this example but how
can we find them and again for time
reason we're gonna just kind of gloss
over this but basically idea is once
again sex we can use a sex plantation
and as it happens repeated patterns in
DNA strings are very important so going
to steal the mouse's algorithm take our
shapes convert the sax and then find DNA
repeated patterns essentially and then
because it slowed down in poverty we get
the data back to genetic algorithm we do
some cleanup work and then basically
linear time we can find these repeated
patterns using someone else's impatient
and I think you're pointing to point out
here is that you can really only do this
with sex it's hard to imagine how you do
this wavelets or four times on anything
else because it relies upon the ability
here or passion in the random projection
algorithm like I'm not include here but
I have a five minute bonus pieces
feature which I will try to get it okay
loving so conclusions that are quantum
25 minutes but the first conclusion is
I'm you probably notice basically right
there representation is everything with
the representation you can solve any
problem efficiently and for time series
data mining sex is probably the best
answer for most problems but the nice
kind of news out here hopefully is that
sex is also probably the best answer for
all kinds of problems with shapes too
and I really can overemphasize this I
really believe that sex actually is the
way to go virtually all kinds of
problems in time certain shape data mine
and you can just do things when you have
symbolic presentations you can't do in
the real space and you can simply use so
many clever clever tricks and again I
will go on into this but my kind of
conclusion was going to be in the end of
time and sex appeal I'm always
interesting new collaborators and I'm
always honest a new problems new data
sets and of course I'm always in testing
the money okay so here's a five minute
bonus DVD features you like we can
actually use sex to visualize very
massive data sets and here's how I'm
going to do that let's start with by
aggression here's some DNA from two
different animals and the question is
are they similar animals right an
obviously there's no way you could help
i look at this and of course is actually
small subset of a genome which is about
three billion base pairs and enamel it's
finally trick let's build a two-by-two
matrix and let's label them a TCG
arbitrarily and less actually counter
off and we see those letters in the DNA
sequence so in this case at
twenty-hundred time we saw see and 25
minutes at a time we saw a TA and so on
and so forth i can actually make more
complicated matrices is basically
cursive lead a little trick here and
that count every possible combination of
two ccct 86 cetera and I can do this
because many level I want to the other
one and and now I can counter often I si
si si si si te etc etc haven't done this
I now have a matrix of numbers and I can
map those two colors I can linearize all
the colors arbitrarily from 0 to 1
and in this case I see that this pixel
here for example occurs seven Central
Time so I can look up seven percent here
and paint it red once I've done that I
have converted DNA string into a color
good nap and I guess the question is now
so what let's actually look at some
files of DNA under Microsoft Windows the
traffic thing notepad I guess and here
the icons for Homo sapiens locks around
that vikarna etc etc and looking at this
you've no way have known are these
things very similar but let's actually
do this now with this trickle shown you
let's replace the normal icon with you I
kind of learned with this approach I
shown you in previous slides when I do
this I see this and the strong suggested
that these two things look alike and
those are things look alike and as it
happens this is the Indian elephant the
African elephant and this is the
chimpanzee and the human so it's not
into it would make some sense you can
look at these bitmaps and figure out
these are a pair and these repair okay
that's all the digression because I
talked about time series and the
question is conditioning some of a time
series and so what would it be actually
useful and the quick answer is of course
yes we have sex now arsenal tools and
with sex i can make a string a pseudo
D&amp;amp;H thing you like and I want to have a
suit of DNA string I can map it into a
matrix I can get the colors and like
this good so I can do this late fast the
question is is it useful so here's the
first example here are some brain waves
from rats and if you look at this it's
what like the Sesame Street game of
which when these things is unusual and
the answer I guess is this one looks
different those ones as it happens these
are all epileptic rats and this one
isn't okay let's try this I can actually
add that to this by mapping them into
Euclidean space based upon
multi-dimensional scaling I basically
find the similarities and kind of
cluster them in two dimensional space so
this actual data set is monthly power
demand for Italian electrical power when
I do this I said actually all my winter
months or over here and all my summer
months over here
but once in a month August's is
completely unique it's out there so why
does it look different and why is it far
from these things here and actually a
very Italian Aria European might notice
in italy in august entire country closed
down feed closes the government closes
and evan go to the beach and actually we
can see this if you plot the data right
here now of course in this case we can
actually see this anomaly if we plot of
the data but i guess utility this is you
can see anomalies without actually open
a MATLAB or Excel whatever to it
actually you have and in any case this
anomaly here or this cluster here is to
settle to say to my eye in this space
here we're going to see it better in
this space right here here's another
example this is a famous data set at
least some data mining but tests and
clustering algorithms and it allegedly
contains 70 heartbeats here's a subset
of them once again in the classic view
nothing really is added the value here
but in the bitmap view we see this there
appears to be too strong strong clusters
these guys here and those guys there so
what's going on why these guys so
different from these guys as it happens
the nut heart beats a grad student many
years ago made a mistake so these five
things here are not heartbeats they're
what's called pacemaker cells but
natural pacemaker is not electronic ones
so known as notice this even though many
people actually use the status of test
algorithms and again the value here is
that we can actually find this if we
part of the doubt and looked at it
potentially but we get it here for free
essentially when we copy or paste or
edit or move files around for free we
can actually see what's going on it's my
final example and I'm all done for the
day my hope actually use this for
basically almost like a Google toolbar
tool for queer by content so I can
search for documents based upon the data
was created its file size its type etc
and I can also search based on keywords
but I think about a more general search
search upon structure where you simply
say find me a file similar to this one
is an example of that it's kind of
trivalent contrived but it makes sense
here have a data set of large mammals in
America's
and I right click on the brown bear and
I asked for its nearest neighbor and so
we start cooking on index and the
nearest neighbor is the polar bear and
you can tell visually actually they look
similar by these two icons here or
bitmaps here and here as it happens last
night on CNN they announced they
actually had found the first polar bear
brown bear hybrid in the wild which kind
of interesting coincidence so I'll show
you actually take time series and map
into this and I think I can take DNA and
map it it is and right now we're working
on doing this for text right so using
latest on the index something else we
convert text into bitmaps and actually
works quite well if you look at my
papers they all are kind of similar
could only do one thing basically it
look at Shakespeare attends to look a
bit different and someone and so forth
and so the question is could we actually
use this will kind of fast search by
type basically find these similar
documents to this document right here
great I thank you for indulgence and now
I really am finished and so I'll be
happy to answer any questions you might
have
or some specific application areas where
you see this being applied I guess name
before 40 references
mirror shape thing yeah and what it has
probably seen as anthropology so an
apologist quickly have lots of the data
I mentioned and million arrowheads in
what part of Nevada alone possess in
like ten square miles that's evidently
about a hundred thousand petroglyphs and
it made the people don't know anything
about these things surprise me so an
topology is one possible example and
definitely looking at things like cells
in an biology and it's a tedious
actually look at every single cell the
Foo Fighter Wing's actually Excel sense
too because bar let's make lots lots of
data like this so those are some kind
potential applications and I'm hoping
people will just more when this work
kind of gets out there a little bit and
then we'll actually do my exam we're
looking up long video sequences
obviously martial arts and the idea is
we weren't trying to find tubular
sequences where the person actually has
the same pose if we have that kind of
collision that may actually london video
and then jump from one video stream to a
diff invito stream so basically we kind
of make fake it's called video textures
where we can combine different move
kicks and punches people have try this
most capped data and it's very hard to
do in the Civil example to have a shape
of which one how many will be right now
it actually looks exceptionally well so
basically for video games quite useful
to do this right we actually have a kick
and a punch and we have a kick and a
fall I'm actually kind of combine those
any combination of those basically you
can't sue let's also instead of using
hookers into new space or something like
that so we are looking silhouettes and
obvious anticipate there are four many
shapes you can look at silhouette you're
going to tell what it is virtually
that's always the case right so I mean
people's faces the easy regularity let's
face the bit on that for some shapes of
course the color the texture or internal
features are important and current event
on the hunt those but we have to do
something to initially start this fight
so but is potentially future work
other questions my order
and we do for one reason because it's
very heavily funded ten people can like
that kind stuff so we actually aren't
looking at them in the detection in this
kind of domain so you think about
unusual shapes and their type of match
shapes so of example even thing that
match in suitcases based on the shape
they figure out if it's been transferred
between different streams but not so
soon we actually look around at a high
level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
