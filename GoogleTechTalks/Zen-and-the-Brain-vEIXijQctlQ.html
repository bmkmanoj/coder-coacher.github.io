today to have our host our friend dr.
James H Austin James is a emeritus
professor of neurology at the University
of Colorado Health Sciences Center he is
one of the oldest and most respected
experts on the links between the
neurological workings of the human brain
and meditation he is the author of the
book zen and the brain which is as far
as I know one of the earliest and most
influential books on the topic he is
also the only real neuroscientist I know
who is also a profoundly deep meditator
and he's going to be very shy as in
there is by his quite enlightened so
making him a very rare master both in
neuroscience and meditation
James has other books include selfless
insight and then brain reflections he's
the only friend I have who doesn't use
email he and the Dalai Lama so the two
of them and he so and he's the only
friend who writes me letters by hand
because the Dalai Lama doesn't do that
oh so before we came here he asked
whether he should be doing the advanced
or the other generate all the version of
his hawk so I asked for the advanced
technical version so it is too out there
Blamey but it was good is his credit and
with that please welcome our friend
professor James Austin
thank you
Thank You Meg for your generous
hospitality and generous welcome to this
group I have a very easy or a very
difficult job talking to this group at
Google the difficult part of my job
relates to your high level of intellect
which paradoxically makes it more
difficult for you to understand unless
you remember how important it is to have
moments of insight if you can remember
the moments when you've had insight when
all your intellectual knowledge has
failed you but your intuition has given
you a burst of understanding then I have
an easy job so try to keep in mind those
moments of insight at your desk or out
of doors when a moment of insight has
clarified a problem that remained
impenetrable to your high level of
intellect
mang tells me that many of you in this
group have taken the course on
meditation and consciousness and so I
think it's appropriate that we all start
with a moment of meditation you've
already worked hard all this morning
you've gotten here you've come here on
time to this lecture so let's start with
a brief moment of meditation
the first slide is the old Taoist
yin-yang symbol and the purpose is to
point out that there are two aspects the
black and the white the male and the
female this and the that are
complementary not antagonistic they are
both necessary to be part of the cosmic
whole you might wonder how a seemingly
Orthodox neurologist and academic would
ever would ever be involved in anything
as esoteric as Zen Buddhism it started
when I was on sabbatical in Kyoto Japan
I was introduced fortunately to an
english-speaking Zen master and this is
the gate through which I entered this
rinzai zen temple daitokuji in 1974 it's
an ordinary gate of the kind we use in
the West and elsewhere in the world it
operates as a unit so that the top and
the bottom open simultaneously what I'm
about to describe to you as a theme
throughout this talk is something that
may seem unfamiliar but here's the theme
the theme is that when we turn on our
self-centered attention we exert in a
reciprocal opposite fashion or external
kind of attentiveness and contrariwise
when we turn on our attentiveness into
the external world we dampen our
resources that go into our
self-centeredness
and with this introduction let's turn to
the two different kinds of meditation
the attentive art of meditation for
those of you who have handouts this will
be on the handout so you needn't try to
memorize it but basically we start as we
did a few months ago by looking down and
usually at a spot in front of us in a
form of what's been called concentrative
meditation it's a more effortful kind of
attentiveness it's focused and it's
exclusive if we're pointing down like
this we're excluding the world all
around us and focusing on one point in a
deliberate one-pointed banner now this
requires our voluntary top-down
processing and so it is more self
referential we're in there doing it it's
the kind of attention that can evolve
later on into the absorptions and it
does involve our paying attention this
kind of attention this kind of awareness
is personalized we are in there doing it
ourselves now later on after we've
trained attention in a top-down manner
we move into a more receptive kind of
meditation by definition this is more
effort less it's 1/10 ofthis that is
unfocused and it is inclusive it will
take in
everything around us front back top and
bottom it's a more open universal bear
awareness and it expresses our
involuntary our involuntary
attentiveness to the world around us so
it by definition is more other
referential if self is everything inside
our skin other is everything outside of
our skin and this is the kind of
receptivity that can later shift into
more insightful intuitive modes of
processing it's called a choiceless
awareness because we are not choosing to
do it it happens so this is a more
anonymous kind of awareness anonymous
awareness now we have two ways two ways
of processing reality the one we're most
familiar with and the one that's easiest
to understand is this form the
egocentric self-centered kind of
processing
if this is the person doing it and
looking at an apple these lines of sight
from the Apple are all coming back into
the general axis of this person's
attentiveness and this person this
person has a frame of reference looking
at the outside world this person is
holding on with both hands to this frame
of reference and is seeing only what he
chooses to
there's another kind of reality which is
revealed to us without our being aware
of it and just as the third Eagle stands
for self the Greek word allo stands for
other so hallo centric reality is that
world that the brain perceives without
our knowing that it's doing so in what
it looks out out there and automatically
identifies these apples and positions
them in three-dimensional space in
relation to each other no lines as I
come back here to the person who is
doing this kind of additive processing
this is a low centric processing now the
two kinds of processing egocentric and
allocentric are on your handout but the
important thing to realize is that they
pursue different pathways in the brain
the egocentric pathway is in a sense the
northern pathway which proceeds in the
upper part of the brain the allocentric
pathway is the pathway the proceeds from
back to front through the southern part
the lower part of the brain next topic
on your handout and your handout has
these topics arranged in a serial manner
so if you proceed from the top you'll be
getting the whole outline of this
presentation the next topic we're
talking about is attention itself
William James the American psychologist
and philosopher
outlined the importance of attention and
he called it the Faculty of bringing
back a wandering attention over and over
again over and over again is the very
root of all of our judgment character
and will I'm going to make a little
different tack and also emphasize that
not only is this a voluntary process but
that attention operates involuntarily
so let's look at the attentive brain
here and to get oriented this is the
back of the brain and you're looking
down at the top of the brain with the
right hemisphere being on your right and
the left hemisphere being on your left
the nose is here and let's look at the
left hemisphere first and you'll notice
that has a lot of fine dots in it this
is to emphasize that the left hemisphere
operates in a discriminatory fine-grain
kind of processing and when it looks out
at the outside world and this outside
world is on the opposite side of the
environment because things are crossed
in the brain it looks out and sees with
discrimination fine-grain discrimination
it sees and hears with fine-grain
discrimination now you know that most
for most of us almost all of us our
language ability is centered over in the
left hemisphere whereas when we're
talking about attentiveness the
corresponding regions vary exactly in
this right hemisphere are specialized
for attention
most of the training in zen meditation
involves the training of attention the
training of attention both top-down and
bottom-up training of attention and here
we see the reason why because this right
hemisphere you'll notice has a lot of
spaces in between the lines it's not a
fine-grain it's more of a coarse-grained
kind of processing and when it looks out
into the opposite visual field there is
plenty of room between these lines for
it to us to insert values atmospheres of
aesthetic appreciation and judgment then
because it sends a message over to the
left hemisphere through the corpus
callosum it enters into a bargain with
the left hemisphere it's an age-old
bargain it's been going on for millennia
and it says in effect left hemisphere
you can take over the responsibility of
words and language and speaking and
understanding language but I'm going to
co-opt everything that you see over on
the right side of the world and claim it
as mind and so the right hemisphere pays
attention to both sides of the outside
environment and this becomes very
important because it means that the
right hemisphere is poised to be
receptive to the whole outside or
many years ago it was theorized with
good evidence that these two pathways
were organized into a ware pathway and
into a what way it's now I think more
reasonable to say that this northern
route is a where is it in relation to me
back in the center and to say that the
southern route is a what is it
pathway that arrives at identification
of the object that is seen out there
those of you who know some Anatomy will
notice an interesting point about this
northern route because it goes through
the angular gyrus here on its way north
into the parietal lobe and it misses
supramarginal gyrus which is more
involved in the ventral kind of
attentiveness this slide is composite
slide that shows the brain and what it
perceives out there as a in a
theoretical way we'll start with two of
these spots up on the top part of the
brain because one of them is
intraparietal sulcus or the IPS and the
IPS is linked with the frontal eye field
which is in the frontal part of the
brain and the two together are our two
modes of top-down attentiveness we spoke
top-down attentiveness earlier and it's
on one of
handout tables you'll notice that these
two modes of attention are in a position
to be overlapped by the egocentric
pathway of processing so that the two
together egocentricity and top-down
attentiveness are very easy to link
together into one giant function on the
other hand lower down is the temporal
parietal junction which includes the
superior temporal gyrus here and the
supramarginal gyrus and it links up in
the same network in circuitry with the
inferior frontal cortex which is farther
forward in the brain you're looking here
by the way at the brain where the
occipital lobe is back here the seeing
part of the cortex whereas the frontal
lobe and nose is way up here in front
furthermore this lower ventral pathway
for attention is closer to the
allocentric or the other centered mode
of processing reality and tucked into
the under surface of the temporal lobe
is a module called efg or the fusiform
gyrus this is a gyrus that specialized
both for color perception and for the
processing of facial features thank you
all right so here's this brain and it's
looking up into the outside world and
what is it seeing well it's seeing four
quadrants of vision and let's look at
them separately why you might ask is
there a red rim around the lower visual
field well that's because the egocentric
pathway starting as it does in the upper
part of the occipital lobe is much more
efficient at processing things that are
below the horizon so upper part of the
occipital lobe more efficient at
processing lower down and ladies there
are several of you in the audience if
you are balancing a baby on your lap
it's very important for you to be using
the functions that are up here your
functions of touch and proprioception
because they will help you hold that
baby accurately on your lap so the baby
doesn't fall and gentlemen if you are
hammering a nail with your hammer and
you hold the nail in your left hand it's
very important for you to have
proprioception and touch so that you can
come down with your hammer accurately on
the head of the nail because if you
don't your fingers are history so this
pathway the egocentric pathway is highly
specialized for action and it depends on
the parietal lobe for its proprioceptive
and
Touch skills and notice that these
objects that it handles are down close
to it in its Perry personal space in the
envelope of space right around it Within
Reach
Within Reach on the other hand consider
the allocentric pathway starting in the
lower part of the occipital lobe
remember things are crossed in the brain
so this part of the brain is most
efficient at processing items that are
up here in the upper visual fields above
the visual horizon what is up here well
in ages past it would be very handy to
detect this saber-toothed tiger by your
sense of hearing audition or your sense
of color vision so that you could detect
the difference between the stripes on
the tiger and the leaf patterns that are
in the underbrush and it's important
that the tiger be detected at a distance
away from you so that it doesn't wind up
in your lap and having escaped the tiger
if you wanted to be in a contemplative
mode and thank your lucky stars you
could look out in the distance at the
blue sky and the clouds and the
mountains and be in a more relaxed frame
of mind these are the differences
between vision and audition which are in
the temporal lobe and touch and
proprioception the circuitry of which is
in your parietal lobe
now we're looking here at a functional
MRI scan of the left we're looking at
the right hemisphere from the outside
the nose is here by the inferior frontal
gyrus and the occipital lobe is back
here in the back and you see these same
structures that we've spoken about
before but the interesting point here is
that the intraparietal sulcus is right
next to this blue spot which is the
superior parietal lobule
what is the superior parietal lobule
it's your somatosensory Association
cortex and what does that mean it means
that this is the part of your brain that
understands that you have an arm a leg a
head and a trunk on both sides and it
puts these together so that you
understand and know instinctively that
you have a body that you can active
which will be your agency for working as
a unit in the outside world so this is
where your sense of physical sense of
self comes together so notice how handy
it is to have your top-down attention
mode right next to this organizational
principle that enables you to know you
have a whole body scheme with which you
can operate in the outside world what
about the bottom-up tension and its
processing well it's in the temporal
parietal Junction and the inferior
frontal gyrus and there are some yellow
colors here and that's simply to remind
us that our top-down attentiveness and
our bottom-up the tented
have to be merged in a very
sophisticated manner in order for us to
put together the kinds of attention that
we need to operate in our daily lives so
the medial frontal gyrus and the
inferior frontal gyrus operate
particularly on the right side to arrive
at this merger of functions that enables
us to operate in your handout is a table
that simply summarizes the responses of
the ventral the lower and the dorsal
kind of attention systems and I won't
dwell on that any further it is
important however to make a distinction
of visual distinction between top-down
attention which is a sharply pointed
remember exclusive kind of attention it
operates on a foundation of bear
awareness
it has a pre attention mode which is
entirely involuntary and which is right
out there at the point and the point
here is simply to illustrate the
top-down attention is the Vanguard that
is out at the tip of all of our
processing in computer programming there
is also I gather something that is out
at the forefront of the processing and
in the brain it is the sharp point of
attention that impales the topic that we
wish to pay attention to so that the
rest of our processing can come in and
know where to operate think how
important it is to this pen
which has lots of ink in it to be able
to have a point in order to write with
and you'll understand the pointing
function of attention and you'll
understand why William James regard it
as it as so crucial to our operations so
this is the kind of top-down attention
and the contrasting form is our
bottom-up attentiveness which is a more
global kind of receptivity it also
functions at the level of bear awareness
and it has a subconscious processing
also and everything above its threshold
of consciousness it does have the
potential of entering our consciousness
but most important everything below this
level operates at a subconscious level
so the bottom-up attentiveness much of
what goes on is not within our conscious
understanding it goes on subconsciously
farther down on your handout is the
issue of the difference between our
physical sense of self and our psychic
sense of self Zen training in particular
emphasizes doing away with the
disadvantageous aspects of our
self-centeredness and to understand how
this is so you need to know the
difference between the physical body
which is your physical sense of self the
Greeks called it that your soma
and your and your cognitive and your
affective and your instinct
of self which are your psychic sense of
self which the Greeks called our psyche
in so soma and psyche are very different
I know because I can feel mice my arm
that I have a somatic sense of self but
can you touch a thought can you reach
out and touch your thought your thoughts
are intangible
so our soma deals with tangible things
and our psyche deals with cognition and
emotion and instincts and these are
intangible categories of functioning now
let's look at the self in operational
terms and try to see how it operates in
our daily lives and to do so what helps
to divide the self into three
operational sub compartments the most
obvious one is the eye the part of our
self that we know exists
we can feel it we know that it's there
and we can watch it act and these are
all very adaptive functions similarly
the me is that part of our self to which
things happen if I don't look carefully
when I'm crossing a curb and going out
in traffic I'm going to be hit by an
automobile and something very bad is
going to happen to me so this is an
adaptive part of the self
me and similarly the mine helps us
identify our thoughts our body parts and
our possessions if we're going in the
parking lot
at Googleplex and trying to find our
automobile it helps to know which
automobile is mine and where we parked
it because otherwise we'll be lost
without our car so these are all the
adaptive good parts of having an i me
mine but there are disadvantages there's
a downside there are cons
to being a self there are maladaptive
aspects of the self that we should like
to do away with the first and easiest to
identify by our friends or our
references are aggressive arrogant self
self we have another self
Here I am trying to get rid of myself
and I have this better self that is
somehow in the circuitry and this tells
us how difficult it is to get rid of our
self we have this eco self which seems
to subside by day it needs to meditate
day more so our friends know that we
have an arrogant and aggressive self but
this part is sort of hidden from us but
the me part of our self this we
recognize because this is our battered
and our fearful and our anxiety ridden
self this is the part that gives us high
blood pressure and all kinds of physical
and mental ailments and how about the
mine the mine of course is also
clutching it's captured self indentured
it craves things it over eats it wants
too much and these are the in short the
ABCs of the I Me Mine the aggressive
besieged and clutching parts of themself
that we can do without now as the new
century dawned a group of investigators
at Washington University in st. Louis
Deborah Gus nard and Marcus Rachel
looked over a bunch of PET scans pom pom
PET scans it had been done in the past
and discovered something interesting and
here you're looking at a summary of what
they found
because we're looking now at the inside
of the brain previously we've been
looking at the outside of the brain now
we're looking at the brain from the
inside and you recognize that it's the
inside because it's the right hemisphere
and here is the corpus callosum that has
been cut the bit bridge between the two
hemispheres and what they found was that
there were two hotspots in this inner
part of the brain at rest at rest their
subjects were trying to relax not do
anything mentally or physically and here
was a hot spot in the medial prefrontal
cortex and here was a hot spot in the
medial posterior parietal cortex front
of the brain here back of the brain here
notice by the way the other centered a
low centric pathway coming along here
through the under part of the occipital
and medial temporal cortex and similarly
the other major hotspot was here in the
angular gyrus which as we've noticed is
along this egocentric pathway that leads
up to the superior parietal lobule so
here at rest are three hotspots what
happens when the subjects are then given
a task which requires them to be
introspective and to look into their
self these hotspots become even hotter
and various lines of evidence suggests
that these hot spots in short are
engaged at least partially in generating
our sense of psychic self-identity and
in relating this identity to our
environment and to ways to navigate
through our environment so if you ask
what are these hotspots doing anyway
one might suggest by way of speculation
that this is how you remember where you
were born what your bedroom look like in
your early formative years where you
went to high school who your friends
were in high school where you went to
college and what your office looks like
at Googleplex this is where you fit in
to your long narrative history and into
that part of your environment
which you lay down with circumstantial
details so that you know how to find
your way around your environment but now
what happens when the subjects are given
an acute task an acute task that
requires them to be very attentive to
their external environment if you
remember the first slide with the self
and external environment you'll know and
can anticipate that these hot spots
become cooler these self hot spots
become cooler when attentiveness is
required
and demanded by events in the external
environment and this is since been borne
out by functional MRI you're looking
here at the top slide at the functional
MRI scans and here you're looking at the
left hemisphere with the frontal lobe
here and the occipital lobe here and
here is the posterior posterior
cingulate cortex back in the medial
parietal lobe and here is the medial
prefrontal cortex and here's the angular
gyrus so that this is a resting
functional MRI scan and we still have
these three major hotspots but now the
subjects are inside in the functional
MRI scanner for 300 seconds or five
minutes and we see something fascinating
because we see that when the cool spots
get hotter the hot spots get cooler and
when the hot spots get hotter the cool
spots get cooler and this is happening
in this subject about three times a
minute now this is a very very slow
cycle ace endogenous intrinsic cycle of
the brain it's not clear exactly what
the mechanism is but it's probably a
combination of some metabolic cycle and
some bioelectric cycle it's much slower
than the breathing rate of say 18 per
minute because this is only three
where could such a basic rhythm come
from and that of course is an
interesting problem for neuroscientists
to settle and if you're wondering about
the IPS which is cooler in the FE F
which is cooler in the TPJ at the
inferior frontal cortex which is cooler
rest assured that twenty minutes twenty
seconds later things will be different
in here
twenty seconds later is the evidence of
a spontaneous reciprocal shift in the
other direction as the hot spots get
hotter the cool spots get cooler
question no no this is spontaneous the
subject is not trying to do anything
this is an involuntary spontaneous and
non Janice reciprocal shift that's going
on by itself thank you for your question
so here is the cooler angular gyrus and
the cooler medial posterior parietal and
the cooler medial prefrontal cortex and
here again as a reminder is the
reciprocal function we've been talking
about now the question then might be
those of you who meditate and who go to
a meditative retreat let's say you've
gone through a day-long retreat on the
weekend retreat and you've gone for a
seven-day retreat you're very relaxed
and yet very receptive very acute very
sensitized to your environment and
you've been doing this for not for a
week or so but
been doing this for some years what
would happen if you're just there
relaxed in a receptive mode of
attentiveness
well speculation here is a model to
think about here is your allocentric
mode of other referential attentiveness
going up and down maybe three per minute
and here is your self-centered mode
going up in a reciprocal fashion
spontaneously and then all of a sudden a
triggering stimulus comes from the
outside a triggering stimulus a
triggering stimulus has been described
in Zen terms in Buddhist terms for many
many centuries for Zen master aq who was
meditating out in a boat in a rowboat
out in center of Lake Biwa in Japan at
night the triggering stimulus was a bird
that flew over and above him a bird that
he was unaware of and the bird said ah
and Zen master oku dropped into a
certain extraordinary state of
consciousness why well we've seen that
there is this reciprocal arrangement
that goes on spontaneously and we're
speculating that is allocentric other
referential attentive processing would
be captured and very hyper attentive
and similarly in the reverse reciprocal
fashion there would be a deactivation of
his self-referential processing which is
in red and down here and after a
variable but unknown period of time
because time would drop out his
allocentric processing would be at a
higher level and as a residual during
the during the afterglow phase his
egocentric processing would be at a very
low level and much of his prior
maladaptive self would have been cut off
cut off question a variable period of
time but I would say anywhere from hours
to a few days thank you for your
question
I've just come back from Beijing where I
was given to my surprise mmm this
ceremonial sword I thought it might
interest the audience as curiosity but
it also helps me explain how the sword
cut that is described in the old
literature which is the sword of the
bodhisattva of enlightenment than
Juicery how it operates and nicely
slices off at just the right parts our
sense of physical and psychic self that
is disadvantageous to our well-being and
to the well-being of others now you may
think it odd that any quasi religion or
quasi philosophical or any other system
of human endeavor would speak of a sword
cut as a metaphor for a state of
consciousness that would supervene but
this is the same way than my Zen master
described such a moment to me and the
technique that he used when something
like this
he said a cut will open up in the mind
and to illustrate the depth of the cut
he put both of his hands down in this
manner and touched his fingers to
indicate a big long v-shaped cut in the
mind so we are talking and there is and
there is a word in Japanese
kirei which describes such a cut in the
mind now if the self vacates hmm the
center of consciousness which it does
and in the centre is an insight that
comprehends all things in the outside
world as they really are in the absence
of self and if there's no fear at that
moment and no time and proprioception
the physical sense of self is
unregistered and if perfection is
registered throughout the outside world
at that moment how is it possible that
such a moment can occur again we're
talking about a model explanation mm but
the model begins with the thalamus but
what are we looking at here we're
looking at the left side of the brain
nose here back of the brain here we're
looking at the thalamus which is a
paired structure this is the left
thalamus and we're seeing the largest
nucleus in the whole thing most which is
the pulvinar and the pulvinar on the
model that you have there is indicated
in a in a yellow orange
and if you see a yellow orange spot
you're looking at the pulvinar what is
the pulvinar do the pulvinar specializes
in salience that's the quality that
enables the foreground item of interest
to leap out and a background to subside
and become the background so the
pulvinar is a very smart nucleus to have
at the onset of all of our perceptions
now what you're looking at in color is
mostly the dorsal part or the upper part
or the northern part of the thalamus and
the other item of interest is a lateral
posterior nucleus and it's connected
with the superior parietal lobule which
is where we organize our physical sense
of self in front of that are the three
limbic nuclei of the thalamus through
through these three nuclei come all of
the messages that rise up from our
hypothalamus our hippocampus our
amygdala all of our emotional life
passes through these three limbic nuclei
in the front of the thumbs and it so
happens that each of these three nuclei
are the passageway up to those three
hotspots in the cortex which are our
sense of self so the way the circuitry
is arranged in the brain all of the
information which comes up from the
limbic system and comes up in a
bottom-up manner that comes up through
the limbic system and drives our cortex
with all of our wants all of our
attachments all of our emotions first
goes through
these three limbic nuclei in the front
of the dorsal thalamus so we're talking
about the dorsal tear first but notice
the ventral pulvinar remains as does the
rest of the ventral nuclei and the
ventral pulvinar goes up to the fusiform
gyrus and all of the other information
that passes along the allocentric
other-centered
kind of processing so then how is it
possible to drop out all of this dorsal
thalamus and therefore rid ourselves of
our anxieties and our sense of self and
the answer is that it is not possible
it's not possible
unless you pay attention to another
nucleus in the thalamus which is the
reticular nucleus think of the reticular
nucleus as a cap that fits over the rest
of the thalamus and because it has many
GABA gamma-aminobutyric acid nerve cells
in it it exercises an inhibitory role on
the rest of the dorsal thalamus
so because the thalamus and the cortex
normally operate in an oscillating mode
very quickly back and forth the
reticular cap enables the thalamus to
shut down its Celaeno cortical system
and to cut off our sense of self now you
may say what is the evidence for this in
my own experience the evidence for this
in your own experience is that what
happens when you
go into your bedroom turn out the lights
and drop off to sleep in the evening at
night why do you fall asleep your vision
drops out your hearing drops out your
sense of physical self drops out all
courtesy of your reticular nucleus in
addition to other circumstances and why
is the thalamus important it's important
because every thing that you have
experienced since you first sat down in
this chair this morning all of your
perceptions have had to go through your
thalamus in order for you to understand
in the cortical level what's going on
with the exception of smell and if
you've smelled a coffee or the onions
coming from over here that's only
because smell is the only exception all
the rest have to go through your
thalamus now like the rest of the
Western world the people in Holland were
used to a door that operates as a unit
from top to bottom until about 1600 and
then some Dutchman said hey why don't we
design another kind of door let's design
a door that is hinged at the top and
independently at the bottom so we have
more options and if our wives are inside
here and the kids are down here playing
at the doorstep she can look down and
watch the kids or if it's a very hot day
and we want to get some cool breezes
from a distant source we can close the
top part and open up the bottom part and
let the cool breezes come in and sweep
along the floor and if we want to close
off the world at night in security we
can close both halves of the door as we
drop off to sleep the Dutch door is a
metaphor for the way the dorsal thalamus
opens and closes at different kinds of
days now there are some triggers of
historical interest the first of course
is that is the moment the episode
involving siddhartha gautama about 2,500
years ago who was meditating beneath the
Bodhi tree in the pre-dawn hours when he
looked up and saw the morning star what
is the morning star the morning star was
well known to the ancients the morning
star is the planet Venus and this is the
way the planet Venus was painted in back
in the early Chinese dynasties mmm she
was painted as a white goddess and as an
indication of the harmony that was
involved in her being she is shown
holding a lute and as further evidence
that she was present in the early
morning hour
if you look up here you can see that she
has a rooster in her crown evidencing
what goes on in the first part of the
morning and next time you go up north
and visit Seattle do visit the Seattle
Asian Art Museum because in the Asian
Art Museum you will see this statue
which is entitled a monk at the moment
of enlightenment you'll notice that like
the Buddha who looked up and saw the
morning star this monk is also shown
looking up at the moment of
enlightenment the technique of looking
up as a meditative practice is well
known in Tibetan Buddhism and when
Mattia Ricard was here in 2007 about
that time he was also writing a book
about shot car and enlightened sage in
Tibetan Buddhism in the nineteenth
century and what shab car had to say is
this I raised my head looking up and saw
the cloudless sky I thought of absolute
space free from all limitations and then
experienced a freedom without center
without end in translation the cloudless
sky is the sky that is free of all
delusions absolute space without limits
is the space that extends around us as a
low centric space
the freedom is the liberation that is
part of an enlightened state a moment
without center means no self is in the
center without end
meaning infinite and so as we go out the
door through which we entered I thank
you for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
