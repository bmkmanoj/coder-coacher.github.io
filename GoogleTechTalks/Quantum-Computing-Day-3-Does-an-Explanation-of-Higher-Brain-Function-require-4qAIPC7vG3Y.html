the certain final Tech Talk on quantum
computing where we are going to explore
the question whether an explanation of
higher brain function requires
references to quantum mechanics and
essentially what we would like to do is
in the last talks you saw how we mapped
a human type tasks that is image
recognition pattern recognition to a
quantum chip and how the information
flow looked like and how we could deal
with issues like preserving coherence
among the qubits so now we want to
follow the natural idea does this have
any bearing on the functioning of the
brain and revisit the hypothesis that
quantum effects are necessary to
understand brain function before we get
there let's briefly review what sort of
today's mainstream viewers on how brain
function comes about and essentially we
are classically neurodynamics so as you
know a human brain sitting in the head
is composed of 10 to the 11 neurons I've
pictured one here where essentially you
have a cell body around which signal
emanates essentially an electrical
signal that travels along this path here
called an axon and which branches out -
like a tree and those axon endings make
connections via what's called synapses
and they touch another branching
structure of the neuron here's the so
called dendritic tree and then when the
electrical signal travels along hits the
synapses and the electrical signal gets
converted into a chemical signal which
then in turn if enough is accumulated
can give rise to another electrical
signal and so on so basically this
neuron is what neurobiology views as a
unit of
information processing in the brain and
it was first formalized by McCulloch and
Pitt's in 1943 which is now considered
to be the start of artificial
intelligence as a field and they simply
model it as a unit that creates a
weighted sum so all the electrical
inputs from the other neurons they are
weighted by some synaptic strengths
being summed up and then the sum is
compared in a threshold unit to a given
threshold and if the threshold is higher
or the accumulated signal is higher than
the threshold it signals and then his
signal travels to the other neurons in
the network by doing this essentially
you treat the brain as a touring machine
and what follows from this that the
brain executes Turing computable
functions think this audience doesn't
need an explanation what this means
essentially what follows from this is
that we would conclude that today's
computers at least in principle are
sufficient to emulate brain function and
this view going forward I will call
classical neural dynamics or strong AI
hypothesis interchangeably so now to see
how far we get with such an explanation
let's look at what's the field of
artificial intelligence has been able to
accomplish so far and it's not a
systematically the listing will only
look at highlights so let's look at what
we can explain or in this approach what
can we reproduce well so obviously
memory is singed for today's computers
computer memory being much more faithful
and that of humans also in arithmetic
operations a little pocket calculator
easily outperforms you when it comes to
things like multiplication also it's
pretty fair to say that the best chess
players today are machines and not
humans if you followed a little bit the
DARPA competitions on
economic vehicles you can see that a
task of a stretch of C nearly hundred
miles to be done by an autonomic vehicle
is something that's possible today even
though I would caveat said for human and
say if singing of an pre story on human
venturing off from the location of his
village and then hunting some deer and
then trying to come back let's say a
stretch of 30 miles just having his eyes
nose ears is a much harder task than
what autonomous vehicles have to do
today since I have a GPS system highly
specialized sensors so the task that's
being solved there is not really on par
with what humans do so in another area
our own area and face recognition a
similar milestone has been reached last
year when in tests was the government it
came out that when it comes to
recognizing faces in photo collections
and maybe of people you don't know and
say I present you a photo album showing
some Chinese family then most of us
would perform poorer than a machine in
telling which faces ours is and
belonging to the same person so these
are all areas where we have quite some
good success more moderate success sort
of where is in the area of learning even
though we have very effective
architectures for machine learning today
it's probably fair to say that an
important disciplines such as learning
from few examples or reinforcement
learning or weekly supervised learning
machines are by far not as effective as
humans are and then there's the areas
where today's picture doesn't help us
come up with a good explanation at all
those areas are consciousness we do not
serve problem with the video system
okay I will just continue so things that
we cannot explain as well it's obviously
consciousness and I will define a little
bit later what I mean exactly by using
this term the question of free will also
here and should maybe bring some of
those things up going back to learning
strong AI would have it that in
principle just can be achieved when it
comes to consciousness strongly I would
say is is an epiphenomenon it has no
functional role hence we don't need to
explain it free will in this picture
simply does not exist
creativity can in principle be achieved
maybe just the software and hardware
power is not quite there yet however is
there I would say if you look where we
are today take a task like building an
energy efficient vehicle then today it's
just we have light years away from
handing the task it's a design of such a
big to computers if you would sort of
have large data base with all the
elements you can use in a vehicle or
future elements you may be able to use
its today inconceivable that machine
would come up with a good solution
that's probably the reason why we are
still here and other companies even
worse reaching metal levels would let's
say end the example was a car if
somebody comes up with the idea and to
really make house energy efficient let's
involve satellites who knows the
position of all cars in the city and
then drives and such that we avoid
acceleration phases will save a lot of
gasoline that I would call jumping to a
meta-level now if one tries to formalize
this mathematically one might say as
it's just a form of creativity maybe
just with a vastly expanded space of
solution and then again strong AI would
have said in principle we can do this
same with natural language
singing and then a final element I want
to mention because historically is that
it is important are there any things
that humans can do that a touring
machine cannot do personally I haven't
seen anything in convincing example of
this but other researchers such as
Penrose is of a different opinion there
so now you see where the explanatory
gaps are and whenever you have a
shortfall an explanation
it's may be time to review your theory
and it's the traditional entry door for
quantum ideas into brain theory is to
attempts to explain consciousness mostly
there and also free will John Searle was
here at Google and couple of weeks ago
and gave the talk on his ideas how
quantum mechanics and free will might be
connected but and it was also my goal to
make a contribution to the HR problem
what consciousness might be but then
soon learns that it might be better and
more prudent to go for a more modest go
I tried to argue that learning in
creativity reaching meta levels that
these are those human abilities
essentially neat or can take advantage
of quantum processes and explaining this
might be sort of a stretch on the way to
explain consciousness so I'm quickly
looking at these types of problems as
you probably know problem solving as I
just call traditionally in artificial
intelligence often it's an np-complete
problem and it is of the form where you
have an objective function over some
domain D mapping into the real numbers
and then solving this problem means or
amounts to finding the global minimum of
this function and we have looked in the
last talks how a quantum computer is
extremely helpful solving this task we
also looked specifically at image
matching as another heart and p-complete
computational problem and we saw how
this could be
mapped onto an energy minimization
problem some things that came short a
little bit last time is that learning me
here in our context looking at the
training of a neural network is actually
a np-complete task as well for those who
are not entirely familiar with this
essentially a neural network is
essentially a collection of McCulloch
and Pitt's neurons similar to those or
exactly like those introduced on the
first slide and you have some input
neurons some hidden neurons and an
output neuron and those are connected by
a synaptic strengths and essentially
what such network could do for example
is to define a separating function
between two classes and some feature
space let's say here this blue guys and
the red guys and by choosing different
weights you essentially get different
discriminating functions and learning in
this context means you choose your way
it's such that you minimize the errors
when classifying these two groups and
again a training problem can be
formulated as an optimization problem
where you have essentially a function
that measures the overall error and you
try to tune your weights such that you
minimize the overall error again an
optimization problem just to avoid maybe
a misconception some people might think
on your network so old-school I don't
use this anymore I use a support vector
machine so or I use boosting
architectures let me just remind you
that as VMs and boosting essentially as
simply you can look at them as
simplified version of a more general in
your network structure where you just
have fixed the weights in the first
layer from input to the hidden units and
you only apply your theory and learning
algorithm to the second layer then the
algorithm associated with support vector
machine and boosting are not np-complete
anymore
but what you find is there is a loss of
representation of power you cannot solve
all the problems anymore that the full
architecture could do so you're not
really escaping and P completeness so um
hence is maybe not a very deep sort but
I want to propose a new theory for
computational role of quantum mechanics
and brain function and this simply
states that human level problem-solving
learning and pattern matching as we just
have seen require or make use of quantum
annealing in the style that we discussed
in the last talk or a different way of
saying almost the same thing as human
abilities that requires a solution of a
heart optimization problem rely on
quantum annealing so to say the same
thing pictorially I assume and I borrow
his a term from John Eckert's and is
that somewhere in the brain is what I
would like to call a quantum box and
this there is an encoding process that
takes heart distills heart problems out
of learning or out of pattern matching
and offers it to the quantum box where a
quantum annealing process runs a
solution is being found again not always
the optimal but close to optimal or
hopefully as close to optimal as
possible and then some decoding process
takes place to offer this problem back
to the more classical functioning parts
of the brain so again here's the
acquaintance box responsible for quantum
annealing functional role is it solves
heart optimization problems so to offer
a complete theory of course I should say
something about what is the
physiological substrate how is this
Quenton box realized in the brain
frankly my theory is not complete in the
sense that I'm not in the position to
offer what the physiological substrate
could be however we will study that
there are numerous building blocks or
what I would call building blocks have
been identified in biology that could
very well serve
constructing the system of the nature I
have discussed but before we get there
let's quickly do an historical review of
the quantum hypothesis of brain function
and consciousness and I have picked our
two strands that I think are most well
worked out and think most interesting so
let's start with the first one pretty
most known one in the seminal book the
emperor's new mind Roger Penrose in 89
has proposed the following he argues
that mathematical reasoning what
mathematicians do is essentially a non
algorithmic process by appealing to good
theorem he argues that mathematicians
human mathematicians can do more as a
nattering machine furthermore he
postulates that there is a quantum
process he calls objective reduction
that causes the quantum wave function or
quantum superposition to collapse and
here I have a little picture how the
idea would be essentially think of a
particle like an electron and think of
the superposition in the position basis
where you have let's say one the state
of the electron could be it's sitting
over here to the left and the other
wavefunction could be one that's here
over to the right and essentially ever
since the real state however is a
superposition out of these two states
then what
Penrose observed is to say essentially
these two states of the electron
correspond to do two states that have
different mass contribute distributions
and essentially gravity and quantum
mechanics as you know hasn't been fully
married in physical series yet and he
said if you were to account for
gravitation then essentially gravitation
added to this picture would make the
situation unstable and essentially make
the superposition collapse if it reaches
a certain
amount of energy separation or in this
picture it's actually painted a little
bit differently as you know in general
relativity mass distributions determine
the configuration of space-time so each
of the two electron configurations
essentially correspond to a different
configuration of space-time and then
such a superposition would essentially
cause little bubbles to occur in
space-time and shorty argues that nature
doesn't like this and as these bubbles
grow to a certain scale then those would
collapse and this is this process he
calls or mathematically speaking
probably Hornet probably would amount to
adding a nonlinear term the Schrodinger
equation again there's a new type of
quantum mechanics being proposed here
not standard quantum mechanics and one
would have to say is that today's
experiments with super positions that
self large molecules put a very tight
bound on what those nonlinearities could
be at best at continuing with Penrose
idea
finally he suggests that the objective
objective reduction amounts to selecting
platonic information that is embedded on
a fundamental level of space-time and
then teaming up was Hameroff in
anesthesiologist in 96 he suggested or
also some suggested sets his height in
the brain where objective reduction
occurs as Hawking and microtubule II
here you see a picture of those
microtubule essentially to the
scaffolding as it's often said in cells
as the structure that all prima cells in
the human body am half and they argue
that this process of r is orchestrated
inside those microtubules hence the term
orchestrated objective reduction now in
ninety nine very important paper by max
tegmark comes along who studies this on
a quantitative basis as you have learned
one of the key elements you need to
watch out for if you want to do quantum
computing is you need to keep coherence
intact or decoherence at bay and then he
looked at the idea or how long would a
superposition of the neuron that is
either a firing or in a non firing state
how long would such a superposition last
and he finds that those are extremely
short times and he finds a similar thing
for excitations and microtubules those
that are used in Hameroff and Penrose
theory you have a table out of the tech
mark paper that shows the object in
neurons a microtubule e and you see
different models for the environment
colliding with water colliding with ions
and then you see is extremely short a
coherence times 10 to the minus 20 to 10
to the minus 13 and he concludes from
there that those processes are not
plausible candidates to do any
meaningful quantum computation the brain
however and here's something that we
bring in having learned to build real
quantum chip is that tech marks
calculations were done in the position
basis and a notion that hasn't been
brought into the discussion at all is to
ask what is the computational basis
because we have seen that let's say for
the DVF chip you had decoherence in the
energy basis but that didn't amount
automatically to decoherence and the
computational basis which was different
so what I would argue is that tech max
calculations happily or are correct for
what he looked at but I would argue that
the intrinsic of the Hamiltonian for the
intra and Inter cellular space is way
more intricate than what his
calculations looked at and the notions
that you can have decoherence in one
basis and that this very Hamiltonian
protects coherent and in another basis
which might be the basis that counts
that is the computational basis
the study tech mark has not done at all
therefore I think I think what happened
sort of in the sociology of signs at the
point that most neurobiologist when this
paper came you could hear a sigh of
relief in the neurobiology community
oh we don't have to mess with this stuff
because notice neurobiologist frankly
are not trained in quantum mechanics and
essentially tech markets and physicists
told them what they wanted to believe
all along that those effects are not
necessary and since then also I would
say efforts in this area have diminished
but again those calculations are way too
cause to really exclude that the
coherent processes cannot do
computational roles in the brain and we
will see actual examples of this another
the second strand of the history of
quantum hypothesis comes about by a
group of people around Freeman and
Vitiello Freeman what a Freeman's a
grand old man of neurobiology
essentially he comes from from a
different angle
he said measures EEG or other through
poking electrodes into the brain
measures neural activity at different
sites and the human brain and/or animal
brains and what he finds is that there
are oscillations and often coherent
oscillations synchronized oscillations
and distant sites of the brain and he is
arguing that those oscillations are too
well synchronized and the onset of those
synchronizations are way too fast to be
explained with very slowly travelling
neural signals so that was the impetus
for him to say there must be another
mechanism at work here and these ideas
actually go back he teamed up with
Italian physicist Vitiello who has
worked out the math and physics sources
and this theory goes all the way back to
Froelich who was an expert in the
dielectric properties of materials I try
to summarize
Ceri on this picture essentially in the
Fremen with yellow and our words the
brain looks like this you have the neuro
pianist entually the stuff that also is
a field of all neurons and auxiliary
cells in the brain that essentially
amounts to a collection of dipoles
sitting in your brain here I've drawn
them plus/minus little molecule symbols
here and essentially in the medium of
those dipoles what you have are a little
bit like in solid-state physics and a
crystal where you have collective
excitations going through your crystal
you have collective excitations often
referred to as phonons going through
your medium of dielectric elements and
then you have neurons who are sitting in
this medium and I have to admit that
this is a very attractive model in
various ways and in theoretical
neurobiology such models haven't been
studied at all the functional properties
of essentially in a dielectric medium
with surfy anisotropic with phonon
excitations traveling through it and
then more classical neurons sort of
reaching into this medium what the
functional and computational properties
of such a system could be I think is a
very important study and I know we do
brain modeling here at Google and think
this would be a recommendation for
something to look at yeah so this is
essentially the second school of
thoughts that I wanted to look in the
historical review so again let's quickly
contrast my theory which haven't found a
better name the quantum box theory I
want to contrast it quickly against
those theories you just heard about
first in my theory quantum effects
assigned a very specific computational
role that is optimization problems
that's what they solve then this problem
solving helps
pattern-matching learning or and general
problem-solving through a quantum
annealing process then maybe what I
should say here I often gave the example
of the image matching algorithm as a
pattern matching example I don't
necessarily think that this exact
problem of image recognition is solved
by the quentin box I'm thinking when I
say pattern matching more about a
general process we tried to put two
disparate configurations together
the reason being his or I should say is
in a second so essentially in this
picture of the quantum box you have
classical and quantum operations
cooperate both occur it's not one or the
other and second behavior and annealing
time scales are this decoupled so for
example I do not think that in a very
reactive mode of behavior let's say you
drive a car and there's a red light
coming up and you're slamming on the
brakes I don't think that in this loop
any quantum effects take place we
probably in this moment act very much
like a classical automaton however in
the situation where you chew on a
problem they take it home and you're
thinking about it and asleep overnight
and suddenly two days later you're not
even aware anymore that you're thinking
about this problem it hits you and say
oh I know how to do this what I would
argue there is that when the count
quantum box came in you had essentially
this encoding decoding process going on
in the background that offered sort of
the hard causes problem two and quantum
annealing process then again we
discussed it earlier I think it's
important to understand what the
computational basis might be and what
and how it might be protected by the
coherence in the computational basis how
it might be protected by an appropriate
Hamiltonian describing the dynamics in
cellular and intracellular space
again I haven't these the last two
points are flaws of the series of
Caesarea I'm suggesting so far I'm not
able at this moment to point to a
physiological substrate and last but not
least I'm more looking at in problem
solving creativity learning and at this
point do not make a statement yet on how
this relates to consciousness okay so so
far the theory now let's look for some
evidence that quantum effects are at all
active in the brain first I want to give
you a few general arguments
theoretically as you have learned the
last two sections it's well understood
that there are numerous computational
advantages that come from exploiting
quantum computing so if evolution as we
think of it is worth its salt you would
think that evolution should preserve or
enhance a powerful computational pathway
in particular since life started from
single cells and below essentially
structures that were much closer to the
energy scales that are relevant to
quantum mechanics and if you look for a
second a different direction
take a spaceship or special temporarily
large scale organization let's take a
company like Toyota it's isn't by any
just a slightly abstract view would tell
you that Toyota can well be regarded as
an intelligent system a sensing system
so it looks what's happening outside the
company it has memory it has reasoning
and planning processes from abstract AI
point of view Toyota is an intelligent
system and if we look how
decision-making happens in a company
like Toyota you would see that even
though the decisions affect sort of on a
global scale and over years large space
and time scales the decisions that the
companies make have effects on those
scales they're often amount to certain
individuals to see you're a small group
of Engineers and then maybe one more
influence
the engineer among those engineers
making those decisions and then again
textbook neurobiology would have it that
when the CEO or the influential engineer
thinks about something or comes up with
an idea or a decision that this is
mapped back to individual neurons so far
I think not a controversial story so
what we see is axon a spatial temporal
large-scale it's are being folded back
to very small scale and very a charge
structures and what I have a hard time
believing is that sort of see Russian
puppet just stops at the single neuron
level that there's a hard ceiling that
information processing below does not
matter this is not when we study nature
and how information flows are organized
it doesn't seem to look this way and
maybe to make this point and many people
have observed this there are organisms
let's say like a Paramecium picture that
show adaptive behavior and Paramecium
can avoid an obstacle that can find food
it can find made as actually new paper I
found the various but a very recent one
by Alma said I said show our learning
abilities so obviously this is a single
cell that does not have and in a nervous
system so how is information processing
which obviously occurs in the single
cell how it's done in the single cell
house this was general arguments let's
move to more specific I would like to
call them building blocks processes of
the style we could use to build the
quantum box system so first I would like
to point out that it's well understood
that our eyes the retina is so sensitive
that it can faithfully signal the
absorption of a single photon a single
light quant numerous papers shows us
another so this would be for the
decoding very useful and the quantum box
once solution has been found and saying
the reading it out obviously we have
neurons that are sensitive enough to do
that another set of work very recent
work
I chose that to understand enzyme
function 20 mechanical effects in
particular quantum tunneling is a key
process again enzymes probably know is
sort of a bio catalyst which takes out
of substrate and causes a chemical
reaction to happen or facilitates is the
chemical reaction and I will show
another nice picture on this in a second
another important piece of work is
studying photosynthesis and how this
process can come about and how it can be
so amazingly efficient it is now well
understood that to transport energy
captured in photosynthesis which happens
through the so called FMO complex a
phenomena is always in complex in order
to do this large-scale coherence takes
place in this molecule which is at least
comprised I couldn't find an exact
numbers estimated myself and it's
probably conservative several thousand
atoms are involved in this or this
molecule is comprised of and again
large-scale coherence taking place to
facilitate photosynthesis and a last
piece that I find quite amazing is that
it has now been found that and again
this is no new age type of literature
this American Journal of chemistry and
while peer to peer review to honor that
is the antioxidant activity of green tea
is due to a tunneling effect and it has
long been a question how katha shows the
key ingredient in green tea can be so
effective it's actually the same story
like was the enzymes he had shown to to
do the antioxidant effect you
essentially have to affect the reaction
and there's an energy hump you have to
overcome with typical chemical reaction
setup and again you have basically two
ways to go
classically you go over the hump that's
the only way to go in quantum mechanics
you can also go through the hump
tunneling and the letter being much more
effective and this seems to be the ones
that brings about empty oxidant
qualities of green tea and of other
enzymes as well so these processes and I
agree if I'd say it's a little bit of
arm waving sort of pointing at these
different processes nevertheless
they show large-scale coherence a show
tunneling to be instrumental in
biological processes and I would say
it's not a foregone conclusion that
those processes haven't been harnessed
in the brain to do quantum annealing
process of the star we discussed last
time
last set as more an application of the
theory I want to argue that the
phenomenology of what's called the
ayahuasca experience is better explained
by appealing or referring to quantum
mechanical effects so for those of you
who don't know what I was guys you ask
as a tea it's abstract active tea brewed
out of two plans here's a picture you
have two plans one called banisteriopsis
caapi the other one is called psychotria
greedy viridis and sort of mixing those
together and procedure leads to this
bruise you see on the right picture
called ayahuasca and the earliest
confirmed use of ayahuasca is about 2500
years ago in the Western Amazon and so
maybe I should take the last question
first what is it like to drink ayahuasca
let me quickly jump here forward I
thought I bring a little movie with me
but I don't have the time for doing this
so roughly ayahuasca is a tryptamine
belongs to the family of tryptamine
mediated experiences so it's like in the
family of LSD psilocybin mushrooms and I
was roughly in the same family but they
are just
differences and experiences as well and
even though I would guess that a number
of you haven't alive made experiences in
those directions
for those who don't I think a larger set
might have seen the movie contact and
you might recall there is a scene where
this capsule falls through this
elaborate machine and then the pilot led
the lady who sits in the cast capsule
goes through a sequence of experiences
that shatter quite a bit and I'm pretty
sure that is a Carl Sagan the author of
the book or some when the chain of movie
makers had experience in the ayahuasca
range because many elements that are
depicted in the sequence are very
elements that occur in this experience
the first of the distortion of the
visual field sort of the mosaicing and
spiraling and then suddenly it's over
and then she has these celestial views
view on celestial cities on galaxies and
Sarah was stunned by the beauty and
intricacy of nature there's also this
element of meeting other beings which
comes across as a father so it has a
number this gives you a flavor of what
the experience would be like
and going back they're still in
ethnobotanical mystery around how
Indians and the Amazon come up with a
plant mixtures and if you just assume
it's basically a trial and error process
you would say if you keep those people
live in the world's richest stocked
pharmacy you will absolutely most
diverse ecosystem on the planet roughly
estimated if they have about hundred
thousand plants available to them it's
probably a larger set then a
two-component mixture would be a
selection out of ten to the ten so if
you keep this in your house pharmacy as
a key medical and then this is a hint
that this is a special in some ways
overall ayahuasca is a complex
pharmacological mix
a key element is believed to be D
material tryptamine this is the
structure formula for it
so how is this relevant to our concerns
in the following way even though I said
I failed or fall short of the goal to
explain consciousness nevertheless this
was sort of the starting point and if
you and also I promise your definition
of consciousness so my definition of
consciousness very pedestrian I would
say consciousness is the subjective
awareness of one's own state and its
relation to the environment and I have
sort of your little picture that shows
how study of consciousness can come
about strictly speaking there's only one
thing you can be sure of that it's
consciousness that's yourself
however we are readily we are ready to
assign consciousness to our fellow other
humans as well and basically if you do
such a thing if you look in this diagram
you have an observer that communicates
with a conscious entity see that senses
some phenomenon it's conscious of but
what's very key is in order to assess
consciousness you need to communicate
with see and sometimes even though
that's not required it's helpful if
there's a memory stage involves that
sees a conscious system can store or I
was aware of that you know during my
dream I saw that sometimes it definitely
helps if there's a memory element
involved but the key point I want to
make is that communication is with
between the observers the
experimentalist
nc conscious entity is key to assess the
presence of consciousness and that I
think even though that seems to me very
straightforward and not a very deep salt
I find so many papers and the
literature's that drastically disregard
or don't pay attention to these
situations you see say even in Penrose
book it goes like this
humans are surely conscious and I can
see those in dogs and cats maybe also or
a dolphin but then Paramecium maybe not
and a tree and a rock for sure not so
how can we know at this point we cannot
know whether a rock is conscious or not
simply because there's no effective way
for us to communicate with the rock so
this makes a study of consciousness Hart
is that we have a very restricted
experimental basis essentially we can
only study consciousness in systems with
whom we can communicate and they are
very few basically it comes down to you
other humans in that sense the method of
looking at tryptamine experiences is
important because I don't know whether
you see here my little prime coming up
in the situation where you are under
influence of tryptamines you essentially
change c to c prime so your conscious
system goes into a different state and
maybe the phenomena you are aware of
going to different are different as well
so it's essentially a tool that sort of
expands experimental basis so going back
to the justification of this method
users who partake I was an expense
report expanded consciousness and
enhanced creativity then it's of course
useful to study if you study a
phenomenon it's useful to study a
situation where the effect or the
understudy is most pronounced and as I
had said what I'm most careful is
understanding how creativity can come
about and this seems to be dramatically
enhanced under the influence of
ayahuasca so these are the reasonings
why this is an important le for study
and my theory on how the ayahuasca
experiences can be explained is as
follows I would argue that you can
understand the ayahuasca experience much
better if you assume that if you intake
ayahuasca it essentially enhances or
amplifier
the operation of your quantum box
essentially the annealing process there
to solve hard problems is kicked an
overdrive and now let's look at some
general hints again and then we studies
experience in detail so general hints
would be as I said I you asked a
drinkers report enhanced creativity so
if we look at sort of an outside
signature essentially EEG measurements
have been done with users who drank
ayahuasca and what has been found is
that shows a show increase the gamma
coherence this essentially waves in the
25 to 50 Hertz in the frequency range
and those frequencies are enhanced in
the eg of ayahuasca drinkers those
similar gamma bursts have been found for
people who are involved in problem
solving and who reports that they solve
the problem with inside so psychologists
actually have their ways of
discriminating said this was problem
solving was inside and this was problem
solving without inside in situations
where inside was a key element you see
gamma bursts so you in general coherent
gamma oscillations are also believed to
be our best correlate to conscious being
present in human so what I noticed often
is again I'm studying creativity and
learning first and foremost but those
seem to be siblings of conscious state
so therefore I believe that if we do a
good job understanding learning and
problem-solving capabilities better we
might go a part of the way understanding
consciousness the second general hint is
the following in 2003 Wong and Absalom
have made an experiment that is depicted
here and this figure it's outside of
biology it's not a biological system
they started so-called quantum dots a
quantum dots may be a pedestrian way of
king of it is you take a little copper
cables they don't use copper they use
cadmium selenide and if you chop it
really short I can that you have this
tiny piece of copper line then the
electrons in this tiny piece of copper
cable don't have much where to go so
they oscillate widely around in
different so it's like a potential
barrel similar like we studied it and
those have been traded as candidates to
represent qubits and then what
Absalom found is that if you bring in
conjugated molecules like see guys that
are shown here at room temperature they
can act as a here's a quote out of the
papers
so conjugated molecules of this type
here can act as quantum information bus
between those qubits and if you look at
the structure of those molecules you
will remark the similarity to tryptamine
based compounds and like Demetrio
tryptamine so these are just the general
hints that there might be a relation now
the last step consists of looking at the
phenomenology of the ayahuasca
experience in detail and essentially how
I've done this I've looked at different
bodies of reports mainly from the book
of Benny Shan from 2002 there's a book
by Strauss Manos as a website aruba talk
where you can find numerous journey
reports so based on about 3000 journal
reports you look what its users report
most frequently to be their experiences
and then the message would be someone
says I saw this huge serpent or I saw an
apparition of the Virgin Mary you're not
going out to doubt that they had this
experience
you take books as experiences is what
they saw our goal is to understand how
can
such experiences come about they of
course two caveats business one is if
the experience makes a state outside of
the head so to speak of the user like I
saw some diamonds lying under this tree
over there then if this was your
experience of course you could then
double check whether this was a correct
experience or not or if people report oh
I got my disease XYZ stopped or at
health improvement why then of course
these are things that in principle you
can measure and check was indeed it took
place it's let me get to this in a
second so in this table basically we
list on the left hand the experiences
and here's easy color marks essentially
they indicate what I just explained how
much evidence do we have that aura
should start here all those experiences
have been reported in high frequency in
the reports again the two things to
check is if the experience has an import
on something outside of the experience
then we can check it whether it was
correct or not and second also how well
is this the concept defined so if the
user says oh I saw this four dimensional
being coming into my body then you may
ask how do four dimensional beings look
to you this is a concept where you
cannot be sure that different users
saying such a statement would actually
talk about the same experience so
essentially these green dots here and
then yellow and red squares they
indicate how well is the concept defined
and how much data do we have to support
it in case it has an import outside of
the experience so might not have the
time to go through through all elements
here but I will go through the first
ones so one may be based and easily
overlooked experiential fact is that the
ayahuasca experience deals with grand
seems so you
thinking about things like nature or God
or truth it's like these big-ticket
philosophical or religious items it's
not like oh my copy machines this
morning broke so how can we explain this
that those big-ticket items are more or
prevalent in the experience as opposed
to others in classical neurodynamics
would have to say okay there are certain
areas in the brain that are responsible
for this and they are being activated
stronger than others it's there's no
confirmation that the tryptamines when
ingested indeed are sort of distributed
that unevenly in the brain in the
quantum our theory may be a little bit
more straightforward because the quantum
box is there to solve big-ticket
problems and this Scranton box is being
kicked into overdrive so as a result
you're dealing more with a big-ticket
problem solving another experience
effect for which iOS got famous is that
the visions are highly information rich
very intricate and highly aesthetic and
often not noisy so many people in their
reports using the meta graphic
comparisons they would say something
like see pictures you see are two
everyday pictures or in relation to
dreams they are more like scenes
elaborate scenes out of the matrix
compared with Bugs Bunny where
essentially as an information scientist
you would say the minimum description
length of the algorithm to present or to
produce such pictures or picture
sequences is much more complex in
ayahuasca visions and in every daemon
tations
dreams or similar situations again I
would argue that in classical
neurodynamics you would have an issue
with explaining if that's how you assume
simply some
exists the tryptamines reduce inhibition
brain and sort of larger portions are
now larger assemblies of neurons are
acting together representing larger
percept that makes is the experiences so
much more rich but then you would argue
that there should be much more noise
involved less meaningful less coherent
pictures then certain side is that if
you people often report that they had
amazing insides or understanding of
certain situations and her famous
anecdotes like Nobel Prizes as a Nobel
Prize winner said no okay I saw I had
the idea for this concept not taking
ayahuasca but LSD there's one famous
example there's you have various
anecdotes from well-respected persons
who claims that those experiences had a
strong effect on them forming the ideas
and insights so in general what I would
say is that the insights gained under
the ayahuasca experience well formed not
all of them but many in the sense that
they stand up to rational scrutiny
meaning the next day you think about it
saying as this was really an interesting
approach I should maybe do it this way
as this was an interesting thought and
these are and standing up to rational
scrutiny here I gave it only a yellow
mark I would like to see sort of more
sort of rigorous study half your
problem-solving abilities really be
increased if you buy a sort of this
assumption for a second then again the
Quentin Bach series that's natural
because sort of we have kicked your
problem-solving faculty into stronger
operation and that makes your insights
or problem-solving capabilities stronger
in classical neurodynamics is
essentially a theory of these
experiences but at the end of the day
amount
defect theory basically taking
tryptamines would foul up your brain
chemistry and you see funny things but
this has no value is sort of just your
brain doing strange things it would be
not easy to explain how good quality
information can be derived out of those
experiences and maybe a last experience
to discuss here this pertains to a
physical condition essentially the
people in the Amazon who traditionally
abused ayahuasca use it as a medical and
it's sort of the household mariaclement
to improve various physical conditions
and in many reports again from many
trustworthy people's I said this stop
that stopped and I only very recently a
yeah again I gave it the yellow mark and
it shows that the FDA at this point
would say ok in a double-blind study we
have found health improvements XYZ but
I'm pretty sure that those studies will
come and I have the Brazilian government
in the eighties when they were
confronted with the decision to allow
ayahuasca communities to exist or not
actually made Studies on sort of the IQ
health status and social status of those
communities and found that there were an
average slightly better than in
surrounding communities and concluded
that therefore it's safe to let those
people use it in the literature list I
have included one very recent paper done
by John Hopkins University not on
ayahuasca but another Simon mushrooms
where indeed there was a double-blind
studies was was all thousand whistles
you need and they showed that two months
after they experience most people
reported improvements in various
directions again in the quantum box
theory health improvements would be very
natural to explain basically like the
green tea
helped with antioxidant reactions and in
a similar way you would argue because in
taking ayahuasca is enhancing the
quantum box behavior which in part is
based on tunneling effects those
tunneling effects on a cell level
essentially amount to health
improvements see here you see sort of a
coincidence between if you do
information processing on a basic
physical level then what is sort of
finding an optimal state for a molecule
might amount to a solution in the
information processing picture and might
amount to finding a better energetic
state for a cell or some molecules which
coincides with some physical condition
improvement so here comes the summary
slide essentially were three elements
the first element is I wanted to put
force the quantum box ceases which says
that human learning problem-solving and
pattern matching abilities use quantum
annealing to solve underlying
optimization problems a second
speculative admit ceases I put force to
say that tryptamine mediated experiences
can be understood by assuming that they
amplifies the operation of see Quentin
box and maybe to finalize it with a
philosophical statement as we start to
appreciate information processing on
very fundamental physical levels and we
are ready to assign to processes
happening in a stone that the
information processing is taking place
there using a stone from an assistant
Theory perspective can sense its
environment in the sense that it changes
its inner State in relation to the
environment there's a memory let's say
if you knock against the stone and you
have sort of some sound waves going
through it it will be there for a while
so there's memory inside if you look on
an electron level it looks sort of akin
to it's an Ising model similar to what
we have seen in the d-wave chip going on
so essentially our ready to assign to or
as we go deeper into a quantum computing
we understand better how we appreciate
more that what we looked as an organic
matter around us is actually equipped
with information processing properties
