two of the founders of a project which
is aimed at helping out the public
health space in the developing world and
without further ado dr. brian ditsch dr.
mamelon thanks hi
so thanks for having us today
and if for every reason you have some
questions or want some clarity please
feel free to stop us so we can answer
questions we want to just give you a
quick overview what we're gonna talk
about today who we are how we got
started on this projects I think having
a little bit of the background give you
some context might be important and what
what is openmrs and what exactly are we
trying to do and how we've evolved over
the past three years and some of the
lessons that we've learned in particular
one big lesson that we've learned over
the past six months or so and how we
intend to grow and maybe end up with
what our mission statement is to give
you a sense of you know if you'd like to
get involved how you can get involved so
in full disclosure I am a pediatrician
and I'm the guy who doesn't like to take
care of the little adults and I'm the
internist sometimes I say the real
doctor I take care of adult patients and
don't do the little kiddies although I
love kids I just want to be their doctor
but I think it's also important to
acknowledge that at heart we are a bunch
of geeks I mean so we we just really
love information technology and we
actually thanks to this guy who's
actually the dishwasher King his name is
Sam Riga Strief and he's this process
engineer that was absolutely obsessed
with trying to do things in more
efficient ways and he actually took his
millions that he made and built this
place called the Regan Street Institute
it's a place that we work and it's
actually a brand-new building that we
just have some pretty excited about it
but I think the best way to describe it
is to show this picture does anyone know
what this plane is this this plane
there's actually the first product of
the the skunk works the folks known as
skunk works is I mean it's a it's the
IDE the whole idea behind the skunk
works is that you put some people in a
room and you unencumbered them from all
the bureaucracy and all the resources
and you get them to do something really
incredible in a short amount of time and
they actually prototype this plane for
world war ii in about 183 days and so
Regan Strief is kind
a place where we do medical informatics
work and so our job is actually to build
these health information systems and in
our day job the kind of things we do are
build building systems to allow
clinicians to better take care of
patients and so this gives us some
screens of the type of environment which
we work in and some of the things that
we actually do focus on things like
decision support so helping clinicians
make decisions through information
technology and we also build interfaces
to help clinicians better take care of
patients as well we want to give you a
special sneak preview of our latest and
greatest invention
we call it the popcorn man's PDA it's a
strap on laptop no we're just kidding so
we do a lot of interesting things and
one of the projects that we were asked
to be involved with was in Africa and I
think initially both Bourke and I kind
of wondered why they would want us to go
to Africa and there's a clinic there
that had a access based system and they
were needing to figure out a way to
scale because they were effective and
taking care of patients and they needed
to understand how to become more
effective within this context and so
initially we weren't so sure what we
were going to do when we got there but
eventually we agreed to go and you might
kind of jump in yeah the so so what was
happening in in Kenya at the time is
they had this access based system they
had built a registration system for a
clinic and it worked very well for them
and they were actually very happy to do
that they had created this electronic
you know record-keeping system and it
was flourishing in this one rural rural
clinic and about that time in the you
know nineteen late 1990s early 2000s
they they really the pandemic of AIDS
started and and they they realized we
need to we need to focus on HIV we need
to start treating and dealing with this
and that that they knew they needed to
you know use some kind of electronic
system to help track that so they took
this access system they had and and
started using that and the the issue
that came up is that they were going you
know from a couple thousand looking in a
year or two to going to tens of
thousands and they that's what got us
over there and say
well how can we deal with this because
the truth is with AIDS it's a it's a
giant problem I mean there are there
over 40 million people that are that are
dealing with it and and the factor
what's worth noting is that about 5% of
it is in the in developing country I
mean in developed countries and actually
it's 95 percent of the suffering that's
going on is in in developing countries
and so there's a massive need there I
mean if this is the developed countries
I mean that's aids in developing
countries so this is the face of AIDS
and it's worth seeing it it's not we're
not you know we don't want to be the
Sally Struthers kind of thing we're
we're we're we're we're not we want our
our community and this is kind of a
message also to our programmers they
don't see it enough is to know this is
Musa and he was basically dying his
brother brought him carried him for an
hour to a bicycle to then ride him to a
matatu which is basically a van that
carries dozens of people to get him with
over two and a half hours to the
hospital and when he got to the hospital
he couldn't he couldn't talk and he had
no blood pressure so but fortunate for
Musa this was when they had you know
they had gotten some drugs and had some
treatments for him and they spent about
four months working with him and when
after about four months Musa was able to
walk all the way home on his own and
walked so fast that no one could keep up
with him and this is Selena and Selena
is she was a special patient because she
was a mother of five children she
refused she came in with a PCP pneumonia
which is a bad infection a bad pneumonia
that people with AIDS can get she
refused to go to the hospital because
she has five children at home and her
husband had died and so they basically
treated her at like an intensive care
unit put IVs in her all at her home and
work with her and and yet after treating
her pneumonia she still wasn't getting
she wasn't gaining weight at this in
this picture when she started she was
about three
two kilos so roughly somewhere in the
sixty seventy pounds and she wasn't
gaining weight despite they had treated
the pneumonia they had her on the right
treatments for AIDS and and then you
know a little light clicked and they
said well you know what maybe we should
feed her and started you know realizing
that that it wasn't just the the fact
that people had HIV but they also needed
a means to eat once they had you know
the medicines and so just out of pocket
kind of feeding her and getting her
nutrition she you know she's turned into
a happy healthy woman and taking care of
her children in fact her her story is
special because she she kind of started
this program to then grow farms and now
the farms are feeding tens of thousands
of patients and they have a program
where they graduate patients through
that and and teach them how to farm so
now not only is she healthy and taking
care of her children she's independent
and has her own farm so these that the
point is that these are real people and
and while we can do this for you know
Musso or for Selena the point is there's
40 million stories like this and so it's
a giant problem and with that comes an
incredible need for infrastructure but
yeah but I think the other important
point is that it's a big problem but
it's a treatable problem so we know what
to do about HIV we know that if we get
people the proper medicine and the
proper care and support systems that we
can actually help these patients so the
issue becomes one of scale I mean how do
you you can go and treat a patient and
have an individual success but when
you're talking 95 percent of the burden
in a very concentrated geographic area
that is very developed and very
underserved how do you go and rapidly
build systems of care and if you go and
look at the current state or at least
one you know we're not 2000 about 2000
when we went to this location this is
this is a nice symbol for what the HIV
care system was like and if you think
about care I mean information is really
care I mean being able to understand
what a patient status is all kind of
relates to the information around that
patient and so information management
especially as you scale becomes
extremely important and so this was
their information system
when they started we're talking you know
paper files I mean it's a far cry from
what can be done with information and
this audience out of anyone would
understand the importance of their
credit this was one of the cleanest most
neatest medical record room so we could
find but but I doubt many of those were
accessed after they were filed away so
we put this picture in because I think
during the the point of that throughout
that week we once again we came in as
consultants but I think we left kind of
with our heart belonging to elder ette
and we just felt like there was a need
to be involved because despite
everything that was going on in this
place you found people that has such
hope and they understand that there is a
way forward and so it seemed to us given
all the people that we've met that
dedicated their life towards working in
this area we could maybe spend a little
bit of our time working on trying to
build something that we know how to
build which is information systems and
that's that's what got us involved we
were hooked so I think if you're if
you're wise and you're and you're
starting to build something like we're
talking about an information system to
manage patient care it's it's worthwhile
- before you start building it yourself
go and look and see what else is out
there and so there are other people that
are interested in doing health
information technology in the developing
world but when we went out what we saw
were a bunch of silos I mean so a lot of
systems that were built not for any ill
intentions but they were built to meet
needs and they weren't built within the
scale in mind and so we saw products
that also had an important that the
front end looked very impressive and
sexy but when you look behind the facade
do you see not much infrastructure and
not much ability to scale and and once
again you know a real focus on the front
end then the user interface and so I
think when we talk about what what makes
an enterprise quality system you have to
think about architecture and data based
architectures and how you store medical
information and the classic way that
people start building health information
systems is what we call a flat data
model and the idea behind it is
can imagine a patient as a row inside a
table and different attributes or
different kinds of information about a
patient things like pulse and weight are
columns in that table so most people
will you know often will pull out access
or Excel and and you know just to get
things started and boom boom boom column
of every every you know observation
every little piece of information they
want to collect on the patient so the
question then becomes if I have a new
piece of information that I want to
capture how do I do that in my database
design and it's important to point out
that you know as clinicians we
acknowledge up front that a lot of what
we practice today is wrong and a lot of
what we do evolve over time and so the
need for a system to be flexible is
really important because as I start
adding in things like cd4 counts I can
do the traditional approach you look in
and oh yeah cd4 count I'm sorry is as a
measure of immune power and so folks
with HIV tend to have suppressed immune
systems and a cd4 counts a measure of
that but if I want to add that
information into my database design what
I end up doing is creating extra columns
in my table or I try to find ways to
squeeze those columns in but you can
imagine the more information that I want
to collect about a patient the more that
evolves over time I start growing
vertically and I start running into
problems with scale and that's a serious
problem in terms of being able to build
Enterprise anecdotally when we came when
we came to Kenya to for this project the
system they had was exactly that and
they had exceeded the number of columns
they could put into access and we're on
there I think Pastor second into the
third table and that you can just
imagine the sequel they were writing to
try to get when each column is started
on this med stop this med started on
that med stop that meant the sequel was
just ginormous so so early on and these
are lessons that we've learned during
our day job that there are different
ways to model the same information and
have a much more effective scale and so
getting back to so that's that flat
model that flat database model that we
talked about imagine an alternate model
and where instead we take attributes
and stack them right and so you have a
separate table that has a dictionary of
all the medical concepts of interest and
then you create one row per measurement
and so you can imagine that as you have
new measurements you create new
dictionary concepts and you separate the
content from the actual database design
so that's for those of you that are
familiar or maybe not familiar the
entity attribute value database model
design and as you can imagine as you
start scaling that over time you just
grow the table and and it's from from a
database perspective and just from beta
best performance you can grow a long
table as long as you want and you don't
have the same performance issues as you
would if you grow a wide so I think
coming in with those really basic
premise the premises things that we
didn't see out in the community we we
set out to get started on this project
and I think our goals were to be
flexible and to be scalable as well and
to maybe focus a little bit less on the
front end because clinicians have
different ways in which they want to
practice and so there's different front
ends for different kinds of workflows in
different environments and so if we
could maybe focus instead on a
foundation so building a database design
that scalable building an API on top of
that and separating out content in that
database then you have something that
other people could maybe use and start
from and it create a tide that rises all
ships so the one of the points there is
that we envision that you you if we took
the complexity of putting medical data
into a database and wrapped it in an API
and made that freely available to people
to beat on you know perhaps we could get
everybody kind of working against that
level rather than having to start from
scratch so right so I mean that mega set
notion of reusability I mean you'd like
to create an infrastructure that
everyone is building upon versus
building yet another series of silos I
think one of the one of the drivers for
Burke and myself since we're both
clinicians of that we oftentimes in the
community in the developed world see a
disconnect between technologists and end
users and we have this unique role of
being both technologists and end users
so we're both clinicians
we both practice and we also do the
development of the technology as well
and so it's really important from our
perspective that people like us drive
the functionality that the system has is
so we we we build our timelines and our
guidelines and our point releases based
upon what the community speaks of
loudest and then we make active efforts
to actually talk with the people that
are in the trenches that using these
systems so so Burke and I work at the
Regan Street Institute but in order to
kind of get to the point where we were
an open source community or even think
about an open source model we wanted to
bring some partners in and we were
fortunate in the next nine months after
we started kind of conceptualizing this
to meet up with folks from the partners
and health group and in particular a guy
named Hamish Fraser and he has a team of
developers that are doing
implementations in a number of different
countries I don't know if you've ever
heard of Paul Farmer but he's done a lot
of important work in HIV and
tuberculosis care and so that was kind
of the the birth and of a new
partnership and a new relationship and
we we had an interesting collaboration
because we both needed each other
we both in order to build enterprise
systems you really kind of need a lot of
people to actually effectively scale
that and we we are but three or four
developers and in Indianapolis and five
or six developers in Boston so you take
their their team where they had already
built a system in Haiti and in Peru and
we're treating TB primarily we're
looking to go to Rwanda wanted to
rewrite their system here we are trying
to build up a new system thinking how
can we design this and it was just a
perfect kind of mashup of needs at the
right time and that was that was when I
would say you know open openmrs was born
and just a little plug this is Paul's
new son will we're very proud yeah he's
ten weeks old is missing very much so
it's worth showing family pictures we
wanted to show I don't have a son myself
I wanted to show my picture of me when I
was a kid so and we can skip by though
yes so this I just want to show you
where were we where we've come to this
is our data based model and we've
iterated this over years and so this is
a reflection of a lot of
content expertise and once again the
notion is that we've abstracted out any
notions of a particular type of care so
there's no HIV related information in
the system but you can write the
concepts into the database and use the
system for whatever you want so you can
imagine it could be used as a
tuberculosis system as an HIV system or
as a general medical record system so in
terms of kind of what this creature is
made of we are and and I think largely I
mean we were a we were looking at Python
we were looking at Java we were looking
at a you know very various platforms
played a little bit in plone and and but
the crew with Partners in Health had
already built their systems in Java had
a lot of Java expertise and we were kind
on the fence and it was like well okay
there you know choice made and so our
system is a web-based app built in Java
it has a we're using my sequel on the on
the for the database in but we use
hibernate to to kind of give us a layer
above that so that we could use other
relational databases
it's a tomcat app and we so above
hibernate we have a service layer which
is where kind of all the business
knowledge of our our system is and we
we're we're very careful to try to build
such that hibernate does not bubble up
and our service our business knowledge
doesn't go down or work its way up out
of the service layer trying to be fairly
strict at maintaining those layers
because in the end it pays off - you
know like MVC model when you finally get
it you realize man you know why weren't
we doing this all alone and so we're in
Tomcat we use kind of for a number of
toolings within the system we use
velocity we have we use the spring
framework fairly heavily for for
internationalization for our MVC with
the web and we do some AOP - for
cross-cutting concerns security and and
whatnot and on the web front and we try
to bring it to life a little bit with
using dojo and we've enjoyed DWR as well
as a way to try to do a little more java
side stuff
and then a ton of JavaScript programming
and and then recently we've been helped
by bit rock to build an installer we're
working on a package that will allow
people to get essentially a CD of the
software be able to install the system
while our our initial aim wasn't at
trying to be a plug-and-play solution
and and and we're we definitely takes
technical expertise to manage an
electronic medical record beyond just
the software but but we it does you know
we're trying to reduce that the
technical hurdles imagine song the mean
the current the current version of the
Installer is under a hundred Meg's and
it packages up my sequel Tomcat
all of the dependencies needed to
literally open up a browser and start
using openmrs and so that's a good
milestone for us and we obviously have a
lot of work to do but what's one once
again we're hearing from our users but
that's what's important and so we've
we've put some energy into that so we
have we also have a modular architecture
been one of our lead programmer it was
very kind to scope out and build us a
module system that allows for plug and
play modules to be added to the system
so that so that you can follow the kind
of the standard API kind of following
the same pattern of Eclipse or other
tools that are out there even the the
plugins or add-ons and Firefox to say
you know you don't necessarily have to
get your hands dirty and get in the core
a lot of enhancements or little changes
that need to be done can be done with
plugging in a module that really has
helped us I think in terms of growing
and and flexibility wise because we've
had fellows that are studying with us in
medical informatics that have gone in
and said hey I think I can improve the
search algorithm for this or that and
being able to build a module that plugs
that in without having to get you know
all the way into the core yeah and the
key is that there's a nice separation
there so they're not disrupting the base
platform but they can go and experiment
and add features and those could maybe
be eventually assimilated into the trunk
if we find a value in that so and part
of the point is that that we we have
some domain knowledge we're building us
system that we hope can help the help
the world out in the process and but
there's a ton of people that are
underneath that that are contributing in
terms of all the you know libraries and
things that help us kind of do what we
need to do and so we acknowledge that
saying that you know openmrs is just the
tip of that yeah I mean for lack of a
better phrase props to the open-source
community they make a lot of this happen
yep so this is this is where we started
and this is Kenya and I just this is a
city called elder ette and where we had
our first installation of openmrs but
what we faced in these past couple of
years is a pretty significant growth and
so we've got installations in a number
of different countries and we a lot of
people are implementing our software and
to be quite frank with you it you know
at least at one point we had a thumb on
exactly where it was being installed but
we get new inquiries of people like for
example there was a fella in Haiti who
has installed this into a hospital
system and he asked questions about the
queries he had in he had put 400,000
patients into the system and so we get
these kinds of queries and we're real
excited about it because they they come
with good feedback and good answers and
it's clear that people are starting to
find out about what we're doing so we're
dealing with this you know this flock I
mean we're all of a sudden we we were
started off in a small city and elder
ette and we're starting to get a lot of
attention now and so the as you can
imagine that that that we feel a little
squeezed these days there's a lot of
interest and I think all of you know
that there's a difference between
developing software and helping people
implement the software and providing
support around that and so it we we
started to evolve a lot of notions of
community I I think one of the one of
the watershed moments for us actually
was the Summer of Code project and and
Leslie and the open source team will
refuse to accept any credit for this but
the Summer of Code experience was like
shining a bright spotlight on our open
source project and it it helped us in an
incalculable amount of ways and it's
really kind of hard to describe in a
couple of minutes but it was a it was a
real lightbulb moment
for me because I I don't know about you
but if you follow the open-source
community your perception and my
perception at least is that people who
contribute to open source projects
contribute because they're benefiting
from the products that they're improving
so they work with a product they use it
they want to improve it a little bit and
so they contribute you know the kind of
further further the community but we're
building something that's a fairly niche
piece of software it's medical record
system and so most people that are
working in the open-source community at
least at least it was my assumption
wouldn't wouldn't have the experience or
wouldn't have the desire to be involved
and so you know we we apply to this
Summer of Code project almost as almost
as kind of a you know there's no way in
heck this is gonna happen but will apply
and see what happens and we got accepted
we were excited and then we figured well
we'd maybe get 20 or 30 people to apply
to us we'd have a couple students and it
would be a great great process we
actually had a hundred and fifty
applications or more and we were really
surprised I mean we didn't we didn't
know what to expect from that and I
guess the lesson that we've learned over
these past few months or that people
participate in open source because they
use the software but they also
participate because they're they have a
philanthropic drive they want to be able
to do something that actually makes a
difference and helps people in the
process and so you know that was kind of
a ha for us when we realized that we've
been kind of working on our own because
we felt like we benefited from the open
source collaboration but we really
haven't tapped into the open source
community as much as we can we obviously
take advantage of a lot of the platforms
that the community is made available but
what we're starting to realize is that
this might be a great way for us to be
able to scale our development efforts so
this is a don't know if you've ever seen
one of these ant mounds but you know
this is this is how ants scale they just
start this keep building up this has
actually been our one of our lead
developers so so some of the things that
we did so we had a web presence and
quite frankly it was built for us to
communicate with each other and so we
have a lot of technologies that kind of
make openmrs web presence hum including
you know subversion repository track
forums mailing lists etc but yeah
MediaWiki it but it lacked a lot of
cohesiveness and a lot of people when
they came from the Summer of Code said
we have no idea how to get around so
that really kind of got us to think
really long and hard about our web
presence and we did a complete site
redesign we opened it up a couple weeks
ago we've got a lot of really good
feedback so thank thank you for that
little stimulus and one of the other
kind of technologies that are underneath
this this web presence is RSS I mean so
no matter whether you're posting on a
blog or you're in a forum or in your
mailing list or you're making a
submission a code submission it's all
being aggregated into a common RSS feed
and we do a lot of good work with tags
so that people can go and filter that
feed for whatever purpose they want but
we find that it works really well to
increase communication and awareness of
what's going on because people like
talking in different ways and we don't
want to preclude people from doing that
but one of the bad side effects of that
is that you don't have a way to
aggregate that information there's lots
of chatter that's going on that's not
really touching each other so the RSS
was really kind of brought that alive
and we're real excited about where
that's gonna take us just a quick a
quick question of the community and and
we were trying to learn a lot because we
feel like we're fairly novice at all of
this and we're just flying by the seat
of our pants more or less but sometimes
when it comes to the open source
community one of the big questions that
I have is that no one wants to take
credit for this work and a lot of these
communities don't really have people
they identify as leaders and so when one
open-source group wants to take
advantage of a software but needs a
couple tweaks done we don't know how to
communicate with those folks and so
that's something that we would hope to
get some guidance on and I hope you'll
allow me Liberty to point out a couple
of those groups in particular we we have
a real interest in openoffice.org and in
particular the XML forms portion and
we've got a summer student working on
this project to do data entry through
OpenOffice forms and we've actually
gotten a pretty far away but there's
some technical issues that we would like
to get some guidance on so if there's
anyone out in the community that
represents OpenOffice xforms or knows
someone
we would love to hear about that in
addition I don't know if you folks are
familiar with the Eclipse Burt which is
the business intelligence reporting
framework from the Eclipse project and
we're using that because a lot of these
healthcare environments need to report
aggregate statistics about their care
and the Eclipse framework provides a
really nice foundation for that we've
got another student working on
integration of Burt into openmrs and we
would love to talk with people in that
community as well and then finally I
don't know if you folks are familiar
with Pentaho but they are another
quote-unquote business intelligence
group but they do a lot of work around
data warehousing and so as you start
looking and analyzing large-scale data
there's different ways of using OLAP
technology to to create shadows of that
and be able to query it more effectively
and the Pentaho folks seem to have a
good handle on what that's what that's
like we'd like to get some guidance from
them if at all possible so this is kind
of a work in progress in this this whole
notion of a mission statement we're
starting to realize is pretty important
because I mean at some point you have to
give the community and and incoming
folks to the community a sense of where
we're headed and we actually had a
breakfast discussion about this very
topic
so we we have these mission statements
and they're kind of a work in progress
but we thought it'd be worth sharing as
kind of our going-away message and I
think our primary mission is to provide
developing countries with enterprise
health information systems that not only
equal what we have here in the states
but potentially even surpass and because
the needs are a little bit more acute
there and so we we will not stop until
we have systems that are of that quality
or exceed that quality and I think
around that our notion is is is
different than a lot of other health
information technology open-source
projects and that we don't want to build
it ourselves and then give it to the
community as free software we want to be
developed by the community and so we're
taking a very active role in building
and fostering a community of people that
are interested in building healthcare
systems and so we've had some success
with that but we're constantly working
to get better at that and I think what
we found is that
in order to really make the system self
sustainable especially in the developing
world it eventually has to be taken over
by the folks in the developing world and
so we can affect change through this
collaboration that we talked about but I
think we have to go a little bit further
and also share I our ideas and our
knowledge with these folks as well and
we make a real concerted effort to try
to get them invested in the work so that
they actually are taking it and making
it their own I'd say I'd add to that
it's it's easy to go into a place like
Kenya and and feel this kind of I don't
know bias that oh we're gonna go and
kind of teach them something but we've
found quite the opposite that the people
we've met there and the people we've
worked with have been some of the most
lovely brilliant people and and have
actually been teaching us things helping
us improve the system and the truth is
where the need is greatest we need
capacity and while there are some real
bright stars there's a lot of kind of a
gap in terms of getting knowledge and
people that are willing to put the time
in and get the training - especially you
know if we can get some you know
medically and geeky folks over there it
would make our lives a lot easier our
goal is to become obsolete definitely so
just real quick just a couple groups to
acknowledge our Institute has put up
with us going off and doing this
harebrained idea that is crazy but we're
loving it in addition the Partners in
Health Group
Hamish Fraser if it wasn't for Hamish
and his team we wouldn't have had this
open source collaborative so we really
owe a lot to them and they took a big
chance to work with us because anyone
has actually done collaboration realizes
it
there is a huge investment that's
involved in it and if you're having to
meet deadlines to deliver things there's
a big there's a big challenge in making
that work working alongside other folks
that have different motives and
different interests in addition we have
Chris cibrex who's a guy that works in
South Africa at a place called MRC and
he has agreed and just blown us away by
his generosity by leading an
implementation community and so it's one
thing for us to sit and build the cool
tools and build the technology but then
we have to have a
a community of folks that will be
willing to answer all the inevitable
questions that happen when people start
building the software and where we
started off you know we we had these
mailing lists in Burke and I would
respond to all of these questions and
we'd have the developers but it's
amazing that whole conversations now are
occurring about openmrs and we're not
even really involved in it we just kind
of sit back and just watch the
communication and I don't think you can
understate I mean for any coder out
there the it made my knees buckle when
Chris cibrex said you know I'd really
like to coordinate the group of users
and try to you know when they have
questions think about what the answer
and come to you with a solution instead
of the question enema are you kidding I
would wish it Chris cibrex for every
developer that's out there because it
really has made our life so much better
we would lay down on untrain tracks for
that guy so yeah he deserves that's
pressure that's for sure and then we
also have a fortunate support not only
just through resources but also just
intellectual and and community support
from the w-h-o the CDC and the IDRC
which is Canada's equivalent of PEPFAR
it's a funding source around the
developing world an HIV care in
particular with PEPFAR is PEPFAR is the
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS
relief it's a it's our answer to HIV and
it's the funding source that makes a lot
of the HIV care in Africa and the
developing world happen and then last
but not least of course Google I mean
once again I mean I I don't want to gush
too much but I mean it it was really a
big big help I mean probably one of the
best gifts we've had is being made aware
that there's a community of folks that
are willing to actively help us build
this software and it really it
transforms us into a completely
different project when it's not five or
six developers working on a piece of
software it really changed it's fun it's
exciting and a little scary when you
know goes from code development to
community development right yeah it's a
good ride so this is this is a
screenshot of our most recent developers
meeting or implementers meeting in Cape
Town and as you can see we're
kind of growing as a community and it is
it is breathtaking to be able to to go
to Cape Town and to see all these people
rallying around your software and they
kind of have a real interest in kind of
making it their own and learning about
it and it I don't know it's just it is
it's just an unbelievable experience so
far and we just we think every one of
them for having the interest it's pretty
exciting so but that doesn't preclude
you from coming to join the community
and in fact you know we would welcome
anyone to come and help us both identify
how we could improve but also kind of
get directly involved in development
when we we have a contribute tab on the
top of our website that talks about a
number of ways that you can do that and
we would we would welcome everyone this
these are our email addresses and we
would love to hear from anyone out in
the community that wants to learn more
about our project but I guess what I
have one of the things that we both feel
pretty self-conscious about we like
giving demos but we we didn't know our
audience well enough but we we kind of
kind of fell back on the idea that at
any given point in time you can go do
your own demo so there's an online demo
of openmrs if you go to demo dot openmrs
org and the most recent alpha code is
auto-updating on a nightly basis so you
can kind of see what the active
development is and so you can see our
our bumps and warts and our successes as
well but then of course you can go to
our website to learn more about us and
that is it
okay question was about hardware
requirements and we're at you are
basically my sequel with tomcat running
over it and you know a war file there's
that you know you can we run it on a
laptop so so I don't know and I would
hesitate to say exactly you know this
particular you know megahertz or this
many gigabytes of memory I would
nowadays you'd say at least you know 500
mega a gig of memory but just any decent
desktop machine could run it when we run
it for in our case in Kenya where we
have tens of thousands closing in a
hundred thousand patients that's and I
think we're probably 15 million
observations of those patients and that
that we run on a server a pretty
decent-sized server these are these are
always notoriously hard questions to
answer because the the question I would
ask you back is what is it going to be
used for and so if so how it scales with
the number of patients yeah the it
definitely you know we're what we're you
know we got into this by having an
implementation and working with an
implementation and our scale right now
is is tens of thousands of patients and
and so we need it to work at that scale
if you go in and put like the the Fela
and Haiti did you know hundreds of
thousands of patients and you'll you'll
find you know we're learning a lot right
now because the the government of Rwanda
has at least this point decided to use
openmrs as their national framework for
HIV care and so we'll see on a
countrywide level how it holds up but we
we don't have the we don't have the
actual experience to be able to answer
that question to be honest with you I
mean we're we're kind of growing beyond
what we had anticipated and we're and
we're really just at the verge of
learning and experimenting with you know
trying to distribute some of the work of
the porosity of different processes move
the database separate from
the apt and etc so we're fairly small
scale right now so it's hard to say you
had another question another question
when a system is worth like an Excel
table
who
maybe they're convinced that memorize
would be better
I think mrs. white
mm-hmm so the the question was I think a
good one of a lot of people if they have
these systems that are that are Excel
based or an access that have a lot of a
lot of columns they have a lot of data
in there already and they've they've
invested in that and they really they
look they may agree openmrs might be a
way to scale up but but do they want to
do they want to invest the time or is it
worth it or is or can they afford to and
I guess I am you might have some answers
for this as well but I would say one
we're not really selling openmrs at this
stage so so frankly you know as we're
riding the rocket ship you know if
people want to wait a little bit that's
that you know I'm not going to cry but
at the same time we're also working hard
to build a version of it working with
whu-oh and CDC that is easier to install
I think that combined with so lowering
some of the technical levels to kind of
get the system up and running combined
with the fact that more as more
implementers come onboard that have some
legacy data they are they they're coming
up with new ways to import from an old
system into a new and as those get more
flexible I think I think the the leap
the threshold that will take to switch
over one of our hopes is that if we can
build a system that's fairly easy in
terms of you know just with some
built-in content you know edits edits
basis openmrs is a you know it's the
infrastructure but the content of
exactly what questions you're going to
ask what data you're going to collect
that depends you know you could use it
for malaria TB whatever that really
depends on the implementer we often
share concepts between implementations
but what works what we're doing with the
whu-oh and CDC is saying well if we make
kind of a package thing say well at
least give you enough to get started
with HIV care is people could take that
and use it to do kind of the simple
day-to-day things they need to do and
hopefully start with that instead of
Excel or access
and then when they decide hey maybe we
want to scale up that package is the
full openmrs so they're they're already
in a system that can scale up so part of
it is try to you know see if we can't
you know give at least give that as an
option for people going forward trying
out challenges trying to get back to
your I think you're one of the questions
I heard from you was if they're if they
already have data in the system how can
they get it into openmrs I think is kind
of what you're asking is that right yeah
so you're you're talking about one of my
personal passions and and unfortunately
there's not a magic tonic for the
problem that you're talking about
because I don't want to get too much on
the soapbox about this but deep
underneath those databases that you're
talking about come different notions of
the same ideas and so for example
hemoglobin is a very common lab test and
a way one system actually records a
hemoglobin is different than the way
another system records it and trying to
make those concepts interoperable across
systems is not something that can be
done with any kind of magical statistics
I mean there's some people doing some
work on that but the the hard reality is
that interoperability will never be
solved until people realize it's a
problem in the and what were where we're
headed though is that people are knowing
knowingly building up these medical
record systems but not knowing that the
data the putting in the system isn't
going to be able to communicate with
other systems and all we can really do
at this point is try to create system
that doesn't doesn't fall underneath
those traps because we use standards at
least for our vocabularies but I think
we'd have to raise awareness of what the
problem is and I think you know it's
excellent to hear someone out in the
crowd
understand that because that's in fact
one of the biggest problems we have here
in the states right now so we talk about
aggregating data for not you know
patient records and that runs into all
sorts of wicked challenges that's what
we do during our day job we have a
two-word name for that job security yeah
yeah and what we're we actually have a
big I mean we won't be able to work for
a long time
so given that you guys are building up
datasets that are in a consistent format
from many different areas where there is
different pandemic spreading who's
actually taking that data and doing any
kind of Public Health analysis on it on
the other side so that's that's a good
question
so each so most of these HIV care sites
they they tend to have a funding source
and typically at least as long as
they're PEPFAR funded they have a
reporting requirement and so these
clinical sites are sending their
statistics about how the quality of
their care they're justifying how their
money is being spent by sending these
data up and they are being analyzed most
of the time at a national level so that
there's ministries of health in each of
these nations and they take data and
we're working very hard with our openmrs
framer we're working with CDC in the
w-h-o to try to ensure that there's a
pathway from patient level data all the
way up to aggregate statistics and
what's typically happened prior to
systems like ours are that people
independently of managing their health
information they go and separately go
and pull through records and try to
create those statistics manually and
we're trying to create automated ways in
which to filter those data up so that's
getting to the bird the bird stuff that
we talked about the clips Burt they have
a lot of knowledge and expertise in that
area and that's why we want to take
advantage of that community there's
there's also communities d-h is as a
community in South Africa and the Norway
that is that works at the
epidemiological level with indicators
that are aggregate statistics and and
we've got you know we were kind of been
talking with them for a while on ways to
put the two together to try to try to
meld between we're very patient oriented
and then get up into the more aggregate
or epidemiological stuff there's a
there's a multi-country study being done
that is that is try it you know trying
to coordinate care of HIV among many of
these countries and openmrs is being
used for a number of those sites and
yeah what do you see do you encrypt your
data or what if one of the protections
if somebody walked into one of these
clinics and walked out with the box yeah
are they walking with live data or do
they need to know some stuff to get at
them we protect the box we we're not
there there's been some discussion in
our you know among our community of
different ways to encrypt the data we we
don't have the expertise or resources to
solve all that what we do is any anytime
any of our our system touches the World
Wide Web it's it's through SSL and and
we secure you know channels but in if
you know if you got the Box you know you
got the data so please don't take the
box okay I'm sorry interest in a hosted
solution could you give me give me more
kind of clarity well that the big yeah I
think I think what you're getting is
like an ASP model for the developing
world so that of course the problem with
that being that there's not great
bandwidth in those environments right
many of those folks are dealing with
dial-up if that if so power yeah yeah
intermittent power I mean there's a
whole host of different luxuries that we
just take for granted here in the States
but a lot of a lot of groups in the
developed world are thinking about ASP
miles for medical record systems and we
work with a number of them so it could
could we could we of off to that if the
bandwidth improved in that environment
absolutely I mean we're a web based
framework so everything that end-user
does with the exception of content some
content creation is actually all done
through the web
so when like a disconnected data entry
or yeah so yeah so the question is is
there an offline mode or a way to deal
with disconnected states and there's two
ways we're cutting that one is where we
have like right now where the way we're
structured is we're Doc's are in the
field they don't have time for a
computer and so they're doing they're
doing filling out encounters on paper
filling out just checkboxes and
sometimes seeing a hundred patients in
an afternoon and and then those papers
come to a central repository and get
typed in by data entry people you know
fortunately it doesn't cost a lot to
hire those folks and it helps to employ
people so we're not you know jump in
other than dealing with scale to to try
to replace all that that said we have
one one at issue in these places where
there isn't power or connectivity how do
we do data entry there because so that
that encounter sheets the the patient's
chart doesn't have to travel away from
the clinic so if they come the next day
that that visits still there and that
we're working on a solution for that and
and then the other is is I think more an
issue for the partners and health group
right at the moment the way they're
structured but it's going to definitely
be one for us is its synchronization
between systems and we're trying to we
have a group actually some really bright
minds working on that trying to do it at
a kind of a domain level with a
transaction system but to allow so that
we can have several nodes and and data
can be kind of bi-directionally
populated that's gonna be where the
linchpins of this this nationwide Rwanda
system that we alluded to before and
part of the goal with that is that it
needs to be able to work on internet or
sneakernet
any other questions
