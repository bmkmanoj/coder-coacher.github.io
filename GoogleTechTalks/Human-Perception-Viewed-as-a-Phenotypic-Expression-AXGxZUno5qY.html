Dennis profit
from the University of Virginia when I
was 18 years old I didn't know what
class to take and I made one of the most
haphazard decisions in my life which was
to take a class based solely on the fact
that there was an Escher drawing on the
website for the class and that has led
to many many decisions of my life which
eventually got me to Google via Hawaii
and the man responsible for that is dr.
Dennis profit who is here today and he
is an expert in visual perception
cognitive psychology and has a very
interesting talk here today that I
believe will changes the way that you
see the world pretty literally to some
extent so I hope that you will enjoy the
talk I'm very very proud to have him
here today and when I first started
Google he was the first person I thought
to bring so thanks thanks any hello
hello so please feel free to interrupt
make a comment ask a question at any
time I'm happy for you to do that but
I'm going to talk about today is the
perception of spatial layout which is
just basically the fundamental question
of how things look and I think most of
us begin with an assumption which is
certainly the assumption that I had that
other species see the world pretty much
the same way that I do so the Frog here
sees the world pretty much the same way
I do
except frogs aren't real smart or as I
am and so I can make many more decisions
about what I see perhaps but basically
the same world is out there and so we
must be seeing the same thing well that
turns out to be false
so if you look carefully at what a frog
sees it basically only sees four things
it sees edges it sees moving edges it
sees a decrease in illumination and it
sees small erratically moving spots and
if it sees a small radically moving spot
it will reflexively attempt to catch it
and this is called a bug detector now
one of the ways that we know that frogs
don't see things the way we do
is that a frog will starve to death in
an aquarium of dead flies and the reason
for that is it can't see them almost all
of the world that the Frog lives in it
can't see it only sees what its species
through evolution has made valuable for
it to see because it can support its
ways of life the same is true of us we
see what people see and we don't see all
that's there and we don't see the same
thing that other species see now that's
the first assumption now the next
assumption is okay well everybody sees
the same world the same way as everybody
else and that assumption is also false
so here are two individuals they have
very different phenotypes and as their
bodies are obviously different and what
I'm going to develop in the talk is that
the world that each of these individual
sees is as different as the different
bodies that they have we all see a
unique world and it is specific to our
individual phenotype all right so to
develop this idea what we need to do is
to begin with what is the information
for visual perception and the
information is shown here in this little
animation so what's being shown is we've
got a fellow who's getting up and
sitting down this is an animation from a
book from an important perceptual
scientist named James Gibson whose work
I follow and what is being shown here is
that what's present to the eye are
angles that is they're raised of light
in this case coming from the edges of
the main object in the environment and
these are converging on a point of
observation and these are visual angles
and they're specifying where things are
and how where things are changed as the
observer moves if we replace the
observers head with an eye you can get a
better idea of what the information is
for visual perception and if we simply
take away the body this is it so the
information that is available for your
perception of the world consists of
information about location
where light is coming from in how much
light is coming from where in fact if
you look across species that what eyes
have evolved to do they have evolved to
solve the problem of figuring out how
much light is located where yeah the
next thing we need to do is say what
organisms do with this information and
they basically make two uses of it so
there's two kinds of vision the first
kind of vision is vision for action in
the sense that this is how we take
information and guide our actions with
it and I'm going to take an example in
the example is catching a fly baseball
so in this wonderful season of baseball
that is just finishing up what you have
is a situation where the pitcher pitches
the ball and if the batter hits the ball
to an outfielder the outfielder will try
to intercept the ball and catch it and
here's what it looks like from the
perspective of the outfielder and this
is work of macbeth j4 and kaiser from
1975 and what they showed is we need to
move away from the microcell take this
with me so this is the outfielder this
is home plate this is the trajectory of
the baseball the outfielder is going to
run to intercept the ball and if the
outfielder looks at the ball then these
rays along the path that the outfielder
is running are going to the baseball
okay and if the baseball player is able
to run in such a way as to nullify the
curvature of the ball then he is
guaranteed to be hit in the head by the
ball okay this is the way this heuristic
works so if I look at the ball and it's
curving in this direction and I run in
that direction just in such a way as to
nullify that curvature the ball will hit
me in the head cool so there's a couple
interesting things about this heuristic
one of the whoops it took it out
one of the interesting things is that if
I'm going to follow this heuristic then
I'm going to have to run on a curved
path that is if I knew where the ball
was going I would run on a straight path
there but outfielders don't do that in
fact I rehab to run on a slightly curved
path the other thing that recognize is
that I don't really know where I'm going
I think that I do but the heuristic that
is guaranteeing interception doesn't
specify anything about the location
where the ball is going to land it
simply ensures that I will catch it ok
so visually guidance heuristics is best
we can tell the actual execution of
actions is guided by these heuristics
the heuristics act directly on angles
remember the angles are the information
that we're given and they're not
converted into environment specifying
meanings meaning that I catch the
baseball without specifying anything
about where the ball is where I'm going
what speed of the ball may be how high
it may be going what the spatial layout
of the field is I simply follow this
simple heuristic now on the other hand
the baseball player who's actually
catching the ball has an awareness that
well here I am I'm on a baseball field I
perceive its layout the ball is coming
towards me I must know where I'm going
because look at me run in fact visual
guidance of action heuristic that the
runner is following doesn't specify any
of the awareness that the baseball
player has it simply guarantees that he
will catch the ball what
yeah if he knew where he was going he
would run in a straight line to catch
the ball because that would be the
shortest path to it he doesn't run in a
straight line
he and professional baseball players and
even frisbee dogs run in the more curved
and somewhat slightly less efficient
paths that the heuristic prescribes okay
now on the other hand so here's an image
from where I live and what I have as an
awareness you can imagine yourself
standing on that road is there is space
it has extends to it there is a building
out there it has a size and a shape to
it there posts all of these things have
dimensions which are not angles their
angles appropriate for spatial extents
and if one is going to perceive as we do
consciously the extents and the shape
and sizes of things in the world then we
need to take those visual angles and
transform them into units that are
appropriate for extents sizes and shapes
and the way that we do that is with our
body so Protagoras said long ago the man
by which he meant the body is the
measure of all things and what I'm going
to hopefully show you is the way that we
see the world is by taking the manifest
visual angles that are inherent and
proximal stimulation and transform those
into units that derive from the body and
that we thereby see the world always
relative to our body so what is a body
well at a first approximation a body
consists of three things there is a
morphology which is the semi-permanent
structure of the body form and size it's
fairly slow to change under most
circumstances there is physiology which
is the internal environment it's
basically all of our metabolic aprox and
it's fairly fast to change and then
there is behavior which is the fastest
to change and which consists of our
behavioral repertoire and our immediate
action
and what I'm going to talk about today
is we use all three of these in
different situations to transform the
visual angles that are available as
information into a specification of the
extent of things so let me make this
concrete and I'll give you an example
and then I'll talk about some research
so the first example is size matters so
think about Gulliver's Travels
and think about Gulliver and the little
pollutions for Gulliver the little
pollutions and the things in their world
are small for the little pollutions
Gulliver and the things in his world are
large what is a substantial rock for a
little pollution is a grain of sand for
Gulliver they are measuring things
obviously relative to their body size so
we can look at that in a little more
detail so one of the questions the
people in perceptual psychology argued
about four hundred years was how is it
that we perceive the constant size of
objects given that the visual angle
subtended on the retina for any object
its size varies with distance so the far
pillar is smaller as it projects to your
eye then the closer pillar and yet they
both look to be the same size and what
is specifying that they are in fact the
same size is a ratio and that is the
extent of the object above the horizon
call a relative to the extent of the
object on the ground to the horizon
which we'll call B is a constant for all
objects of a constant size so long as
they are on the ground and you happen to
be on the ground with them so let's look
at two individuals of different sizes so
the first person the guy on the right
let's call him Bob he has an a over B
over B ratio where a is a small
proportion of B whereas for the smaller
person a is a different proportion of B
and so the object is specified relative
to her eye height as being bigger now
the horizon intersects all objects in
the environment
that are bigger than you at your eye
height
we're over the horizon even if you can't
see it is well specified so if I move
forward towards that pillar all of the
optical texture that is below my eye
height moves down all of the optical
texture that's above my eye height moves
up and so simply by moving back and
forth a little bit I can discover the
horizon and I can then scale the size of
everything in the world as a proportion
of my eye height I have an a over B
ratio and this is true for things that
are smaller than my high height as well
as things that are taller than my eye
height now if we go back to these two
individuals Bob on the Left sees all of
those pillars as being a constant size
as does sue the smaller person on the
right but sue lives in a smaller world
because the altitude of her eye her
height is shorter than Bob's she sees
things as being larger now there's an
important idea here and that is the
smaller your perceptual ruler the larger
will be the extents that are measured on
it okay smaller rulers bigger experience
yes if they assume that what they're
seeing in Street View is taken from
their eye height and the eye height is
actually higher then they will perceive
things as being smaller that's right as
an aside I did considerable amount of
work with Walt Disney Imagineering and
one of the real problems we had was
getting people to scale the size of
things because people do assume a
default eye height and we were working
in an Aladdin world where we're allowing
them to fly on a magic carpet and this
just made everything begin to look like
toys so yes this is an issue okay one
more conceptual idea and now go on to
the research so here's an image of me
and the question is what ruler do I use
so the body is going to provide
I mean with a plethora of rulers which
one do I use I find myself in this
situation and in any environmental
situation there are an indefinite number
of things that I could do that the that
the environment offers for me is what
Gibson's called affordances so I could
walk on a trail I could bend over and
pick up a rock I could throw the rock I
could get across the stream if I'm
willing to jump across the stream so
these are the things that I could do
depending upon what it is that I decide
to do what I'm going to do is I'm going
to turn my body into a machine that
allows me to do that thing so I'll turn
my body into a walker if I decide to
walk and that will be my phenotypic
organization I'll turn my body into a
Reacher and then a grasper and then a
thrower if I decide I want to throw a
rock I'll turn my body into a jumper and
I'll organize myself to do that if I
elect across the stream by jumping over
it and so there is a sequence of things
that happen depending upon my purposes
and what is available in the environment
I'm going to undergo a phenotypic
reorganization in which I turn my body
into that kind of machine necessary to
do what I want to do and that
reorganization is going to determine
what aspect of my body is relevant and
that aspect of my body will then be used
as the measuring stick and it will
provide the meaning for the perception
okay so let's go through the research
and look at some examples so what is
going to be relevant for reaching I'm
going to reach to an object that's going
to be within an extent in near space
what's going to be relevant is going to
be my morphology can I reach the object
what is the length of my arm and the
behavior the activity of reaching we
need to introduce one more relevant
concept here and this is the idea of an
action boundary so any kind of action
has an extent over which that boundary
that action can be realized and that's
called an action
so in this slide this little guy would
like to punch the bag unfortunately for
him the punching bag is beyond his
action boundary for punching and so he
can't punch it so the extent to which he
can reach is going to define in this
case how far he can punch so in first
set of studies that we did what we did
is we manipulated a person's reach
ability and I'm just going to give you
the results of that and then I'll talk
in more detail about in another set of
studies we'll just look at individual
differences in reach ability and show
you the people that have different armed
lengths receive the world as being
different in near space so in terms of
arm length what Jesse Witt did jesse was
a graduate student of mine she's now
professor at Purdue she had people reach
to objects that were in arms reach or
just beyond and make distance judgments
about how far away they were and I'll
explain what you did in a bit when we
get into the next set of studies in some
cases they reached with their arm in
some cases they reached by using a hand
tool in this case a conductors baton and
what she finds is that for those objects
that are out of arms reach but with the
in reach with the tool those objects
look closer when she's reached when the
participant reaches with the tool then
when they don't have the tool to reach
with so this object which is out of my
reach will seem closer if I have an
object that allows me now to reach it
okay so I can extend your body in this
case the length of your arm and in so
doing I make closer those objects that
have come into your action boundary
longer ruler shorter distance perceived
okay so these are going to be more fun
so there's in any one of my talks
there's one thing you're gonna want to
take home to sweetie
tonight so when you go home and you have
dinner with sweetie you say I heard this
great talk I have no idea what this guy
had to say but wait till you hear this
and this is it so this was found out by
Sally Lincoln auger she was a graduate
student of mine who graduated last year
and she's now at mocs applying to become
and what she found out was if you're
right-handed you actually perceive your
right arm and right hand to be longer
and bigger than your left arm in hand if
you're left-handed you perceive your
body to be symmetrical but if you're
right-handed this arm appears longer now
I have a strong identity with this I'm a
strong right-handed person when not
strong that I am right-handed and I feel
as if my right arm is long extent I am
walking around with a little tear a
little Tyrannosaurus Rex left arm
appendage on the side of my body and so
the way that we study this is
participant comes into the lab we say
put your finger right in that little
dimple in your shoulder and look at your
arm and the experimenter takes a
measuring tape numbers facing the
experimenter and simply pulls it out and
says you know I'm gonna move this back
and forth until you tell me to make it
visually match the length of your arm
okay and they do that and then they'll
do some other things and then they'll do
the other arm and we counterbalance in
all of that and this is what you find so
what's being plotted here is for the
left hand so we're going to have
estimated length over actual length
where one would be perfect and if you're
left-handed okay red stands for left arm
blue stands for right arm if you're
left-handed you're pretty accurate and
in both arms are perceived to be the
same length if you're right-handed your
right arm is perceived accurately these
are error bars but you underestimate the
length of your left arm by looks like
about 7% it's it it's just perceived to
be shorter well if it's perceived to be
shorter then you should receive that you
can reach less far with them instead of
test this what we do is first of all
this this is going to be important first
we put the participant in the chair and
we clipper shirt to the chair
because what happens is if you're if
you're asked to do this and you're
competitive then you're going to reach
forward and reach as far as you can and
then where are we so we just want you to
you know how far can you reach with your
arm and then we'll move targets in on
various rays and we'll ask you you know
to tell us stop when you can just reach
it with your right arm and when you can
just reach it with your left arm and
here's what we find
so everybody overestimates the reach
ability but of course they've had a
lifetime experience not having their
shirts clipped to the back of their
chairs and so that's not terribly
surprising but what's interesting is
there's no difference in how far you
believe you can reach with your right
and left arms if you're left-handed but
if you're right-handed you can you
believe you can reach much farther with
your right arm than with your left arm
but of course you do that's because you
perceive your right arm to be longer
than your left arm now here's the task
that we use for distance estimation it's
the same one we use for tools so an
individual sits at a table and above the
table is a projector and the projector
is going to project a target down target
dot onto the table and the person is to
judge how far away that dot is from
themselves or from this reference dot by
adjusting two other lights back and
forth so again they're doing a visual
matching task make this distance the
same as this distance and then they
reach out and they touch the dot either
with the right arm or with their left
arm Sechler yep okay if we think about
action boundaries if this is me with my
big right arm and this is me again but
now with my little left arm and they are
going to specify rulers action boundary
rulers then I would measure this dot
with my right arm as being sixty percent
of my action boundary but with my left
arm it's 75 percent of my action
boundary again the long
the ruler the shorter the extent that is
going to measure looking at what
measurement theory tells us if this is
the actual distance and this is the
measured distance using rulers of
different lengths then the shorter ruler
will have a steeper slope but it will
have the same intercept and these are
the actual results the left arm has a
steeper slope and the same intercept
relative to the right arm and so objects
that are within reach are perceived to
be closer when you're going to attempt
to reach with them with your right arm
than with your left arm what this means
of course is that all of us
right-handers are living in an
asymmetrical space where in part and we
know behaviorally people do this we're
going to reach over into the left side
of our body
with our right arm to pick something up
because that space becomes expanded if
we think about reaching forward with our
left arm okay so our space is
asymmetrical yes so you want to turn it
around mice we haven't actually done
that to turn the statistics around but
there's not a great deal of variability
so right-handers tend to be they tend to
be very skewed in terms of their they're
not ambidextrous a right hander is
right-handed left-handers tend to be
ambidextrous and so what we find is they
have a very different distribution where
they are slightly skewed towards the
left whereas the right-handers are
strongly skewed towards the right
left-handers are very very different in
part because of genetics probably in
part because they live in a right-handed
world also if you look at the brains of
right and left-handed people
so if you look at the regions involved
in the sensory motor cortices and also
in the parietal lobe for right-handers
there's considerably more cortex area
devoted to the right arm in hand than
the left arm in hand whereas for
left-handers it's symmetrical okay so
what about walking so obviously if I'm
going to think about walking from here
to the top of the hill I'm not going to
measure that with the length of my arm
I need another ruler and the ruler that
we propose is that the way that you're
going to measure it is in terms of how
much walking is going to be required in
order for me to get from where I'm
standing to the location that I desire
to go and the way that we propose that
you do that is with physiology that is
you're going to measure how much walking
in terms of the metabolic costs of
walking so here just we've been working
on this for almost 20 years
first of all we looked at perceived
geographical slant I think in Evans
poster there was a question what does
the steepest hill in San Francisco how
many of you said that it was 45 degrees
18 degrees okay that's right it's 18
degrees if you ask people how steep 18
degrees looks they'll tell you that 18
degrees looks like it's 45 or 50 degrees
so we greatly overestimate hills but we
also overestimate them more when we have
a greater physiological cost to
ascending them we've also been looking
at distances and similarly we find in
both distances in geographical slant
perception that if you were encumbered
by wearing a heavy backpack
yol's look steeper distances look
farther if you're physically fit Hills
look more shallow distances look more
compressed if you're elderly and a
Hills look steeper if you're low on
blood glucose hills look steeper in
Bloods I'm sorry in distances look more
expanded yep steep hills so I have the
data on this steep hills look steeper
from the top than they do from the
bottom they look about the same up to 25
degrees at 25 degrees it is actually
easier to walk up a hill than it is to
walk down it because for biomechanical
reasons if you're going to walk down a
grassy slope that's 25 or 30 degrees
you're going to either have to butt
scoot or break into a run and it becomes
a dangerous place okay people on top of
heels on skateboards find them really
really steep elderly people find steep
hills really really steep from the top
okay anything else this is good all
right so I've hinted at physiology
essentially what I'm arguing is that
what you're doing all of the time as you
walk around in the world is that you are
doing an auto correlation between where
you intend to go and how much biological
resources are required in order to get
you there in essence you're measuring
the world with your gas gauge so we have
all of those studies that demonstrate
that sort of thing I'm going to go over
a recent one which I think makes it
really clear so what we're going to do
what we've done here this was done by
John's aedra who's a current graduate
student and we have an exercise
physiology lab at the University of
Virginia it's in the Medical Center it's
the general Clinical Research Center and
we've got a group of highly highly
trained in competitive bicycle riders
who are willing to participate in this
experiment for free just so that they
can get the data about their own
physiology and here's what we did to
them so they come in and we get a
distance judgment task in the distance
judgment task is you look some distance
at a soccer cone and you're then asked
to turn and walk in a different
direction with your eyes closed
the distance
that you perceived that cone to be this
it turns out people are pretty good at
this and it works a lot better than
asking them to give seat things because
people give people are terrible at that
but they can actually do this pretty
well so that's why we use it then
through a small grant from Gatorade we
give them either
Gatorade with a caloric sweetener or
Gatorade with a non-caloric sweetener we
see them on two occasions so this is
within it within participant design they
don't know whether they're getting the
caloric sweetened Gatorade or not they
ride on the bicycle for 45 minutes when
they're riding the bicycle they are
asked to pedal close to exhaustion so
there is a scale that they've learned
called the Borg scale the star trekkers
there actually is a board scale and it
goes from 5 to 20 where 20 is exhausted
and 5 is kind of where you are right now
sit at seated and they're asked to
maintain a level of 17 or 18 so just
below exhaustion and they do that for 45
minutes while they're doing that we have
a continuous measure of heartrate we
have a continuous measure of the power
that they're putting into the bike
they're wearing an octa con so we have a
continuous measure of their oxygen
intake and carbon dioxide respiration so
we actually know how many calories
they're burning and we've got an
intravenous line and so we've got a
continuous measure of a number of blood
chemistry's and then when they're done
they do the distance measure again so
the first thing that we look at is did
the glucose manipulation have any effect
and it does so what we're plotting on
the Left axis is we take the blind
walking distance and we have a number of
these distances so that's our dependent
measure of perceived distance and we
divide that by the target distance okay
so if it was one they would be accurate
if it's over one they're overestimating
if it's under one they're under
estimating so they're pretty accurate
I'm sorry okay it would be one and then
what we do is we take a post - pretest
to see what the difference is between
what they did initially and what they
did after riding the bicycle
and the bottom line is that if you had
the placebo then after you rode the
bicycle the target seems farther away if
you've had the carbon carbohydrate load
then it's actually slightly closer so
this is a difference based upon
basically whether or not you've got
blood you had glucose prior to riding
the bicycle okay that's the manipulation
much more interesting than that is we
have individual differences in our
bicycle racers so what we're going to
look at here is these are the blind
walking distances after they rode the
bicycle so this is not a pre- post this
is just at the very end how far away did
they see the target and what you're
going to see is how far away they saw
the target is essentially a function of
their own physical fitness so here is
what we're plotting here is how much
energy did they put into the bike and
what we're plotting here is how far away
did they see the target where one would
be dividing a parent over actual would
be perfect anything lesson that's a
slight underestimation and so the more
energy you put into the target
now I'm gonna sorry into the bicycle the
farther away the target appeared at the
very end of the ride and these red lines
or lines of variability okay so the
harder you work the farther away the
target appears blood lactate so blood
lactate is a good measure of physical
fitness the more blood lactate you have
following vigorous exercise the less
physically fit you are the higher your
blood lactate the farther away the
target appears heart rate higher your
heart rate is another good measure of
physical fitness the higher your heart
rate given that you're attempting to
ride at a particular level of exertion
less physically fit you are the higher
your heart rate the farther away the
target appears energy expenditure here
what we're measuring is oxygen calories
by measuring the oxygen that you're
burning during respiration again the
more oxygen more calories that you
expend the farther away the target
appears another measure of physical
fitness relative to apparent distance
and then finally we have blood glucose
the higher your blood blood glucose
level following the bike ride the closer
the target appears so what we're showing
here is that in cases where you're
measuring walkable distances you're
measuring it with your physiology with
your gas gauge
how much energy is going to require be
required for me to walk and extend
relative to what I've got in the tank
lastic set of examples so the last thing
we're gonna look at is behavior in the
sense of for example hitting a baseball
skilled performance so in terms of
skilled performance what becomes
relevant is behavior and in particular
your immediate actions so there are a
bazillion sports anecdotes seeing that
the world looks different depending upon
how well my performance in the
particular relevant sport is so Mickey
Mantle after hitting a particularly
momentous homerun stated I just saw the
ball as big as a grapefruit so we're
gonna look at that this work was done
primarily again with Jesse whipped and
here's what we did in our first
experiment so we're gonna look at balls
as big as a grapefruit problem by
looking at softball players at the local
softball fields and so what you did is
she went to the fields and she there
would be a game going on softball game
and when the game was over the players
would come out and Jesse would smile at
them and point towards some free sports
drinks and say for two minutes of your
time you get a free drink and she's very
attractive and they would
/ and the first thing that she would do
is you would say here's a sheet of
papers got a bunch of circles on it
point to the one that's the size of a
softball and then after that she would
find out how many of bats they had and
how many hits they had and these are the
results the higher your batting average
the bigger the ball okay so what's going
on here what we're arguing is that you
measure the size of the ball with the
variability in your hitting so if you're
hitting well versus you're not hitting
well it's probably the case that the
mean of your bat swing is centered on
the ball but if you're not hitting well
you have a much greater variability
whereas if you're hitting well you have
a small variability if we measure the
ball with the confidence interval or the
statistical variability let's say
standard deviation of hitting well
versus not hitting well then this is
roughly plus or minus one standard
deviation whereas this one is
considerably larger I'm seeing smaller
guys so here's plus or minus one
standard deviation these are covered up
here the smaller the rule or the bigger
the objects being measure so if you're
measuring your performance as you're
measuring the ball with your performance
and you're measuring it with the
variability in your performance the
greater your variability of the smaller
the ball the smaller your variability
the larger the ball we did the same
thing with putting we did it on a golf
course where we had people on the 18th
green and we would get their performance
following playing golf we did it in the
laboratory and it's the same idea you're
going to measure the size of the golf
hole by the variability and your cutting
performance the better you are at
putting the bigger the hole looks and
then finally you can actually change
people's behavior in putting by an
illusion that changes the apparent size
of the hole so this is called the
Ebbinghaus illusion if you take a circle
and you in this case this is our putting
green and we're going to project down
circles around it
if you put large circles around a circle
versus small circles around a circle
this makes the whole look smaller when
you do this people say yeah this hole
looks smaller but they don't putt as
well
they putt better to the hole that has
been made to be bigger through an
illusion the holes are the same size but
through performance is better because
the ball the hole looks bigger now
here's a cool and this is the
muller-lyer illusion these two black
lines are the same extent but this one
looks longer so what it does is it
doesn't change the apparent size of the
hole but it changes your apparent sense
of your own variability so for a given
extent change you know miss of the hole
in your performance is going to be seen
as being greater in this context in that
context that is if your variability is
the same in both of these contexts it's
going to appear to be greater in this
one because everything's being stretched
out horizontally and in this case people
perceive the hole as being smaller here
than they do there because of the change
in the variability that they saw in
their performance with regards to the
hole okay yes the measure one depends on
the experiment so in some experiments we
get estimates of the hole before and
some afterwards so we need to find out
if the illusion is working so we do that
before in other experiments we'll just
do it afterwards and so there's a
reciprocal relationship such that if if
you're seeing the hole or the ball is
bigger and you're hitting better if you
hit better your variability seems
smaller your smaller variability makes
the ball look bigger still and it just
works on itself and of course it works
in the other direction if you're not
hitting well the ball looks smaller the
smaller the ball looks the less
confidence you have in your hitting your
swing becomes worse and everything
apart that's where I am so to our belief
is there's a reciprocal relationship if
you're that you're going to play better
if you see it bigger but if you see it
bigger it's going to appear even bigger
because you're playing better I agree
that's up to some limit I think that's
what ought to happen we haven't shown
that yet we would like to know so the
question is have we seen professional
athletes using these techniques to try
to improve their performance
no I'm we're working on this especially
with golf there's a lot of money to be
made in golf but well you can imagine
that if you make the whole illusory
bigger and they perform better and then
they go out and there's no projected
circles around the hole it's going to
look smaller and they're gonna do worse
so it's not clear to us what exactly it
is you want to do well we'd like to know
yeah I'm not sure about the putting
weights on a bat I I've thought a lot
about that I don't know that that's the
same thing we're studying or not it may
be I don't know it makes the bat feel
lighter but but if you always do it then
it always feels like it is the main
thing in terms of performance for
swinging their bat is that you want to
do it exactly the same every time so if
you're gonna weight the bat and you
believe that that works you need to do
it every time because if you don't do it
you're not going to not going to swing
well okay so I'm going to sum up and
then hopefully you know we don't have
time for more questions so the basic
idea is going back to the to me and the
Frog we all assume that we all see the
same thing but across species but we
dumped we see what is specific to our
phenotype in that case to ours
we then assumed that well okay everyone
that is the same species sees everything
the same and yeah we kind of do but we
also don't we scale things differently
we the information does not come in
units that are appropriate for what it
is that we perceive extents and sizes so
we need to scale them in the way that we
scale them is to our body and just as
Gulliver and little pollutions live in a
differently scaled world you and
left-handers and right-handers and tall
people and short people and people with
long arms and big hands and all of this
we all see the world in different ways
moreover our physical fitness as we've
shown changes the way you see the world
your current energetic state and your
ability to expend energy will change the
way you see the world and of course your
purposes change the way you see the
world so you see the world in terms of
what you're trying to do and what you've
made your body into and when you're
pursuing different ends than someone
else you're seeing a different world is
being measured with a different
yardstick so the information comes to us
in this form there is no extent there's
only information about where things are
theirs in terms of location there's no
information about distance or extent or
size without it being transformed into a
scale appropriate for those measurements
the measurement units come from our body
morphology physiology and behavior that
aspect of our body that is used depends
on our purposes our purposes in an
environment caused us to undergo a
phenotypic reorganization in which we
turn our body into a machine to perform
the actions that we want to perform that
reorganization makes relevant what part
of our bodies should be used for scaling
reaching it's my arm walking
it's my physiology sports performance
it's the variability in my performance
and those bodies scale units once so
defined provide the meaning for the
basic layout of our environment as we
perceive it
thank you so yes okay camera lenses so I
can't really answer that very well there
is a certain assumption that people have
that the elevation of the camera is
roughly at their eye height and that the
field of view is somewhere roughly
around 55 degrees and then when you
stretch things out farther than that
things seem to be farther away than they
are when you pull the camera angle and
things seem to be closer than they are
but it's really the elevation of the
camera that gets into the nature of the
body size if I want to make something
look big
I just put my camera down low if I'm
semester Stalone and I want to be filmed
then I make them put the camera down
here and I look like I'm a big guy no
I'm not saying that the width of the
lens mattered but it has more to do with
certain default assumptions that we have
about pictures than the body yeah yeah
absolutely absolutely so yeah so if
you're measuring so if you're looking at
a cell phone you're measuring it with
your hand if you're looking at a big
image at a sports bar you're probably
measuring it with your eye height okay
and what we know from a lot of the
research that we've done is that big
displays and little displays treat
things very very differently so for
example anything that's big
gets stretched vertically in our
perception okay it's a vertical
horizontal illusion you get it no matter
what the size of the object is but the
bigger the object and the bigger the
display you put it on the more it gets
stretched so if I take a picture of a
building and I show it on a small screen
the person will stretch it a lot in
order for them to say it looks right so
smaller you the display you put it on
the more vertical compression you're
getting relative to what things would
look like if they were actually looking
at the real thing in another paper that
I'm working on impressionist painters
like Monet know this and when they paint
things that are really big they will
exaggerate the vertical extent of what
they're painting so that it'll look like
what it would look like when you're
actually looking at the thing in itself
so that's yeah there's a lot of tuning
that could be done on displays of
different sizes in order to make things
look the way they would look when you
would actually saw them and this is
relevant for street view an image on
street for you looked on it and looked
at on a small display just gets
compressed like this compared to what
things look like when you're actually
looking at it if you compress it
laterally then you're changing the
horizontal vertical ratio that's how
things things get compressed vertically
when you put them in the small display
so your intuition is compress them again
this way and they look better
it depends on what you're looking at so
if you're looking at a sports bar you're
looking at people
people don't get distorted when you look
at them if you're looking at a building
it gets distorted when you look at it it
gets elongated this way in the real
world and then when you put it on your
small screen it gets compressed this way
and so to make it look natural you want
to stretch it this way again depends on
how big something is depends is
conditioned eliza's how much it's
distorted by the fact that we look at it
so you get a small horizontal vertical
illusion for small figures of a nature
it's not terribly small but it's like
seven percent if you're looking at a big
object outside it can be over 20 percent
okay so there's big things that are hard
to act on once it gets over about two I
Heights
it just gets stretched this way and we
look at it in the real world and then
when you put it on the display and
you're measuring with your hand it goes
back it gets compressed back this way
relative to even though the geometries
right relative to what it would look
like outdoors it gets compressed this
way I think there's a lot of reasons why
one of them is you're not looking at
them from the same perspective you're
not looking at them from the same angle
because you know you're able to move
your eyes around you're taking a lot
more part of it is the compression that
your medium is putting on it it's
changing the aspect ratio of what you're
seeing and part of it is you don't know
you don't know where it is
you've disconnected it from the spatial
understanding that you normally have so
when you're driving in your car you know
where you are and what it means to know
where you are is that you know where you
are relative to other things that you
can't see in the environment okay you
know I'm heading up the peninsula
heading towards the Golden Gate Bridge
the oceans on my left the mountains are
here the other the mounts are over there
I know where these things are even
though you can't see them when you take
an image and you put it out of context
you don't know where it is in all of
those things and so you've got to build
a mental model of where you're looking
before you can really appreciate what
you're looking at yep
depends again what you're looking at so
if you're looking at buildings then
making you know 20% bigger is probably a
good idea and if it's on a really small
display maybe even more than that if
you're looking at a mailbox you don't
want to distort it now you've got to
take you've got to decide what's
important in your image if what's
important or the background buildings
then elongate them that's what is
important are the things that are
normally at eye height and you don't
want to distort them
thank you very much Danny we he'll be
around for answering some more questions
if you'd like to stick around we have
this room I think for another half hour
and thank you very much everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
