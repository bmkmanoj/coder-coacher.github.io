the school of personal growth with
Google university today we have the
pleasure of having Bruce menaka Bruce
menaka artist in healer spent 19 years
in a monastery living a life of
meditation and contemplation in his
sound healing work he combines the H the
ancient vocal techniques of overtone
chanting with the beautiful tones of
quartz crystal singing bowls to create a
dynamic vibrational environment that
raises the consciousness of everyone
present he will be he will exponentially
show how sound and it's overtones can
create profound changes in our lives on
all levels sound can be a direct path to
healing of body mind and soul through
the vibratory alignment that occurs when
it is focused with powerful intent it
can serve as a doorway to explore realms
of unlimited creativity vocal power and
inner wisdom through resonance and
vibration the waveforms and harmonics
created by the crystal singing bowls
helps return us to a state of our
natural rhythms and frequencies ladies
and gentlemen Bruce menaka well thank
you a little bit more about my
background I was a monk for 19 years and
transitioned daughter that lifestyle in
2001 shortly in two months before nine
eleven happen so you can imagine the
transition at that point I was pretty
much off the radar as far as everything
in the world I no never I didn't pay
taxes for over 20 years I didn't have
any kind of credit history and so to
make the decision to move out of the
monastery which was a very safe place
and to enter a world that was quite
frightening and scary it was a it was a
major thing for me the monastery that I
lived in was one of East Indian
tradition and I learned about meditation
about controlling energy through
meditation and also we got a lot into
chanting
and I discovered that there's something
about chanting where you have the rep
repetitive of certain sounds and the
type of chanting that I did back then
was more of a devotional Indian style
but even back then I realized that a lot
of the power enchanting was in the
frequencies the vocal overtones and
since leaving the monastery I I became
involved I got married and my wife and I
we do you know sound healing magic of
harmonics events in San Francisco areas
and the power of vocal harmonics or
overtones I think you know everyone here
you know you know the power of sound for
one thing the power of music and there
was an American Medical Association
research done on the number of hours
that that teenagers listen to music and
it's astounding it's like from the
seventh grade through twelfth grade they
listened to over 10,500 hours worth of
music and that includes you know thrash
metal heavy metal hip hop and you know
what's happening I I'm interested in
that because of this that the sum of the
beach and the low bass sounds the low
bass frequencies it puts the mind very
easily into a hypnotic trance state and
the body becomes very relaxed and open
and and through that a lot of the
messages is no is received through the
brain and into the whole system and a
lot of the messages may not be very no
positive what music can also be used in
a very positive way and my style of
singing your vocal overtones sometimes
called throat singing
it might sound a little bit foreign to
Western ears but and a lot of people
already know know how to sing you know
local overtones and but the but the
thing is my focus that I use is on using
sound as a way to access different
states of consciousness different states
of awareness so this is going to be
experiential and for those who are
sitting farther back if you want to feel
the full vibration and energy of these
singing bowls you may want to come up if
you want to be able to experience that
to get the full experience so what is it
about vocal overtones for one thing
vocal harmonics are overtones and what
is it I can explain harmonics or
overtones by giving an example like if
you have a piano and you play the losi
on the piano that fundamental sound will
vibrate the string but all the other
notes that are harmonically tuned to
that low C will also start to resonate
or vibrate along with that so what is
that what is the significance of that
well for one thing our bodies are made
of seventy percent water and as you know
water is a great conductor of sound and
electricity and energy so you if you
have if you have something like a
singing bowl or certain frequency
anything around us that produces sound
our bodies will naturally start to
resonate or in train to that that
outside sound now give an example and
this is going to be sort of like a an
initial sampling just to get a feeling
for this type of work this type of sound
so I hope that this comes over the PA
well enough
so everyone take a deep breath
and as you exhale just relax
and feel on the inside another deep
breath exhale and relax
can using the breath and sound it's
almost like instantaneous relaxation
and for the next few moments as you
listen and feel on the inside listen not
only with your ears but listen with your
entire body with your bones listen with
every fiber of your being
take another deep breath
exhale and go even deeper
this fall is made from rose quartz
combined with
quartz crystal
and the natural quality of rose quartz
is that it is attuned to the heart area
but you may feel it in different parts
of the body
just allow your attention
to go to those different parts and just
feel for the next few moments
and then i will include
some overtones
and feel all that energy
how it flows through your body
you
Oh
Oh
you
so you get a sense of how that energy
moves in the body the more you connect
with that energy the more you find that
energy it speaks a kind of a language
and that language may not be a spoken
type of language but it speaks more in a
type of metaphor imagery colors and
you'll find that as you connect more and
more with that energy you may find that
your dreams become no very vivid and
you'll be able to access you know very
subtle thoughts very subtle feelings and
it's that connection that I'm that I am
committed to is my commitment is to
creativity and creating a sacred space
and creativity is is a way of accessing
that energy that's within every one of
us and that is conscious and when you
connect with that energy it wants to
create and it creates differently for
every and every person that that
creative energy moves differently and
uniquely through every person it's like
every person is a filter or conduit for
that type of energy so my passion is
creating sacred space and that sacred
space is that place within each person
where they can access their own power
their own creativity and you'll find
that you want to you want to create and
you you know it's almost like you feel
driven to create I do art
I'm an author of a book I do music
that's just my particular way of
creating but back in two thousand when i
was still when i was still among the
role of being a month sort of superseded
a natural connection with my own heart
and it's no quite ironic that person who
lived for 19 years and a monastery would
be so out of touch with his heart
and around no the year in 1999-2000 my
body started to fall apart and I was
getting a lot of inner messages that you
know all was not quite right and you
know I was going through major
transition and so I had to make a
decision stay and you know either stay
in the monastery where it was no quite
secure or go towards an unknown future
but I hey it was like the heart as I was
connecting more and more with the heart
the heart was saying go towards that
unknown future and I really haven't
looked back since and I want to I want
to read a short passage from from the
book just to give you an idea of the
process that I went through and a lot of
a lot of my book and the flights of a
runaway monk was written during that
time of transition and what I did was
and this is called dominant non-dominant
hand writing and some of you may be
familiar with that but what I do is I
asked questions with my right hand my
dominant side and I answer with my
non-dominant left hand without editing
just writing writing writing and
allowing and for me that was an exercise
in allowing the linear logical mind to
just sort of step aside for a while and
allow the deep the deeper creative side
of me to show up and so that that's what
I did I would ask questions with my
right hand answer with my left and I
found that incredible things started to
show up in my life and and I got a lot
of information and this is
and as I as I started to connect with
that energy I found that the awareness
starts to see more and more patterns
around us it's almost like have you ever
you know looked at a tree and as its as
it's moving in the wind you start to see
forms it's sort of like that but as you
connect with that energy you find that
more and more you start to see the
patterns that are all around us and that
are speaking to us that's it's so subtle
that it's easy to miss it's easy to miss
when we connect with other people when
we connect in nature it's so easy to
miss but as you connect on that deep
inner subtle level you start to see the
connections there the subtleties and
this this paragraph sort of reflects
that see deep into the pattern of what
seems static around you all things are
alive with vital energy learn to use it
as fuel for your creative endeavors keep
the body and mind tuned to this
energetic pattern it is all a play and
dance of energy all sounds have
underlying vibrations of indescribable
beauty learn to see deeply into the
fabric of creation it is a dynamic
tapestry woven of the subtlest threads
of light and sound held all together by
love can you see and feel this it is all
infinite depth of sound and light play
with it allow it allow it expression
create dance let it flow through your
body in mind in an explosion of
beautiful creation open your heart open
your mind to receive this energy receive
and then release surrender yourself to
the river expand and breathe in the air
of creative inspiration it sustains all
things in its embrace of creation beauty
is all around you
even in what seems ordinary and mundane
be embraced by beauty she wishes to hold
you in her arms of exquisite rapture
melton to her embrace you will learn to
see with all your senses you will see
and feel all things are alive all things
are infused with light and love you will
then recognize yourself as a force of
nature connected with the very power
that sustains the Mighty River and the
powerful winds you will drift with
clouds and feel yourself embraced by the
most beautiful mystery so so for me
making that initial connection with that
energy it seemed like such a difficult
thing I had no idea because I was always
up here trying to figure out logically
it was only when I was able to sort of
let that's let that step aside for just
a few moments allow myself to know
breathe in exhale and relax and it's so
simple with each inhalation we create
sound with each exhalation we create
sound and that sound when we watch it
and when we feel it it takes us to
deeper and deeper levels and it's it's
it really is an experiential thing
I want to play this this is an amethyst
bowl and it's combined with quartz
crystal it's a very soothing it's got a
lot of overtones and harmonics
continuing to breathe deeply and
naturally
again
feeling on the inside
just getting it a sense of that energy
as it moves it might be very subtle
but it's in subtle tea
that we find great power
keeping your awareness inside
get a sense of your location of the body
in space
inhaling and exhaling
going deeper
whoa
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
I
Oh
I
Oh
pitch sound
has correspondence with the body there
are certain sounds
and it's something that can be practiced
by anyone
it's just a matter of sometimes using
the vowel sounds
ah
and as you do that you can feel and
listen for how the body is being
affected what part of the body and as
you explore you can have a lot of fun
with that
for example the e sound at least for me
I feel a lot of that in the forehead
area so if I feel like I need some of my
brain to be recharged I will tone the e
sound and I will involve the nasal
cavities and and if you do that you will
start to feel a lot of vibration in this
area and it's it's an experience you can
start to feel that energy up here and
it's you can find that you could you see
you could hear that it's being affected
by by the sounds by the vowel sound of e
it's sort of like this
you
alright
I
it may not sound pretty to the to the
Western ears but again if you use that
that information as a way to explore
your own energy your own consciousness
and awareness you will find that you
could use sound to help move energy to
any part of the body and again if you if
for those who are wanting to develop a
greater connection with heart the all
sound is very powerful and I'll give an
example of that you know use the rose
quartz
all or or just toning regularly
if you want if you want to sing along
and go ahead because it is it's an
experience that you want to feel for
yourself and you will see for yourself
that that certain sounds will vibrate
you know different parts of the body and
what and what good is that with what is
the significance it has great
significance i believe for healing and
there's a college 'used by the name of
mitch gainer from New York and years ago
he was introduced to Tibetan metal metal
bowls through one of his clients and he
started to use that with his patients
and then he got into some of the singing
bowls and then ultimately he got into
Tony and he said that it revolutionized
his practice it helped his clients to
such a degree that he came to an
understanding that sound is is such a
powerful modality for healing that he
believes that it should be a part of
every healers no medical handbag so to
speak and there's another medical dr.
Herbert Benson md who found that using
certain sounds and he is as naman terms
certain certain sounds and a lot of them
are no vowel sounds he found that the
body and mind go into deep states of
relaxing relaxation very quickly you
know through the use of sound and mantra
mess he calls it the relaxation response
so even in western ma healing modalities
the healers are finding great use for
sound and it's something that we all
have our voices it's something that we
could do I often times i will sing in my
car
and it's a great way I've learned a lot
of my own techniques i never i didn't
have to you know receive training to do
the over toning it sits into you know
for me it's a matter of learning how to
listen on the inside and if you listen
on the inside if you can hear the
vibration and connect with that
vibration you could usually be able to
vocalize it so often times i will be in
my car and i will be practicing my low
you know tibetan low voice singing and
you know someone might drive up you know
they have to have their loud music
playing and i'll just sort of play in a
sing-along with that and they look
because that because the low frequencies
it travels we know very far and very
quickly so i have a lot of fun with that
this is gold combined with quartz
crystal and this this particular ball
corresponds to the pineal gland and it's
it's pretty intense and for those of you
who know about the pineal gland I know
glad it produces melatonin for sleep it
also produces dmt which is considered a
hallucinogenic and it's not legal here
but if you stem when you stimulate the
pineal gland you can you will find that
you will see you might be able to see
like colors and
and geometric patterns so this one is
connected with the pineal gland
and as you listen on the inside getting
a sense of the energy as it moves
through the body
take another deep breath exhale relaxing
even deeper
the body will naturally start to entrain
you'll start to resonate with the
vibration
again it's almost like we're hardwired
to receive this type of vibration our
bones are skinned certain crystallite
like structures that vibrate and in
train naturally to be songs
and the idea is to remain conscious not
so passive but aware feeling on the
inside be in touch with that energy
then going even deeper allowing the body
to relax consciously relaxing
listening to all songs
around us inside of us
and then just visualize a river
of energy however it should however way
it shows up for you whatever way it
shows up for you
now visualize awake
and I don't have to go into detail as to
how this Lake looks your mind will
automatically create that link for you
it will fill in the blanks so to speak
and I will count down from five to one
and with each countdown words you will
draw closer and closer to that Lake 543
getting closer to one
standing at the edge of that Lake now
look into its waters and you will see a
reflection
just take notice of what that reflection
is
that reflection is your own energy your
higher self
you
your very essence just take notice and
you can ask anything you wish of that
vibration knowing that in some way it
will answer and again just take notice
and continuing to relax allow yourselves
to go deeper into that leg
you
and as you continue to relax and enjoy
the state of relaxation listen to the
didgeridoo ancient Australian Aboriginal
instrument
in tradition has it that if you were
able to hear the rotation of the earth
it would sound like the didgeridoo
Oh
Oh
in a few moments we'll come back to full
waking consciousness
but before we do that get a sense of
how the energy is moving in your body at
this point
getting a sense of body location
and as you feel on the inside
you will you will experience yourself
as an energy field that goes far beyond
the body
coming up from one to five with each
count upwards you
come back more and more to full waking
consciousness feeling energized
one
two
energy coming back into the body 3
taking a deep breath
for almost there and five all the way
back feeling recharged wide awake
so we haven't in our own voices we have
within our own voice the power to
vibrate any part of the body and and one
thing that people sometimes ask me is
you know how do you sing in overtones
and I answer this way is that everyone
is already singing in overtones if we
didn't have overtones already within our
voices we would all sound the same we
would not be able to know the difference
between one voice to another it's it's
the overtones the par shows that give
uniqueness to each voice but if you when
you want if you want to be able to
separate the notes so that they're more
distinct you know that's where that's
where listening comes in listening on
the inside when you hear certain sounds
you know in your own singing like you
could sing ah or ii ii there's a lot of
overtones already there but you don't
you may not notice the separation but
when you listen and then and then use
certain small movements of the tongue
and then just getting a sense of that
energy then you could start to focus
more energy into those different sounds
like
and then also using the nasal cavities
as a way to vibrate and produce even
more overtones so it's really a matter
of deep listening and really feeling on
the inside and also being able to
support that sound with with breath and
that's one of the things I'm I find with
a lot of my clients that I work with
there is a need for learning how to just
breathe naturally and deeply supporting
the breath without that breath support
you know there's really no not a lot of
energy in the body and there's no and
there's not a lot of production of the
overtones so when you're able to support
the the sound with your breath you're
able to get a lot of volume and then
that also supports the overtone singing
so and again if all you need to do is
really mean again my commitment is my
passion is to be able to empower you
know myself and people around me to be
able to use that instrument that they
already have and it is so powerful that
it's just a matter of exploring a little
bit into its use so if anyone has any
questions I'd be happy to answer them at
this point
because i think it's almost that time
and if you want to feel if you when i
play these bows when you're queer about
six or eight inches from it you could
actually feel the vibration coming from
them so if you want to get that
experience you know come on up and thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
