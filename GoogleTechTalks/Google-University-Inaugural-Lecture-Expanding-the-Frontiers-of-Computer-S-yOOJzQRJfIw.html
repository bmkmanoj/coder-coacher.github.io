boo University are sort of various
mottos including never stop learning
innovative education for Googlers and my
personal favorite which is don't be
stupid and over the course of the summer
we're having a series of inaugural
lectures on topics that are related to
Google in one way or another and I was
delighted to be able to invite Mehran
sahami as our first speaker Mayron many
of you probably already know perhaps
most of you as a Google research senior
research scientist he's taken on
additional responsibilities of being an
associate professor and associate chair
for education in the computer science
department at Stanford where he is
leading a i think a fairly radical
rethinking of the computer science
curriculum so a great way to to start
off this lecture series is by somebody
who's famous both here and up the street
and i'd like to welcome mayer on back
thank you thanks very much thanks for
coming i'll hopefully try to keep you
awake this afternoon after lunch by
talking to you a little bit about the
frontiers of computer science education
how we expand them and and trace um some
fairly eye-opening statistics some of
you may already be familiar with what's
going on computer science education but
for those of you who are not let me just
show you what many consider the most
famous chart in computer science
education and what this is is this came
from the Higher Education Research
Institute at UCLA what they do is on a
fairly regular basis they pull high
school students to determine what areas
they're interested in going into and
what this chart shows the percentage of
freshmen the incoming freshmen to
college that are intending to major in
computer science and as you can see from
that graph broken out by men the the
overall total and women back in 1999
life was good right everyone their dog
wanted to be a computer science major
the.com boom was happening we got a huge
surge in the percentage of students who
said they were interested in computer
science and since that time this graph
only goes down to two thousand four
we've come down pretty drastically as a
matter of fact in terms of percentage of
women were at a historical all-time low
with respect to how
this statistics actually been measured
right we're less than half a percent now
of incoming college freshmen women are
actually interested in going into
computer science now if we take a look
at what this has actually translated
into right so you might say well this is
student interest coming into computer
science let's spend a little bit of time
thinking about where we're going to go
from these numbers we're seeing right
now with interest in terms of how that
translates into the computer science
student pipeline looking at colleges and
also looking at some other leading
indicators in high school to see where
what is going on with students
interesting computer science from there
we'll spend a little bit of time talking
about misperceptions of the field what
are some of the factors that are
affecting students choices and what the
reality is behind the choices that
they're actually making and then I'll
spend some time going from that leading
into the curriculum revision we're doing
at Stanford which is as Peter mentioned
a pretty significant revision in terms
of our computer science curriculum I'll
tell you about the structure of the
curriculum especially if you're a
Stanford alum you'll see a lot of things
that are different some of the issues we
faced in doing it and the broader
context of trying to situate some of
these changes in terms of a larger
community of people that are that are
dealing with some similar issues and
then lastly talk a little bit about
broadening the initiative to think about
ways we can you know think about life
beyond Stanford to have an even larger
impact so to start off with a computer
science student pipeline on that
previous graph I showed you showed you
the interest of incoming college
freshman in computer science this is in
terms of when students actually gets
college what percentage of them actually
or what number of them actually end up
majoring in computer science so that's
the number of declarations and computer
science and you can see it follows that
same curve so we had a peak in 2000
around the time of the height of the
dot-com bubble and the numbers have
fallen pretty drastically in terms of
absolute numbers the number of students
going in computer science is roughly
fifty percent of the peak back in two
thousand another thing that's
interesting about this graphic there's
actually two lines on it the top number
is the total number of students going
into computer science the bottom number
is the medium number of students per
department and if you think about that
you might say well that's kind of an
interesting phenomenon because the
median number of students per
departments actually going up while the
number of students is remaining constant
right if you put those two bits of data
to get
it tells you something what does it tell
you there's fewer computer science
departments there are actually schools
that are shutting down their computer
science department these are non-trivial
schools so Tulane some of anyone
graduated from Tulane their computer
science department no longer exists and
if you're wondering ho who may have
graduated from that computer science
department David philo one of the
founders of Yahoo actually graduated
from that department it in no longer as
their as a matter of fact they shut down
most of their school of engineering
except for one or two programs and so
this number is pretty significant right
the fifty percent drop that we're seeing
here is is nationwide and if you think
about that there are some schools that
have what we refer to as control flow so
Carnegie Mellon for example any chronic
email and grads here no one that's
surprising very surprising Carnegie
Mellon actually has control flow which
means they have the same number of
students coming into their program it's
just a different number of students that
are actually applying to their program
at a given rate right which means that
if there are some schools that despite
this drop actually have the same number
of students this drop is
disproportionately larger at other
school so when I talked to some friends
at other schools for example that will
remain nameless they give me numbers
like we had an enrollment drop of eighty
percent or eighty-five percent or ninety
percent alright so they're non-trivial
drops in enrollment that are happening
now how did this translate to Stanford
right so if we bring it back to Stanford
for a moment here is the last 15 years
of data of the number of CS majors we've
had and you take a look at this graph
and you see it follows roughly the same
shape of the number of students
intending gone computer science we had a
little uptick recently but you stare at
this graph long enough and you think you
know there's another graph I've seen
that looks something like this hmmm and
then you think for a while here's a
slightly more well-known graph here's
the nasdaq composite index averaged on
an annual basis over the same period of
time and so you see this graph and you
see the other graph right and sort of
that that inner data analyst in you
comes on says what happens if i put
these on top of each other okay so i'm
not only put them on top of each other
but students are not a market in the
same way that the nasdaq is right it
takes if nasdaq fluctuate it take some
time for that information to get into
students decision-making process so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to shift
the declaration period to align it the
academic here to align it sort of
backward in time with
the calendar year and normalize these
graphs by their 1998 values and then put
them on top of each other right and what
you see is a very if I take the entire
period a very strong correlation point
six one right and they have the peak in
the same place they sort of have the
same growth ramp the same decline except
for one interesting point that you look
at and you look at that graph when you
say well something's going on sort of
later on in that graph around 2003 and
the natural question to ask is what
happened in 2003 and you start to look
all right you need to dig a little bit
more than just what happened at
universities in 2003 because there was a
lot of stuff in particular that happened
with respect to curriculum at
universities in 2003 what was happening
with something external and that
external was it was in this time prayed
that all this news started coming out
about job offshoring and that there
weren't going to be jobs in computer
science anymore because all the jobs
were going overseas so even if the
economy seemingly was recovering with
the Nasdaq coming back up that wasn't
necessarily going to translate into jobs
for computer science graduates and so as
a result that information in some form
or another you could say was
internalized by students and their
continued to be a decline in enrollments
ok interestingly if you look at the
correlation up to two thousand three
right so you just look at this 10 years
from here back the correlation is almost
ninety percent right which just
astounding for any data that's real
world data right and you get ninety
percent correlations when someone's
doctoring data but this is your pretty
astounding to think of that and then
suddenly there's this this sharp change
that happens okay so there's one
possible solution right we just get one
more bubble right and you know I
actually you know being at Google I need
to thank you for trying right so here's
here's a couple headlines from around
the time of the Google IPO well Google
bring back the IPO bring back the bubble
this one I thought was pretty clearly
interesting Google with a market cap
north of 15 billion right this was the
time of the IPO blows in the stench of
bubble to write Z we're just off by
about an order of magnitude but Google
certainly tried right I mean you could
say that a lot of the the economic boom
that's been happening that that growth
that's been happening on the Nasdaq a
lot of it came about as a result of you
know things that we're going on at
Google helping to reinvigorate the
market around high technology but the
bottom line is that hope is not a
strategy right we can't hope for their
to
Google or a bunch of other Google's or
to google for to just get so big that
everyone says I have to do computer
science right as an educator you can't
expect the rest of the world to solve
the problem for you so what can we think
about doing okay and one of the other
things you can actually think about is
historically if you take this graph
further back in time interestingly
enough we actually were in a second
bubble most people don't know about this
first bubble that happened back here
around the time of the personal computer
and hard drives and hardware that came
out was kind of when this first bubble
happened but we actually were in the
second bubble if you go back further in
time and you can see again you know just
how bad the graph is especially with
respect to women if you were taking all
the way back to the 70s okay huh so what
I would say is if you talk to some
economists who believe that there's
cyclic ality you could expect that I'm
not going to count on it right and I
think if people really knew if there was
going to be a bubble in another 15 years
the market would probably arbitrage it
out so I don't know if we can really
count on that uh-huh
that's a fantastic point and it really
leads into the point that what we need
to do is make computer science
interesting again right we need to get
what it was that was motivating these
people to come into the field because it
was interesting to them we need to
create that kind of excitement again
around computer science but I think
you're right people are cleaning to like
computational biology for example or
something and that really you know
Google still needs computer software
engineers but really the market as a
whole doesn't and they're going to
things doing computation in other fuels
that's an excellent question and you're
about 10 slides ahead of me so I'll show
you some pictures about what the market
actually looks like to and what the
demand is first the production okay so
if we look at some other statistics we
could say well what is the what's a
leading indicator right what does some
leading indicator we can use to see what
interest exists in computer science and
so one is to use the AP exam in computer
science and high school AP exam how many
people took the AP exam in high school
okay fair number so here is the / of
students taking the computer science AP
exam there's actually two exams there's
an CS a exam which is kind of roughly
comparable to a one quarter one semester
class and the ABA exam which is supposed
to be roughly comfortable to about a
year of computer science and here's
those numbers and you can see again
there's a little bit of a peek around
here the numbers decline a little bit
and flatten out just in case you're
wondering you might've heard that the AP
exam change language in fact in 2004 did
change language from C++ to Java but you
can see that that didn't have a huge
impact one way or another it did have
somewhat of a longer term impact that
some teachers eventually decide to stop
teaching computer science in high
schools because they didn't feel
prepared for the language change but
that's a separate story but you can see
that these numbers sort of go up and
decline a little bit and then you could
say well oh sure sorry got to remember
to repeat the questions or to ask you to
use a microphone get to see the
questions so you might look at this and
you might say well that's kind of
interesting but what does that really
tell me well it's more important to look
at this in contrast to a few factors one
is that the AP exam the CSA be
is actually being dropped by the College
Board starting next year so I would say
you would think computer science would
be something that you would expect
students to go into and there should be
a growth in computer science and so more
students should in fact be taking this
you know CSA be exam going forward but
in fact that the numbers for the AP exam
we're going to go away it's no longer
going to be offered after this year okay
why would that be okay and it actually
is along with a few other AP exams right
so the other ones that are also being
dropped after this you're Italian Latin
literature and French literature and if
you look at all those you might want to
come to a particular conclusion but
despite the company you cannot consider
Java Romance language okay but if you
think about this relative to what's
going on you might say maybe all AP
exams are suffering some kind of decline
right in fact no the AP exam for example
in calculus is extremely healthy has
been going up every year for the past
decade both the a/b exam and the BC
examined when you plot those relative to
computer science which you realize the
computer science one pales in comparison
and two it's not the number of students
taking the AP exam there's actually more
students every year taking AP exams in
general and there's a very healthy
pipeline of students that are taking
technically oriented courses like
calculus they're just not choosing to go
into computer science okay so before we
get too excited about what look like a
little bit of an uptick in 2006-2007 for
the csap right when you plot it on this
kind of scale it's basically just flat
and it's not in Sean nearly the kind of
growth anyone elses as a matter of fact
if we look at some other exams so here
are some places like biology and
statistics right statistics its first
year ended up a little bit lower than CS
and just zoomed up like crazy but these
are fields that you could say have some
bearing on computer science right like a
computational biology you could think of
statistics related to artificial
intelligence and machine learning so in
some sense there are other disciplines
which are somewhat CS related which are
also seeing major growth in in students
taking exams now part of this growth and
exams is just getting into college has
gotten more competitive so more students
are taking more AP exams and more
schools or offering AP courses that's
just part of what these graphs are also
telling us but one of the interesting
thing is across exams computer science
is the only exam that is actually
shown a decline and stagnation over this
period of time right so there's a bunch
of different exams if you want to go to
the College Board you can get all these
stats for the last 10 years from the
College Board and it's interesting to
see the computer science what you would
think is this booming field in the last
10 years is the one that's actually
suffering the most in terms of this
leading indicator so here's a sobering
thought the studio art AP exam how many
people knew there was an AP exam in
studio art right a couple of did someone
to actually take it did take it now um
yeah this was with what I asked was they
have AP exams in studio art yes in fact
they do and since two thousand four more
people take them than take computer
science okay again you know even studio
art just showing tremendous increase so
there's really a problem here right the
problem is not that students are
deciding not to get more prepared for
college and taking less p AP exams the
problem is specific to computer science
okay so let's think a little bit about
some of the misperceptions of the field
which are which have our causing some of
these effects we talked about some of
the economic factors previously okay so
here's a little bit of a pop quiz right
I want you to fill in the blanks
according to the bureau of labor
statistics blank right test and maintain
detailed instructions the computers
follow and blank design create and
modify computer applications and systems
and your two choices to fill in our
computer software engineering computer
programmers okay do you think you could
fill those in with certainty so here's
the interesting thing you might say but
Marilyn why are you giving me this
exercise why do I care about the
difference between computer software
engineering computer programmers because
if I go to the bureau of labor
statistics right it turns out that the
answer is the computer programmers for
some reason or the ones that right test
and maintain detailed instructions the
computers follow and software engineers
are the ones that do this other stuff
okay but if you go to the bureau of
labor statistics and I'm not talking
about the bureau of labor statistics in
the 60s I'm talking about the 2008-2009
edition of the Occupational handbook
right what you see is this picture
computer and this description right
under the picture that says computer
programmers write tests and maintain
details in structures of computers
follow and this a picture of someone
alone by themselves in a room working
with a computer
without any interaction with anyone else
without any social context while their
jobs are being sent overseas I'll show
you the stats in just a second oh and by
the way in case you're wondering they're
all white men who are glasses as EES oh
my bad thank you spelling mistake yeah
so if you read between the lines i'll
show you some more of the stats and just
second but if you read between the lines
if programming jobs are being off short
if that's the perception right and if
that makes students believe that CS is
less likely to lead to a job it means
that they must be equating computer
sciences just program okay now if we
look at the statistics as to how that
bears out here's the truth on offshoring
so the ACM commissioned a task force in
two thousand actually was before 2006
the report came out in 2006 to find out
whether or not offshoring was a
significant issue and what they found is
that there's actually more IT jobs in
the United States now then there were at
the height of the dot-com boom at the
top of the peak in 2001 there were all
those jobs there's actually more now but
students don't necessarily know about it
and even worse not only did I talk to
students I talked to that parents and
their parents don't know about it they
have their students who want to go into
computer science and their parents tell
them no you shouldn't go into that field
there's no future in computer science
and you might be wondering why well
here's what the bureau of labor
statistics has to say what's the
predicted job growth from 2006 to 2016
if you're a computer programmer remember
the definition of a programmer your
prospects are below average if you're a
sauce computer scientist or software
engineer remember the clear
distinguishing factors of what a
software engineer was your prospects are
well above average right when I showed
this to the rest of the faculty in our
department they had two comments one was
well if I can't tell the difference
between those things how do I expect
someone who's a junior or senior in high
school to write that's number one and
the second one was hey computer
scientists we might we must be okay
right because we're above average or
computer scientist in fact if you go to
the bureau of labor statistics this job
category is called computer scientists
and something else do you know what to
something else is database
administrators okay they get lumped
together in the same category so there's
certainly confusion from this Bureau
that's supposed to be telling us what
the job outlook actually look
like right and what we need to do is to
really create an awareness of Computer
Science in the large because computer
science is really fundamental to other
fields it's not just programming right
and in some sense even if you think of
Computer Sciences programming it's not
just sitting in a room by yourself
programming but it's having a
fundamental impact on other fields and
we'll see some examples of that in a bit
okay so getting back to John's question
is this really an issue right I mean are
we just if yeah there's going to be some
students trained in other areas and
everything will work out so here's
annual degree production and so this is
a portion of a slide that's courtesy of
Eric Roberts that many of you probably
know from Stanford and it's actually
triangulating if you want to read this
whole section sort of statistics coming
from a bazillion different places
because as you can imagine you know
there is lies there's damn lies and then
their statistics and so we try to get as
much sort of statistical integrity as we
can so here's annual degree production
in computer science phd's masters and
bachelors degrees and so one question
you might ask is well what's the demand
here's the demand right if you took
every single person that's the annual
demand every single person who's getting
a PhD masters or bachelors degree in
computer science including the very
worst computer science major you knew so
think back to school and think about
like that person who just managed to get
it through right what you're like oh no
way there's no way they're going to get
hired by anyone all of them get jobs and
then we need to go out to other fields
and find whoever we can to be
programmers because we can't fulfill the
demand right so in some sense the demand
is so great that it's for outstripping
the supply already uh-huh question it's
yeah this is primarily from from I think
us or maybe North America yeah the u.s.
may be different than the rest of the
world that's absolutely true but as you
saw previously right even if you
consider offshoring we still have more
jobs in terms of domestic jobs than we
do even when we consider jobs going
overseas oh
interestingly salaries have not you know
you would think you know as an economist
right supply and demand salary should
shoot way up I that's a that's a great
idea so how suggestion was we should
have for your computer scientists until
they pay more I would love it if that
were the case we just need a whole bunch
of companies to go along with back on so
no so there the question was about h-1b
visas so there's a whole separate issue
about h-1b visas and in fact there's a
vast shortage there's much fewer h-1b
visas than the number of people who need
them there's like 0 1 visas I mean all
across the board from what I've heard is
there's just a shortage of visas across
the board for foreign workers to come to
the United States
right so it's weather is looking at the
numbers from overseas I would say that I
mean the main numbers that in terms of
overseas jobs is just how many I think
the bigger worries how many jobs are
going overseas as opposed to how many
people are coming to the United States
and getting jobs it could be both but
from what I've heard from most parents
and students it tends to be more
offshoring than worries about there's
too many people coming from overseas and
taking all the jobs here I just end the
statistics bear out is they need to be
coming from overseas into getting jobs
here because we don't have enough people
here that we're domestically producing
to satisfy all those jobs but even given
all the visa quotas that exist if the
numbers I've heard is just that there's
far too few visas and the problem is
that we're still just struggling to meet
this demand even foreign students coming
out of US schools would need visas so
there could be a bit of overlap and
false data out there right so to get the
proper statistics you actually need to
do some you know conditional estimation
there I haven't done that um at Google
as in many places i'm sure there's
plenty of people from mathematics and
other sciences to fill in that purple
bar to what extent you think the choice
of of major is determined by the fact
that the perception is that you can
study physics and still go into computer
science or study mathematics or
statistics or something else and then
easily transition over to computer
science because it's somehow easier to
pick up right for most the students have
talked to they don't necessarily major
in math or chem or physics because they
eventually want to be computer
scientists they major in math or physics
because that's what they want to do and
if you I actually had some other
statistics that I'm not showing here
that show sort of degree production in
mathematics and some other fields versus
what those fields can absorb right and
the numbers are just totally reversed
basically the size of the purple bar is
about the size of the gradual
populations in those fields and as you
can imagine the people who get degrees
in physics to actually end up doing
physics there's cream skimming in that
field they're the best physicists are
the ones who did very well in graduate
studies and they're the ones who go to
physics and everyone else who was not
quite at that same level or four
ever reason decided not to go on to
graduate work ends up filling this par
so I don't think that that's the the
first-order effect is not that they want
to fill this bar by going into those
fields it's what happens naturally as a
result of the size of that purple bar in
those fields I'm sure you will come to
this later but one of the phenomenon may
be that actually it may be better to be
a good statisticians that learns to
programmer and then feels one of those
slots than vice versa than a computer
scientists trying to learn statistics a
good point so i will get and wonder you
know how these phenomena influence i
mean a person is maybe not purely a
computer scientist right and i think
that's the point is we need to take a
broader view of computer science to say
that really the traditional notion of
computer science needs to be much
broader and by doing that what we need
to think about is for the people who are
going into statistics were eventually
going to fill up this bar making sure
that they have at least the proper
grounding and computer science to go do
it in addition to all the statistical
background they get and so when we get
into the curriculum revision we're very
much kind of in that vein so let's talk
about the curriculum revision I love it
when a question leads into that segue so
at Stanford our goal is really to
educate leaders in computer science I'll
give you a few quick statistics our
annual degree production here since
we're just talking about degree
production is about 880 bachelors 125
masters 35 phd's per year and a
interesting statistic that Leia Laura
breyfogle just gave me is that there are
five hundred and fifty Stanford grads
working at Google which if you think
about how many students we actually
graduate annually versus how long google
has existed as a company there's a
non-trivial percentage of all of our
grads that are coming here nice work by
the way I'd say and and our grads want
to come here right but what our goal
really is right besides just producing
software engineers for Google is to
create leaders to shape the future in
the industry right in some sense we want
to be producing students that are
innovators entrepreneurs and leaders in
industry as well as have excellent and
research both going into academia or an
industry our goal in life is not just to
create an army of programmers right
there are lots of places where lots of
programmers are being produced and what
we want to do is produce people that are
computer
scientists who know how to program but
really are going to be leaders in their
field whatever field they choose to go
into okay and that requires a
combination of skills you do need
technical fundamentals of programming
skills I by no means want to say oh no
let's just get rid of programming not at
all we still want to emphasize
programming it's a very fundamental
skill as a computer scientist but you
need to also think about creativity and
communication with other fields to be
successful in understanding whereas
computer science going to go on how can
it impact other fields as well as itself
by communicating with others okay so in
terms of revising our undergraduate
curriculum just a little bit of
background before I get into the
nitty-gritty the field has evolved
pretty significantly as you know in the
past 20 years and generally curricula
has not evolved as quickly and the
fields going to continue to evolve an
accelerating pace so what we really want
to do is we want students to be made
explicitly aware of the options in
computer science in some sense to think
about the diversity of areas within a
large umbrella of computer science and
to think about the significant role of
computing an interdisciplinary different
programs right it's not trying to fix
the curriculum so to you know be totally
honest we didn't think our curriculum
was broken right but that doesn't mean
it can't be improved moreover what we
want to do is provide a context for
computing programming some means to
doing something it's not the end of
doing some there are some people who say
I want a program I don't care what I
program I just like programming slummy
program and that's great but most the
time when people program something they
want to produce something at the end of
it and that's what they're using
programming is a tool for as the means
to reach that end right now again I want
to emphasize once again we don't want to
discount the importance of important
software is the importance of software
engineering skills we don't want to
water down the curriculum to attract
more students we could increase the
number of computer science this tomorrow
by going to our curriculum and saying oh
you know what there's just there's too
many classes there let's just take half
from and throw them away and the other
half well we'll just make them really
easy we'll get more computer science
majors that's not what we want to do we
want to have people who are leaders and
who have these rigorous skills but at
the same time understand that there is
more to computer science than just
programming okay what we really want to
do talking about expanding the frontiers
increase the footprints of the field so
here's a two-dimensional projection of
the subfields of computer science just
some sampling of the sub
the computer sense and i put a little
note here it's a two-dimensional
projection that clearly does not capture
the relative importance or
organizational nuances of the field some
topics may be closer to you than they've
here on the slide okay so I understand
everyone would probably draw the slide
differently and on any given day I'd
probably draw it differently but here is
one way of looking at the footprints of
computer science and what most students
get now is they get a program that has
some systems and it's a little bit AI
depending on where you're at and some
bit of theory and that's computer
science right traditionally that's what
it's been and there's all these other
areas out here like machine learning and
human-computer interaction and security
and computational economics
computational biology the generally you
go and do if you want to be a graduate
student right many times these are the
kinds of things that are not available
to undergrads or if they are there the
one class you take in graphics as part
of your undergraduate program it's the
one or two classes you take an HCI is
part of your graduate your undergraduate
program it is not a whole program
concentrated in that area and so what we
want to do philosophically is basically
go from this footprint to thinking about
having a track model whether still some
portion of systems AI and theory someone
would get but a significant part of
their program would come outside of the
traditional core of what we think of as
computer science and if you think about
having more depth here there's two
things that come up one is the total
size of that little circle or oval has
to remain the same we can just say hey
guess what we want to increase the field
the number of classes you take just
doubled right no then no one will major
in computer science which keep the
number of classes the same essentially
the number of units the same while
allowing this depth now if we can do
that and allow students to choose their
depth in a variety of areas what we end
up doing as a result is just making the
whole field look bigger okay because now
what's available to you in computer
science was not the little thing inside
this circle but you can think of
computer science as this whole big pink
circle that's all available to you as an
undergraduate now if we can pull this
off the right way ok now the total
footprint is potentially larger the core
material everyone see so this guess the
question of what does it mean to be
computer scientist what is that common
core that everyone's going to share that
we call them a computer scientist and
given them a computer science degree
that core has to get smaller it
has to get smaller if we want to allow
students to take more classes out here
now what we've done the last few years
is we've actually been expanding the
scope of our program by having a bunch
of hires in different areas which are
looking at computer science and its
relation either in different areas like
robotics or Gilbert Renault for example
as a new faculty member has a joint
appointment in computer science and
developmental biology okay so he's
actually a professor of biology as well
as computer science and so we have a
number of professors we've hired in the
department's in recent years who really
work at these different areas Scott
clemmer for example is in computer
science and human computer interaction
he's also founding member of our design
institute at stanford ok and it kind of
goes across the board with with a number
of different faculty many of whom I
would imagine many of you already know
okay so what is the structure of a
curriculum look like there's kind of the
high level picture of where we'd like it
to go what's the structure really look
like so here's the revised curriculum
what we're going to have as a core this
is what everyone's required to take to
get a computer science degree in the
core we like to think of the yin and
yang of theory in systems so it's three
courses on theory and all should tell
you a little bit of the details in just
a second without going into too much
excruciating detail but is the notion of
mathematical foundations that someone
needs to have with a computer scientist
probability theory which we think of as
an increasingly important part of
computer science and data structures and
algorithms on the system side its
programming methodology in abstractions
computer organization and systems to
understanding the kind of hardware your
programs running on and principles of
systems and network so that everyone has
to have some idea of how their operating
system works and how to do something
over a network they don't need to
implement a tcp/ip stack but they should
probably be able to open a socket for
example and pass them information around
between computers so it's what level you
need to know the stuff because you can
imagine so you're going to have a whole
class on networks right that's not
what's going to be in here it's going to
be amount an appropriate amount of
networking material to make someone
facile to use a network not to implement
a network okay so what do these courses
look like I've just put a few course
numbers up there how many Stanford alums
do we have in the room a fair number so
i put the course numbers up there in
case you were wondering what they aren't
some of them are entirely new courses so
systems one is programming abstraction
methodology it's kind of our standard
106
curriculum standards sort of stuff like
basic data structures linked lists
binary trees how to program in C++
recursion kind of bread and butter you
know first or second quarter class in
computer science that's followed by
systems to which is a reworking of the
class that used to be 107 and the
philosophy here basically is from the
hardware up to your high level language
so you get a little bit of machine
architecture and memory model and data
representation right you get some
elements of complicated compilation you
don't implement a whole compiler but you
should understand what code generation
is about and how some intermediate code
actually gets generated in your compiler
so you can have a notion of how that's
going to sit on top of your machine
architecture and then some basic notions
of concurrency right this is what's a
lock what's a semaphore how do I use
them in some basic and currency if
there's processes running on my machine
right so it's from my language basically
down to the hardware in one class and
then the third class is what we refer to
as principles of computer systems this
is a new class number CS 110 if you're
kind of old-school Stanford where 110
used to be the old assembly language
class not the same we're just we're
using that number but a different class
and this is not a class on how to
implement an operating system we still
have a class on how to implement an
operating system it's later in the
curriculum for people who want to do
systems this a class on understanding
what your operating system is doing on
how to use its facilities so processes
and concurrency mechanics right what is
a context switch what does it mean to
save off that information and switch out
some other process what is thrashing all
about storage and file management how do
you actually at a low level right stuff
to disk read stuff back from disk and
networking in distributed systems right
again not implementing tcp/ip but being
able to be a facile user of tcp/ip or
other networking sorts of protocols okay
and this is these are all one quarter
classes so basically it would be a year
sequence someone doesn't have to do it
continuously in a year but basically
your sequence on the system side on the
theory side we have started off with
logical foundations and proof techniques
and this includes kind of all the
standard bread-and-butter discrete math
kind of stuff that we expect computer
scientist to know as well as some
introduction to formal languages and NP
completeness you might say well I've
seen a whole class on em to complete
this this is not you know 12 of your
favorite reductions to set its
understanding that there is a notion of
reduction and perhaps seeing the
reduction from sata3 set
you don't have to go and prove 12
different reductions you do need to know
what it means for something to be
np-complete what are the characteristics
of an MP complete algorithm what kind of
technique would you use if you wanted to
prove something that was empty complete
okay so those kinds of things we think
we can do in a quarter theory to this a
brand-new class we're going to do fondly
named CS 109 which is introduction to
probability for computer scientists when
I was at Stanford there is a CS 109
which is my favorite class and it was a
completely different class than this and
I have fun associations with this
because not only is going to have the
same number but I'm going to be teaching
this class so I look forward to it huh
huh yes calculus is a prerequisite so
there's a number of requirements which
are school of engineering requirements
which I'm not listing up here that would
include a year's worth of calculus
linear algebra years worth of physics
for example actually two quarters of
physics and then an option for another
science class so science and mathematics
are all in there these are just the ones
that are specific computer science great
question so in terms of introduction to
probability for computer scientists
we've traditionally had a class on
probability taught in the statistics
department that we required our students
to take perfectly fine class for
statistician right it would have a lot
of proofs in there a lot of things where
student would take the class and a year
and a half later they would be required
to apply that probability in some class
downstream and they wouldn't remember
any of it and so what we decided was to
create a class that has all of that same
basics of probability theory so the
first have to you know three-quarters of
the class is probability theory sort of
straight up and we talked about things
like essential theorems like bayes
theorem law of large numbers central
limit theorems we do proofs we show
inequalities right all the kinds of
things people have grown to know and
love about probability conditional
independence but we do that all in the
context of computer science applications
multinomial distribution let's talk
about hashing markov chain let's talk
about page rank hypothesis testing let's
do data analysis right and then once
we've gotten all the probability theory
out of the way we can actually give an
introduction to machine learning as well
by showing for example how does a
recommendation system at Amazon work how
does your spam filter that's doing some
kind of Bayesian filtering actually
where can go through the math with
students and potentially have them
implement that in this class of taking
up a sophomore level and hope that
that's going to help them remember
to this stuff much better than just
doing a few proofs about it and then the
third class is data structure and
algorithms CS 161 this is kind of the
classic hardcore data structures class
right not the super hardcore graduate
class but this is the kind of class that
you we would use you know the the
corpsman leisure ssin rivest in Stein
book which open this class right
algorithmic complexity analysis various
kinds of algorithms on different kinds
of structures like trees and heaps and
graphs different approaches like greedy
and randomized dynamic programming short
all the things you would expect in a
real algorithms class ok and that's
those two sort of things comprise the
core here's what the prerequisite
structure looks like i won't go into a
lot of detail about it but the basic
idea is that we're going to weave
together systems in theory so it's not
just you do a bunch of programming and
then you do a bunch of theory in that
you don't relate to each other by having
a prerequisite structure that's woven
together we can say hey finite state
machines get talked about here guess
what we're going to use finite state
automata in it thinking about your
operating system you did hashing and
data structures over there or you did
quicksort we're going to do it's
probabilistic analysis over here okay so
the two all get weave together this is
still a fairly safe center with a
curriculum that means that it's how to
for an outsider to pick a couple of
courses and now something reasonable
about computer science and my feel is
that computer science is becoming a tool
for a lot of people so eighty percent of
the people who do computer science so do
something else primarily but then they
need to code from economists to social
scientists to just about everybody so we
need to become something more similar to
a math department where people can take
a reasonable small number of courses and
have at least of the rudiments this is
still have the don t think so for people
to just be couple of courses and and
have some basis previous major in terms
of depth of course in computer science
was 15 horses alright so we've gone from
15 to six so and these are quarter
courses so that's the kind of thing that
in sophomore year by taking two classes
per quarter or someone could satisfy
this whole thing we think if you really
want less than that we had a long debate
about what should be in computer science
what is the minimal amount someone could
know and it's I'll show you some of the
tracks that we designed and just in a
second we actually said someone doing
computational biology do they need to
know about
you know networking of theater and
computational biology and the consensus
overall was yes that they do at least
it's on basic level so we've gone from
15 to six could we have gone lower
probably not without you know flames
erupting in the room but at least that's
a step there we'll see how this goes and
potentially we might make some more
changes down the line if you're on so
this sounds like a great plan the
problem is my question is then you need
to get a bunch of professors to execute
it and you didn't never get professors
to do anything you tell them to do right
way each have their own opinion about
each course and and maybe some of the
interesting relationships won't happen
as you plan them I'm glad you asked that
question so I'll show you a slide in
just a bit to show you all and was
involved in this problem but one of the
things we were doing while we were
designing these courses was we
specifically said while we're doing the
design is there one or two at least
faculty members will agree to teach this
course and we'll be on board with this
integration and so we had that
designated up front so as we went
through it and they were very closely
involved in defining the classes so our
belief is because they were involved in
doing the definition it's not we're just
going and handing it to them and say
teach this they agreed upfront to do it
and were involved in the integration but
that's a great question because you know
right you're you've you've been through
this as to how difficult it actually is
to get people to sign up to do it so I'm
happy to say all these courses are
staffed next year and we're we're
rolling it out for students who have AP
credit or prior programming experience
they can come right into this track for
students you've had no previous
experience at all there's still a funnel
what we refer to as the funnel into the
major it's our current introductory
programming class CS 106a which actually
these days about 800 students take per
year and if you consider that Stanford's
inch incoming freshman class is only
about 600 having 800 students a year
take the cs 106 a class is a pretty
substantial number and that's not even
counting students to go directly into
106b 2x which is also a fairly
substantial number there are some dash
classes up there those are classes we
might create in the future to stream
students into the computer science major
by having an introductory program in
curriculum for example focused on robots
or sensors and for example MIT under
house Direction has been doing some
wonderful things along these lines so I
want to talk more the how about how we
can potentially borrow some of those
ideas for what they're doing but I think
that's exactly the right way
go in terms of broadening the funnel
into the rest of the program and the
classes have to be at an appropriate
level of difficulty to mature students
from not necessarily having done any
programming before to being ready to
dive in somewhere some particular
subfield so that's all the the core
which is where a lot of the debate when
we were designing this came around
beyond the core we have a set of tracks
and the tracks are basically roughly
four courses some are slightly more and
these give students students need to
complete the requirement for any one
track and it gives them the ability to
develop a specialization in some depth
and I'll show you what some of those
tracks are as well as potentially have
multidisciplinary options within each
track so here's the initial set of
tracks we have we have eight artificial
intelligence theory systems kind of the
standard bread and butter then
human-computer interaction graphics
information which i think is a track
particularly interesting to google
because it's about the management and
application of structured and
unstructured data in the large-scale
right so you can imagine dealing with
large-scale data you have similar issues
if you're dealing with a large database
or you're dealing with the human genome
or you're dealing with the web graph
right in some sense all of those share
some characteristics of large-scale data
problems and data analysis and synthesis
that you want to do and that's what this
track is about bio computation the bio
computation is a real track and
computational biology it is not here is
one or two classes other algorithms for
for biological sequences go knock
yourself out now you're a computational
biologist what we decided is that if you
someone wants to do real bio computation
they need to have a year of chemistry
they need to have most of a year of
biology they need to be able to have
options take other classes for example
in the medical school at Stanford have
them all count toward a computer science
degree which is what we did so someone
can actually do a computer science
degree by doing that core set of stuff
and then taking a bunch of classes many
of whom are actually in the de biology
department and they will count toward
computer science because we really
believe that the leaders in
computational biology are going to be
the ones that are not just algorithm
assists throw the ones who also
understand the chemistry and the biology
unspecialized so we at the end of the
day we came up with something where we
said well what if someone takes a little
here and a little there and a little
there and then we said hey that's our
current program so we have a track that
people were in flight or who want to do
the old program can essentially do it
it's called unspecialized we
specifically
chose the word unspecialized to make it
unattractive we did think about making
this the generalist track we decided not
to do that that was a little too
generous we thought about making the
deprecated track that was a little too
negative and then if someone really
can't find anything in all these other
tracks we have an option that they can
individually design their own track as
long as they come up with a coherent
program that they get approval for from
their advisor they can do individually
designed so why did we choose tracks
because it explicitly shows the
available options when someone comes to
the course catalog even to look at
computer science they don't see here is
computer science here's the 15 classes
you need to take all computer scientists
do them what they see is a list of
options that looks like that and it
shows classes and things like psychology
for human-computer interaction studio
art remember our friends studio art
you're doing graphics probably a good
idea to be able to draw or at least
appreciate a good drawing so we actually
let you take art class and count them
toward your graphics program okay and it
helps eliminate the image of computer
sciences just programming right it shows
the diversity of themes that exist in
the field and it showed you what it's
possible to do with a computer science
degree besides just thinking of I get
this degree and I program right i get
this green i go make movies because we
have faculty no department who won
Academy Awards and their graphics work
right that's what students don't know
about and that's what they need to know
but it still provides the significant
programming education to make sure that
everyone who comes out from Stanford
with a degree in computer science knows
how to do this and that's still
important to us okay and it provides
organizational infrastructure from our
standpoint right so from the faculty
standpoint as the field evolves tracks
or modules right they are a
decomposition of programs what you did
with programs apply to the curriculum
there's a particular track that's not
very popular anymore that's a function
that's not called anymore you take it
out of the program right and we can add
modify and drop things as we need to
while maintaining the modular structure
of the curriculum so it makes the probe
the curriculum much easier to evolve now
you might say well beyond the track what
if I just want to take some breath I
want to take some additional classes
that's perfectly fine we still have room
for students to take a set of electives
and those electives allowed them to
either take additional breath class in
computer science or we have some track
specific electives to allow them to
really do more meaningful
multidisciplinary work in the particular
track they've chosen and
a question so this starts to sound a lot
like symbolic systems have you guys
talked to them at all about having
subsuming their program possibly or at
least coordinating with them so that for
example is symbolic systems HCI and
symbolic systems a I are almost exactly
what you're describing here right just
with some non CS classes in the in the
specialization yeah that's a good
question because symbolic systems is a
popular program we've talked to the
symbolic systems program director is
about the changes we're making the
biggest difference right now between
incorporating symbolic systems and as a
track of what we're doing is that we're
in the School of Engineering so we still
have all the school of engineering math
and science requirements symbolic
systems and humanities and science so
they don't have them so that's an issue
we need to resolve track an elective
structure and I don't think we want to
subsume in the long run I don't I think
symbolic system is a great program we
don't want to try to fold it in the
computer science we just want to make
sure that there's it's clear to students
which is the right program for them so
tracks an elective structure I won't
belabor this point I'll just go through
just this bottom point very quickly
which is that in the track there's
multidisciplinary options so if you do
the bio computation track you can take
classes in genomics and denied dynamic
models in biology which is actually a
class taught and I think in our med
school in our biology department those
count toward computer science if you're
doing graphics studio art you draw
pictures it counts toward your graphics
program and you might wonder weren't
people up in arms no in fact the people
who are pushing for this requirement
were the graphics faculty because they
said there's too many people who do
computer graphics who don't know what a
good drawing is and they should actually
understand that or things like
understanding the psychology of vision
if someone if you understand how someone
perceives an image that tells you where
you should be putting your computational
cycles in terms of rendering that image
an HCI classes like needs finding
psychology of perception cognition to
think about how do people really
understand and interact with some
software artifact or what do they really
need that's outside of just the realm of
software okay and the idea is hopefully
we can have some appeal to
non-traditional students so we wouldn't
be nearly as worried if rather than this
was being biology and statistics was
computational biology and machine
learning right so we want to bring some
of those students over in some sense to
the computer science side last but not
least we still require a capstone class
this is senior project that everyone is
required to do just like we've had
before that doesn't change so to get
a longs point where people really on
board with this I'll show you who in our
department was actually involved we have
the curriculum committee and then a
whole bunch of people beyond the
committee we had with a vast majority of
the department who was substantially
involved in this and by substantially
involved I don't mean an email right
that gets in the mini additional cabin
faculty you sent emails these are
faculty who showed up at meetings who
helped design curriculum who had real
conversations about the stuff or agreed
to teach classes and so in one
interesting thing about this there's
actually lots of ties to Google so I
just highlighted in red all the folks in
here who have some kind of tie to Google
either through funding or who've worked
here or advise one of the founders but
is the case maybe there's lots of ties
with the department so I'll briefly go
over issues there's a bunch of issues
we've considered I already talked about
this the curriculum isn't broken why fix
it students won't know what to take they
don't need to know what to take right
away because there's a common core and
then we can provide advising to help
them out but more importantly well
students know what track to take right
if everyone's taking these general
computer science classes how do they
know what artificial intelligence is
about well we work a little bit of AI or
a little bit of theory into some of
those introductory core classes but each
track also has a gateway course which is
kind of like the survey of that idea so
if you do AI there's the intro day I
class you take that class if you like it
you go on and you do that track if you
don't like it you can count that course
as an elective so there's no penalty for
trying out different areas because you
have these electives that you need to
fulfill anyway and if you manage to
sample four or five of the gateway
courses this kind of the dilettante
track and you manage to say oh there's
none of these that I actually like what
am I going to do well you're going to
graduate under the unspecialized track
because the unspecialized track is
basically all the game recourses okay
additional issues what a very few
students take a particular track that's
information gathering right if no one's
taking a particular track that tells us
something about student interest in the
field and we have a master's program and
some of the master's program
concentrations are small but they're
still available and they give us
information about where students are
going this is the big one that I think
is the most controversial issue one
students have take fewer systems courses
and potentially have weaker programming
skills okay there's two things to say
about this one is there still as you
know was mentioned there's still a
substantial amount of programming in the
curriculum so students will still be
well prepared if they want to go into a
programming job
but not all students want to take a high
intensity programming job right students
who do will take the system's track and
guess what they'll be even better
prepared in systems than our current
program prepares them now and for those
of you have gone through the current
program you know it's a pretty good
systems program and to give you data
along those lines forty-seven percent
are about how far master students
actually choose the systems track we
think with undergrads it will be the
same but there's a large number who'll
choose to do other tracks as well so
broader context just finishing up
quickly there are the broader context
for this the I Triple E and ACM have a
computing curricula 2001 report the
track model fits neatly in that there
was a workshop a couple years back
called integrative computing research
and education which was held at Stanford
I'll just highlight a few people who may
be around there's Ellen who's sitting
right there she was at that workshop
Dave Patterson he was president of the
ACM at the time always rub his head for
good luck Stewart Regis he's actually
funded by a Google grant and there was
me and a bunch of other people you know
like there's Eric Roberts there's Dan
Garcia from Berkeley so a bunch of folks
from West Coast universities and some of
the recommendations that ice are made
was that we need to change the popular
image of computing encouraged curricular
experimentation make sure introductory
students recognize the breadth of the
field and strengthen interdisciplinary
connections and we think we're hitting
all those with the curriculum revision
many peer institutions are moving in the
same direction for similar reasons
without even publicizing this curriculum
so basically we just kind of improved it
internally this one of the first public
forms are talking about this outside of
Stanford we've already had folks from
University of Washington University of
Maryland and Cornell contact us about
this program to see what kinds what
portions of it might be interesting to
them and we want to you know push it out
more broadly we have some other ideas
under consideration one would for
example be a seminar to freshmen that's
great ideas and computer science just a
one unit seminar that tells them about
different areas by showcasing faculty
and Industry speakers I may at some
point hit some of you up for that kind
of a speaking engagement and it's also a
venue to have women and minority
speakers come and say you know what
computer science not all about white men
you are glasses it's really of diverse
field and we need to build that
diversity going forward further and also
talk about these issues like career
paths and offshoring to really give them
the facts so they can understand it so
broaden the initiative just to wrap up
this need for curriculum reinvigoration
is not unique to Stanford as I mentioned
many schools are grappling with the same
issues and have the same
kind of drops in enrollment Stanford I
think has the opportunity to have a
continued leadership role in education
we've done it in the past we have the
opportunity to again because we're well
placed to make the changes in experiment
and actually actively engage in computer
science community with results writing
papers talking to people in industry
right that's why I part of the reason
for coming to talk to you is to get
feedback on this kind of thing and
material generation writing books etc so
the end of the day is really to engage
both from the academic side in the
industry side if they're things we're
doing well that you like that'd be good
to know if those things where you think
we missed the mark it's important to get
your feedback and incorporate that into
the curriculum going forward because in
the end the pipeline is something that
affect us all it's not just that the maz
that goes up in students choose to go to
computer science but 20 years from now
it'll be whether or not students chose
to code it can be into computer science
now that's going to affect what the
Nasdaq looks like it's a bi-directional
relationship and so we can all have an
impact on it so thanks very much for
your time
