welcome John kumi here to speak to us
today John used to work I think it
Lawrence Berkeley Lab's for quite a
while and these days he described
himself as a free-range researcher all
organic no antibiotics he is an adjunct
or I guess consulting professor at
Stanford no salary no responsibilities
lots of fun also affiliated with with
Berkeley Lab's still and he looks for
interesting problems to work on that in
many cases people will pay him to work
on that hopefully will do some good in
the world and he's going to talk to us
today about electricity use and
efficiency and servers and data centers
one thing i want to remind people this
is a public talk it will assuming you
signed the waiver it will go up on the
on the internet so make sure you don't
ask questions that you wouldn't want out
in public okay alright thanks John
thanks very much bill can everyone hear
me in the back so I'm going to talk to
you today about data centers but I
wanted to put that issue in a larger
context and the context is that of what
I regard as the defining challenge of
the 21st century which is that of
reducing our carbon and greenhouse gas
emissions to eighty or ninety percent
below 1990 levels by the middle of this
century hey let's
there we go sorry okay so what can we do
about the climate we know that we have
to make these substantial reductions
Calvin in this cartoon has one answer
but unfortunately this is not something
within our current technological
capabilities that of leaving for
somewhere else as I see it we have three
options we can adapt to the climate
change that we know is already in the
pipeline we can suffer accepting what
comes but what comes is likely to be
disruptive difficult and costly in terms
of lives ecosystem damage and economic
disruption or we can mitigate and so one
of the things I would like you to come
away from this talk with is an idea that
mitigation which is the third option
here this is reducing emissions
mitigation is not just about new
technology new technology is part of the
picture but I would argue at least as
important is institutional change and
also human behavioral change and so yes
we need new technology there's no doubt
about that but we also need to think
about how we organize our economic
systems our company's our households and
to change some of the arrangements that
we've come to regard as standard
practice and what we've seen
historically is that when there's a big
crisis those institutional arrangements
are changed people do actually make
those changes and those changes can
happen much more rapidly than new
technology in many cases can be widely
used and so that's kind of the big
picture to all this now I want to use
the data center area as a way to frame
that discussion and give you some very
specific examples of the kinds of
institutional problems that get in the
way of increased efficiency that get in
the way of reduced emissions and then
talk a bit about how information
technology and the kinds of work that
you folks do here can help facilitate
the institutional changes that I'm
talking about
so the name of the game of course in
solving this problem is innovation and I
mean innovation not just in technology
as i said but also individual behavior
and attitudes purchasing goods and
services purchasing of energy using
equipment and the way we operate energy
using equipment i'm not going to talk
much about that in this talk but
obviously households and and your
purchasing behavior has a huge impact on
residential emissions there's of course
technological innovation then there's
institutional innovation in each of
these cases information technology and
network externalities are most important
allies and if we play our cards right
and use information technology in a way
that it is most effective to do we will
be able to more rapidly change the
institutions that we need to that we
need to to get to where we need to be so
on the technology side I'll talk about
this briefly the main concept I'd like
you to come away with on technological
innovation is that of whole system's
clean slate redesign this is a concept
that Amy lovins in particular has become
well known for and the idea is figure
out the task that humans want to
accomplish and start from scratch don't
assume that you have to continue to
build things in the way that you always
have because last time you looked at
this technology was a lot different than
it is now and so clean slate redesign
can help you realize immense leaps in
the way technology interacts with human
being so one example is that of the
iphone here this was a case where people
actually look carefully at what people
actually wanted to do in in terms of a
phone and they made something that
people really want because it does what
it what it needs to do in a very
effective way another example is that of
the Toyota Prius the basic concept is
you want to build technology that's
better all the way around so that people
want it for more than just efficiency so
the Prius is ax is a great example this
is a very efficient car but it also
is technologically advanced it's
comfortable it holds five people it
accelerates reasonably well it has
bluetooth it has voice recognition this
is a car that was done well and that's
the kind of game-changing innovation we
need more of in order to get to where we
need to be on emissions so in the
institutional side there are a number of
different ways that you can implement
this whole system redesign concept back
in the in the early part of the
information technology revolution say
early 80s personal computers had just
come into widespread use and the
economists were wondering well where is
the productivity gain that we would
expect from all this investment in
computers and it took until the mid to
late 1990s before those productivity
gains started to become manifest in the
statistics why did that happen because
at first people put pcs in the old
institutions they didn't change anything
about the institution they just put pcs
on people's desks and that doesn't lead
to game-changing innovation what leads
to that this kind of innovation is when
you redesign the institution to use the
at the attributes of the new technology
more effectively and we saw this also
when electric motors were introduced in
the late 1800s the same sort of thing
happened people designing factories had
originally been using water wheels and
some steam engines and some other more
difficult to use technologies for power
and suddenly with the electric motor
they found they could redistribute the
process of doing manufacturing in a way
that was effective for increased
production as opposed to being
constrained by the power source that
they had so again but it took several
decades before that sort of innovation
trickled through on the business process
side there are many different ways that
you can improve the way institutions use
resources one of the examples I like is
that of the Six Sigma program DuPont
uses this particular program I visited
there are few years ago and they use
this this
specular program as a way to identify
opportunities within the company they
have a group of analysts who are not
attached to one particular business unit
instead they go into the individual
business units and they evaluate what's
going on in that business unit for
opportunities and they are assessed on
whether their initial analysis was
correct and whether when they implement
the opportunity they actually get the
savings that they had had postulated and
when I asked my friend about this who's
in dupont he said I asked him
specifically are you going to run out of
opportunities after you do this for a
few years are you going to figure out
you know that you've got it all he said
no every time something changes
technology price the way the institution
is organized new opportunities come up
and so this is a this is another example
of a game-changing innovation that can
have real substantial impact on the
efficiency of companies the resource use
of companies it's important of course
that you measure the results and that
you reward good results when they come
about it's also important to rethink
some of the underlying assumptions so
the batteries in this remote control
device back in the old days even a
couple decades ago the job of the
manufacturer of batteries was to produce
batteries that was it but nowadays
people are starting to think about
extended producer responsibility so now
battery manufacturers in in many cases
have to think about who's using their
batteries and how can we get those
batteries back to be responsibly
recycled that's a change in the way
people conceive of you know in essence
property rights and that kind of a
change can lead to radical changes in
the incentives for companies and radical
changes in the behavior of companies and
then last year their various ways to
foster and reward innovation within
companies and one great example there's
a company called right solutions which
is in Rhode Island and is a great
Harvard Business School case study on
this they developed an internal market
place for innovation
and in that marketplace any person in
the company could propose an idea each
person in the company was given ten
thousand dollars or twenty thousand
dollars of funny money each person could
propose an idea once the idea was vetted
that idea goes up as a stock in this
internal market place and if other
people in the company think it's a good
idea they can take their funny money and
apply it to the ideas that they think
are best and that allowed the best ideas
to percolate up to the management so the
management could say ah okay these three
really people everyone thinks this is a
great idea we better do this and what
wasn't just about cost savings it was
also about new products and helping
existing customers so again this is an
institutional innovation that can lead
to game-changing innovation within
companies when widely applied so one of
the lessons I think of the last twenty
or thirty years is that
environmentalists and business must get
past the adversarial relationship that
sometimes exists and one way to do that
is to start thinking about information
giving giving consumers information
about the behavior of companies so that
consumers can identify products and
companies that that are doing things the
way they think they ought to be done
people need to be able to make decisions
based on accurate information so one
example scorecard org originally started
by Environmental Defense it's a website
that uses publicly available EPA data to
identify polluters in given geographic
area so you can type in your zip code
and it will tell you who are the
polluters what are they emitting based
on the latest EPA statistics and then it
will allow you with a click of a mouse
to fax the operator of the plant saying
you don't like what they're doing so
that's one example of how information
technology can help in this way another
is that of the Carbon Disclosure Project
part of the Clinton Global Initiative
and that effort is intended to get
companies to disclose their greenhouse
gas emissions to investors into
consumers there's also information about
products that's important to release so
energy star is one
miliar example where the best products
in terms of environmental performance
and energy use and costs are identified
with a single label so that consumers
don't have to go through the process of
doing the analysis themselves it's
important to create both internal and
external pressure for continuous
improvement and reorganization and that
internal pressure comes from the desire
for cost savings within the firm the
external pressure might come from
consumers saying we want this kind of
behavior and not this other kind another
important lesson is that the supply
chain is critical and you can use the
power of the supply chain to advance
environmental goals so one example is
supplier responsibility we talked about
batteries another is to use purchasing
power to move the market so as a thought
experiment what if Walmart were to say
we're only going to sell energy star
labeled appliances from now on what
would happen is not only would there be
an increase in the sales of these
appliances leading to economies of scale
because you're producing more of them
the products that used to be niche
products with high markups would then
become products that are commonly used
and the markups would be lower so the
companies selling them would still make
profits but they've been making profits
on products that are considered to be
the standard product instead of the
advanced product and so or the niche
product and so that those two effects
actually can be quite powerful in
reducing the cost so one example that I
like the site is that of organic food I
decided to do a little field trip and I
looked at Berkeley Bowl to see well of
course they have organic bananas we do
that how much did they cost these at
Berkeley Bowl they have bananas from
dole seventy-nine cents a pound so dolle
clearly a large company has moved into
this area I went to trader joe's they
also had dole bananas a little more
expensive because they sell them per
piece and then I went to safeway they
also had organic bananas same price as
Berkeley Bowl these were bonita but the
point is that large companies had
decided that organic was something that
they wanted to go into and this is true
for other products as well now one of
the issues that comes up is what does
organic mean right this is always
labeling is a really critical thing when
you look at the the bananas they have
this this nice seal on them it says
certified organic central Union
certifications okay and so this is
something that comes up again and again
consumers when they're making decisions
they don't have time to do calculations
about which product is the most energy
efficient or will cost the least it's
important to give them relatively simple
decision rules so that they can make
good decisions easily without large
transaction costs in order for this kind
of label to exist there needs to be a
government activity or there needs to be
some sort of industry collaboration to
come to agreement on what means organic
you can't if you want it if you want
success on a large scale if you want
your eighty percent carbon reductions if
you want to have large-scale
environmental improvements you can't
just have hippies eating organic bananas
everyone has to eat the organic bananas
so let's turn to data centers there's
been a lot of confusion over the years
about this I started working on
information technology electricity use
back in the 90s and round about the year
2000 there are a couple guys running
around talking about how the internet
use eight percent of all electricity use
and all computers used thirteen percent
and the total was going to go to half of
all electricity use in 10 years this
turned out to be bunk and I spent about
two years of my professional life
proving that it was bunk but out of that
work grew the first peer-reviewed work
on data center electricity's and that's
something that I and Jennifer Mitchell
Jackson at the University of California
Berkeley and Michelle blazek at AT&amp;amp;T
worked on and that started a set of
measurements that are continued to this
day at Lawrence Berkeley Lab the goal
here is to review some of the recent
data so you can so we can talk about the
trends that we see discuss some of the
implications for industry growth and
then I'm going to move into
talking more about the institutional
issues that impede the data center
industry from improving their efficiency
so let's be clear here I'm talking
generally about the data center industry
as a whole there are different markets
and Google obviously has one specific
set of data center activities that they
use that their data centers are
optimized for right but there's a whole
world out there of many different
applications many different data centers
and I'm talking in the aggregate about
that whole world we can talk
specifically about some of the issues
that might come up in your work later so
there's a lot of recent activity a lot
of new facilities being built often you
see these announcements they don't give
relevant details like how much
electrically active floor area is there
how many servers are there likely to be
and so on so you have to be a little
careful in interpreting those
announcements we know that because of
latency and and other issues you can't
build all these data centers in one area
so they're likely to be spread around
the country we know that these are
different markets the hosting market is
different from the search market is
different from the corporate market is
different from the high performance
computing or super computer market so
when thinking about this this area you
have to separate those there's a lot of
different equipment in the data center
most people think of the information
technology equipment here computers
computer racks a but there's also power
distribution units there's
uninterruptible power supplies which
have batteries to keep the computers
running long enough to have the
generator kick in if there's an outage
there's also use the backup generators
there's also lights there's office space
and then there's the cooling and
conditioned air conditioning activities
here so there's a lot more going on in
the data center than just the computing
but this is what people tend to focus on
now these are the the standard sort of
servers that people buy off the shelf of
course you guys are doing custom servers
for your search data centers but they
can range from these these very large
high-end boxes to
one you and to you service each you is
about this thick it's like a shape of a
pizza box a 1u server is about this big
and those tend to be the volume servers
and it turns out those tend to use the
most electricity in the aggregate
there's also of course there's storage
the disk drives there's also networking
equipment that uses electricity as well
so one of the other lessons of years of
working in this area is anytime you see
a watts per square foot number related
to data centers watch out people are
generally very careless about defining
what the watts are as well as what the
square footage is and so this is an
example from American Society of heating
refrigeration and air conditioning
engineers it's a fork at history and
forecasts of their estimated heat load
per product footprint so this is watts
per equipment square foot so for a rack
it's about six square feet so they're
taking the total power use of this rack
of servers dividing by six square feet
and that's what this number means and
you see numbers you know here 100 200
400 thousand you know by 2004-2005 we're
looking at six thousand watts per square
foot well that's true for product
footprint but that doesn't tell you
anything about how these things are
actually used in real facilities and so
if you really want to have a sense for
what's going on in real facilities you
have to be much more careful about the
way that you express floor area so the
uptime Institute is a user group it's a
group of data centers who come together
to share information in a confidential
way and in this case i was able to
convince them to release some of their
data on watts per square foot when I'm
talking about watts per square foot I'm
talking about information technology
load so the computers the servers the
disk drives the networking equipment and
the square footage is what we call the
electrically active floor area also
often called the raised floor area
though not all data centers have raised
floors but it's it's basically the
computer space the place where the
computers are not talking about the
floor area of the where the heating
cooling and
fans occupy this is just about the
computer space and uptime they've
tracked over the last eight years
they've tracked data centers 19 data
centers and the total represents about a
little under 1 million square feet in 99
and so i'm going to show you the the
graph of those data this is plotted as
an index so 1999 equals 1 point 0 and
we've got three things plotted here one
is the index of total power which is
this dark one one is the index of floor
area and one is the index of watts per
square foot so on the floor area side
you see something interesting happening
here is that in these 19 facilities you
have a decline in the floor area so
there's some consolidation happening
after during and after the tech bust and
then around 2000 to you started to see
some uptick just a little bit in terms
of how much area was being devoted to
data centers in these in these specific
facilities you also on the watts per
square foot side the index goes up about
thirty five forty percent over this the
seven eight year period and it goes from
about twenty three watts of square foot
to 35 watts of square foot so those
numbers are very different from the ones
I showed you earlier and these are real
facilities lots of times people because
of constraints and air conditioning or
power they will spread the server's out
over larger areas and make it you know
in other words use the existing facility
in a way that can hold some of the newer
equipment but in order to hold the newer
equipment which is denser and power use
you have to spread it out more so there
is definitely growth though in these
existing facilities there's no doubt
about it they've definitely been putting
more equipment more powerful equipment
in these facilities so that's those are
specific facilities what about the
aggregate one of the things that I
wanted to know in the last couple years
was how is total data center power use
growing and I managed to convince AMD to
fund research on that specific question
and it's downloadable here all major
industry players reviewed it including
bill including Intel including all the
server manufacturers and so this
research was vetted pretty thoroughly
and it used data from IDC which is
probably the most widely used source for
data on the server market and
fortunately AMD paid the the cost using
their own contract for the data from
from IDC the goal was to estimate
historical data so we looked at year
2000 year two thousand five we looked at
volume servers which are the most common
ones those one you and to you pizza box
servers that I talked about the
mid-range servers and then the high-end
servers looked at the US and the world
and for each of the two estimate the
power use for the different segments I
actually looked at the most popular
models of each computer type and used
either measured data or engineering
estimates to get the power use for those
and this is the summary of the results
here we have the US here we have the
world on this axis is total electricity
use in billion kilowatt hours per year
for context the u.s. electricity use is
on the order of thirty five hundred
billion kilowatt hours per year in 2005
and so I've broken it up this is
electricity use I've broken it up for
the year two thousand and two thousand
five into volume servers mid-range
high-end servers and then the cooling
and auxiliary equipment so that's the
losses in the power distribution system
so one thing you see immediately is that
big chunk of this electricity use is the
cooling and auxiliary equipment
typically for every watt of server power
there's another wat devoted to the
cooling or associated with losses in the
Power Distribution another thing to take
from this is that this is the growth
here is mainly a story of volume servers
you don't see much change in the
absolute amounts here for high-end
servers and mid-range server so that's
that's also very important and then
in the aggregate we're seeing over this
five-year period about a doubling so
pretty substantial growth the average
annual growth is something on the order
of sixteen percent per year bill looks
like the percentage of high-end
mid-range tiny mid-range servers is
higher and the rest of the world in the
US so fair Paris is it I think well that
part of that is an optical illusion
because these bars are higher look
that's probably true the engine as well
yeah you do see there's definitely a
reduction in the number of mid-range
servers that is from the over this
period pretty substantial reduction in
the installed base of mid-range servers
high-end servers stay about constant
terms of their absolute numbers so
there's about a doubling here sixteen
percent per year annual growth most of
the growth is volume servers so that's
one of the key lessons from these
results so this is follow-on work that's
going to be released officially in the
next week or so same data set but I
wanted to break the data down regionally
so you could get a sense for this the
u.s. is still a dominant market this is
2000 in 2005 still the dominant market
here with roughly thirty five percent
market share Western Europe is second
together those two areas comprise about
two-thirds of total electricity used by
servers you have asia-pacific excluding
Japan here at thirteen percent the rest
of the world I think at about twelve and
Japan at a little more than ten so so
certainly the developed countries plus
Japan are the dominant current use but
what we see is in terms of average
annual growth rates over that period
2000-2005 the asia-pacific region
excluding Japan is the only one growing
significantly faster than the world
average so roughly twenty three percent
i think annual average growth rates and
somewhat lower growth here in the US and
japan these are about average here so
there was a report to congress on data
centers released in august of this year
have built on that AMD analysis that i
described
I've also downloadable purpose was to
give a sense for the total electricity
use but also to identify barriers and
opportunities for both government and
business this is a summary of that and
the the server numbers are about the
same as what I had in the earlier study
the important point to take from this is
that this includes both the storage and
the networking equipment and again still
the story is volumes servers are driving
the growth storage and networking does
increase no doubt but it's a much
smaller percentage of the pie then the
servers and particularly the mid-range
servers so there are a lot of trends
pushing the total data center power use
up and you guys are at the heart of some
of these demands here those demands for
e-commerce voice over IP search
software-as-a-service video downloads
resilience in the face of disaster so
sometimes you have to have mirror data
centers in case something happens
there's also regulatory compliance
issues that lead to increased used for
data storage and electricity use and
then of course there's demand for the
kind of transformation that IT enables
change big changes in the way business
operates you also have general trends
that are putting more transistors on a
chip more RAM and servers and more
volume service those also drive
electricity use one of the the terms
that can brill at uptime likes to use is
the the number of watts of server
electricity per thousand dollars of
spending on IT hardware and because of
these trends the watts per thousand
dollars of IT expenditures these these
trends have been going up and that means
that in data centers the auxiliary
equipment &amp;amp; cooling costs as a fraction
of the total costs are increasing very
substantially and we'll see in a second
what that implies so on the downside of
course you've got trends towards
virtualization consolidation better
management of data center operations
you've got constraints and power and
cooling particularly in areas like New
York
city you have a recognition by the sea
level folks in the company the CEO the
CTO the CIO that they're going to need
to address some of these inefficiencies
that exist within many data centers from
simply from a cost perspective you also
have metrics that are now coming in the
spec power group as well as the EPA and
the deal we are working in this area to
help people get a metric for continuous
improvement of either server power or
operational efficiency of data centers
and then there's some rebates the
utility area throughout the data center
there are misplaced incentives so one of
the big problems is that energy
efficiency metrics are not standardized
and so different companies use different
measures of their efficiency some don't
even measure it but those that do don't
have a standardized way and can't
compare to how they're doing compared to
other firms ninety percent of the costs
related to cooling and infrastructure
are actually kilowatt related not square
foot related but almost always either
internally or externally data centers
are charged per square foot so if you
want to put in servers into a data
center they'll give you a
per-square-foot cost this is changing
slowly but again if you're not paying
for the true cost of what your what your
actions are you're likely to act in a
way that's going to be less efficient
than than otherwise very often the
utility bills in the infrastructure
costs are in two separate departments so
the IT department has no incentive to
spend an additional dollar on an
efficient server even though it would
save five dollars on the infrastructure
side you also have differences of
hierarchy and culture within
organizations and so facilities folks IT
folks and the the finance folks don't
talk enough they don't talk well they
don't use the same words to describe
different concepts and different kinds
of different words to describe the same
concept part of what's going on in the
data center is humans have a limited
ability to manage complexity and so what
they do in the face of complexity is
they establish rules of thumb that
provide safety margin so that
they're not going to the data center is
not going to go down they're not going
to get fired and so on so people will
often they'll take the rated power of
the computer which is typically two or
three times the actual power use and
then they'll double it when they're
sizing the power conditioning equipment
or the cooling and to that of course
leads to great inefficiencies in the
building and operation of these
facilities so in order to understand
what's going on in terms of incentives
here I wanted to to look at the total
costs and I did this model with funding
from IBM threw up time to look at the
the various costs in a data center
that's high performance computing for
financial applications so it would be
for one of the financial houses in New
York who are doing derivatives modeling
and analysis of the markets and looked
at all the different components of the
cost and for this particular kind of
facility this represents typical
industry practice and this is the end
result their site infrastructure costs
in other words the cost of the cooling
equipment the cost of the power
conditioning equipment the cost of the
distribution of power turns out to be
about two-thirds of the capital cost of
the IT so you think when you think of a
data center you think of IT but you
think of computers but when you're
building a data center something like
two-thirds of the capital cost is
actually associating this is on an
annualized basis so it deals with the
lifetimes of the equipment something
like two-thirds of the annualized cost
is actually site infrastructure and
because the watts per thousand dollars
of computing equipment has been going up
that means that this term is continuing
to grow and in some cases it's already
equal to or surpassed the IT costs in a
data center so that's one of the reasons
why the sea level is paying attention
now it used to be these facilities cost
in the tens of millions now they cost in
the hundreds of millions and that's a
level of expenditure that gets the
attention of the CEO because they need
to think well we're spending 300 million
dollars is there some way we can do
something about that and because of all
these inefficiencies in the way the
organization works and the way
information flows there's a lot of
opportunities for improving
the efficiency so on the efficiency side
whole system redesign is again the name
of the game making sure the incentives
are aligned towards minimizing total
cost of ownership is critical so you
have to make sure that within the
organization there's one budget for the
data center and the people making
decisions all have to be in the room at
the same time the facilities the IT the
real estate folks and the financial
folks the easy stuff with in data
centers you can change some of the
infrastructure operations you can start
charging for power for example typically
it when you when people move data
centers they find ten to thirty percent
of the servers are sitting there using
electricity not doing anything people
were afraid to turn them off so again
this comes to the difficulty of managing
complexity if you had a comprehensive
inventory of all the servers in your
data center what they're doing what
software they're running and so on then
you would be able to tell that pretty
quickly but in many data centers that's
not the case now in many of the servers
that you see the high-end stuff the sir
the power supplies are pretty good but
for the lower end servers the power
supply efficiencies are certainly in the
eighty percent maybe lower range and we
know that we can build power supplies
that are close to ninety percent
efficient why doesn't that happen
because the people design the servers
say oh no we're competing on first costs
and we can't spend that additional
twenty dollars or thirty dollars on the
power supply even though it will save a
hundred bucks on the infrastructure
costs and the trick is how do you change
the incentives so that people are not
competing on first costs because really
at the end of the day the customers have
to start demanding that they're there
we'd love to pay you thirty dollars for
the power supply that's an opportunity
for you guys and they need think that
manufacturers need to get outside that
there's other things related to metrics
switching over DC power as a whole
another kettle of fish which has
potential benefits in some costs as well
then there's a whole virtualization area
so I wanted to show you one example it's
not quite whole system redesign because
we only did this over the course of
maybe six months I
down next to Laurie weigel at the
meeting where I also sat next to Bill it
was a do a meeting in December of 2006
and I said as soon as I learned that
Laurie was head of server marketing i
said here's something you guys could do
that could make a real difference and
the idea was take all the efficiency
technology build two racks build a
standard rack that looked like good
current practice and then builds another
rack they called it an eco rack because
they're good at marketing right and the
idea was to put as much efficiency
technology as they could into that
second rack have a meter showing the
power used by both of them to make it
very simple you mean I could buy this
rack instead of this rack and it would
save me this much money thank you very
much I'll take this one and the they got
to about sixteen to eighteen percent
savings compared to good current
practice and that's the good current
practice include ninety percent
efficient power supplies they're working
on a couple of iterations of this this
is a summary of the of the results
here's power use per rack kilowatts
measured as UPS input this is the
standard rack in idle mode so it's not
doing anything standard rack in full
utilization mode and the Eco rack saves
between one and a half and two kilowatts
so sixteen to eighteen percent in those
two cases one source of savings came
from adding a better processor another
source came in moving to high-density
dim so if you have one gigabyte dims and
you switch to two gigabyte themes turns
out there's a fixed power cost for each
dim so if you go to two gigabyte dims
most people don't know this it so it's
very odd I hate a lot of people when I
say this or like oh yeah that's a good
idea and then they also use DC power on
this one and that intel has been working
very hard on the DC power concepts part
of the savings from that comes from at
the plug part of it comes in the
infrastructure even if you stuck to AC
power of course there's a lot of
opportunities so let me just summarize
because I think we want to leave enough
time for questions here for servers the
total power use is about 1.2 percent of
us electricity is
so it doesn't sound like much but it's
basically doubled over the last the
five-year period two thousand two
thousand five if you include storage and
networking gets you up to about one and
a half percent of electricity use it's
likely you know if the IDC number is
uninstalled base for servers holds
you're still going to see some increases
over the next five years between forty
and seventy-six percent or so within
existing facilities watts per square
foot appear to be going up so people are
putting more servers in existing
facilities and packing them more densely
volume servers are the name of the game
here they're driving the growth and
that's where the power uses within this
area there are perverse incentives all
over the place and that's exactly where
these kind of institutional changes can
make a huge difference once you align
incentives then people within the
companies start feeling empowered to
reduce total cost of ownership instead
of minimizing hassle or keeping the boss
happy and at the end name of the game is
minimizing total cost of ownership
increasing profits you want alignment
between individuals in the organization
and the organization's goals the need
for organizational change in this sector
is driven mainly by the fact that
infrastructure cost is a fraction of
total cost in the data center have been
going up very rapidly and will continue
as based on the best current data we
know that met having metrics is really
critical if you can't measure it you
can't manage it so the spec power group
is working on metrics for servers EPA
and deal we are working on metrics for
the infrastructure side and there are a
lot of changes happening now because the
manufacturers are realizing that their
customers are having problems and they
need to help those customers solve those
problems so I want to end again with
this really important point in order to
solve the climate problem we need new
technology for sure but we also need to
make changes in the way our institutions
are organized and the way people behave
and if we do that we will be able to to
make much more substantial reduction
and if we just focus on technical fixes
we know that even currently available
technologies that are cost-effective and
beneficial are not being adopted so that
in itself is proof that we need these
kind of institutional and personal
changes and we also know that
information technology as embodied by
the work that folks at Google are doing
is key to achieving and capturing these
kind of changes so with that I'd like to
turn it out to questions I've exhausted
you all there has to be one question I'm
like we can also take questions from the
remote sites
all right you said that the eco brad had
a savings of our sixteen to eighteen
percent what was the cost well the Intel
folks estimated there was roughly
comparable costs and they were removing
part of the thing that part of what
happens when you go to DC power is that
you actually use fewer components so
there was actually a cost savings there
but they didn't do a full detailed
engineering analysis we're hoping that
for the next version that we will
actually get costing from some of the
big OEM so that we can we can lay it out
really clearly but since this is
basically they had six months to do it
they had their hands full just building
it so I'll ask a question Oh God so if
if I were the CEO of some random company
which thank God I'm not thank God for me
and for the company uh-huh you've
retired from that sort of activity what
would your advice be in terms of key
institutional change that the CEO that I
should try to push in my company to
actually really make a difference around
this I think the most important thing is
to assign one person responsibility for
the overall financial performance of
data centers and usually that person is
the CFO the chief financial officer and
that person you should have the
facilities people and the IT people and
whatever financial folks are related to
this decision all plugged into one
person so that when there's a decision
to be made all those people are in the
room and the you know the facilities
folks can raise their hand and say oh no
we can't have that generator for six
months because there's backlogs or you
know the IT folks can say you know we
can't spend this addiction ten dollars
and some other folks can say well the
whole system cost says yes you can but
you need to have everyone in the room
and it needs to be one person
responsible for the total cost and if
you do that I think you'll see some big
changes very rapidly and how the
facilities are designed and operated
any other questions talk show it may be
unrelated to your talk but what are the
trends in the use of renewable energy
for powering data centers for powering
data center yeah renewable energy for
powering data center do you know about
the trends well I know that there are
some facilities that have put solar on
the roof but the energy densities of
these is are much much higher than
typical facilities I know also some have
sorted to use geo exchange so that you
use ground source heat pump for you know
accessing some of the heat in the ground
but i would say we're only at the
beginning of that evolution I don't have
a whole lot of examples for you but I
know that people are starting to think
about it thank you
yes you mentioned the different power
usage is at idle verse not idle have you
seen any research with regards to
basically shutting off some of the
machines and a setter and using stuff
like that yeah there are actually some
companies that are starting to
experiment with this specific thing and
so it's not just when you do
virtualization you're combining
different instances of the operating
system on one box but some have started
what as long as they have the right
equipment in the data center some have
started actually to shut off servers
that are not being used now that takes
some very sophisticated software to do
the predictions and understand the
trends in the loads and so on but
because there's so much inefficiency in
the way these things are designed and
operated there's a great potential for
money savings from that and the key
impediment has been fear about
reliability and once there are a few
demonstrated examples like this
high-profile examples then you'll start
to see people making the kind of
investments and changes that are needed
at that level but it's not trivial to do
but it's definitely given current
technology and current understanding we
know we can do it because I just I was
just visiting a company that was doing
it this morning so I know that it's it's
starting to happen but it takes a fair
amount of investment to start with and
then it takes the sophistication of
people who have been doing this stuff
for a long time to make it really work
and then to satisfy the people who are
fanatic about reliability as they should
be within the data center any other
questions
can't you guys kind of go in sequence
you know so I could optimize my you know
people seeks here so the how much of a
problem is it the way the electric rates
are structured like the you know if
you're a big consumer of electricity you
get your marginal cost per kilowatt
hours peanuts compared to residential
users for example well one of the
reasons why the electricity costs are
much cheaper is because it's much
cheaper to serve these customers because
they're so big and so half typically
half of the cost of your residential
bill is actually the distribution
network so all those the wires outside
your house that is something that a big
data center typically doesn't have to
deal with and so the costs are actually
a lot lower my sense is that even that's
not the main thing driving this the main
issue is that internally it's very hard
to coordinate how people make decisions
and how they operate the facilities and
because these are such big users they're
going to get lower rates just because
their costs are lower for the utility
hey John hello um what can you share
with us about what future plans the EPA
has in store for us as far as data
centers go okay well what I know is that
Andrew fanara who works in the labeling
branch at EPA has been working on
specification Energy Star specification
a label for servers so specifically on
the equipment side there's another group
at EPA that's working with the part of
energy on the facilities side my
understanding from and room they started
accepting comments and going to
different different venues around the
country to get feedback from different
industry groups they were just at the
uptime Institute meeting in Santa Fe and
the schedules as far as I understand it
is sometime in 2008 they hope to have
some sort of energy start specification
for servers but I think that's
undetermined exactly how that's going to
work but but Andrew wants to do it
and as long as there's a way to do it
that balances the needs of Industry to
have the full choice of servers that
they need and also give the information
so that customers can make sensible
choices then I think he's going to go
forward and part of this will be related
to the spec power work that's coming out
in the next month or so so there that'll
be a basis for measurements of power use
of specific servers that the EPA can
then use credibly to to analyze what
different efficiency levels could work
on the infrastructure side I think
they're not quite as far along there so
I wouldn't expect anything too soon but
in the next year or two probably
anything else other questions all right
thank you very much John I appreciate
all of you
