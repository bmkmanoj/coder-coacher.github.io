and in my 20% time I'm working with the
personal growth series and we're trying
to bring you more resources to help you
improve your life your work so in that
spirit I'm here today to introduce dr.
dan Siegel he's co-director of the
mindful awareness Research Center at
UCLA he's clinical professor of
psychiatry at the UCLA School of
Medicine where he's also on the faculty
of the Center for culture and brain and
development C dr. Siegel is author of
mine site the mindful brain the mindful
therapist and parenting from the inside
out which he co-authored with Mary Hart
syllabus so dr. Siegel previous that
came and talked to us in 2009 and this
morning we're lucky to have him back I
really fortunate and he came before the
publication of his book mine site so
he's here today to kind of deliver some
new insights and if you will on mine
site and why it's applicable to you I've
cultivated for personal and professional
growth so that's all for me I'd like to
turn over thank you very much it's a
pleasure to be here with you today thank
you Aditya and thank you google for
having me here
can you hear okay in the world's
wherever we're projecting yes wonderful
great so today we're going to talk about
something called taking time in and it
builds on this concept of mind site
which I spoke about at Google University
a few years ago and it allows us to go
deeply into the idea of asking the
question what brings health into our
lives by looking at what the mind is and
I'm happy to report to you an unhappy
statistic which is that I've asked
100,000 mental health professionals now
if they've ever been given a lecture
that defined what the mind is and what
percentage of a hundred thousand people
all around the planet from the field of
mental health psychiatry psychology
Social Work nursing what percentage do
you think have been given a definition
of the mind it's very low it's two to
five percent all around the planet which
is an amazing number so this first
question and are the slides available to
everyone to see or we can we can show
them later the first question is what is
the mind and if it's a google or
anywhere we want to say we want to help
cultivate a healthy mind how can we
start to address that question if we
don't have a definition of the mind so
the work I do in a field called
interpersonal neurobiology tries to
address this question head-on by
offering a working definition of the
mind at least one aspect of the mind
that allows us to develop a healthy mind
does that make sense
so in in doing this then I'm walking
through this we're gonna do a couple of
things we're gonna walk through the
science of the mind we're gonna ask the
question how do you develop health of
the mind and then if we have time we're
gonna actually do a practice that will
increase the health of your mind okay so
here we go so the first thing to say in
addressing this is that we have a kind
of challenge ahead of us you can see
here that the issue now in the modern
age and certainly our Internet is a part
of it is that we're having this
ever-expanding world of external things
drawing our attention to it attention is
the process that regulates the focus of
energy and information really and we
experience it every day you focus
attention on this or if I go like this
you'll focus your attention on my
clapping my hands and the Internet
provides us with this infinite set of
stimuli that draws our attention outward
and one of the main messages of today's
talk is we need to balance that by
having a focus of attention inward and
as you'll see it actually helps
cultivate the parts of the brain that
generate health and I'm gonna now
present that to you now but this is the
issue that the focus of attention
externally is far from the world of the
circuits that calm us or the
interactions with other people that calm
us
so if you're feeling sometimes a lot of
stress and anxiety here are some of the
reasons that might be the case that if
we're constantly that's perpetually
focusing on external things we can have
this persistent sense of incompletion
you know how do you ever finish things
you know in the old days we used to read
something you may remember called a book
and a book had a beginning a middle and
an end and when you finish the book you
felt like you had achieved something but
when do you ever finish anything on the
web it's endless and that for a nervous
system makes us well nervous we have
this nagging sense of a bottomless pit
of things to do and a hidden feeling
even of being invisible all of these
things create a state of dis is and
anxiety and stress that is not of the
healthy sort so time in as you'll see
isn't a approach that can help us
provide an antidote to those stresses
when you say well if we're trying to
develop a healthy self let's just use
that word for a moment before we get
into the mind what is the self now
amazingly even this term doesn't have
much of a definition now you may think
that your self resides only in your body
but actually if you look at studies of
how the self develops which is what I'm
trained in as a researcher in
relationships you find that the self is
actually connected to the environment in
which it's growing right so that your
relationships with other people the
things that you do are the context both
external the environmental interactions
we have and demands from our environment
and in an internal and when we're far
from the internal experiences that shape
a self then you don't have the capacity
to actually change your mind toward
health as you'll see so the self is not
created in isolation in fact if you can
see from this this diagram is created at
least in two places one is the embodied
brain that is this nervous system that's
distributed throughout the whole body
which we'll just call the brain for
short and relationships and what I want
to ask you to do
reflect for a moment how would
relationships in your life be related in
any way to your interpersonal
relationships beginning there how could
that be and then you see on this
triangle we have the mind what is the
connection between relationships the
brain and the mind now that by itself
could be an entire semester at a
university which is what I do and we
teach about this you could take this one
slide and you could actually spend an
entire semester focusing on how do these
three things go together so for the
purpose of our talk today I'll just say
that we see the mind in fact as emerging
from how energy and information flow is
shared in relationships so relationships
are defined as the sharing of energy and
information like I'm doing with you
right now and the brain the embodied
nervous system is the bodily mechanism
through which energy and information
flows you remember from basic biology
that the nervous system is basically a
system of interconnected neurons and the
supportive cells around them called glia
and essentially what it's all about is
electrochemical energy flow and
sometimes those patterns have symbolic
value and we call that information so
energy and information flowing through
the body is what the nervous system is
all about and relationships are all
about right now I'm sending something to
you you receive it it's energy I'm
sending to you sometimes if I go up on
my mom I'm up there isn't much symbolic
value to it sometimes I might say Golden
Gate Bridge and suddenly that that
phrase Golden Gate Bridge has symbolic
informational value so basically in
science we talk about an emergent
property that arises from complex
systems that's called this
self-organizing process and this
self-organizing process is what I'm
approach to you is what the mind is and
that the mind is not just in your body
but it's also emerging in your
relationships and the way to really
imagine that is the system that you're
looking
at is patterns of energy and information
flow that are not restricted to your
skin you're immersed in a pattern of
energy information flow just think about
what you do at Google think about what
you do on the internet think about what
you do in your life
we are constantly immersed in energy and
information flow sharing now when that's
only externally focused we get very
limited in what we can do now how do you
embrace health in this view this is
again an entire semesters worth on one
slide but it goes like this through a
long line of reasoning that in all the
different books I've published I you'll
see the science behind this so you may
say well where's the science behind it
it's it's published but I just want to
give you the take home message health if
you say I want to develop a healthy mind
health arises from a process called
integration integration defined this way
as the linkage of differentiated parts
so let's take for example your own brain
if you don't allow the two sides of your
brain to be differentiated to be
specialized in the unique wonderful ways
that they are and then also become
linked you can show a person will have
restrictions in health and you can show
this literally on an MRI you can show in
a relationship let's say someone you
live with if you're not honoring each
other's differences and promoting
healthy caring communication that's the
linkage part it won't be a healthy
relationship now how do you know when a
system is not healthy this is how you
know when an integration is happening
whether it's in your nervous system or
in your relationships
it's harmonious it's flexible adaptive
and it has a certain stability and
energy and vitality to it that's the
integration piece but when integration
is not happening you move to chaos or
rigidity now you can look at subtle
forms of chaos where you just feel like
life isn't what you want to be in you
just feel you're in turmoil or rigidity
I feel no there's no meaning to my life
I feel kind of disconnected from my self
other
people my body that would be example of
rigidity or the extremes of course you
can show major forms of illness but even
in the subtle ways that our health is
compromised this graph of chaos and
rigidity basically explains a lot of
what happens in human life so here's
what I'm going to propose to you is the
following that time in practices which
we're going to talk about right now time
in practices are the way you integrate
both your nervous system that is your
embodied energy and information flow
patterns and your relationships and
again everything I'm saying I mean I
hear myself cited I say that sounds too
simple luckily there's literally
thousands of scientific articles that
support these slides so these are like
to take home how do I make use of this
so just look at any of the books that
I've been a part of publishing or
written myself and here's the bottom
line
time in practices which we're to define
in a moment they cultivate integration
so if you say well at work let's say at
Google what should I do or any where you
work what should I do with my life and
you say well at least you should be
doing a time in practice and though the
body is clean and beautiful wonderful
and our relations are clean and
beautiful wonderful if you think about
brushing your teeth right how many of
you brush your teeth
okay now actually there was a time when
we didn't brush our teeth and what what
was a problem with not brushing your
teeth our teeth became unhealthy our
gums became unhealthy right we didn't
have good dental hygiene well time and
practices are all about keeping the mind
fit keeping the brain integrated and
keeping your relationships empathic and
supportive that's what time in does and
there's an extensive amount of
literature behind what I'm saying so let
me just give you the bottom line you say
if integration is health
I want health in my life great how do
you achieve it you have a regular time
in practice just like you have a regular
brushing of your teeth we need to start
creating not only in you that all of you
who work here but we need to think
creatively
how can systems like Google that
influence the mind of humanity take an
active part in making time in a regular
practice throughout the planet because
this is a serious moment when actually
we can start influencing people to
create health in their lives now how
does that work well here's the proposal
there's something called attunement
which again is all these are all very
deep processes but the bottom line is a
Tumut is where you focus attention on
the internal nature either of someone
else in a relationship so like if you're
close to someone you don't just respond
to their behavior you respond to what's
going on inside of them their thoughts
their feelings their memories their
hopes their dreams that's the key to a
healthy relationship and a time in
practice it actually builds the circuits
of the brain bless you that not only
allow you to tune into others with more
power and specificity which it does but
it also allows you to develop the
circuits of internal attunement we're an
observing part of yourself actually
tunes into an experiencing part and when
you do that there's a sense of safety
stability clarity and coherence that is
in your own mental life so if you say oh
my god my life is so feeling chaotic and
crazy I just feel sort of afraid this
gives you a feeling of safety stability
clarity and coherence and when you look
at the brain you can actually show that
the parts of the brain that regulate the
brain and give a feeling of safety
stability clarity and coherence all the
things that Timon gives you you can show
that those parts of the brain for those
of you like the science are the circuits
that link widely separate areas to each
other widely separated areas are the
differentiated parts of the nervous
system and you can show that the
circuits which link them which are
called of course integrative circuits
are the circuits that are stimulated to
be active with time and practices and to
now here's the secret to the sauce
integrative circuits in the brain our
regulatory circuits so if you say I want
to learn how to really bring myself more
into balance to coordinate and balance
my whole bodily experience time and
practices are the route integrative
focus of the mind stimulates the growth
of integrative circuits in the brain
which are regulatory so that's the whole
that's it in a nutshell whether you're
doing that internally or doing that with
the internal world of someone else a
Tumen is an integrative form of
communication that allows you to
stimulate the growth of these
integrative fibers of the brain that's
the whole secret okay so mine site is
how we do this because it's a teachable
capacity that I'm going to teach you
about right now to monitor the flow of
energy information within relationships
in the embodied brain so from this talk
I hope you're seeing if say well hold on
Dan didn't tell us where the mind was
well this one aspect of the mind not
subjective experience necessary their
awareness those are very important in
different aspects of the mind but the
regulatory aspect of the mind is in your
body and it's in your relationships the
body is really really important and your
relationships are really really
important they're not just coincidental
for any of us who are focused on
technology and science like I am too you
know we can kind of focus on all the
interesting concepts the data all the
technological aspects and the scientific
findings and we can forget about
relationships and forget about the body
but in fact they're the essence of
health and so we can make ourselves
non-integrated and do well in these
these areas but in fact it isn't being
integrated now once you learn to monitor
with more clarity
you can then modulate toward integration
and that's what the whole mind side
approach is about which is summarized on
this slide just to review because now
we're going to dive into the practice
basically we've defined the mind even
though a hundred thousand professionals
have revealed that even the field of
mental health doesn't have a definition
of mine you're going to be
define the field of psychology doesn't
have a definition of mine the field of
the philosophy of mine doesn't have a
definition of mine the field of
cognitive neuroscience does not have a
definition of mine the field of
education does not have a definition of
mine so mental health is not alone it
turns out there actually isn't a
definition of the mind it's kind of wild
and believe me those are amazing
conversations to have with people in all
those fields so we're offering a
definition of mine as an emergent
process and I'm going to teach you how
to regulate energy information flow
right now relationships and the body are
important we're gonna teach you I'm
gonna teach you how to monitor energy
information flow and then modify it and
harmony if you do this practice because
I've done this now with thousands and
thousands of people this time in
practice I'm about to teach you creates
harmony people's lives and the emails
that you could analyze when they come in
have such similar discussions of these
kinds of features of how it promotes
integration okay and these are just to
remind us that the brain is two halves
and it actually works to integrate both
halves as well okay now if you say well
okay what's the bottom line what does
science tell us is going to improve if I
do a time in practice the middle
prefrontal areas this area right behind
your forehead are massively integrative
areas of the brain and these are nine
functions right here that are science
proven to be enhanced with time and
practices now what's a time in practice
it draws on the studies of mindfulness
it draws on all sorts of studies of
mentalization
it draws on the studies of attachment
research this is the idea that when you
mental eyes or that is look at the
mental side of life whether it's in a
mindfulness practice or an attachment
relationship these are the functions
that are enhanced and this it's an
amazing group of nine functions actually
these are the integrative aspects of
middle prefrontal function okay so we're
gonna do monitoring modifying so if you
say well hold on what did Dan say the
mind is composed of well its regulatory
like when you regulate a car you have to
monitor where you're going and then
modify we're gonna move the steering
wheel you press the brakes press the
accelerator so why shouldn't we train
people to develop the skill of the mind
once we've defined as regulatory to
literally monitor and modify now what if
I gave you a camcorder and it wasn't
stabilized with a tripod and was all
shaky
what would the video that we got out
look like it'll be blurry shaky in
blurry out and how much detail could you
see if it was a blurry blurry video no
not as much as you want and when it's
blurry you actually can't do something
very specific with what you see right so
if you think of it that way then what we
want to do is take a mine site camera
which is basically your mind and you're
gonna develop the ability to build a
tripod so literally you're gonna
stabilize this part of your mental
experience that allows you to look at
the mind itself so that what you see is
no longer blurry now amazingly this is
the first step that allows you then to
modify toward integration if you can't
see clearly you can't modify it with any
specificity because you can't see
anything so it's kind of that simple now
you're gonna see that we're gonna build
on the sense of openness to what is this
is one leg of the triangle objectivity
that is seeing that a thought or a
feeling or even a sensation in your body
is not the totality of who you are it's
like an object you're you have an
awareness it's like the thing that you
know about it's not the experience of
knowing and the observation is the fact
that there is a you that is observing so
you don't get lost in like an impulse or
or lost in a negative thought so that's
just a negative thought it comes and
goes when people are lost in their
negative thoughts they it ruins their
day when someone has this skill they go
oh it's a negative thought I won't take
it so personally right now what are the
practices we have well it's basically a
way of a tuning to an observing self
that this observing self you activate it
and you then figure out what's an expiry
himself going through and you can focus
inwardly that's what we're gonna do this
is the time in and it's a form of
internment we're gonna do these
practices right now a breath awareness
practice and a wheel of awareness
practice and the benefit of doing this
is that you will experience right now
what we're talking about so it isn't
just an idea you'll actually experience
it now you don't need to take notes on
what we're about to do because from from
my website for free you can download
digitally into whatever object you have
the audio recording of these processes
but this will give you an experience
right now of what it feels like to do a
time in practice so you can see for
yourself and then if you're up for it
when we're finished though you may feel
like not speaking and just letting
yourself reflect on what happened by
yourself that's fine if people would
like to to offer what their experience
was as scientists as technicians you may
find it actually fascinating to hear
what each other is both experienced if
you don't want to do that that's
absolutely fine also let me just see
first before we get into this if there
are any questions does it make sense so
far yep okay great
so let me just show you what we're gonna
work on this is what we're gonna work on
this is called a wheel of awareness
practice it was created if you take the
concept of integration and apply it to
awareness you say what is differentiated
in your experience of being conscious or
being aware and it says okay one thing
you can differentiate is let's say the
five senses that bring in the outside
world and that you see there and the
their outer rim these first five senses
you also can be aware of what your body
signals are like what's going on your
heart or your lungs and that's called in
science we call that sixth sense or
interoception
there's also what you can call a seventh
sense which is your awareness of
thoughts or images emotions feelings
memories dreams attitudes ideas those
would be on the seventh sense and
there's also an eighth sense which we'll
go through which is your sense of
connection to not only other people but
even the whole planet and in many ways
the work I do in climate change issues
uses time and practices to say we need
to call to
the eighth sense in humanity because
we've forgotten that we are a part of
the earth and we don't treat the earth
like a part of our self instead we treat
it just like a trash can
and this is a serious life endangered
problem so this time in practice not
only gives you personal health but it
has the potential to increase kindness
to other people but also kindness to
planet Earth okay so what I'm going to
ask you to do then is say well okay fine
I differentiate these things on the rim
I can also differentiate the experience
of awareness from what I'm aware of now
you can say well that sounds kind of
weird
well you'll experience it right now for
yourself as we do this practice because
differentiating the hub from the rim
this is the vocabulary we have empowers
you actually to integrate your life in
ways that the emails we get from people
are just so rewarding I mean you'll
experience it yourself I don't need to
say more editorial about that but in
terms of integration of consciousness
we're differentiating elements of the
rim from each other and the hub from the
rim and just that practice alone has
profound possibilities for people now
let's begin and let me walk you through
if there are no question about this I'm
gonna ask you to image this wheel but
we're gonna do a basic awareness of the
breath practice to get you ready and
what I'm gonna do if you've never done a
reflective practice before that's fine I
do this a lot with people who have never
done a time in practice never done
reflection they've never done anything I
mean whether you call it reflection or
mindfulness or being aware of the self
or mentalization or whatever many people
that I've done this with have never done
it before so you no need to be nervous
and if you're nervous you're nervous but
there's no need to be go I'm gonna walk
you through it
so when we do this in a group here's
what I'm asking you to do again you
don't need to take notes because
everything we're about to do is
available for free for you to do the
time and practices from Dr Dan Siegel
calm you just pull it and it's yours to
use however you want so it's good to
with a straight back let two feet be
flat on the floor and even though your
body's not going to move you're actually
working out your brain a lot so it's
like a workout you're about to do so you
want to have a sense of purpose like I'm
doing something and some people like to
have their chest you know with a sense
of dignity like okay I'm ready to do the
work so this is not a like hang loose
I'm doing a relaxation technique kind of
thing you may get relaxed you may not
get relaxed that's not what we're trying
to achieve we're not trying to achieve
anything except do this integration
practice so for the first part what I
like to do with your eyes open let your
attention come up toward me let it come
to the middle of this room and then send
your attention back to the far wall and
then bring your attention back to the
middle of the room and then to about
book-reading distance as if you were
holding a book or a magazine in your
hand and notice how you can determine
where your attention goes you can
determine that and now for this first
initial practice we're going to do
something just called the breath
awareness practice and what I want you
to do is see if you can sense the breath
whether it's at the level of the
nostrils with the sensation of the air
coming in and out or the level of the
chest rising and falling and some people
like to let their eyes go closed for
this to really let the bodily sensation
of the breath fill awareness a chest
rising and falling perhaps or even
notice how you can let the attention
move downward to the level of the
abdomen as it moves in and out and
wherever you feel it most naturally is
fine let that be the focus of the breath
and let me just share with you an
ancient story before we do the brief
breath awareness practice and the story
goes like this it's been passed down the
generations that the mind is like the
ocean and deep in the ocean beneath the
surface it's calm and it's clear and no
matter what the conditions are at the
surface from this deep place it's
possible to just look upward and notice
whether it's flat or choppy waves or
even a full storm deep beneath the
surface it's calm and clear and just
sensing the breath
allows you to just notice whatever arise
is an awareness like brainwaves at the
surface of the mind whether it's an
emotion or a memory and image a thought
and you can just notice it from a place
of clarity and tranquility so this very
brief breath practice goes like this I
invite you to just sense the breath
wherever you feel that most naturally
and then if a distraction comes and
takes your attention away from the
breath that's fine that's just what the
mind does when you've noticed you've
become distracted just let that
distraction go and return your focus to
the breath
and now in and out another distraction
may take you away and some people like
to just name the kind of distraction
like thinking thinking or remembering
remembering and for them naming it tames
it and it lets them drop the distraction
and go back to the breath other people
don't really want to do that you can
play with that let's just do that
very brief practice where you just sense
the breath a distraction comes and
redirect attention just like working at
a muscle you contract the muscle with
the focus on the breath a distraction is
like relaxing the muscle you refocus it
contracts the muscle this is working the
muscle of attention really developing
the strength of the mind to focus on a
particular object in this case the
breath let's begin that right now
that's great and now we'll move from the
breath awareness practice to the wheel
of awareness practice so what I invite
you to do is just let yourself ride the
wave of the breath in and out and now
either picturing in your mind the wheel
if you want to open your eyes and just
look at it one more time
we're just knowing about the structure
of the wheel and you even if you can't
picture it that's fine sensing the
breath brings you into the hub of the
mind where awareness is represented and
we're gonna imagine from this hub
sending out a spoke from the hub out to
a particular point on the rim and let's
begin with the point on the first five
senses that represents sound so it's the
sense of hearing and let's let sound
fill awareness
and now moving the spoke over a bit more
to the sense of sight let any light
coming through your eyes or if your
eyelids are closed or your closed
eyelids let the light fill the sense of
sight filling awareness
and now moving the spoke over to the
sense of smell letting any odors fill
awareness
and then moving the spoke over now to
the sense of taste that nante tastes
fill awareness
and now moving the spoke over one more
time in this area to the sense of touch
anywhere where the skin is touching
things the skin touching clothing or
skin touching skin
and now taking a bit of a deeper breath
we're gonna let these first five senses
that bring in the external world go and
move the spoke over now in your mind's
eye to the next segment of the rim and
this is the segment of the rim that
represents the interior of the body and
let's begin with the facial area letting
awareness become filled with the
sensation of the muscles and bones in
the face
and then moving to the muscles and bones
in the scalp
and now moving attention to the back of
the neck and the throat
and now letting awareness be filled with
a sensation of the shoulders
and then letting attention go down both
arms to the fingertips
and then letting awareness be filled
with the upper back and the chest
and then the lower back and the abdomen
and then moving to the hip area and then
focusing attention down both legs all
the way to the toes
and now moving attention to the pelvic
region to the genitals
and then letting awareness become filled
with the signals from the intestines in
the stomach
and then moving attention to the
interior of the lungs
and then centering attention in the
heart region
and now letting awareness become filled
with the whole of the body the interior
of the body letting the whole of the
body fill awareness
and now knowing that science has
demonstrated what people have known for
a long time which is that the body sends
signals up into the skull into the brain
and the skull that gives us a deep
important intuition and wisdom just
sensing the body gives you access to
that bodily wisdom I now invite you to
take a bit of a deeper breath and
imagine now moving the spoke from this
part of the rim of the interior of the
body now to the next segment of the rim
and this is the segment that represents
mental activities and we'll do this part
of the rim review in two aspects the
first aspect I just invite you to be in
the hub and just invite anything
whatsoever to come from mental
activities like emotions or memories
images thoughts attitudes intentions
beliefs hopes dreams anything at all
from mental life let it enter into the
hub of the mind where you just bring it
on and just be aware of whatever's going
on in mental activities
and now for the second aspect of this
part of the rim of you here's what I
invite you to do now just like in the
first part you'll invite into awareness
anything from mental activities this
time what I invite you to do is to study
the way a mental activity let's say an
image how does it first present itself
to awareness is it sudden is it gradual
and once it presents itself to awareness
how does it stay present does it
undulate is it vibrating is it continual
how does it feel as it stays an
awareness and then how does it leave
awareness is it again from one side of
the other up down is it just suddenly
leave is just replaced by another mental
activity and if it's not replaced by
another mental activity what does the
gap feel like between two mental
activities so now I'm inviting you to
become a student of the architecture of
your own mental life studying the
comings the staying presence and the
goings of mental activities and let's
begin that practice right now
now I invite you to take a bit of a
deeper breath and we'll let this part of
the rim go for now where we can always
explore the architecture of our own
mental life and now moving the spoke
over one more time to the last segment
of the rim and this is the segment that
represents our sense of connection to
others or other things outside of our
bodily selves and first what I invite
you to do is let yourself become aware
of your sense of connection to people
who are sitting close to you right now
and then let that expand to people who
are near you but not immediately next to
you right now
and now let's let that sense of
connection move beyond these walls to
people who you work with your colleagues
and then extending out to friends and
family
and then extending out to people who
live in your neighborhood
and then to people who live in your
larger community to people who share
your city people who share your state
and people who share your country and
then allowing that sense of connection
to move out to all people who share this
common home our planet Earth
and then moving that sense of connection
to include all living beings on earth
and knowing that science has now
demonstrated with wisdom practices for
years have known that sending out
feelings of concern and kindness out
into the world actually brings positive
changes not only in the world but even
in our own physiological health invite
you to send out compassionate concern
and caring senses of intention and
kindness out to all living beings on the
planet
and then bringing that sense of kindness
and compassion now to your inner bodily
self we bring a sense of love and
kindness inwardly to our inner selves
and now I invite you to take a bit of a
deeper breath and for many this would be
a good place to stop the wheel of
awareness practice but people seem very
focused and I could take you very
briefly to one more step but nod your
head if you're up for trying it out and
a lot of nods are going on okay so if
you don't want to do this that's fine
just keep on just focusing on the breath
but we'll try this one more it's an
advanced step so if it's hard don't
worry about it it's just the way it is
but let's just give it a try and you can
always come back to this another time
but again if you're not up for it just
focus on the breath in and out but
here's how this next step goes what I
fight you to do is sense your breath in
and out and then being in the hub of the
mind imagine sending the spoke out again
from the hub but this time instead of
going to somewhere on the rim
imagine bending that spoke and sending
it back to the hub itself so now you're
gonna focus attention on awareness and
experience what awareness of awareness
feels like for you
now again I invite you to find the
breath riding the wave of the breath in
and out and now when you're ready taking
a deeper in this time or intentional
breath you can let your eyes get ready
to come open if they're closed and we'll
bring this whole wheel of awareness
practice to a close for today
thank you and welcome back so we have a
few minutes left for today and as I
mentioned you may feel like talking or
you may not feel like talking
this was the whole wheel of awareness
practice a little bit faster than normal
because we wanted to fit it in the time
but if you do the audio practice you'll
see it's a it's extended out a little
bit more so you have the feel feel of it
but is there anyone who would like to
share anything from their experience
from any part of it yes please oh
there's a microphone I'm so
there you go thank you thanks I just
noticed that for me
certain parts were very easy certain
parts were not very easy at all like for
example when it was time to get the
seven cents it wasn't very easy for me
not and I think that's probably where I
spend most of my time whereas being
aware of like my body or maybe
connections around me that was like oh
oh challenge it to really think about
that beautiful problem so that's that's
pretty interesting that's very helpful
to say and you know how we practice
attention drive to energy information
flow through our nervous system so if
you spend a lot of time doing the
seventh sense it will be like a very
well-developed muscle so you're kind of
finding wow that's an area of my rim
that it might be good for me if I'm
going to integrate it there's honor the
differentiated parts develop connections
to others connections my body so it was
a good invitation to to practice that so
that's great thank you thank you anyone
else would like to share some people
often ask what is the hub and I'm going
to just show you because I have two
minutes left if unless someone wants to
share something I'm going to show you
one scientific proposal for what this
was all about what you were saying is
you know we can look from the neuro side
that if we need to have certain circuits
developed we can find it's harder and
those are as well develop and the great
news is the brain is always changing as
we focus attention down it in the next
slide which is this is a metaphor the
wheel of awareness in this slide which
you'll find in the book called the
mindful therapist this is basically
saying if we've defined the mind as a
process that's both embody and
relational that regulates energy and
information flow it takes the science of
energy which is basically as you know on
the science of probabilities not
Newtonian absolutes
and it says Wow if the mind is truly
regulating energy flow then maybe it's
actually regulating degrees of certainty
so for example if I say let's all go to
dinner and have salmon for dinner right
that was an absolute statement I said
and on this graph it would be a peak
I've said salmon and maybe you say well
I'm also in the mood
but let's go have Italian food or
something there'll be another peek and
together we might have a mood of eating
which would be a plateau of probability
and finally we would decide to go eat
somewhere so we pick out a particular
peak of heat that shows a distribution
from absolute probability we're eating
salmon too we're in the mood or priming
ourselves to eat that's a plateau what I
want to suggest you is those are our
thoughts up at the peaks or a mood
that's a plateau but you can drop
yourself to this open plane of
possibility where you're moving energy
distributions to zero probability which
means infinite possibility and so how
many of you did when you did the hub on
the hub part felt this sense of
expansion anyone feel that don't know
Center ok what anyone else want to share
it what that felt like well for many
people they talked about not only being
centered but feeling like at home or at
peace or in clarity so what I want to
suggest to you is that this is one
scientific proposal for how the hub when
we say let's build the hub of your mind
with a time in practice how basically
you're gaining access to this open plane
so let's say you're someone who's you
know prone to be worried about a lot of
things or you know have negative
thoughts about a lot of things those are
a bunch of Peaks that are driving you
mad when you develop this time in
practice you're basically strengthening
the capacity of your mind
by building certain circuits in the
brain to actually bring you from those
points on the rim down to the open plane
so in a nutshell what I want to leave
you with as a closing remark is that if
you can build up through a time in
practice the capacity to move yourself
in different differentiated circuits of
your brain you're literally going to
integrate not only your nervous system
but all the studies show that when you
can do this you become more open
literally the open plane of possibility
to what's going on inside of other
people so it's your relationships will
be improved you will increase
creativity because rather than being
stuck on a certain pattern you say
literally okay this was the plan I had
these are the peaks and plateaus of
trying to solve this problem in a
certain way I drop my self to the open
plain that's the hub and from that
spaciousness I can move over to another
set of Peaks so literally creativity
connection a sense of coherence
stability and clarity these are all
available to us now the wonderful thing
is if in a place like Google or any of
us who works to influence education or
families or the whole of our human
family we have the opportunity actually
to create not just inner health but
health among all of us in this planet in
which we live we can create more
kindness more compassion more
integration because ultimately if you
think about it what is integration made
visible
it's kindness and compassion toward the
self or toward others what is health
health is integration so if we can get
together and create a time in movement
facilitated literally around the planet
I believe very deeply that we can create
more well-being for all of us so thank
you very much for your attention it's a
pleasure to be here with you today
and I look forward to more time in
together thank you but I was reiterate
what the definition of mine was because
from my perspective on me yeah I'm not
sure how to tell the difference yeah
that's great absolutely to go back and
just yeah luckily that goes fast
you know this definition of mine there
you when you look at systems science
there's something called an emergent
self-organizing process so that is in a
phrase I made up because I'm from
California that's actually a math and
we'll turn so think about like a
classroom you know kids like each other
the teachers supportive of the kids the
kids are exploring new things does the
openness to be wrong and people are
creating together they're collaborating
and you walk in the classroom you say
well the more Allan this plasm is really
high well you never point any individual
and say that's the source of morale it's
a an emergent self-organizing process of
high morale that's arising from the
interaction of the elements of the
system this case the system is a
classroom so what I was thinking to us
you know I know people on think this way
but if the system is actually energy and
information flow that's the key to look
think of it this way where does energy
information flow well it's absolutely
flowing your body the whole nervous
system is electrochemical energy flow
and so you say okay fine but it doesn't
end there you see it's happening right
now between the two of us and among all
of us and all of us everywhere and
certainly Google is influencing it
everywhere so when you when you when you
really embrace the issue and certainly
you know I work closely with
anthropologists they love this
definition because for them they study
culture and Google is shaping culture
and culture is about energy and
information flow patterns and how
they're shared not only now across you
know people within a society but across
generations that's what culture is so in
this way mind becomes about energy and
information flow patterns that are both
embodied and relational and there's and
you say well how does that happen it's
it's a an emergent self-organizing
process that people get upset about this
they want to own their mind they said no
no no my this is my mind you know they
say well look do you have a relationship
with someone yeah well this is your
interaction with that other person
really should affect you yeah yeah well
you know we're not we don't just come
out of nowhere we're relational and in
fact our whole incredible movement as a
human species is we don't have you know
big claws we don't big things we
actually have achieved
because we collaborate so you really
understand the mind is a relational
process literally process so you can
just drop the emergent self organize
people makes you comfortable as we do in
the definition process but basically
that you say where does that word
process come from it's literally a
mathematical property of the interaction
of elements of a system the elements of
the system are the nodes in which energy
and information is flow now those nodes
can be distributed as Google knows just
look at your screens all these people
doing these thing we're all
interconnected that's the thing about it
and this just gives you the scientific
view so it's not metaphysical it's not
you know any kind of anything it's just
straight science I'm a scientist who
practices as a clinician you know this
is a scientific proposal you know and
that it fits with you know what
attachment researchers like or
anthropologists or contemporary to
practice people we we work in a field
called Concilium so as we try to bring
in all different ways of knowing and
we're very happy that we can have people
in various religions talk to each other
you know people in various Sciences talk
to each other with know people are just
out in the field trying to make kids in
schools have a better time so we're
happy that we can communicate with
everybody
we're interpersonal neurobiology is
basically a Concilium or invite everyone
in to join together because you know our
species has so much wonderful potential
if we awaken our minds literally in this
way and then when you go from this you
know definition of mind to health then
you've got the whole thing on two slides
you know then you say okay fine I got a
monitor modify modify how toward
integration toward integration toward
integration and that's why I really
wanted to do the wheel practice with you
because it's you know you can see it
right there I know it was a little fast
I want to apologize for that but you
know you can see it's literally
integrating consciousness so we don't
want to be vague about this I mean I'm
being super scientific about this
sometimes people say you're way too
scientific I said well that's where we
should start everything we should do
everything we do should be based in
science
and then we need to go out and try to
help the world be a better place but
it's got to be consistent sighs that's
that's how I stand as a scientist that's
what I feel very strong did that make
sense it does crime you state something
in one of these to tell me if it's just
evening this is my purpose it's
inaccurate so brain would be you know my
brain was my nervous system yes like
mine is you're defining it would be a
system or systems of brains and nervous
systems exchanging information with each
other is that correct and themselves
that's correct and so then add to it if
you think about the Internet does you
know it is affecting your mind if you
think about like I have a dear friend
named John Adani who died a couple years
ago he writes wrote beautifully and his
audio programs still affect people so in
these ways
it isn't just limited to a nervous
system the internet is not composed of
neurons you know what I mean and you
guys are really influencing the minds of
people so I would just stick with energy
and information flow and say for sure
the nervous system plays an important
role but you can have fiber optics that
are contributing to that role too and
you know when we see what everyone's
doing linking each other what's really
being linked as energy information flow
patterns and you know with the 186,000
miles per second that you know the
fiber-optic allows things ago I mean I
have these online things I do where I'm
talking to someone in Iran and South
Africa and Australia all at once there's
no lag I mean we're literally having
this community that's created that
because of that speed of light thing I
mean it's as if I was right there with
him like I am with you and with all of
you I mean so we have this opportunity
then to connect all of us but yes so
that's why the word embodied is there
for sure the the brain and the whole
nervous system the whole body itself is
really really important but it's not
just about that it's about our way of
sharing energy information flow however
we can share it and and the Internet is
a huge impact on the human mind because
you have such a profound influence on
how energy information flow is being
shared
make sense yeah it does I'm still
interested in that kind of you running
on time you get that seems like a fair
definition but then you keep using
mine's plural which seems like a little
bit of misnomer because you just say any
given system is a mind like there's a
human mind which is a small humans are
yeah yeah human minds well this is a
really important point so the mine has
subjective experience this is the
regulatory aspect of mind but absolutely
the - nobody knows what happened what is
subjective experience from a scientific
point of view we have no idea from a
subjective point of view of question we
know what it is from a sign through
point of view we can't we have nothing
to say awareness same thing awareness
like no scientist even though they're
looking for neural correlates of
consciousness nobody knows what
awareness is we know it has the
subjective quality of knowing which is
really fantastic we have the subjective
texture of that which is known which is
beautiful red is red and wine tastes
like wine and you go swimming in a
beautiful lake it's gorgeous
so so absolutely right we don't know
what those aspects are but in terms of
the regulatory aspect of minds not the
whole thing what this helps us with
rather than having no definition but it
helps us in the work and internet or the
work and therapy or the work in
education or parenting here's what it
helps us do it says let's teach people
to monitor with more stability and
modify toward integration so for sure we
can't say what subjectivity isn't
awareness we don't know nobody knows we
may never know but that doesn't mean we
can't define one aspect of mind and then
once we have a definition say what's a
healthy that aspect of mind and then go
with it and so the great thing is it's
like you know the Willie Sutton story
you know really sons this guy who robbed
the bank and so they put him in jail
they caught him and then they pull him
out of cell and they said Willie Willie
why'd you rob a bank and he goes that's
where the money was you know so it's the
same kind of thing if we can find one
aspect of the mind that directly impacts
health of our individual lives of our
collective lives of the planets life
let's go for it
let's actually
bite the bullet let's do the Willie
Sutton rule if that's where it is let's
promote integration let's do it by
teaching people to monitor with more
stability and to modify toward
integration and bam you got it so I
think we I think it's time we can do
this if we do this together and that's
why I said like the human mind its it is
as an open system there are lots of
layers of dividing it up because there
are lots of parts and stuff so yes you
have your mind I have my mind but then
were influencing each other like I
probably would ever forget you okay
you'll you'll influence me forever and
so now you're literally I mean whether
you like it or not you're now a part of
my mind right so this is how we have the
influence each other if we do it in a
positive direction you know let me think
about if integration is health and
integration is also the source of
kindness and compassion
you got a win-win situation here you're
gonna get people healthy building nicer
to each other you're gonna make people
have more meaning in life more
flexibility let's do it it's just a
matter of like doing it so time in good
thank you any other questions or
thoughts comments okay wonderful
well thanks a lot I look forward to
hearing from you whenever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
