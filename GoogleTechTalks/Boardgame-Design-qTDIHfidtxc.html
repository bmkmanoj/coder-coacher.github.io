am a software engineer at Google and
this will be the last year for me just
here to present presenter speaker for
today Peter's strife who is a board game
designer that a bunch of a bunch of met
on our trip to Germany a few weeks about
a month ago so Peter oh thank you very
much and I'd like to give a short
presentation and give you some insights
into the process that led to the
creation of this game called Cracow 3025
ad I gave a title to this presentation
which is a creative journey because i'd
like to share with you a little bit
about the last four years of my life in
which many things have happened but one
thing that's been a consistent part of
that is the design and development and
publication and sell sales of this board
game that I designed I'm here I thank
you very much for your invitation you
were to come and talk to you and I'll
try to keep my presentation limited to
about 30 minutes so if you have any
further questions I'll be very happy to
answer those and I'll tell you a little
bit about me just to know who is here
for me the question would be who am I
for you the question is who is this
Peter guy I'm a Dutchman I'm very close
to 40 years old dangerously close and i
was born in Holland and grew up on a
small farm one of the things that is
definitely a part of my youth and my
upbringing is our board games playing
cards with the family and also
role-playing games when I was in high
school into university I've always had
an interesting creative writing although
I never published in any way so this is
my shot at redeeming myself probably
something I wrote in real life I studied
development economics I then pursued a
career in development aid and your
monetary
work which has been my way of life for
the last 15 years and I've worked in
five six different countries over that
time with in that line of work I'm a
manager of the funding decisions in that
kind of work I've managed offices and
projects related to either long-term
development in the third world or a
humanitarian recovery after the tsunami
and some wars and refugee crisis that's
been my normal life you can say
throughout that time my board gaming is
has been a big hobby of mine I once
designed a board game when I was a
teenager with my brother it was a
shipping game not very inovative it
never saw the light of day and i'm not
sure that the world is miss much as a
result of that and I've always played
games wrote and designed role-playing
game adventures scenario so I've been
involved in the creative part of board
games for most of my life what I never
intended to do in my life was to start
up a company and to self-publish a board
game that was something that just
happened to me and in my board gaming
and it has a link to the rest of my
story I did come across again that's
called advanced squad leader it is one
of the most complex board games in the
world to its workings technical
simulation game its rule book is about
the size of several manuals and white
why that has something to do with the
story is that if you go to an tournament
of this board game you spend about three
days and every game lasts about five to
eight hours and your opponent sits
across the table like you like this
and you will play this game for that
long and you will have intense
concentration so you will focus
completely on the rules the options the
dice rolls and you will manage your game
throughout if you go to a tournament
which I've done regularly over the last
10 years you put yourself through quite
an unusual mental effort and okay why
that is interesting that is this why
that is interesting is that I went to
the creation of this game happened the
day after such a 200 so I was in Sweden
in 2005 I spent three days without sleep
but with intense concentration trying to
win this board in 200 I did not win it
but in the bus on the way to the airport
I had enormous amount of creative energy
I have analyzed it later and thought
okay I released this tension from my
brain about how to play this game and
now there's this energy wants to go
somewhere so I was sitting in the back
of the bus in Sweden and I was suddenly
thinking about designing a board game
and I thought back to my youth when I
was when at home we used to play a four
player card game a typical Dutch very
traditional and boring card game but you
played it with the team of you played it
only with four players two players in
each team then I started thinking okay
that's an interesting mechanic it's an
engine for a board game it would be nice
if you play if you use that engineer you
put a map board in the middle so that
what you're doing with these cards while
you're playing it is is aimed at
influencing and map then let me see if I
should take the one further yes good so
sitting in the back of the bus thinking
about a card game with four players and
a map board then I started thinking each
card should be different and the cars
should bring about a certain flavor and
a story and I
designed in my head for secret groups
which would be the four colors of the
cars so instead of spades and diamonds
there would be four colors which
represent a certain group these groups
in the game are called the underworld
and read the good and decent citizens in
green secret societies in yellow and the
monks and mystics in blue so the cards
would have a special would have these
colors and each card would represent the
attempt of one of these colors groups to
increase their influence on that map
board which was the idea of medieval
some kind of medieval city so the car
each card will be different and each
card would tell a small story about how
this group who try to increase influence
and where as you see here in the
presentation there was also the idea
that there are n matee between some of
these colors so when you see the arrows
the underworld and the good and decent
citizens are each other's arch enemies
the underworld and the secret societies
are somewhat aligned the secret
societies and monks are arch enemies etc
so that was something that wanted to
build into the into the card system what
does that mean that means that each
color of a card has two enemy cars more
or less the cards in the red color and
the cards in the yellow color would be
fairly strong enemies to green whereas
blue cards would be very weak enemies to
green so this idea started shaping I
this idea of how this medieval city in
these groups would work translated into
different values so a green card would
have four values in the support of four
different colors and a green card would
have four values when it's played
against one of these colors what I then
decided is that if you design a board
game with four players and they play in
teams that's lovely but obviously
more interesting it is only one winner
so I decided that these they would need
to be to scoring mechanisms one is on
the map board what happens what use for
on the map board which is visible to
everyone would be one scoring track you
could say but then there should be a
second scoring track where you do not
play together with your partner but
where you play for yourself and that
scoring track depends on the scholars of
the cards so the idea was born very
almost immediately you could say I need
for secret identities with a certain
relationship between them I need two
people to mix up in teams of two they'll
play a card game that is someone related
to the card game that I used to play at
home and there are two ways of scoring
that means that you will play against
your own partner for the entire game ok
so I went home and I went to work as you
can see from this picture I'm not much
of an artist but I did draw the first
map of cracow and this is it so I
decided this would be six or seven areas
and each area would have a name like the
palace or this the harbor or the
barracks of the army because those
naming those areas would create the
possibility to have a story on the car
that links to this particular area so
for example a card called army rebellion
if that god would succeed would score
the result would be felt in that area
and not in the other areas what you can
see on the top right is the first set of
cards that I made as you can see not
very nice to look at but the the
ultimate concept was already there aight
values about how each card interacts
with cards of another color and a set of
values that tells you if this card
scores
where you get what what is the reward in
terms of the map word okay and I started
playing this with two of the four people
who have joined me on this trip to the
US my wife and a friend from Switzerland
and another friend from the United
States who has happened to visit me and
I can say it immediately worked from the
first time we played one set of cards
one hand of gardens looked at the
mechanism I realized while they're
starting in this because this is
different from any other board game I
know there isn't there are two levels of
interest and the idea that you play with
your partner but against each other
through a secret second scoring
mechanism is really strong it has a
strong attraction it will interest
people but of course I also found in a
way was a way to deliver some of my
world views through the stories and the
ideas because each card will be
different each card would have a story
to tell and you'll see some examples of
that later so before i shock you with my
world view well if you haven't played
the game yet did all four secret groups
are crooks the none of them are better
or more almost or more more generous
than others they are all battling for
influence they just use some different
methods and the second idea i think was
that medieval times medieval times and
modern times are not that different
really if you look slightly below the
surface this was these were some of my
ideas if you say where does this
inspiration come from certainly the
novels of Terry Pratchett spring to mind
so you create a crazy world with a
strong internal logic you could say and
within that logic you show that even
though the world looks different and
move different it's still very much
and okay let me see if I need to press a
button yes so this is an example of
Peters world fast foods are the creation
of the underworld and if they sell their
fast foods in an area called the slums
and they would if they score they will
get much following in that area and they
will gain gold so I also added the idea
that to make relate the story and the
cards closer I need different types of
influence not just all the same so I
created four types of influence which
represent a certain flavor to what your
what your what the reward is they are
following power style and gold so on the
left you see two columns the scores
where you can see that in supporting the
cards of a different color the scores
are the four on the left so you see
there that a underworld card like this
is not useful in supporting the good and
decent citizens is in this case fairly
even to the others etc and then your red
cards will be stronger in obstructing
and playing against a green card that I
started by another by another player
what I did not have at that time was any
idea of where to place this game I had
as you have seen so far it's quite
generic you cannot say the Holland it's
not America it's not a fantasy world so
I was looking for a place to put it and
together with my American friend and
with my wife I went on a holiday very
soon after I played I started designing
this game and we wanted to go to Poland
and this was one of our objectives we
have a strong interest in history of the
Second World War and one place we wanted
to really see
for ourselves was the concentration camp
at Auschwitz so we I'm pretty sure we
then googled and to find the nearest
place if you want to see how shoot where
do you sleep in the nearest place to
sleep if you want to be our food is crap
how and when you when the three of us
drove into this town we were quite
amazed to see in a way how it presented
itself as the most suitable place for
this ballgame in the car me and my
American friend were talking about the
Borg and I design and we're talking
about where should it be know any nice
place it should be near a bit far a bit
romantic and not totally when nobody
knows anything about so if you go to
Cracow if you've been to cracker you
realize it's an amazingly evil city was
not damaged in the Second World War and
it has a magnificent castle an old town
that is in a very well preserved state
fantastically the evil taste in food and
it happened it happens to have an
amazing castle that is also an enormous
museum and that in that museum you find
we found out that it was the capital of
Poland in the Middle Ages so this is me
in a typical pose concentrated as you
see at the Bible castle reading the
legends of this place so once we were
there I realized this is it this must be
it the name I then gave to the game was
a play of shadows in Cracow 40 90 80 of
course in later edits it became it ended
up shorter it became crack up and let me
see
this is the next place related to the
development of this game because about a
month after i visited cracker out my
last holiday in europe before i went to
this place this is jelani and a chain
Indonesia and it was devastated by the
indian ocean tsunami and i had the luck
to be to find myself a job there for
about seven months so I work for an
English humanitarian agency and in my
suitcase not really knowing what to
expect from a place like this I put this
beautiful map that I showed you and not
so beautiful cards that I also showed
you and I thought well there will be
some people there who might have some
spare time I hope I'm pretty sure
there's not going to be that much
entertainment going on around town so
that is a good opportunity and the best
thing is I'm the head of the office so I
might be able to convince an influence
some people to play this game with me
and maybe they'll even enjoy so after
just a week or two i was i showed my my
creation to some of my colleagues and as
they indeed had nothing left to do when
i was the line manager for all of us all
of them they agreed to join them and on
the beach in this town we made the set
of beans we made a set of small stones
representing the influence of the two
teams and we started play testing this
so it was really amazing for me to see
that i was playing this game i designed
with people from India Pakistan
Philippines Indonesia all over Asia
almost and none of them ever play the
board game before and they all really
started to enjoy it and this gave me a
very gave me a lot of confidence that
yeah there this is unusual day there
must be something in it what I also did
there because I had some spare time
is to write up all the stories that go
with the intrigue cards and to write the
first draft of the rules in something
like something like this so these were
the first rules that I wrote of course
in seven months of testing this game
there was a there were a lot of changes
that were needed mostly it was making it
easier coming from this background where
I play a very complex board game you
always tend to over overdo it too many
rules too many victory conditions too
many the scoring was too complex etc so
as I every time I had to decide can I
cut this out and we'll get better or
will it get worse and I also designed
the engine of this board game which i
will show you at the end of the
presentation because I would like to
show you a little bit of how I managed
the play test sessions and how I ended
up with the cards the values as they are
now I did this in an excel sheet and I
can safely say that excel sheet in two
years of time went through at least a
hundred versions because I tried out
almost anything more areas etc all sorts
of different values ok let me see after
several months there I would I return to
let me just check the next one yes I
returned to Holland where I took my
prototype to some publishers one of them
was quite interested had a lot of good
comments on what he thought was too
difficult the market would like it etc
but if he were to publish my board game
he would want to make quite a few
changes and one of the changes was that
he would want to remove all the text so
no titles to the
and no stories in other words Peters
worldview was not going to be there and
that was one compromising I was not
interested in making so I decided that
is not going to happen I then met up
through my workplace with my former
workplace with Melfi of all right who's
the artist did all the drawings for this
is gay he's the husband over a co-worker
of mine and we started talking about
doing this together he's a beginning he
was a beginning illustrator and we
started talking about how we make these
games we started talking about can we
make this game just the two of us and
how would we do this so he made a number
of drawings and I'm going to show you a
little bit and going to talk to you a
little bit about how we made the
drawings that go with this game I also
got some quotations from publishers and
publishing houses and dealer suppliers
of pieces that go with these kind of
games to get some idea what the
investment might be and I also met a
number of Dutch guys who had
self-published before and they gave us a
lot of fantastic tips without them I
wouldn't know how we would have started
off so we use the Dutch printer to
intermediate between us us and the
Polish brain through finally publish the
game etc they also gave me the
impression that it is possible for
someone without any experience to
interact with publishers and design and
publish your own game it will all so
clear to me what it would require in
terms of capital so I had to talk to my
business partner with my wife and we
more or less decided that two-thirds of
our savings should be put aside if we
were going to go ahead if you would not
find the publisher in the end so that we
might risk making it ourselves then
about six months after this I resigned
from my old job and I returned to this
very place in our
shape I re I was rehired for the same
job in the same desk at the same desk in
the same office to continue working
there for another nine and a half months
for the closure of this response to the
tsunami in our check and of course many
people there was still there that I'd
left one year before so I knew I should
take the next prototype with Councilman
being willing to play once again I was
the head of the office and also what we
then started doing and this is a very
interesting process the artist Mel fewer
he was in the Netherlands and I was in a
chain and we started working on all the
pictures that you now see on the cards
and I wanted to share with you how that
process work because it's something that
I've thoroughly enjoyed so I had written
a story for every card for every card in
the game and it's a story that's about a
paragraph long I'm not going to read it
out to you but this is the story on top
of the card called protection racket and
it's a car that belongs to the
underworld and so the I sent well if
you're the story at the top and then in
the middle you see the amount of text I
thought would there would be space for
on the card in other words the first is
just background the second line is what
I thought might fit on the card to
support to support the illustration and
then at the bottom i wrote my suggestion
to the artist so my suggestion to mel
cure for this protection racket was can
you draw for me a poor shop owner
standing in his store maybe he's selling
eggs and cheese facing two gentlemen who
clearly frightened him the first one is
a well-dressed smooth looking figure
maybe one of the organized criminals
from another card the second is a muscle
man and they threatened by his presence
alone so I sent this to
the artist he made a sketch he sent the
sketch back to me and I wouldn't comment
on the sketch to see if he patiently
she'd make changes so this was a
creative process that that repeated
itself for all 64 cards we produce them
roughly at the rate of three cards every
two weeks I think so it was quite an
intensive process um see this is a
drawing that did not make it this is the
original drawing for the card called
Black Death the story I sent was that
rats came to Cracow and the plague broke
out and people didn't do much about it
in terms of Public Health and they just
prayed for deliverance and then it won't
save all of them so there was the reason
this car did not make it is not clear
enough wasn't clear enough why this was
a picture of black there we go quite far
on this one so I said to me oh that's
not all right can you draw me something
else and we made a small we ventured out
in something we all know which is the
bring out your dead from sorry multiplan
did Monty Python yes so he can we have a
cart full of dead people and someone
calling out to bring out your dead so
this was his first schedule as idea I
like it and then he drew it like this
looks nice but I said to him but
Melchior I don't like there there's a
live guy on the cart because this takes
makes it to cartoonist for my liking and
this makes you wonder whether they're
really dead or not so this was the final
like that the happy man who survived got
taken out
then the one thing the most difficult
part of the entire design process I
would say was the struggle to fit
everything on the cards I cannot
underrepresented and difficult the
process was for us illustrator and
designer both never designed a board
game to get all the information on the
card in a way that was most attractive
and most successful so the one on the
left is what I made in more or less what
I brought with me brought back with me
from from our chain so the values were
all already tested then we went to the
one on the left sorry on the right and
one thing you will see the one on the
left here is the final one and what you
will see is that the we all the text
that was not flavor text was removed so
the words were all taken out and that
was quite helpful but you can see here
on the on the on the right you see the
picture of of the peasant revolt and
this is how we this is how many spaces
we need it we work on 63 by eighty eight
millimeters and the printer tells you
then don't do anything don't put
anything on the on the outside Outer
three millimeters four millimeters on
each side so you have a very limited
space and of course as you can see these
cards have quite a number of values and
one thing that I just show you for
example throughout the first part we had
the two columns with those values and
they squeezed them they squeezed the
picture so the picture was smaller and
look for the artist to make a more
rectangular or almost square picture
which really limit what an artist can do
so as you can see when you then see the
afterlife in its final form you have a
much wider
make sure because remove the columns
away from each other so that was an
amazing amount of work I can say right
let me see so at the end of my second
stint in Indonesia I can say that the
cards were more or less the way we
wanted them and we'd gone through almost
one and a half years of play testing
trying out all sorts of versions I was
pretty confident that it was very solid
it could not really go wrong and i
returned to holland in February 2008 and
we made the decision to self-publish
this game made 2,000 copies I started my
own company which is just me and my in
the spare bedroom in our house that's
the office and our bicycle seller is the
storage since we don't ride bicycles and
I made my own website with the
assistance of a web designer and and I
got involved on a site called
boardgamegeek which is an amazing
resource for board games and again this
was from it from advice of other people
in the board gaming industry who I had
met who said you must do this well it's
been a without boardgamegeek I can say
that this game would have not sold more
than 50 copies probably only family and
friends and people we could force at
gunpoint to buy a part of their money so
decided to take the risk to publish this
using our own savings I think the most
exciting part was now we're going to do
this exactly the way we want it and
we're going to put it out to the public
if they don't like it well then we'll
retire with much less money and much
more board games in
in our cellar but we would have tried it
and the idea of not really having to
compromise because I believed that this
was something usual or at least worth
pursuing then my friend then we had to
draw the map board because so far shown
you only things about the cards so this
was my coreldraw mad bored I'm quite
fond on it you might not have bought it
if it was in this form I respect that so
this is what I brought from from oj this
is what we played on this is a sketch we
found of medieval Cracow this is around
the Year 1500 originally the game was
placed somewhere around that time we
later change the dates back to 1325 ad
for some reasons so this is a present
day cracow and you can see the shape of
the old city very very well everywhere
where there are trees that's just inside
the old city wall interesting also is
that the river that you see here on the
on the bottom several of the larger
tributary rivers of the Vistula River
are now big streets so they were rivers
then their streets now in the front of
this picture you see the castle of
viable this is what well he ought to do
first this is a sketch and you can see
the Sheikh there then we started messing
with it so I'll just show it to you in
rapid succession we start trying to fit
everything and it moved around quite a
bit
starting to look more permanent now then
he drew this map and this is what you'll
find in this box so you'll see that
there is a very interesting sequence of
creative interactions between the
designer and and the artist basically I
don't know anything about drawing and I
don't know what works in terms of colors
and shapes and what people what how to
how to use the visual aspects for most
effect and now he or did not know too
much about how the game works I had to
keep on making sure that the game itself
would not work less well because it
looks so nice and so this was a very
interesting partnership than we were in
for this for this project okay then we
had to draw ourselves the box that you
see here this is just to see you see the
same tower in the picture at night and
funnily enough at the board game fair
that we've attended we've had Polish
people come to our stainless a well it's
a really nice picture of Cracow and
because I recognize the castle so they
do really he did do a good job in order
to make all these drawings now if you're
actually took a trip to crack out and
walked around there for about three days
taking pictures trying to get some more
of the graphic information that you
might need and this is what it then
finally looked like so it was first
published in october two thousand eight
which is just over a year ago
this is us we had a small event at our
house that I just wanted to share with
you where we shared with people who had
helped us in play texting and giving a
device in providing friendlier guidance
and all through the play testing process
so he had a small fair event and this is
how we revealed the game to our home
crowd and of course after we revealed it
we had to play it and this is us meeting
the market at essen in october two
thousand eight we took our game to Essen
the biggest board game fair in the world
and we started selling the game there
what has happened since since this time
october two thousand eight which managed
to sell 1200 of the 2,000 games we
printed originally both in Europe and
quite a few in the USA and with some of
the capital returns from the first sales
we published a three-player expansion of
which we've managed to sell 400 the game
was nominated for that board game award
did not win the award but we did that
was not very likely from the start so
it's already very pleased to be
nominated we got a very nice ranking on
our board game geek site many people
scouring the rating the game quite high
obviously also if you allow the public
to rate and comment you also get a lot
of very nasty comments and we took them
on the chin and we enjoy them as well
because they were part of it was good
that people at least express an opinion
rather than we be totally unknown to us
have some interest from the United
States based distributor but we have not
concluded the deal yet one thing I had
hoped from the very start you could say
is that some board game publisher would
jump in and want to
publish this game on a much bigger scale
because obviously if you publish 2,000
games you cannot do this in any
commercially viable way the print run is
too small the minimum is roughly four or
five thousand that any real publishing
company will put in so that has not
happened yet and that has been maybe
it's like disappointment but not really
all that much two main reactions I have
received from hundreds and hundreds of
people have method board game fairs and
online is that they think that this game
is a totally different gaming experience
from other board games so people who
play many board games will often enjoy
this game simply because the engine is
totally different we're only playing
cards and you don't need to plan way
ahead because you cannot and you have
this secret identity and I think
secondly a high level of appreciation
for the quality of the product that we
made although we were complete beginners
in this field and we had to rely on our
publisher and on our own skill and
trying to make this as good as possible
for quite quite a long time so you see
quite a large variety of self-published
games at the better fair i guess some
looking very good and some maybe should
have worked on it a little bit longer as
for the future or as for what's next
with peter and his board game i would
say if a banker or an investor or
publisher would look at my experience of
the last four years I don't think he
would rate it as a success story we have
managed to make a small loss every of
the first two years we did not get the
publishing deal that might have
generated some income and certainly we
have not been rewarded financially for
any of the time with pudding however I
think as the owner of this company
and then powers of this game I reserve
the right that I measure its success by
my own standards the goals I had I might
when I started this was to recover some
of the invested savings which we did to
enjoy the experience of self-publishing
a board game learn new things and meet
people around this project of mine and I
think the biggest reward that I've had
in the last two years in particular has
been the opportunity to meet people
share something that I've created
together with others and get the
feedback on it to get an email from
South Africa or Brazil or Hong Kong from
someone who's played the game or who has
a more gaming club or who really please
can you sign my expansion is really
unusual when we went to Essen for the
first time we said should we if people
ask are we going to sign these things is
that it wouldn't be any interest and
then to meet people who are delighted
when you are willing to sign your name
in the corner of a net board is just
what's the value of this is you cannot
cannot say what's the monetary value of
that that's just amazing and especially
people play the game a lot you and these
fans you meet real diehard board gamers
you know what's in their cellar you know
they have hundreds and hundreds of games
and they go home from a board game fair
with 20 30 50 different games if you
later hear that they've played it and
they've liked it then somehow you've
shared something so if I look back at
this whole project then I could have a
bigger bank account right now but this
idea would be like a bird and I can
certainly say it's been a big success if
i compare those two states of the world
with each other for the future I don't
think my company is going to live much
longer
but there of course I'm still hoping to
sell most of the rest of my games since
I owned the idea and together with the
artist on the artwork if in future
anyone would show up who wants to
publish this game on a bigger scale will
be very interested just to get more
people a chance to play I have not been
deterred from designing or publishing
another game at least I know how it
works so if I would ever have another
inspirational moment I would consider it
what I still think what is the what what
what something very interesting in this
game to explore is the within board
gaming is the concept of the duel
scoring which allows you a secret
objective as well as an open objective
in most board games you're either
totally see it's either totally secret
or it's quite open but the combination
of putting in one game to scoring
mechanisms one that generates visible
points and one that generates invisible
points I think there are still a lot you
can explore in this that you can make
more different games with different
engines that would I think people would
be interested in playing and that's all
I had to say about this game I would
like to just show you the excel sheet if
you like if you help me you go
radix
let's see right so no runs BCC the power
this is to work yeah yeah yeah okay so
from top to bottom you see all the cards
1 256 the the normal cards you could say
where they belong to the area the area
is also numbered and the title of the
card the rewards of this card you can
see my cursor moving yeah the white
areas are what is not possible so in the
barracks there is no following so I
could never place any influence in this
white box that are there is only style
and power tokens can be earned in the
this then here are the 8 values of this
card and again the title just to be able
to read this part so here you see the
support of each card for every other
color and the opposing values of every
card to every other color you can
imagine that these have been manipulated
endlessly to try and make them as
interesting and different and give you
options not create cards that are too
strong etc I'll just go back and I'll
show you
so here at the bottom we see that if all
here the total number is 58 for each
color so if you score all the red cards
you would have scored 58 influence and
the same applies to every other color of
the cards and then if you go here you
see what how that is divided and you see
that this is not even so the underworld
is generally more likely to earn you
gold and the good and decent Senate and
the secret societies is less likely to
earn you gold so in these 16 you see the
division over the different types and
then here you see the values so in
support for good and decent citizens at
the bottom you see changes that the
total support from good and decent
citizens cards for good and decent
citizens for on green cards supporting
green cards is 58 on blue cards
supporting green cards is 43 on the
yellow cards supporting green cards is
29 and on red cards 0 right so these
numbers of course have also been
manipulated throughout to see how much
stronger the opposing card should be in
comparison to the to the base cards and
here you see the same value so 0 is the
total amount of opposing points you have
on all the green cards against all red
cards again on the green cards against
all blue cards against the yellow cards
and against red cards so here you see
the system of these alignments
showing that green cards are stronger
against yellow then they are against
blue for example let me see so the sum
of all the abstract values is 143 in the
sum of all the support values is 130
which is 1.1 times then there is a
difference between gold and others
because gold is an influence that can be
spent in different ways it doesn't have
to go straight to one area you can spend
it later in the game so generally having
gold is better than any other type of
influence then I needed to make sure
which you see here I needed to make sure
that from the total of all the cards how
much of the influence that you can win
goes to which areas because it would not
make sense that the amount will be the
same because one of the areas is worth
more than others so here you see and the
calculations I did to try and keep track
of this to try and make sure that if all
the cards for a certain area would score
how quickly would it fill up if many big
cards would go to an area with only
limited by space for influence then the
later players will be disadvantaged so
this is a system I put into that
and this is my final bit I think so this
is this table shows you that for every
card you play you will face 13 cards
which have a value of zero against that
card five cards with the value of one
took our eight cards with the value of
two etc every card will face 55 possible
other cards with a total is 56 and this
is that same number 143 and the same
applies up here so this is the engine
sorry to take much longer than I hope
you have been
the the the reason I wanted to well
they're too two reasons firstly I want
to stronger link between the card and
the story and the map board so that some
card will give you much power in the in
an area but not much style point you can
say or not much followers so the idea
that in the slums you can only have
followers you cannot get power or style
which is Fame you could say in that area
in the harbor you can get certain things
so the stories would relate to those
things being either fame or or followers
in the harbor and then one card would be
different because the story would point
you more towards following rather than
fame so river Legends is a card that has
an effect in the harbor because the old
men tell their stories in the taverns
and the harbor and they will get you
more Fame and some followers and not
much gold that was trying to make as
much a link as possible between the
storytelling and the actual card the
other reason was that I wanted to have
these special effects where card might
give have a special effect on followers
or on the power that you have so that's
why I needed different boxes in the
different areas when you explain the
game to new players there often are so
what's the difference between for the
gameplay what's the difference between
following in power and I can say well
there's not much difference except when
you play a special card that allows you
to remove following order to replace one
thing or the other all the special cards
getting the special cards to be balanced
was very very difficult we took a very
long time we had a number of special
cards in the beginning that were way too
strong black death was a special card at
the beginning and would wipe out all the
following in about three or four areas
and the only time I saw my livelihood
program coordinator very upset during
nine months in Aceh was when his
followers were all eliminated by the
Black Death he said this is ridiculous
how can you make it so strong this card
should not be in the game so trying to
we try to make them as close as possible
what you'll see or for that the special
cards that have a stronger impact will
have a lower value to start with so they
are hard to score but if they score
their effect is bigger try and make sure
that the special cards of red and the
special cars of green and the special
cards of yellow have roughly the same
value or attraction has been quite a
long process of trying where did you
make the obstruction that's because in
the way the game works one player starts
and his or her teammate adds points yeah
so there is one starting card and that
card is supported by the partner in the
team so it will add support points the
two opponents play their cards and they
use their obstruct or oppose points the
thing is there are four seasons you play
for card games in one game here before
you score the victory points and in
every card game one player or one team
has the advantage to decide the ties if
the score is 88 one team will win or
want to lose depending on the season
that you are playing the first second
third or fourth card game now the thing
is if they would be equal that in a
season in a card game where you have the
advantage you would win too often you'd
because it would often
might often be tight so if the opposed
cars are slightly stronger in this case
ten percent stronger it balances for the
fact that quite often the starting
player is one who wins all ties so to
compensate for that the obstruct needs
to be slightly stronger so you mentioned
that some of the elements of this game
they start attacking and i was wondering
these i find that the block is whatever
you want to call them just in mechanical
again because they make it dangerous to
play okay are these things that you just
come up with them doing this this the
Domino that part of this original you
know the original card game is actually
it's possibly most comparable to bridge
but much simpler I think the essence is
the 24 always four players and two teams
against to where you manage your hand
not only for yourself but in
anticipation of what your partner might
have or might not have and what your
opponent's might have or might not have
so the idea of blocking strong cards I
realized fairly soon that both for the
storytelling element having strong cards
and opposing block cards was very
interesting rather than to have a large
number of cars that are all sort of just
values you now look for special cards so
that you can block especially a specific
component card obviously also the strong
cards would be too easy to score if
there was no blocking mechanism what you
can say it might it might come bug be
most directly related to the game
striptease Stratego you go towards where
the marshal the strongest piece can be
destroyed if the spine affects it so you
if you have a game where if in the game
mechanics some cars are much more
powerful than others you need to create
some balancing mechanism
of course in this card game it also
really works well because remembering
which cards are in or out becomes much
more interesting if you have this
mechanic yeah well so what made you
switch from being 1492 to 30 25 good
question we decided earlier want to have
medieval crack out as I explained and it
should be at a time when it was the
capital of Poland and that is in a time
span that started roughly around the air
11 hundred one thousand up to about 50
1600 I believe after that at some point
well Paul didn't always exist and if it
existed after some time they moved to to
Warsaw so we had this whole space of
about 500 years we want to put this and
I had already written quite a lot of
these stories so had some idea what kind
of things should be happening in this
environment rocket science can't think
of that many I was looking at a time
when this was the seat of the royal
family they're needed to need it to be a
time of war of conflict with surrounding
countries and there were several of
course as you can imagine to choose from
originally we put 1490 because I had a
card called the Copernicus code copernic
the call the scientist or a stolen earth
yeah astronomer he studied in this town
I found it out very early and I thought
oh that's a lot nice thats ever thought
about that but then I found out sometime
later that in the year 40 90 the King
had no family and no children and
already had pictures with daughters and
his stories about his wife and it's
better if this guy had a family the king
of home at the time
and then we already had one of the very
early cards was a palace coup it shows
the king of poland sittin on sittin on
his throne and some people trying to
scare him out of his wits and that king
that Melfi Oh drew is very very short
and I then I searched all through polish
history trying to find a time when there
was war the King had a family and
possibly he was also short and to my big
excitement there was a man called lucky
tech who was king of all around from 13
24 to 30 28 I believe only a few years
and in polish his nickname was the elbe
as high as your elbow or something so in
English they called it low key take the
short which was much nicer so having
already the picture of a very short king
and all these other things matching up
meant so I remember writing an email to
Melchior from Indonesia saying I've done
some research and excellent rather like
to move it to 30 25 were you okay with
that he wasn't too sure because he said
well I've been drawing all these
people's clothes never based on the idea
that was 40 90 so I'm going to look at
this we looked at whether or not there
was a gun powder or some of these things
we had more or less I think so go ahead
finish off yeah that was the reason okay
so um we're up time so thank everybody
and thank you very much hey Topher come
