presentation is going to be about
testing applications on mobile devices
and it will be given by darn movie knee
from you test hi guys come on good
morning so I may let me start by
introducing myself and Iran movie knee
I'm the CEO and co-founder of you test a
little bit of background about my
company before I start your test today
is a world largest market place for
software application testing so
primarily we provide a software testing
services to software companies that
develop web desktop and mobile
applications and we do that in a very
unique way we do that using a the
world's largest community of
professional testers today in our
community we have over 20,000
professional testers from 158 countries
across the globe and my presentation is
about the unique challenges of mobile
application testing we all know that the
mobile is the hot market it's
significantly growing at a fast pace
multi-billion dollar industry and we as
the QA and test leaders face some unique
challenges when testing mobile
applications and I'm going to address
that I'm also going to introduce the
concept of crowdsourcing or
crowd-sourced testing or community
testing and talk about how crowdsourcing
or crowd testing can be utilized of as
one of the tools in the arsenal of a QA
or test leads in order to handle and
work with some of those unique
challenges primarily the need to test
across real devices in real locations
now you know really excellent
presentations in the last two days a my
presentation is kind of unique because
it doesn't talk about
technology or a technical innovation he
talks about people's innovation and
business process innovation so in
essence you're not going to see any
lines of code in my presentation even
though everything behind it behind the
business process is facilitated by a
relatively robust technology platform
that facilitates the business process
innovation so from an agenda perspective
I'm actually going to start by
introducing crowdsourcing talk a little
bit about the history talk a little bit
about crowdsourcing in other types of
industries then I'm going to introduce
the mobile application market talk about
the size of it how it's growing and
what's at stake for mobile developers
and people that are testing mobile
applications I'm going to talk about the
unique challenges of what we call in the
wild testing that mobile needs and I'm
going to address where crowdsourcing
fits when we look at the four dimensions
of testing in houses versus outsource
manual versus automated scripted vs
exploratory and on device versus of
device for mobile we're then going to
take a deeper dive and take a look at
some of the challenges of crowdsource
testing you know it's one of the tools
it doesn't provide the bulletproof
solution so we're going to talk about
some of the challenges we're also going
to talk about the benefits and we're
also going to talk about how does it
really work in a real world scenario and
we're going to end with the real world
examples of people and customers that
are using it in order to do that testing
so let's start with crowdsourcing so you
know in order to wake you up a little
bit too has ever heard about the term
crowdsourcing okay who hasn't okay
they'll be interesting who's ever used
crowdsourcing in some way or another one
two three four five okay not bad so
crowd
sourcing was defined by at least the
academic definition by Jeff Howe who is
a journalist in Y magazine and just
defined it as the act of taking a job or
a service traditionally performed by a
designated person usually an employee
and sourcing it to a large group of
people in the form of an open call so
that's the academic definition of crowd
sourcing but actually crowdsourcing
started about 100 years prior to that
and it started in a small town in
England so I'm going to tell you a story
now which is not about software testing
but it's an interesting story so in this
town in England about 100 years ago just
over a hundred years ago they had they
held a contest in town contest was there
was a new boo you know bull that was
born and all the people in the town had
to come and guess the weight of the bull
and it was in stone you know for the
people have come from England but I'm
actually going to speak in the metric so
Oh every other people from town came and
basically you know wrote on a piece of
paper what they believe is the weight of
the newborn bull and you know small kids
and adults and at the end of the day you
know they analyze the resultant they saw
something which is very interesting if
they look at the average guess it was
very very far away from the actual size
of the book but when they looked the
actual weight of the book but when they
looked at the average of all gases it
was only two grams away from the actual
weight of the book that came to be known
as the wisdom of the crowd so was that a
fluke no it wasn't a fluke it was
actually tried in many guessing games
after that like guessing the amount of
jellybeans in a jar and they actually
figure out that the results are
consistent and not only that the largest
crowd the more accurate the gases and
that became to be known as the wisdom of
the crowd now question is
can we apply that to testing in some way
we'll get to that so before we go to
testing let's talk about crowdsourcing
in other industries you know the people
who are not familiar with the term of
not used it so in information in media I
think everybody knows Wikipedia was
created by the crowd contributed by many
people dig Yelp in marketing services a
good friend of mine started a company
called trada you know people today go in
and basically hire experts in order to
do the google adwords campaign what try
that does is basically has experts
compete to do the best google adwords
campaign for you so he has a crowd
competing to it companies like genius
rocket IT services companies companies
like LiveOps that does call center using
the crowd companies like on force I want
to why my office instead of calling a
company I can basically post a job have
people compete for it and the guy that
will come in and basically do it design
companies I don't know how many people
here know Twitter but the little birdie
which is basically the logo of twitter
twitter paid four hundred ninety five
dollars for it and they did it using a
crowdsource design style and there's
many crowdsourcing designs that
basically real designers which are
freelancers doing design work another
company where i come from called local
motors who are this year going to
produce the first car that was designed
by the crowd okay and you know one very
interesting aspect is of the crowd is
actually crowdsource development so a
company out of New England called
topcoder basically has developers
compete for best algorithms developers
competes to writing test applications
and they're basically using the crowd in
order to
fellow of applications to their
customers so to summarize what is
crowdsourcing so really crowdsourcing is
an approach to delivering a service it's
the capability to leverage a large
community of customer professional so
these are not just people its people in
a specific field of expertise that come
together as a community okay and work
together for a common cause it really is
the people in business model innovation
now what it is crowdsourcing is not
traditional offshoring or outsourcing
it's not a tool or technology and it's
not a technical innovation so I'm going
to put crowdsourcing a side who put it
together in a second let's take a look
at the mobile application market so who
doesn't have a smartphone here one two
three Wow okay so you know the
competition around smartphone is and
mobile ease faces than ever the
estimated size of the market and next
year is 8.5 million dollars I'm talking
about apps only I'm not talking about
mobile devices developers today are
really competing for media attention for
consumer dollars for App Store approval
for Vista investments it's one of the
largest growing markets today and it's
not only in the consumer apps enterprise
application are starting to go to mobile
as well banks are doing iPhones
application so our insurance companies
it's really the pressure to build and
test and launch and get to market faster
with high quality better than my
competitor has never been fiercer
competition is really really tough now
what's the most interesting thing is is
that ugly
gation is really the driving force
behind mobil I mean look at the iphone
commercial okay no and I like the fact
that this queen is very nice or you know
it can play music they basically say you
know that's 50,000 apps that can do this
and can do this and can do this so that
leads me to my next statement that
basically said that the battle for
mobile dominance is going to be fought
and won on the field of the apps the
apps are really the driving force behind
selling these mobile devices behind
selling these mobile services market
size so this is from G gone and you know
iphone is today the largest platform for
mobile application developers is the
estimate is that by the end of the year
Android is going to be the number two
platform but basically a the estimate is
that you know today's as 200 million
worth of applications solved every month
that's 2.4 billion dollar a year and
this is on the iphone only and this is
today's run rate so this is a
multi-billion dollar industry growing at
the significant pace now let's take a
look about a on the side of testing so
testing today in mobile application is
what we call the wild wild west okay
it's basically where everybody is a
cowboy it's where web and desktop for a
few years ago and really the start to
squirrels that wave around application
testing is not sufficient for more about
today mobile is going at such a fast
pace in automation for mobile is still
not there so many companies that are
looking in order to do things and by the
way the guys in the room which are
interpreters there's many opportunities
around testing for mobile devices a part
of the you challenging the unique
challenge of mobile application testing
is that the matrix that needs to be
covered in
tested on mobile devices has significant
depth and is growing so in order to
really get the coverage and test across
everything that you need to test you
really need to worry about handset
makers and models and different wireless
carriers because application behave
differently with wireless carriers and
different operating system and browsers
and languages which are also important
and location location location so my
application behaves differently in
different location in mobile device not
only because it's it's tied to my GPS
but also because it's tied to a server
and its behavior behaves differently if
I connect to it from Germany or I
connect to it from the US so location
really matters you know one great
example which always give I have a
friend with mobile application startup
it's called pixie small brown and it's
actually an enterprise application
beautiful application everything was
going great you know had perfect
coverage on mobile devices until one day
blackberry released is touchscreen you
know he basically had to reinvest
reinvest and rewrite or the front end in
order to support a screen for the
blackberry so what makes it even worse
is that the applications are relatively
simpler so time to market is a real
pressure and the margins that you can
get from these applications a narrow and
are shrinking all the times I've sold at
a much lower rate and sometimes I even
given for free so you really need to
manage cost effectively so let's take a
look at crowdsourcing and see where
crowdsourcing fit scene for mobile
applications I'm going to look at their
four different dimension and talk a
little bit about crowdsourcing in where
it fits in so dimension number one is
really in house this is offshore and you
know obviously there's a pros of
in-house is at the fact that you know
you have more control you have more
visibility your in-house team has
and business knowledge and expertise of
the actual application the cons is that
it's relatively fixed cost I cannot
scale as quickly from coverage
perspective my coverage is not you know
huge because I cannot hire hundreds of
people to cover it and I cannot fly them
to different location and there is a
higher level of commitment when I
invested in Asti we look at the other
extreme and we look at offshoring so the
perceived cost is lower it has more
scalability it's lower commitment for me
because it's a contract it's not my
people but really adaptability is the
fact that the testers are not diverse
the transparency the fact that many
times it's perceived costs low but I
have communication issues which cost me
internally and and basically causes me
to hidden costs so crowdsourcing
actually fits right in the middle take
some of the benefits from both ends so
with crowdsourcing I can get significant
coverage because I can utilize the crowd
in order to test the mobile application
in different locations and get
significant coverage that can grow over
time absolutely to scale whenever I want
I have the creativity of testers that I
know the grading I know the past
experience in my total cost since I
don't invest in it in a long time and I
can use utilize it on demand whenever I
already I'm ready is significantly lower
there are some cons as well it requires
a high level of coordination there is
some learning curve so I need to be
repetitive in the tasks that I give so
the crowd learns my application in the
way I want them to report bugs and
issues and there is a signal to noise
ratio that goes down over time but this
is something that I need to learn to
deal with as time goes by until my
virtual testing team learns the
application and does it correctly the
other dimension is manual versus
automated and agree that it's not this
or this obviously combination is
best but I'm putting it in an extreme in
order to show you a crowdsourcing feeds
so Manuel you know this is obviously I
agility of the manual testers this
creativity allows us to explore the
edges it doesn't provide the scalability
the repetitive tasks the fact that they
may be human error involved and
basically the exhaustive coverage the
technique on the side of automation you
know it's good form anything it has a
scalability the investment obviously
provides ROI in the cost for the long
term it provides speed for repetitive
task he doesn't provide me the coverage
for in the wild it's morning in the
laptop was testing specifically for
mobile application and it ignores the
unexpected limited imagination and
invisible adaptability crowdsourcing
really fits please today in the manual
side because these are manual testers
which are testing on device now we and I
know some other companies that are
experimenting with handing some
automation device to test us in the
field and handling handing or giving
some testers in the field basically
diagnostic tools that can run and report
to a main server so we definitely see
that as a direction where the market
will go combined together with the
manual testing the third dimension is
exploratory versus scripted so
exploratory testing provides the agility
creativity allows us to explore the
edges a doesn't ensure coverage and may
have some human or error involved on the
scripted slide it does provide a
predictability that's provide me
coverage in control a but really ignore
the unexpected and limit the creativity
crowdsourcing can do both and it should
do both although it excels in the
exploratory style
this is where it really gives the value
but you can get you can basically do
both you can get coverage across a wide
range of devices across a wide range of
countries locations in carriers networks
or SS but it can really excel in
exploratory based testing when you're
using good testers in the crowd to
really explore your application the last
one is on devices versus of device now
there are today many companies that do
of device type of testing they start by
you know connecting your mobile device
to a main hub and basically having a
camera on top and and basically allowing
you to do some some functionality or
even taking your mobile device apart
putting it in a lab and connecting it to
a simulator where you can actually do
the testing using some virtual window
into the actual mobile device that's
what's called basically of device
testing so on device obviously has the
agility the creativity is the real world
device the interaction with the network
or the multiple networks the interaction
with the user it's more time consuming
there's a high cost because you need to
do the coverage and you need the device
access the off device in the long run it
provides good cost ratio it provides
speed it provides convenience but it
doesn't give us the in the lab they in
the wild testing or the limited user
expertise or it is really detached from
the real world so crowdsourcing really
fits on the own device crowdsourcing is
basically testing on device okay and
that's really where it Excel and that's
where we see the value so let's take a
closer look at crowdsource testing in
out work so the idea behind the crowd
source option is in the really secret
sauce behind it is to match the right
tester with right project so the idea
here is not to take the specific project
and throw it at the crowd and see what
you get because your signal to noise
ratio is going to be significant to die
the idea is really to monitor and get as
much data as you can due to past history
and profiling of the tester and really
match the right tester with right
project because this is where you get
the value and that also allows you or
allows customers to build the virtual
testing team that will go with them from
iteration to iteration and will
continuously test with them and we'll
get used to the way that they wanting is
reported and obviously the value is in
the wild testing and real location based
testing now not only you can go and
choose and select your testing team
based on past experience and on profile
you can even use symmetric like user
demographics in order to pick and choose
your testing team so if you're
developing the next social network
application for a mobile device you can
basically select and pick an invite
testers with background on social
network type of testing that's really
where you get the true exploratory value
of the actual testing now crowdsourcing
is not the answer for all mobile
application test and does not intend to
be crowdsourcing is basically another
tool that can be used in the hands of
test leads in order to get better
coverage that exploratory testing in
real world on device type of testing
let's talk a little bit about the
challenges because you know this is a
true world and nothing is ever perfect
there's a lot of noise in crowdsourcing
today and what's very important when you
choose a crowdsourcing partner to do
your testing or your mobile testing or
anything else you really need to choose
your partner wisely and a really
important thing is that when the crowd
and the application interact there's
basically mutual gradings that goes on
so every time the tester performs a job
you get some credit he gets some braids
every time project gets to be tested the
project gets graded the company gets
graded so in essence it is very
important for you to choose a company
but to use a partner for your
crowdsourcing that basically has a track
record and many customer wins because
all those previous customers will help
to build and shape up the community of
testers that will provide you value you
also need to choose a partner that
provides complete transparency and past
history of the actual successes of the
crowd so you can basically pick and
choose and invite the right testers that
fit and meet your project some of the
most common challenges when using crowd
is follow so communication you know how
do you I communicate with my testers so
you need to have to choose a partner
that has a technology platform that
facilitates communication with the
testers only one to one places via chat
via email on a one-to-many be a message
board via video chat message board one
real concern is IP protection so you
know I'm developing this great new
application I'm going to launch it to
the market market is never seen it
before oh my god you know how can I give
it to the crowd and so really you need
to choose a partner that facilitate the
capability to sign direct and da
we certify testers that have proven
track records also you also need the
capabilities to allow you to do check in
and check out of specific applications
to be tested because it allows you to
complete traceability into if something
happens who basically licked it M
quality the most important thing about
the quality is the capability to build
your testing team and go with it
basically for the long run and really
the value is the capability to reinvite
testers from cycle to cycle imagine
something like favorite testers imagine
something like bookmarking testers in
inviting them to my next releases
application knowledge is critical and
that's why you kind of need to have a
sick a dance in order to do your cycles
and be to have the capability to
reinvite those specific testers back now
on the signal-to-noise ratio there's
many many things that overcome that some
of them are technology issues for
example you know be for example have an
automatic duplication or duplicate bugs
that I report so we discourage testers
from reporting duplicate bugs in that
manner so something can be handled in an
automated manner some things can be
handled in an education something that
are handled by the fact that testers are
graded for the report so basically the
good testers flow to the top was a not
good the guys that don't follow the
rules get less and less project to
proceed to to basically participating
and that over time improves the
signal-to-noise ratio so if you did
everything right what does crowdsource
testing give you it gives you the
capability to really launch higher
quality applications test it across
real-world devices in real-world
location by real people that meet your
criteria the capability to invite
testers back build my own
virtual testing things that continues to
blow with me from cycle to cycle get to
market faster you can do cycles within
the weekend within two to three days
cycles are usually take two to three
weeks because you till you can utilize a
larger group of testers with more tools
with more devices with more coverage in
a much shorter period of time you can
ramp up quickly so you can spin up
projects within a matter of hours okay
you have a large crowd you can invite
many people you can spin it up in a
matter of hours and UK it can contain uq
echoes you don't need to sign long-term
contract and you can really utilize this
on demand and pay for the values that
you get but to remember execution is
critical you really need to have a large
community very skilled and engaged
testers and you need to have a
technology platform that facilitates the
communication between the testim that
set themselves between the testers and
the project in order to manage the bugs
execute the test script and provide
automated coverage report one very
important thing is that the platform
needs to have the capability to
integrate into your product development
lifecycle too sometimes your
requirements management sometimes to
your back tracking system so you can
really use it as a seamless extension of
your in-house testing so really how does
it work it really works in a in a very
very simple software as a service mode
you can go to a software service site
and basically specify your testing needs
you basically specify what do I want to
test and who would I like testing for me
and I can be very broad I can say you
know I have this mobile website I want
everybody testing for me across the
world or I can be very specific I'd like
to have blackberry testers
in Germany on a t-mobile network with
experience and expertise in social
network application on a mobile device
after i specify that the system matches
the right test is based on experience
and profile with my project those
testers get invited they get access to
the project and the project details real
time and they start testing and
reporting in real time on real live
devices you get all your bugs and
feedback and coverage reports in real
time and you have the capability to
approve them or don't approve that is
very very important because by approving
them and communicating with the tester
you basically grade the tester and you
help choose and select your testing team
for your next iteration now in a
crowdsourcing model the testers do get
paid so they do get paid for valuable
work that they've done okay and that's
an incentive for them to actually do
provide value and actually do do good
work and complete the coverage so to
summarize before I go to a few lodge a
few real real world example so a mobile
application today fast-growing
significant market testing is much of an
afterthought and it can't be enough to
the traditional testing methods that we
have today that work for web work for
desktop work for enterprise don't work
as well for mobile the problem if for
mobile is different it's significant in
size and location devices the matrix is
that needs to be covered a significant
crowdsourcing helps cover that matrix
crowdsourcing helps do real life on
device testing crowdsourcing does help
help get real exploratory testing unlike
devices by real experts I'm going to end
before the questions
with basically to real-world examples
show you some real companies that uses
use this on the real world example so
company number one is a startup from
Seattle it's company called one cast in
one cast has both an iphone application
and an android application the
application is focused on delivery of
news and video their challenge was
really we need to launch a leading-edge
product in a multi-platform world we are
startup you know we have a team of seven
developers we have one person your QA
you want to launch we want to be the
leaders in the market and we need to
cover Wi-Fi and we need to worry about
3G and the 18 th network and we really
need testing that we can fault you not
you know we've evaluated everything so
we looked at increasing our in-house
team really not so effective for a start
up a size a we're not willing to give
control to a real app offshore and
really say such you know alternatives
and they came to crowdsourcing in
crowdsourcing actually gave them global
coverage that they needed a cross iphone
and android with a significant cost
saving they could specify the
requirements the testing needs created a
virtual testing team they're integrated
their product development platform and
test management platform in this case
they used rally software because they
were an agile shop into the crowd
sourcing solution and really went and
took it the extra step when they're
actually doing weekly builds test and
deploys to the market using the
development team their in-house QA team
and a complete virtual crowdsource
testing team the other example is a
company called topless out of palo alto
california and everybody's a
I phone here and I don't know how
popular iPhone is but basically that
boost it develops the game tapped up
within three which is the number one
game on the iphone store and it's really
a combination of a gaming application
that needs to work on an iPhone device
and at a later stage on an Android
device and they had to test it on
different os's carriers devices and
location is a really significant launch
code tap tap revenge 3 and they also
need to test multiplayer games which was
you know unique and you need testers
communicating and working with each
other and you really need to be able to
test both offline and online mode in a
3d environment a they had an in-house
testing team which took care of you know
most of the issues however specifically
in a gaming applications the testing
teams becomes very very familiar with
the game and the way it goes and you
really very difficult for in-house to
cover all the extreme cases that are
really hitting the field and autos was a
little bit too expensive for them to
choose and that's why crowd sourcing was
chosen as a real blend an ideal blend of
both better testing and in aus type of
testing they tested across North America
both usability and functionality found
some significant high-priority bugs
before the launch of tap tap revenge 3
and really achieved comprehensive
testing within a matter of weeks what
they estimated will take actually month
though they actually expedited time to
market significantly thank you I may
open for questions
a check thank you for this presentation
was very well thought out one of the
questions I had was you said you have
these crowd testers all over the world
but one of the challenges for companies
is like if you also stuff to say India
first of all they might not have the
right infrastructure or they are not
familiar with the app so how do you
handle that like language barriers that
canister okay it's a very good question
so ideally when we work with companies
this is very typical to any crowd
sourcing type of a mode you can you can
really select and choose is a test is
based on different criterias some
criteria is is you know where they live
in the country of the origin so you can
basically come and say you know I'm
developing an application for the German
market and I actually want to select
testers from Germany that's very very
common and that's part of the value that
crowdsourcing give you when you type
into an environment of 20,000 30,000
testers you can really have the
capability to cut and slice and create
your own virtual testing tea you never
give it to 20,000 people you really have
the capability to pick and choose the
people that you want to invite and the
people that have the real background
information on on you know things that
they've done like that in the past now
what we do is we r crazy about data so
basically we analyze everything we
analyze everything about the
applications and we analyze everything
about the testers so every bug that is
reported there you know how many bugs
have reported how many bugs approved how
many bugs approved how many bugs
actually were fixed by the customer so
we really have a significant investment
in the grading system that allows us to
really put this you know top testers
together
uh excuse me over here sorry yeah it was
a very good talk I've had some
experiences testing mobile applications
and have faced that problem of how to
get the coverage of all the devices and
configurations that are out there you
mentioned that you know crowdsourcing
can improve product quality that sort of
challenges the statement we heard last
night which is that it's not all about
finding bugs so what do you do when
these people out in the wild with all
these various configurations find a bug
on a device or a configuration that you
can't reproduce in your development
environment okay and it's a good
question and that's obviously happens
that's why one of the most important
thing is really a technology that allows
you to have a communication with the
tester the testers is the testers are
actually extented to help the company to
figure out the source of the bug a
because of two reasons one they want the
bug proved because they get compensated
for it but even more important to that
they get graded and that impacts the
future project that they will get and it
impacts their rates moving both so the
testers are really is extended to help
the companies figure out the source code
of the bug and weather bug is coming
from now there are occasions where they
work with the company and they work with
the development team but still there's
no real source for the bug and they
provide proof you know in a real-life
picture or a video demo that there is a
bug so first of all it goes into the
repository of the company and obviously
it's better to know than not to know in
many cases in this occasion the tester
does get compensated if there is proof
for that many occasions is also also get
overcompensated by the company because
that's really valuable information um
I'm interested in the issue of coping
with unpredictable demand because
presumably you want to keep your top
coders engage your top test is engaged
um which means they have to have enough
flow of work to keep them involved but
you can't you know you can't necessarily
you don't necessarily know how much it's
got how much demand is coming in from
your clients and all you know and
wondering how you managed that kind of
thing so it's partly true mostly a
customers today are developing in agile
environment in their release schedule
and cabins of reasons pretty much
predictable and what happens is that if
you look at the top testers usually you
know in crowdsourcing and haven't talked
about it and but it's true statistically
to any large communities or something
which is called the 99 one rule what
does that mean basically means that
ninety percent are quiet listeners nine
are active and one percent is very very
very active okay so this one percent of
the guys which are really really active
in our on the top these are usually
thread talk to your guys a certified
testers the guys that are assigned to a
ongoing virtual projects of existing
customers and what happens over time
there is an ongoing predictable cabinets
of releases to the market there's a
virtual testing team that goes with
these customers from cycle to cycle so
there's a lot of value to the customer
buys in which you saying you know I have
this is my thirty thirty percent team
that actually does the coverage from me
on my weekly build and you know I can
also invite new blood every time and
that's really the way it is work so for
the one percent it's pretty predictable
the problem is that when you start you
need to prove yourself in order to get
to the one person and you prove yourself
not only by testing but also
contributing to forums being active in
other forms of engagements etc exit
dinner do you give the testers scenarios
to try like sets of scenarios that you
want feedback on or do you just let them
hand bang around
it really depends on the customer so
many many cases you know we give some
bass test case so the testers can use as
a form of playing with the application
but really the value is insignificant
exploratory testing within the realm of
some scope of the application now you
know one of the things and I don't want
to enslave you many many times we don't
only test finished products okay we many
times we test product in early
development life cycle where the
customer gives us specific focus to test
and tells everybody else to avoid you
know sideline pockets so that's very
very that happens all the time thank you
and my question is about are there any
limitations about possibility to form
the kind of crowd you need to test
application for example i can i'm not
sure i can imagine people with
blackberrys who will be what does what
can make them motivated to participate
in testing okay it's a good question and
there are markets which are less open to
this type of solution like others but
it's very typical like you know many
many other industries look at virtual
computing when it first came out many
companies said why i'm going to put my
day down the great one my crazy what
about security and all the time you know
everybody is starting to migrate people
start to feel comfortable with the fact
that it really works they get
compensated they belong to something
they contribute the quality of
application they get some financial
incentive they are rated the top tester
for company x there's a lot of value in
it was a test now I'll tell you
something you know very very interesting
I I go and speak a lot and I talk to a
lot of a test leaders in many many types
of countries in many many types of
projects
many of these tests leaders actually
incentivize deaf people to go and sign
up for you to sin work for you too now
the reason for that is the visibility to
different type of applications and
different types of technology and
different types of methods of testing
makes them a better testing so there is
valuing that as well I have two
questions the first one is if a company
wants to test their next next generation
flagship product how can it prevent this
information being from being leaked to
the competitors and the second one is
that I have an idea for an iphone
application I want to use some program I
want to ask programmers from top coder
for example to implement it for me how
can i prevent this situation that sudden
there are dozens of similar applications
deployed in app store based on the same
idea thanks let me try to address the
issue of IP protection so you know first
of all let's start with fact twenty five
percent and I'm sticking my name in my
company name 25 of them percent of the
application that we test today are under
NDA private releases and under full IP
protection okay it's a fact twenty-five
percent and there's many mechanism that
we utilize in order to protect IP none
of them are one hundred percent secure
the mechanism are we know who the
testers are we pay them we know where
they live we have the social security
number passport numbers it Stein and NDA
with us they sign an NDA with a company
every time they download an applications
they check it out okay so if something
is deployed to the market we know what
the source where it was okay so that's
all things that basically you know make
sure that it's not worth while for the
tester to do something bad okay now did
anything
bad happen in the past no hoodie yes it
could can we pursue the testers for it
yes we can okay so but it can also
happen with you know an employee and
I'll give you an example you know the
source code for windows 7 was posted on
you know on the forum I think after the
beta so employee is also linked no it's
in today's world IP protection the fact
that you develop in agile and you
release product to the market all the
time becomes less avenged that's my own
question so what are the barriers to
entry for another company to become the
next you test competitor and second
question is is there a university or
case study written on your company as
yet okay so question number one
obviously there's many barriers of entry
part of it is technology part of which
is the fact that you know testers build
reputation over time so I found my
tester and I'm going to some other
community takes me time to build a
reputation we're invested significantly
in R&amp;amp;D and development okay so out of 23
employees we have 12 which are basically
doing development and the reason for
that is we're rolling out a
functionality all the time that ensures
that we collect data all the time so
also the fact that we're collecting data
about bugs about behavior of application
about stability of application about
maturity of application about our
testers also gives us an edge over the
competition because if someone starts
from the beginning he has zero data
needs to start from the beginning he
needs to start creating and building his
community he needs to start
understanding the demand of the
customers but there are competitors so
this is actually many case studies the
case studies on mobile application this
case studies on desktop application this
case studies and web applications are
all on the website we're now doing a
significant case study with Microsoft
with a
sewickley tested for them in microsoft
security essentials which was released a
couple of months ago very successfully
they're doing a significant case study
with us and I would like to ask you what
whatever precondition to be from your
test there and can you tell me a profile
of a known tester I mean how much salary
can get in so or it's not secret no it's
actually not a secret em so in order to
become a tester for with us it's
basically nothing you need to come to
the website and you need to profile
however in order to actually get
projects you need to prove yourself okay
and you need to prove yourself with us
and you need to prove yourself with
customers okay and only once you start
getting grading and feedback from
customers only then you will start
getting visibility to the most important
project after you have a proven track
record for a few months only then you
start you will start to see what we call
private release is basically which are
intended for our certified business so
that that's basically how we go you
cannot just go in and test now what you
be able to test immunity is our product
our product so you know we use our
community in order to test our product
so that's one way for us in order to
build the community we also have
different types of projects which are
open source which basically allows us to
categorize our testers to silver gold a
bronze silver and gold and allows
testers you know to be graded from more
promising and basically go up the ladder
oh and about compensation it really
depends our top testers can make the
real top testers can make a few thousand
dollars so it's not a replacement to the
day job at least not in the you
so the neural but it is nice ink hello
my own yeah you've spoken almost
exclusively about bugs can you or do you
also deal with tangential matters such
as for example usability or beach
requests as may be more usual yeah so
you know obviously when you do
exploratory testing the end result is
bugs and you know about 80% of what we
do is exploratory a we do about ten
percent today which is usability testing
and another ten percent which is like
testers that get to a certain level and
provide project management we also do
load and performance we do load
automated load and we also do something
which is very basically automated load
provided by our certified testers and
automated testing testing provided by a
certified tested but we also do
something which is very unique which is
real life load basically the idea is and
we've had the need for that in
specifically in web application many
companies come to us and say you know if
you invested in this in real life load
but really when we go live the
application behaves differently because
a machine cannot really mimic
significant load of human behavior so
can you have a thousand testers do
realize Laura so we do that too hyper
very short question what's the Ender
criteria of testing for the product of
sourcing because based on the park's
number of bugs have been found are based
on the time that you put it taste the
period I'm sorry I'm not trying what's
the end the criteria of the tasting or
product what's the criteria yeah based
on the box has been found or based on
how many time has been spending the day
with the test oh it's basically valid
feedback which could be bugs executed
test cases
executed desk it's not about time no
right time is a factor in the coverage
but it's not a factor in the example of
a product that some users reported a 100
bucks and then where you decide that it
were good enough to release to the pub
market or you ask your went to horror
movie for finding new box so it really
depends on the type of bugs and bugs
were really categorize you know i'll
share with you some statistical
information you know we look at this
value that we provide in two ways one if
when a bug is reported how many does it
bug get approved so what is the
percentage of bugs that get approved
after they get reported and we call that
the noise factors the second criteria
that we look at it from the bugs that
get to prove how many actually get fixed
okay the statistics today is that and it
really depends from customer to customer
but the statistics today is that almost
seventy percent of the bugs do get
approved and out of the ones that get to
prove a fixed ratio meaning the
development team actually decided to fix
the bug is fifty-four percent now this
that's usually good numbers if you
compare them to industry standard but
there's also you know reasons for that
part of the reason for example is the
fact that some of the some of what we
test is product that's already being
tested exhaustively by internal QA out
so sku a automated testing and then it's
given to us so obviously every bug
that's found there and approved will get
fixed so you know that's part of the
reason but the other reason is that
exploratory testing on real live
environment has value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
