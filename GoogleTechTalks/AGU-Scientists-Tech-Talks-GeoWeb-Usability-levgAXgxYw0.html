Richard Reeves who is at the departure
grafite apartment at the University of
Southampton in England where he's a
general sort of research an educator and
does a lot of work in the area of Google
Earth Google Maps and how best to use
them and design the things that you
using them he maintains a blog called
Google Earth design and so today he's
going to talk about Geo web and its
usability thanks John so yeah there's
the front screen and I'll tell you what
I'm going to go through in the talk
today first of all I'm going to go off
on a complete tangent talk about
polygons and how much I like them and we
should use them more in Google Earth
then I'm going to come on to the big
challenge of the 21st century I think
for the human race which is global
warming and how this relates to Google
Earth then i'm going to talk about our
we miss using the geo weber i mean this
in terms of design i mean this in terms
of designer the people putting things
into google earth rather than the actual
design of google earth or any of the
other virtual Globes or google map type
tools and to do this i'm going to
explore lessons from other technologies
so i'm going to talk about some other
technologies and how they developed i'm
going to d deconstruct a couple of
projects from a design point of view ok
so is here i go off on my tangent
polygons rock they're really good what
happens is if you look at Google Earth
you'll see there's lots of content which
has which is in the form of place mark
so place marks are very common way of
putting information in Google Earth and
there's one there that's the Albert
Memorial in Hyde Park in London and I
mentioned this one because i did a
teaching exercise in london at the raw
geographical society which is very close
to this and i had to teach them about
how to use gps and i gave them gps's and
i said go out and Mark the Albert
Memorial and the picture of it is down
there and what I didn't say and I
deliberately didn't tell them is how
they were supposed to market so I showed
them how to mark points and I said just
go out and market the best way you think
and what they did is they actually went
out and marked a polygon so that she
went out and they marked that square
rather than marking it as a point which
tells you that it these are social
scientists i was talking to that aren't
big on GIS or anything and they just get
the idea that actually the picture you
can see the album memorial isn't a point
it's more than a point it's actually an
area and the way it works in GIS is lots
of data is held in polygons as tables of
data so there's multiple bits of data
held within polygons I thought I'd
better show you a better example so in
GIS as I said polygons a lot more common
this is a an image of big island hawaii
and it's lava flows you can see in color
coming down the mauna loa volcano there
and each of those has to be a polygon
you can't mark those different
historical flows of lava as a point and
there's lots of analysis for things like
volcanic hazard go on with that sort of
data so it's held in a GIS system and
what goes with polygons is what's called
an attribute table so there's lots
there's a whole table full of data i
actually just pulled an image of any old
attribute table so they don't actually
match up here but you can see that you
have rows which is each polygon has a
set of data and you have the attributes
there so what I've highlighted there is
slope so each of those lava flows you
can imagine having a slope and that
helps in the modeling of where lava will
go in the future
and there's an ESRI Google tie up now
and what I'm pondering and I'd be
interesting to know the answer to is how
all the data that's held as polygons in
attribute table is going to get
transferred into Google if we don't
start using polygons more and when I
talk to talk to GIS people about Google
Earth the thing they often come up with
is they start talking about polygons and
how it's the central way that they
control data okay so briefly what can
you do with this well I've had a go
building a tool that works with Google
Earth and this is just some sample data
I just produced some random polygons
they could be administrative regions
whatever and this is in the Darfur
region and the yellow and orange marks
you can see there those are damaged
villages in Darfur and the red flames
are destroyed images and I just counted
them up and attach them in a table to
those polygons and it allows you to
produce the ematic map thematic maps and
you can then with the tool that we
produced you can automatically color
them in different ways on the fly in
Google Earth so in all kinds of teaching
situations that's a useful thing I'm not
going to go into the technical details
of how you did Dave if someone once
asked me afterwards I'll tell them but
the nice thing is I just got some
successful funding through to play
around with this and the tool I produced
wasn't in a form that I could release
and what we're going to go on is produce
a customization of google maps and play
around with this idea some more so
you'll see some more things about this
in the future okay so so on to the tour
proper really and to talk about
usability Geo web usability how to
design things well to go into geo web
applications and off really on another
tangent here this is this is from a
drugs education project in the UK I
heard about and they gave out pencils as
part of their drugs education with that
message on saying it's cool not to do
drugs now the thing about pencils is you
sharpen them and letters disappear in
which case the message of course changes
a little and then you show up in there
it more and it gets even more emphatic
about what you should do so they printed
up loads of these pencils and sent them
out and then of course they had to not
use them again which goes to prove a
great saying of mine in most of I do
which is just because we can does not
mean we should which is a very cheeky
thing to do to say actually standing in
a Google office built on things which
are very good for very good reasons so
that that's a kind of backstory the 21st
century challenge I think the central
challenge of our time is going to be
global warming and as a scientist who
works with scientists as well it's
communicating science change the public
we have to have them understand what's
going on to make decisions because if we
don't persuade them to stop using planes
wigan we're not going to solve global
warming so it's the central challenge
and I think the Geo web is a key tool in
that battle of trying to explain global
warming science to the public and David
Attenborough I saw him at Google Earth
Google outreach launched in London put
this a lot better than I ever could and
he said Google Earth is a weapon of
unparalleled value in the hands of all
of us who care about this greatly
imperiled world so that's the importance
that's what we're going for that's why
considering these is particularly
important I think and solving these
problems okay so I said I'd talk about
other technologies and what lessons we
could learn from other technologies this
is Gartner's hype cycle and it applies
to some technologies that I said not all
of them but lots of them go through this
sort of thing and what you've got on the
Left axis is visibility so the
visibility of the technology and time on
the the bottom axis and obviously to
start with this there's no technology
invented and then it's invented so you
have the technology trigger and then
everyone gets very overexcited about it
and then they realize that they got over
excited about it and actually doesn't
work in ways people thought they would
and then finally people work out how to
use things well and we end up with the
plateau
productivity now I I like this but I
think it's a bit over complicated so to
explain it in a short period of time I
kind of simplified it and I just go with
there's the old there's the wrong and
there's the right so let's have a look
at some technologies watches and I'm
going to have some audience
participation here so old this is a
mechanical watch it's got no battery in
it you had to wind it up it's all little
cogs and wheels does anyone in the
audience have a purely mechanical watch
nope no not on you okay good nothing
wrong with an old watch but it's
expensive for what it does and you need
to wind it this is wrong now this is a
digital watch it is a particular type of
digital watch that came out in the 70s
and to actually get the display you had
to press the button to see the time does
anyone have one of those okay I'm glad
because I'm saying that's wrong and
really people could just rest I lista
Creason like it but you had to press it
to find out the time so you couldn't
glance at your watch surreptitiously in
a meeting where you're getting bored and
find out what time it was and finally
now we've got things like this which is
a mixed digital analog watch so whatever
takes your fancy with whether you like
analog or digital you can glance at it
it's always on it's battery-powered you
don't have to wind it up and it's much
cheaper to produce than the mechanical
wash and I also like that example
because it allows me to use this rather
nice quote okay another one information
index so books books have indexes there
are indexes of books the web came out
and we all got really excited about
indexes and hyperlinks but sometimes the
hyperlinks were done really badly and
the indexing was done really badly so
this is a particularly bad web page in
terms of design because it's got an
index and it links quite nicely and that
all works thank you very much but you
can't see it because of the terrible
colors that have been used in the
banding and i'm not going to actually
show you the web page but if we could
see it the guys actually animated those
colors so they move
and it will give you all headaches I'm
not showing you that and right this is
my homepage that's what pops up when I
open Firefox every morning it's google
reader it's indexed everything it works
it looks nice I understand what's going
on with it so that's a particular aspect
really of the web I was talking about
their jakab nielsen who's a web
usability expert said that the lost
decade of the web was approximately
nineteen ninety-three to 2003 when he
says that in those years web design was
absolutely abominable so my thesis is
that really we're going through a kind
of a lost decade of Geo web designers
people really haven't learned to use
this technology properly and my
arguments we watching some web it's not
a very tight argument I've just try to
put the idea across so if anyone thinks
of some holes with those arguments
that's that's fair enough but as I said
the central question is are we in the
wrong phase are we in the lost decade of
the Geo web so let's go in and look at
an example this is the hurricane hunters
and what you're looking at there that's
an image of a plane track that's going
across and these people take wind
measurements as they as a hurricane
comes in and they record them and this
person has published this I don't want
to embarrass anyone so I'm not going to
say who it is but it's just I'm pointing
out some of the common mistakes that get
made and so they put it together and
here are some obvious things that aren't
really working with this first of all in
the scale where the scale isn't an
obvious blend what it's showing you is
wind speed but red has appeared twice in
the scale in different places so you
look at red you don't immediately know
what what wind speed is referring to
those icons I've expanded one in the top
left that's a standard wind icon on
meteorological maps and it works when
it's one icon separated by lots of space
which is usually what you have on
weather maps in this case you've got
lots of them packed together and you
can't you can't see them they all squish
up so what I did is I did I did another
version of it and I try to improve that
is
and what I did first of all I cleaned up
the scale there so it's a standard heat
map scale so you can instantly get an
idea of wind speed and the wind speed
isn't within the icon anymore it's the
the color of the line there and also
what I've done with the icons is their
little black slugs with white halos
around and that means on any background
they will pop up and you'll be able to
see them and you can't control what
background things plot over in Google
Earth so that's a good design point you
could also see that the line has got a
gray halo around it also to make it
stand out so I hope you can see from
common sense point of view that makes it
a lot more easy and I cleared up the
number of place marks as well I took a
lot of them out so it's not a crowded
view this is not an isolated case it's
just one where there was a number of
things wrong all at once I see lots of
lots of design problems like this all
over all over the Geo web really moving
over to the places column I'm not going
to talk much about this but one thing
you can instantly see is if you're a
member of the public who really doesn't
know about this data that's a very
complicated set of folders and
structures and the icons with the the
circles and the holes in them if you
haven't used Google Earth a lot you
don't know what it is so my version I
just simplify things and you can see in
the places column there I've just got a
set of very simple layers to click
through so I'm standing up here talking
about design but there are a lot of
things that Treves does not understand
there's a lot of things I don't get and
the central thing is my criticisms when
I talk about these things when I write
about these things on my blog I'm
drawing analogies from web design and
from static graphic design and applying
them to the Geo web I'm not sure that
works I'm not sure you can do that
straight off other things is if you
improve the design in the ways I've
described does it make it for the users
or more memorable thing does it make it
more interesting does it mean that to
spend more time on the site looking at
it all these questions I don't know so
I've been in negotiations and I've now
just got a fellowship sorted with splint
which is a consortium of British
universities and we're going to
investigate some of these things and
answer some of these questions so to
conclude that's my blog that's the
address in my blog if your interest in
reading any more about this first of all
I was talking about just because we can
doesn't mean we should and I went off on
a tangent and talked about polygons and
how I think there's something that we
should be using more of in Google Earth
and then I said that the central thing
we have as a challenge in the 21st
century's climate change in
communicating the science of climate
change and I compared really the old
wrong right phases of some technologies
and I said just as digital watches have
largely disappeared the ones that you
have to press to see the time so I think
we've got a phase here of design and
people not understanding design well in
how to communicate with the public
particularly using tools like Google
Earth and really the last thing it I'd
like to return to what David
Attenborough said and if you remember he
said we live in a greatly imperiled
world and we have in Google Earth a
weapon of unparalleled value for
tackling that and defending that
imperiled world and my point I think
essentially that now we need to learn
how to weigh in that weapon that's me
the sort of lost period
by extrapolation yeah the question was
as I mentioned the Lost Decade of the
web are we in that now and is a lack of
technical tools and direction
documentation of how to design thing I
think I think you're exactly right I
don't think we're actually lacking
technical instruction and technical
tools I think they're all out there but
I think you're right its lack of
documentation and I hope my blog is
doing something about that is i'm
talking about that but yes I think I
think it's definitely a phase I think
we're going to go through it and what I
think is we are going to come out the
other side but I prefer to get out there
before 10 years is up it'd be nice if we
went through in five years so okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
