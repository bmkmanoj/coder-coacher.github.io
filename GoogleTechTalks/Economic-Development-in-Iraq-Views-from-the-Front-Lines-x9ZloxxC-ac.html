authors at Google Talk and we're very
pleased to have ambassador charles reese
join us for a discussion today he will
be discussing his experiences in Iraq
experiences as the minister for economic
affairs and coordinator for economic
transition in Iran and he was based in
the US Embassy in Baghdad and he'll be
talking about some of the I imagine some
of the past and present actually I'd be
posting on president future but I'd be
glad to talk I tell war stories if
anyone really wants to hear them yes
excellent so please join me in welcoming
Charles Reese thanks very much and I'm
delighted to be here I'm especially
delighted to be out of Washington where
there are six feet of snow in my in my
front yard I thought I would talk today
about the Iraqi economy its progress and
its problems you may know from reading
the newspapers I'm sure you do know from
reading the newspapers that were now a
month away from national elections in
Iraq which will be on March seventh and
although the formal Campaign just really
started last week partisan politics has
been on the minds of Iraqis for six
months or more first there was a
struggle about the terms of the
elections law a major step forward was
taken when the Iraqis agreed to hold
their election on an open list model
rather than the closed list bottle that
they used for years ago and that should
allow for campaigns by individuals
rather than by parties and perhaps some
connection between the politicians and
the services that they give then there
was a fight about how the seats would be
distributed particularly having to do
with Kirkuk which is a city on the
borderline between the Arab part of of
Iraq and the Kurdish part of Iraq and
then the Sunnis which are a minority but
used to run Iraq and they thought on
most Hussein days objected because there
were no seats allocated for Iraqis
abroad many of whom
Sunnis so all those disputes got settled
before the first of the year in an
election was called they increased the
number of seats to make everybody happy
but more recently and much more
worryingly some 500 candidates that had
filed to run in the election out of 5
out of 3,000 some fifteen percent of the
total were disqualified by a Shia run
Commission on the basis that they were
too close to Saddam Hussein some of them
have been reinstated but several
prominent Shia several prominent Sunnis
who are actually part of secular
coalition's have still been disqualified
and the Washington Post led their paper
this morning with a story that in some
mixed neighborhoods or hsieh
neighborhood Sunnis are once again being
intimidated by people in the middle of
the night perhaps a revival of sectarian
militias so welcome to a election
campaign iraqi style now what i find
interesting about all of this is that we
have no one in iraq is really talking
about the election issue the economic
issues in the election and why is that
why how is the economy doing and what
are their prospects for the next few
years and can iraq emerged from the war
and the insurgency with an economy that
can compete and grow and what are the
key decisions that the government the
next government will be making so let me
start out by pointing pointing out that
since the 2007 surge economic growth in
iraq is actually been quite good by both
regional and global standards the IMF
estimates that Iraq saw four point three
percent real growth in 2009 that's of
course half what the the nine point five
percent that they had in 2008 during the
mini boom that they had when oil prices
went through the roof but still quite
respectable in the fourth highest rate
of growth in the Middle East region for
2010 Iraq is expected to grow at five
point eight percent which we would take
very easily here and is in the Middle
East region only the
government of the country of Qatar is
expected a higher rate of growth and
with all this growth inflation is is up
slightly to about seven percent but it
expect the IMF again expects it to stay
in this region in 2010 and the hot near
hyperinflation of 2006 when prices in
Iraq were up over seventy percent that
year mainly driven by the insurgency in
the inadequacy of goods because they
were getting blown up that is about a
distant memory the Iraqi economy however
is still state dominated and state
controlled more than eighty-five percent
of the banking systems assets are in
state banks and the two largest of them
are insolvent because of bad loans that
they had undertaken under Saddam's day
and government spending represents over
half the gross domestic product but that
said the private sector is not
insignificant has been growing as the
Iraqi contractors snag reconstruction
contracts truckers move goods markets
reopen having beaten inflation the
central bank is now driving down
interest rates to encourage lending is
in the private sector and private bank
lending has been growing quickly a total
private bank lending from mid-year 08 to
mid-year 09 was 575 million dollars
still a drop in the bucket at an 83
billion dollar economy but moving up
very quickly in forty percent or so a
year so the central government and its
budget remains the single most important
economic variable and unfortunately the
oil price fluctuations determine the
central government revenues and lead to
boom and bust planning in 2008 anxious
to move the rapidly growing oil revenues
out into the economy Iraq with our
strong support approved first the fifty
billion dollar budget and then a 22
billion dollar supplemental for an
increase of over fifty percent in
spending over the year before 2007 no
wonder the economy boomed but much of
the spending was oriented toward
salaries and and operations rather than
reconstruction capital investment in
infrastructure and the spending rates
were very uneven through the year so in
reaction to the fall in oil prices the
government of Iraq adopted a tight
budget for 2009 and implemented a hiring
freeze which really affected the
security sector after rapid growth in
2006 to 2008 there were no new recruits
in 2009 into the army or the police
forces and training and equipment
continued to improve the quality of the
force but the actual numbers have have
stabilized so what does all this mean
for an average Iraqi Iraq's improving
but still tenuous security situation
makes reliable numbers really kind of
hard to assemble but ran conducted an
in-depth survey in 2008 of households in
the on bar province that is suggestive
of some real progress our questionnaire
sought to revisit the questions asked in
2004 by UN Development Program survey
all the respondents in the in our survey
reported average monthly incomes up
considerably moreover since the dinars
appreciated against the dollar and
almost all the consumption goods are
imported the spending power of those
incomes increased even more one way we
can see this is through the ownership of
consumer durables in 2004 ninety percent
of on bari households reported that they
had a television in 2008 nearly a
hundred percent of households had them
in 2004 eighty-seven percent of on bari
households had a refrigerator pretty
important in the desert and now 92%
happen but perhaps what's most striking
is how quickly Iraq has entered the tech
age in our cert in our study fifty
percent of on Bari households claimed
that they owned a computer and and with
19.5 million cell phone accounts in the
country cell phone subscribers on three
national networks there is nearly one
hundred percent penetration of us of the
adult market for cell phone connections
now that last finding
feels completely right to me because if
you go through an Iraqi market you'll
find as many people chatting on cell
phones as you'll see chatting and
texting here in Santa Monica Iraqis are
quite poor they have a per capita income
still only of 3,300 dollars and by some
measures unemployment and
underemployment constitute perhaps fifty
percent of the workforce yet our on bar
study showed that nearly a hundred
percent of the samples males 25 years of
age or older we're engaged in some form
of work rarely wage labor forty percent
made their living as tradesmen such as
carpenters two Mason's twenty-one
percent in retail mainly Manning a
market stall or a sidewalk vendor and
thirteen percent of our sample worked in
the government sector including in the
police in the army now in cockies across
all income classes are unhappy with
state of services like electricity waste
water and sewage even though the supply
objectively speaking of all three has
increased since 2004 electricity is a
good case in point although power
production increased by nearly twenty
percent in 2004 in the face of a serious
drought which affected their hydropower
all these new refrigerators and other
consumer durables are driving demand up
just as fast so loadshedding blackouts
do continue all across Iraq the root
cause of the shortages is that almost no
one pays for public power Iraqis
actually use about the same amount of
power per capita as do Jordanians but
the Jordanians pay for it the Iraqis
don't which is what's driving the demand
growth looking ahead the most important
factor that will affect the Iraqi oil a
day rocky economy is the 2010 budget
since the state is so large in terms of
the economy late January the Iraqi
parliament approved the new budget set
federal spending this time of 72 billion
dollars and putting aside the anomalous
oil boom year of 2008 the 2010 budget is
or it is it is coming back on the form
of
a trend of increasing spending by about
twenty percent each year since 2007 now
as I noted almost all of Iraq's revenue
comes from oil sales and the budget is
based on a conservative estimate of
sixty two dollars and fifty cents a
barrel for oil and exports a little over
22 million barrels a day 2.15 million
barrels a day so on this basis the 2010
budget has a projected deficit of about
19 billion dollars although if oil
prices end up higher than the 62 dollars
a barrel the deficit could be less and
this deficit will be covered by an IMF
loan they're really their first since
the US intervention in 2003 and some
domestic borrowing and by running down
their unexpended balances from earlier
in the decade so one of the most
interesting aspects to the budget is
that for the first time it gives a one
dollar a barrel fee to the regions that
are producing more than a hundred
thousand barrels a day of oil this is a
big boon to the province of Basra in the
south and the province that Kirkuk in
the middle of the country but it and
should be popular local governors and
and communities should we make it much
easier for foreign companies to come
into the to the country and work in oil
development the 2010 budget also
represents a significant shift in
priorities for Iraq from guns to butter
the budget basically holds security
spending roughly constant and makes a
significant increase in capital
reconstruction spending proportionally
security spending will decline a full
percentage point from 16.4 percent of
the budget to 15.4 the money will be
used to support the Prime Minister's
so-called poverty reduction strategy
with additional spending on water
environment health education youth
municipalities and Public Works all of
those will now move up by more than a
percentage point from nineteen point
three percent of the budget to 21.9 in
all the two thousand
in nine budget the 2010 budget should
drive continued economic growth and if
the projects are implemented it should
support a continued slow but significant
improvement additional improvement in
most services a metaphor for Iraq though
I think is that of a man swimming to a
life preserver in choppy seas the
country is kicking hard but reaching the
safety of the life preserver depends on
reversing the trend of slowly declining
oil production and doing so before its
strength including the country's credit
we're even worthiness is exhausted that
is the significance of the oil contracts
that have been concluded by the Iraqis
with BP Chinese national petroleum
corporation ExxonMobil Occidental shell
and others these contracts will help
attract more than double its oil
production perhaps to as much as six
million barrels a day in five to six
years now it's also important that
Iraqis found their own way to bring in
foreign investment and expertise many
Americans and other international
experts had advised the Iraqis to
conclude production-sharing contracts
which are widely used in other OPEC
countries the advantage of
production-sharing contracts is that the
foreign company can acquire a property
interest in the stream of production
that it develops through its investment
companies then can book the reserves
it's an asset which reduces their cost
of capital but to Iraqi oil minister
char Istani that looked too much like
foreign ownership of Iraqi oil and even
if it had had the support of the
government it would have been a really
tough sell in the Iraqi parliament so
the Iraqi approach was to invite
companies to compete for the right to
improve production through technical
service contracts transparency was
achieved by making competitive bids in
public in a ceremony televised to the
entire nation the June in December bid
rounds and subsequent negotiations
actually revealed that companies were
willing to take on several of Iraq's
bigger existing fields for less than two
dollars a barrel and to offer to finance
the capital costs to this is a much
better deal for Iraq than many
birds had predicted on this basis BP and
Chinese national oil corporation agreed
to increase production from Rumaila
Iraq's largest field from less than 1
million barrels a day to 2.8 5 million
barrels a day in five in six years even
if the oil majors help Iraq make
short-term gains in oil production
however the short-term economic disaster
could loom if Iraq stew channels for oil
exports are compromised in the south
well over a million barrels a day is
exported from an offshore oil platform
known as a bot the two underwater
pipelines that feed a bot are well past
their design life and cannot even be run
at higher pressures the good news is
that the Iraqis are contracting with
Foster Wheeler UK to replace the two
pipelines and to add single point
mooring systems to be able to increase
tanker loading capacity if all goes well
the new pipelines and mooring systems
could be an operation by the end of 2011
which would provide much-needed
redundancy and increased capacity to
Iraq and security to world oil markets
in the North all the oil exports from
the Kirkuk field must go through the
northern oil pipeline to Turkey this
pipeline was interdicted nearly
constantly from 2004 to 2007 when an
arrangement was reached with the tribes
along the group the smooth functioning
of the northern pipeline ever since at
about 300,000 barrels a day has
contributed some seven to eight billion
dollars each year to Iraq's revenues but
the pipeline's first hundred kilometres
remain very vulnerable to continued
vaalu to renewed violence and are
inherently hard to predict to protect
over the medium-term Iraq will need to
add redundancy to this pipeline route
also now I'll leave aside the tangled
web of arab kurdish struggles for
control of oil development in Iraqi
Kurdistan which is held up the
hydrocarbons legislation no one gets
rich by being an optimist on that
although the sustainability of the
present ad-hoc arrangements is very much
in question
for now in Iraq most assume that the
Arab Kurdish oil arrangements will be
one of those issues to be resolved in
post-election government formation
negotiations so to sum up the oil seen
oil exports are as vital as ever to
Iraq's future and there's some genuine
good news on the contracting front how
this new realism will be affected by the
national election in its aftermath are
uncertain and on the security of Iraq's
physical export channels there are some
good news in the south but continued
vulnerability in the north and the need
to increase capacity is really quite a
virgin given the expected increases in
production if they are going to produce
six million barrels a day in six years
they need to be working on the problem
now that's also true for natural gas
aside from oil there's been some
important move in the foreign investment
front just before Prime Minister Maliki
led a delegation to a mid-october
investment conference in Washington the
Iraqi parliament passed an amendment to
the foreign investment law to allow
foreigners to own land to develop
housing as but has been done
successfully up in the Kurdish region
this is good news especially if it
brings capital from the rest of the
Middle East to the labor-intensive and
politically important housing sector
less commented upon though is a
provision prohibiting foreign investment
in land on speculation that the value of
the land will increase although perhaps
motivated by concern to ensure that
investors actually build this provision
could well lead the arbitrariness and
uncertainty in the application of the
reforms now while Baghdad has seen many
trade investment delegations from all
over the world I suspect that political
factors weigh heavily on the minds of
investors especially these days with the
if the national election next month
produces a credible and broad-based
government dedicated to economic
development and integration foreign
investment in Iraq would likely grow
quite quickly among the sectors of
interest are agribusiness construction
telecom transportation hotel and
hospitality services and of course oil
and gas
equipment and service support but Iraq
has a number of problems even beyond
political stability and security that
will affect its ability to attract
foreign investment the World Bank ranked
Iraq a hundred and fiftieth in the world
in the ease of in the overall Ease of
Doing Business even in the Middle East a
region that includes countries like
Syria Sudan Djibouti and Egypt Iraq did
poorly ranking overall 16 out of 20 Iraq
seems to be standing still on board
going backwards on most doing business
issues nevertheless there has been some
improvement Iraq moved up 10 places
worldwide on the reliability of
enforcement of contracts and to senior
officials trade minister soudani and
deputy transportation minister al-obeidi
were arrested last fall on corruption
charges which is the first so again a
mixed picture to other serious clouds on
the economic horizon I wanted to mention
first they Iraqis have taken an
important step forward in settling their
Saddam era external debt by agreeing in
November with China on eighty percent
debt reduction which was agreed standard
by the Paris Club of donor nations of
the major creditors only saudi arabia
and kuwait have yet to agree on debt
reduction with Iraqis but even agreement
on debt reduction from all credit even
with agreement on debt reduction from
all creditors Iraq is fast approaching
the end of its grace periods under the
Paris Club agreements and we'll have to
start servicing it's rescheduled and
reduced debt the IMF estimates that the
servicing obligations will be half a
billion in 2009 and 2010 but will jump
to 2.4 billion dollars in 2011 and 3.2
billion dollars in 2013 even out
calculating the cost of servicing the
new debt that they're starting to
contract this year and there is also the
economic impact of our departure I don't
think there has been any recent attempts
to systematically assess the macro
economic impacts in Iraq of the u.s.
spending but the trend in
our spending is already sharply down and
the magnitudes are significant and will
be more so this year US military's joint
contracting command for example
implicated in 12 months ending September
2009 it had spent 941 million dollars
almost a billion dollars on contracting
for goods and services within Iraq and
this is only one part of the of this
money being spent by the US military in
Iraq and that billion dollars was less
than half of what it had spent the year
before even so though it represents one
percent of Iraq's entire GDP another way
of looking at the impact of us spending
and the Iraqi economy is through
employment the end of november the u.s.
embassy estimate was that the Iraqi
employment related to US civilian and
military assistance programs was 88,000
people but since then two-thirds of
those temporary jobs have ended and many
of the rest will phase out with our
military's withdrawal if all goes well
continued increases in government
spending oil non-oil private investment
in oil development will offset the
macroeconomic effects of our withdrawal
but it's something to keep an eye on so
all in all if there's stability on the
political front a credible election and
decent security all big IFS all of these
economic problems can be tackled at the
household level the economic situation
many Iraqis has been improving
significantly electricity production is
up more Iraqis have water and sewage
than ever before and the much-maligned
public distribution system delivers a
monthly food package to most Iraqis in
the long term the resource base of the
economy petroleum mineral and
agricultural is good foreign investors
are taking note and some particularly
from the nearby countries of the region
are beginning to enter the market
world-class international oil companies
have agreed to double production from
Iraq's aging oil and gas fields so to
get back to my original question are the
Iraqis better off economically than they
were four years ago I think the answer
is yes all
Iraqis themselves saw their situation
deteriorate dramatically in 2006 and
early 2007 before getting better and
rent and polls including our own at ran
show that most Iraqis remain very
unhappy the state of basic services jobs
and economic opportunity for these
reasons Prime Minister Maliki may have
decided that running on a chicken in
every pot platform is risky so too is
running exclusively on the basis of
improvements in security as that's
vulnerable to suicide and truck bomb
horrors that still sadly daily affect
affect Iraqis daily life and that may be
part of the origins of the present focus
of the XI establishment on fear of baths
the bath is under the bed over the
longer term provided that the strains of
the election and the transition to the
next government don't stimulate a
widespread return to violence and the
Iraqi security forces managed to
continue to improve without large
without the presence of US combat forces
I think Iraq can look forward to steady
economic progress it could be better
than steady if the new government takes
on economic sensible economic reform
steps but for now as a one commodity
country emerging from a near Civil War
there are still very substantial medium
term risks so the swimmer is getting
closer to the life preserver but the
seas are still rough thank you very much
for having me here and I'd be glad to
answer any questions
you mentioned some aspects of Iraqi
economy in the last couple of years I
was wondering if you could put it in
perspective and compared to the size of
a rocky economy today to the size of
rocky economy just before American
invasion it is it is bigger the the size
of the Iraqi economy just before the
invasion is hard to figure because the
the it was it was a it was an economy
that wasn't really functioning as such
the if you look at the physical
production of delivery of food in
production of say electricity we the the
economy today is about ten or fifteen
percent higher than the economy was in
2003 if you look at a whole range of
other indicators there's considerably
better than that that said there were
some very strange aspects to the economy
in last four or five years of Saddam
there were huge state enterprises which
didn't produce anything there were just
ways to keep people happy or at least a
tolerably non revolutionary and the the
the strange aspects of the operation of
the awful food program the way that
Saddam managed to peel off kickbacks and
money that he was using to build his
palaces and so forth actually deprived
the country of much of the benefits of
the oil exports that they were able to
make and the the the volume and variety
of goods available in the markets was
sharply down if you talk to Iraqis about
the situation say after the surge 2007
2008 the thing that they talk about the
most is the markets the bazaars where
suddenly there's riotous profusion of
goods almost all important many of which
many of them from Iran and China
but the Iraqis didn't use to have the
choice of four different pails and mops
to buy or eight different sources of
saffron for their for their cooking they
do have that now so the in terms of the
sort of gross domestic production is
measured in terms of actual things you
can count and track up but not
substantially in terms of choice and
dynamism the economy much better than
that I still want to put it in
perspective so it might be that monetary
value of economy is hard to compare what
it is right now and before American
invasion but maybe some other aspects
are easy to compare for example
availability of electricity is it better
now than just before yes it's it
surpassed pre it's it's passed in 2007
pre pre invasion levels but there was an
initial deterioration whereas the
insurgency took hold and there were
attacks on transmission and production
stations electricity in 2004 2005 were
what the production delivery was down
one to thirty percent but it's now
surpassed the the pre-invasion levels so
a question I have would be so it sounds
like from your previous description that
Iraq pre-invasion was state dominant but
it dominant i guess in a strange way and
it's state dominant now right on how
does it compare to other economies in
the region and I guess is is there
compelling evidence to suggest really
that there will be a I guess maybe a
substantial reduction in sort of how
important the state is in economic
activity a good question and it is it is
it is still a state dominated economy
because of the revenue stream the the
virtually all of the revenue for the
government and for the and half the
revenue for the entire country come from
oil exports
and those oil exports are organized and
sold by the government now with some
some foreign expertise on a service
contract basis there is growth actually
quite rapid growth although from a low
base of the private sector the bizarre
ease the the little manufacturers the
and and revival the agriculture sector
which are critical to the long-term
health of the economy what where it will
go will really depend on the policies of
the next government the government that
will be elected next month or the
members the problem to be elected next
month and then we'll have five or six
months of government formation
negotiations and whether or not they
seriously are willing to undertake
economic reform the hardening thing I
think about what's been happening is the
expansion of the private credit markets
which is why I think it's something to
keep an eye on the private banking
sector and the degree to which they
actually lend money because in most
Middle Eastern countries private banks
actually don't lend they are they make
their money on fees fees for for for
services and to the extent that the both
the microcredit sector and the sort of
more conventional banking sector is
willing and able to make loans that can
help capital formation and new
businesses to get going there will be
certainly a lot of opportunity in Iraq
there is the prospect of very
substantial housing investment replacing
the maybe two or three million units of
housing stock that need to be either
built new or rebuilt because almost none
of that has taken place for five or six
years and it's a rapidly growing economy
and then the contracting that has been
done you know working for the government
but there's also private companies that
are establishing contractors we used to
joke and Baghdad that there was a guy
was an Iraqi very early on about 2004
who noticed that we were importing these
what they called T walls these big
20-foot tall anti-blast chunks of jersey
barriers and steroids that we were
putting around all of our own buildings
in the Green Zone so forth and he
figured out he could make them cheaper
that we were importing him from Jordan
and the Gulf and invested in molds and
you know equipment to cut rebar and so
forth and became the T walking quickly
you know got more than half the market
and you know in the bad old days T walls
was was definitely a growth market so to
the extent that that kind of happens and
the the cell phone companies are private
as well and actually quite a big part of
the private sector at the moment is
telecommunications that will that will
11 an otherwise state dominated economy
if you look around the rest of the
Middle East a country like Syria even
more state dominated some of the
countries like Algeria and Morocco have
also not been very successful it at
growing a private sector one of the
things that the Iraqis have compared to
some of the other oil-exporting
countries is that the Iraqis have not
lost as poor those people that have
suffered so much have actually still got
quite a work ethic and they are not
reliant on imported labor from south
after theta and I think that will stand
them in good stead as well other
questions hey I want to ask about the
education situation like has there been
a rebound in effectively human
investment like human capital investment
at the at the Elementary and Secondary
School yes quite a bit but not not yet
at the university level the Iraq and
Baghdad particularly used to be a center
for intellectual achievement in learning
in the Arab world and the just a
terrible deterioration security
situation and and Saddam also destroyed
the independent universities that had
made Baghdad great
one of the things is really important to
Iraqis has been the restoration of a
street in Baghdad that is known as the
street of the booksellers it's called
muta nabi Street and it's a street that
I don't like a place in cambridge or
London or something like that where they
just have antiquarian booksellers what
is the center essentially of the Arabic
world for books and marketing of books
and some of the insurgents set off
several bombs in that area back in 2006
which are just heartbreaking to most
Iraqis and so they were very cheered
when the street of the booksellers was
back up in business and apparently I've
been there lately but it apparently is
seeing a big revival and one can hope
that that that they will now with the
increased income that they should have
from from oil that they should deal with
the the challenges of reviving their
public universities Prime Minister
Maliki last year established a program
to send ten thousand iraqis a year out
of the country for university education
in order to import talent and expertise
from the rest of the world um how how
long will I racks oil reserves last you
know as a like a prime cornerstone of
the economy as long as long as as we can
foresee at the moment Iraq has a hundred
and fifteen billion barrels of proven
reserves but there's been no exploration
in the country since the 70s there's
been no exploration in the country with
the new technology no 3d seismic shot in
the country and unlike countries like
Brazil or Angola where the oil is
offshore and expensive in Iraq its
onshore and you know basically in in the
same the same producing geological
formations as across the border in
Kuwait and
and Saudi Arabia so the Iraqis depending
on how you can't have right now the
second or third largest reserves known
reserves in the world and they haven't
done any exploration in in this field
there's a little bit of a kind of a
debate about is are there big oil
reserves out in the West in Anbar that's
politically important because the Umbar
ease are Sunnis and the rest of the
country where the big oil is Shia in the
south the geologists I've talked to
don't think so that because of the way
that the uplift of the Arabian plate
goes the rocks in the West or older and
the Saudis haven't found any oil out in
the Western Desert so there's no reason
to think the Iraqis have a huge amount
of oil there however in the middle of
the country right up from Basra all the
way up to Kirkuk just that you can you
just look at the sort of the orientation
of the oil fields and they're just a
continuation of the same orientation in
the Saudi part of the Gulf so they will
have plenty of oil for a very long time
I mean maybe we won't be using oil and
they'll still have oil oh so caring
coming off of the earlier question is
are there any sectors of the economy
that you really expect could Eve ever
compete with oil as far as being a large
chunk of I think I think properly
managed agriculture because remember
this is the the land of the two rivers
and there is a tremendous resource and
in water that if you look at say what
the Israelis do with a very very much
less of a water endowment properly
managed drained done with drip and sort
of non evaporative irrigation methods
the Iraqis can have a world-class AG
sector for a very long time and the kind
of agriculture they can do can be very
high value they can do irrigated truck
farming flowers all these kinds of
things
of those fruits and nuts that take a lot
of people and are relatively high value
and that's the direction that they need
to go in or are they going in that
direction they are they are actually
we've put a lot of effort into trying to
improve not only the farmers the farmers
have problems they need credit they need
seeds they need technology extension
services all that stuff then you need a
grow business you need canning plants
you need poultry feed mills and that's
been a big focus for us in the last
couple of years okay thank you very much
thank you thank you should be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
