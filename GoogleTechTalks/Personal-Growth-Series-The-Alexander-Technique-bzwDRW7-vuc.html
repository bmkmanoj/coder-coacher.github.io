speaker today John Barron who is our
Alexander Technique teacher in the in
our school the first thing you may
notice about John is that he has a
British accent and that's how you know
he's trustworthy I mean I don't know
about you but laughter so I cannot not
trust somebody with their accent but in
in addition to his accent I found John
to be an amazing teacher he's very smart
very knowledgeable and he's very good at
guiding his students so if for those of
you who haven't already signed up for
the Alexander Technique course offered
by Google University which is taught by
John I strongly encourage you to do so
soon today and something or from John's
bio before I bring him up John has
taught the Alexander Technique since
1985 back when even I was young even me
now John has taught in Italy Germany
England and California he is the
co-director of the Alexander Technique
Alexander Education Center in Berkeley
California and he has taught various
workshops and in universities and
colleges including a credit class in Cal
State Hayward he divides his keenest HEC
program and an in-house a postural
re-education training program which has
been commissioned by various baracoa
operations including the fireman's fund
and beef pyro teaching a gentle
technique
John was a professional actor and the
founder of a publishing company called
marketing media and my friends my
friends please welcome the amazing John
Baron
okay hey thank you Thank You Mack good
so I wanted to cause to thank Meg and
also Google for organizing today's talk
and also for having the foresight to
bring the killer's tech project and
which is a program based on principles
of the Alexander Technique and to Google
employees so today's presentation on the
Alexander Technique is going to explore
the the scale of this work and begin to
look into its practical applications
wait before I begin I'm going to let my
neck be free my head be forward and up
my back lengthen and widen
in a minute stop
hey wait hold on
that would be great
mmm
okay so you you might be wondering you
know what's going on here you know we
just seen someone working at their desk
and dealing with some of the routine
tasks which while responding in a
slightly stressful way and you saw me
playing the role of the golfer
attempting to hit a ball it's a foam
ball by the way it's okay and over and
imagine bunker on to an imagined green
and while at the same time voicing a
typical in a dialog that's familiar to
golfers don't go in the bunker don't go
in the bunk hockey and then we we heard
someone playing a cello no rather rather
well I'd say and oh and incidentally
this this cello too is it's a 17th
century cello as it's an Amati cello and
played by the very world renown cellist
of the cypress string quartet Jennifer
Hudson so and at the same time we're
we're looking at this this poster on the
screen and we see that this is an
in-house poster promoting a course to
Google employees that brings the
Alexander Technique into a corporate
setting its sub headed personal growth
and pain management so apropos although
it's been known for a long time that
this educational method has has has
direct therapeutic benefits just last
month a detailed study on 579 subjects
published by the British Medical Journal
and it concluded that lessons in the
Alexander Technique reduced back pain by
85% and that these results actually
lasted
over a one-year period so that they're
the effects last long-term so extending
the the scale even further I'm now going
to read a couple of brief quotes about
this work first by a famous American
educator and philosopher then by a
well-known British author both of whom
worked with with Alexander and lastly by
a well-known actor okay so this is the
first quote so it the technique of mr.
Alexander bears the same relation to
education that education itself bears to
all other human activities and that's
John Dewey the second it is now possible
to conceive of a totally new type of
Education affecting the entire range of
human activity from the physiological
through the intellectual moral and
practical to the spiritual that's Aldous
Huxley and the last one the techniques
many benefits for actors include
minimize tension centeredness vocal
relaxation and responsiveness mind-body
connection and about an inch and a half
of additional height okay that's that's
carrying client so the reason I'm I'm
presenting the scale and the myriad
applications that this work has is is
twofold first to address a widely held
perception that this work is it's
something to do with with posture or
it's some form of body work and secondly
to help this audience understand that it
is not possible to package the the vast
scope and application this work has into
you know convenient sound bites or all
telling
definitions this work needs to be
experienced in order to be understood
this work involves understanding from
the whole self not just the
understanding that comes from being
given data and information to learn so I
don't wish to spend our time today just
giving you data and information about
you know the history of this work
because there's like 120 years of it all
about the amazing Freddy
Frederick Matthias Alexander I need not
tell you that you know all this
information it can be readily googled so
no however if you would like to find out
about how this work was developed I
recommend you read Alexander's book
which is called the use of the self and
it also is available on on CD so and
indeed what we what we normally break
down into separate segments of movement
emotion posture thought individual
spirit expression energy psyche
sensation voice gesture etc and how
these aspects are consciously embodied
connected and choreographed in the
moment can be characterized in the
Alexander Technique as the use of the
self so so what is it that connects us
now what centers and integrates us so
that aspects of our self and the freedom
of movement ease of expression
coordination balance appropriate degrees
of tension harmony well-being etc they
seem to come together in a particular
moment so how would our office worker
for example find this connection when
when dealing with the stresses the
stressors that create such strained
responses that we saw when she was
walking in you know carrying her laptop
and the foe
and having a cup of coffee and a hand at
the same time all activities that I I'm
sure you've seen on this campus a few
times people walking in embodied in that
particular way how might our golfer find
the connection that could take bunkers
out of play at least in his own mind and
our cellist if we imagine the connection
that's needed to bring to a performance
you know the technique interpretation
connection to other colleagues acoustics
find motor skills connection to audience
etc imagine bringing all this to a
moment in time making this this kind of
connection and when things do not seem
to come together what in what is it in
us that is aware of our disconnection
that's a big question let's start to
explore it practically and see where we
go in fact what I want to start to focus
on today is a very particular connection
okay that's the connection of the head
the neck on the back okay so we're going
to do this practically okay and I just
want now if I can have this side of the
room in a little while if I can have you
stand while the rest of this the rest of
us here observes exactly what happens to
some of the people here as far as what's
happening to the head the neck and the
back of this particular connection
because this is what we're just going to
start to explore today okay so if you
can just all stand like you normally do
okay okay
look and you just sit down like you
normally do okay all right so we're just
observing what's going on there let's
switch it around let's try this side of
the room okay yeah okay just to stand
okay the rest of us are observing what's
going on here okay and if you just just
sit down like you normally do okay so
what do you notice what happens to heads
necks and backs what happens to this
kind of relationship you see some people
when they they go to sit down they
oftentimes tighten the head back so the
head weight gets thrown into the large
neck muscles which tighten a lot of the
muscles in the back tightens the lower
back etc and other people do it very
differently some people have more
collapsed responses where the thought to
stand for instance has the weight being
thrown down and being being pulled back
up again because whenever we have a
collapse there's always an area of
tension as to support the collapse so
that the good news is that that although
tension over tension has a domino effect
throughout throughout the body
have we tighten here etc we're tighten
in other areas release also starts to
have a very positive effect what I'm
going to work with now is that I want to
have a couple of people come work with
me we've never had this work before so
that we can we can start to observe what
goes goes on there I know we had
somebody agreed to do this just before
so at least we had someone okay but
perhaps a couple of people is anybody
yeah please come great so yes thanks
right that was no problem okay good so
if you can I'm just going to have you
stand facing the cellist here you can
come over this side okay okay and we're
just going to observe this this simple
movement so called simple movement that
we do many many times a day just to see
what happens
em on incidentally this movement is just
it's just an excuse it's just an excuse
to study the principles of the Alexander
Technique
okay this is not I'm not about to show
people how to sit down and stand up just
for its own sake that wouldn't make much
sense okay but we're looking at the
connections and therefore we look at the
connections by looking at the disk
connections - okay so if you can start
you David you just come sit sit down
like you normally do you just face our
cellist yeah okay good
and just to stand like you like you
normally do okay great okay and just
come to the site then if we can have the
other two volunteers to do the same
please just come and - okay good right
okay okay and up we go good so we have
similar patterns going on here but did
you observe anything in yourselves about
what was going on with this connection
that we're starting to study this head
neck and back connection do we notice
what was happening so we have that
thought to sit down okay we have the
thought to sit down and then we have an
automatic response that's connected to
that and for a lot of people it's this
this tightening back and down because
there's tightening of the head what
actually happens when the head gets gets
tight like this is that it puts so much
pressure on - on to the neck and on to
the back and we start to develop these
habits and they start to feel quite
natural because habits feel natural but
when we start to see that we put this
much pressure on ourselves we start to
realize that our use the way we move the
way we express ourselves actually
affects our functioning because if we
keep ourself the spine so compressed
through the repeating these habits of
tension we've put too much pressure on
ourselves and things start to when you
put too much pressure on anything it
starts to break down okay so if we can
have you come back David okay you just
stand up as if you're about to sit down
okay good and if we just just face the
cellist a little more over there that's
it good enough for now what I'm going to
start to work with is
I'm going to start to to guide David
through this movement here because you
can't tell people how to do something
right when they have all that on top of
all the habits that put them wrong in
the first place we have to work with
undoing and when we undo these habits we
start to see that the good.you starts to
happen quite naturally quite easily okay
so can we put can you put your feet just
a little further apart for now again
this is not the way to do it so so I'm
going to start to put my my hands here
on this this area just where they just
right on the the spine goes into the
skull and what I'm working with here is
with my hands I'm giving David a
stimulus to help release this whole area
it's a very very very important area
okay so you saw before or perhaps you
didn't but that thought to sit down
produce that retraction of that head
back and down that puts a lot of tension
into us here and here okay so let's see
what happens if I help you to not do
that note I'm not trying to tell him how
to do something right but to recognize
how he's putting himself wrong okay okay
so I'm going to help you here and just
allow that neck to release good that's
it and just allow those knees to float
forward that's very good just let them
go good that's it let those knees go let
the knees go good and we stay there and
by not putting those habitual tensions
those habitual patterns onto himself
he's actually ended up in fairly decent
balance here so this again is this
connection this head neck on back
connection so I'm going to put the hands
on again here and we'll see if I say
today okay stand up please stand up
really quickly stand up yeah immediately
you see we see that thought that trigger
the thought and when we're studying
mind body connection we really want to
understand what part the mind is playing
in the moment not analytically but
actually in the moment what signals have
we learnt to just give ourselves
consciously or otherwise so that thought
to have to do something right that
thought to achieve a goal that wishing
that wanting that and that form of
pressure can actually put ourselves
wrong so instead of thinking that you
have to sit down I want you to think of
something else I want you to think of
allowing your neck to be free good and
allowing that head to release just in
that forward and up direction and I want
you to think here David good so the old
thought is that you go there right you
go that way and we get the the but going
backwards instead what we're going to
work with is that we're just going to
change that thought okay so sit down no
okay otherwise that were just throw into
gear that old response and instead we're
just going to think with my hands here
you're thinking up and the knees go
forwards while you're still thinking up
with my hands yes very good like the
neck go free good let the knees go forth
very very very good yeah and in this way
you don't have to think about posture
posture happens postures are and an
effect of the connection and it's this
connection that we're starting to
explore this head neck and back
connection which Alexander called
primary control in that this is an
integrating force it's like been bodied
integration and when we're aware of this
and we're aware of that connection and
therefore and also aware of the
disconnection so that we can easily
reconnect then nature nature does its
job we don't have to think about doing
posture right
the posture means to fix we want to get
away we want fluidity so I'm thinking
star and I'm thinking okay if I have
that thought stand up and just going to
say stop to that and instead of thinking
that way okay where the learned impulse
is to go there instead I want you to
think where the balance is which is up
all right and stay with my hands good
stay with her hands good good good and
we start to see that there's much more
connection there and you're starting to
explore the idea of using appropriate
force for an activity so we can tolerate
a certain amount of what we call misuse
you know as a certain amount of the
disconnection but not too much and the
more we're able to like take this little
example and you're using much much less
force and tension for this activity and
then you take it to all your other
activities more complicated activities
you know more fun activities or working
into the working environment that really
we start to use our or our awareness to
prevent a lot of unnecessary results
that come from disconnection gotta
thanks can we have someone else keep
tell me your name hi Vanessa
thanks good so can you just remind us
we're just going to go through this
process of setting down covered okay and
to stand good so I'm seeing quite a
using this part the lumbar spine okay
using that area there to tighten that
putting force on yourself there and what
we want to encourage is to undo that
some of that tension there and instead
we'll find that if we we don't tighten
here that the hip joints will just work
very fluidly good and just help me out
too if you can just put the feet a
little wider apart just for now okay I
start off this way but this is just for
it's more practical good so the same
thing you say I'm going to be thinking
just taking this movement here I'm going
to be thinking here
good you're thinking with my hands and
you allow the knees to go forwards
instead the butt back and the neck is
sweep over that's very very very very
good yeah and by not tightening these
areas posture happens so this whole area
of where the the spine meets the skull
is very very important and the more that
we we undo the tension we start to
connect to that awareness here so that
we're aware of the head being nicely
balanced on top of the spine but of
course when we when we become over tense
we lose sensitivity because it if over
tension effects that that proprioception
good let's put the features a little
Annie's just a little wider apart there
good good
okay Vanessa so my hands are there to
just help you think good that's it good
okay thanks okay okay let's just I'm
going to use you for another little part
of this okay and I'm going to borrow one
of the the chairs here and
good and we started to look at that
connection again this head neck and back
connection and I want us to understand
too that when that's happening when we
let that happen how that really is an
integrating principle and how the the
movement of the arms and the hands
readily connect to that so I'm going to
go through this little rigmarole here
I'm going to sit down okay and if I can
if I can get you to come and put your
hands on my shoulders okay I don't know
if would yeah most people can see okay
now if for instance I'm sat like this
and my spines balanced and very very
fluid I said when I when I come to make
movements with the arms and the hands
they connect to that just like it's
movable architecture and but when I
actually find myself collapsed I'm just
falling down a little bit here yes my
back's a little rounded and now I'm
going to just move my arms and put them
on the back of this chair okay
so that okay so what happens get it out
it tenses up right yes and if you put
the hands back again okay now I'm going
to do another thing I'm going to do the
thing that people have been told to do
which is sit up straight which ain't a
good idea okay look what happens if I
stiffen the spine a lot of people might
think that this is good so called
posture and now I come to move the the
arms again what happens it tenses up
again so but a lot of the time you see
people are moving from these extremes of
over tension and over collapse and what
we want to become more and more aware of
is our use how we use how we move how we
express ourselves let's try something
else if you put your hands on my
shoulders here okay now that I'm
connected a little more to
this head neck and back connection to
the fluidity of the spine I'm going to
put my hands on this chair just there
okay and I'm going to pick this chair up
like that okay and what did you what was
going on here just it's smooth engine
without tension right this is so
important for people when they're going
through an activity like our office
manager
hey thanks yeah thanks a lot so it's the
demands of working in an office it can
be easily dealt with but if we actually
bring these patterns of misuse these
these patterns of tension and / collapse
into like our modern-day environment
into the to the office worker we can
unconsciously be putting so much
unnecessary strain and stress onto
ourselves and it doesn't make a lot of
sense so what makes sense is to learn to
not do that to oneself okay so if I come
over and ask a mirror and so a mirror is
here to help today but she's also a
teacher of the Alexander Technique and
as some of you already know her because
she also comes and she's them a
kinesthetic trainer here and Amir just
tell us a little bit about your about
your own background and story
technique from a background in project
management I worked at a tech company
and I worked long hours at the computer
and let me demonstrate how I work long
hours at the computer I don't know if
you can smell you can see me so I would
start off trying to sit up straight like
John just demonstrated kind of like this
okay
very tense and then as the day
progressed I get tired that's
unmaintainable and I'd go someplace like
this and then I'd go someplace like this
and I'd find myself like this for the
rest of the day and as you can imagine
working like that for long hours is not
good for you and I ended up getting
quite a lot of shoulder and neck pain as
well as tension in my forearms and my
elbows and what put me over the edge was
when I lost feeling in my fingertips and
the the thing that got me functioning
again without pain was the Alexander
Technique because it taught me about
this head neck back relationship and how
important that is to maintaining poise
while you're working when I learned how
to coordinate that head neck back
relationship I no longer did the things
that we're causing me the pain so then
the pain went away and now I'm an
Alexander Technique teacher my story
tada tada good okay so we've been
looking at a relatively what seemingly
simple motion of someone standing and
sitting we looked at movements of the
arms and the hands and how the arms can
be easily integrated we've been looking
a little bit at the task of working in a
in an office dealing with you know
phones laptops etc etc and now we're
actually going to move on a little bit
more into what let's say very very
challenging
situations like playing a playing an
instrument in a performance and and
Jennifer who actually is going to be as
I mentioned before she is part of the
the Cypress string quartet and they're
going to be playing near here at the
Montalvo Center in a couple of weeks yes
you don't say a little more about that
actually we have a series at the
Montalvo Art Center eight concerts this
year late Beethoven and then some
contemporary works as well very
interesting it's not much bigger than
this so it's a wonderful place to hear
music
it's very visceral place to hear music
Saratoga so it's not that don't that
partly good so would you like to just
explain a little bit about how the
Alexander work and how this specifically
this had this connection that the works
given you and how that's that's played
for you in your in your work certainly
let's see I came to the technique
actually I found John Barron as my
teacher about four years ago I think
because I've been having some pain a few
not minor injuries nothing debilitating
but but but enough that it bothered me
and I wondered what was going on because
I felt like I was fairly tension free
when I played but yet these things kept
happening and if you all have seen tell
us to play very often you'll see that
when they play high or when they play
very passionately they're often like
this and this is a pretty standard look
but this is not a position of power
because you've collapsed your back and
so John I've been working a lot about
how to how to still stay connected to
the music and to the instrument and not
do that and allow the neck to be free in
the back to to be you know to widen it
and lengthen and still be able to get
around we'd be amazed at what you can do
without having to be that close to it so
that was my initial foray into the work
with John and then two years ago two and
a half years ago I was I was pregnant
and I actually worked with John through
my entire pregnancy I was touring up
until two weeks before I gave birth and
as you can imagine where the cello lies
that you know what do you do tell so I'm
it once a week or every two weeks or so
when I was in town I would work with
John and we would sort of manage to
figure out you know what the tendencies
are because for me what it's about is
what I tend to do if I'm nervous or if
I'm feeling out of balance which I
certainly did feel when I was pregnant
you know and there's all this extra
weight here woody what do you do so that
was maybe the most extreme you know use
I was learning about there so it wasn't
just up and down the cello his back was
nowhere it's as far as how do I move
around but in and then within a month
after I gave birth I was back playing
again and touring so again I had to
rebalance myself so it's not something I
learned very quickly it's not something
that's fixed because especially in the
you know the 40 weeks of my pregnancy
every week was different in terms of how
I was using my myself but I mean even
today it's it's every day feels a little
different and at least if I have tools
to sort of remind myself and I'm not one
of my favorite things about Alexander
Technique is the idea of end gaming or
not and gaining so if you're always
thinking well I have to do that and I
have to do that now I mean even when I'm
talking about that my body kind of goes
this way so okay I'm going to stop oh
okay I already feel better and then you
know task at hand here's what I need to
do right now good so that's just such a
good example of how someone makes this
work their own and how it is really
educational in nature yes you come you
work with it with a teacher and oh you
you're working here on campus within
this program but the idea is that this
is a self-care method so that you learn
to use these principles and adapt them
yourself to to your own lives I thought
that when you were saying - about the m
going through the pregnancy that was a
really interesting phase for us when we
were working together because that we're
really having to adapt very quickly to
the to the changes and and especially in
the you know the last trimester it was
really quite challenging so it's fun
would you like to say just a little bit
Jennifer - about the the technique in
terms of
performance anxiety and how you see that
for for musicians well when we get
nervous we tend to use our body and you
know ways that aren't necessarily
helpful I'm constantly surprised even as
much as I know now what I'll catch
myself doing I'm not breathing I had one
student once who didn't breathe whenever
she played and this was the you know she
didn't even notice she was doing it to
turn red you know it's just so coming
back to those basics of like wow what am
i doing I don't feel so well
oh okay if I stop and take a breath or
if I and it just helps to manage the you
know how you're feeling when you're
under tremendous pressure like that so
so I'm thinking about it quite
frequently but I also feel like I have
tools to do so like I know how to figure
out what to stop and what to use and you
know not that it's perfect all the time
there isn't such a thing right but um
but but that I have a better better
sense of what to do yell protection is
an endgame yes it is just trying to
achieve something that's that's not not
realistic
good okay um what I'd like us to do is
to even just put the cello safely aside
yeah okay and we're just going to go
back over here again to to the chair
yeah because with and I'm wanting us to
understand that this connection is very
very fluid and with with the challenges
one has to playing an instrument
especially at this level it's really
important that that one has that
fluidity and that ease so while we've
been working I'm just going to take
Jennifer to the chair here and
good so we might just move very fluidly
around around the chair here so that we
have that ease in that connection and
the the ease into the with the arms a
connection into the arms so it isn't
this is not about sitting up straight
that really is such as I mentioned such
a lousy idea it really is the idea of
connection in ourselves because the
awareness to that creates that
connection it's also not about just
letting go yes when I first came to the
work you know when you go for a massage
you want to let go but this if you let
go you fall down so you want to know how
to use use everything yes yes it's
exploring the tonus so really as
learning again how to connect into
ourselves so for instance if there are
certain passages which uncertain
positions on the cello which are better
served by coming a little more forwards
but certainly when we're playing up into
the high position it is better to be
able to come back but remember what we
were doing before about the shoulders
it's so important that they don't get
tight and elevated because otherwise as
well as it creating tightness in all the
extensors here and it also affects how
one feels it affects the agility in the
movement so we're looking for this
connection to just give us this use this
good use so I'm going around here good
that's it that's good so and now we're
just going to take that very nice use
into into a piece and this is going to
place a piece by corrado catheter
cassotto excuse me do you want actually
you can just face them yeah
and just play for them thank you
okay
you
you
my
Oh
Oh
Oh
ah
you
ah
her
Oh
Oh
thank you if people have any questions
I'd be very happy to address them
you know it's kind of nice not to have
questions sometimes just let just stay
with the music
how does this compare to in terms
have
there isn't still right you know I'll
still be managing things Oh could I
repeat the question
yes okay shot like an instrument in its
physical right so she would she was
asking me how it's changed for me over
the period of time that I've been
working with Alexander and that I seemed
quite fluid and has that changed and can
I play for more hours now or something I
think I'm just a little more aware of
when I've reached the peak of what I am
what I cannot do like I've I've had
enough for that time but as I get older
I think it's you know I kept thinking
it's going to get harder as you get more
and more tense and you get more set in
your ways
so this is definitely made me feel
younger as a player and more fluid
certainly and I can sit for longer and
play for I mean I'm often playing eight
hours a day that's you know it's not
that that's not a problem
I don't always love those days but but
that I can manage everything pretty well
or notice actually that's basic notice
notice oh I better think about that a
little more work on that a little more
or perhaps you know called John for
another lesson and say why does this you
know I can't figure out what I'm doing
here and he'll often bring you know one
idea to me oh that changes my whole
world when I started playing when I was
six so you can imagine I have habits
from a long period of time and you know
I've had all these great teachers but
actually the technique has taught me I
think more about how I use my body than
any of my teachers did why is my why am
i doing that with my foot I don't need a
foot to play that could be gone and you
know but obviously it's you know
contributing to something does that
answer your question yes
can you tell me more about published
spokes
and yes and yes he wants to know about
the published studies and this the one I
mentioned before has just been published
and by the British Medical Journal if
you go to Alexander study and be BMJ
it'll it'll pull up that study this
study was done by the Southampton
University and there have been other
studies done and smaller studies than
that in the past but that's been the
most major study so far even though this
works quite a bit 120 years old as I
mentioned okay
so well sure is that it
good let's end it thanks so much for
coming thanks a lot thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
