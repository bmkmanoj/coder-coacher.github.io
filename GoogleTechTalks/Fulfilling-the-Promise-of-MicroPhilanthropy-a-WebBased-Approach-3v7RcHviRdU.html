you how donorschoose.org came about and
then we're going to show you the front
end of our website and explain what's
going on at the back end explain a few
technology powered ways that we're
bringing donors to our website and then
ask for your help in spreading the word
and in helping teachers and students so
just to let you know how
donorschoose.org came about it was at a
public high school in the Bronx where I
was a social studies teacher for five
years and my colleagues and I saw our
students going without the books without
the art supplies that they needed to
learn we would come up with an idea for
a field trip we would think of an art
project that just needed certain
supplies we would come up with a science
experiment that we wanted to conduct
with our students but needed certain lab
materials and none of these ideas could
come to life because there were there
was no funding source we couldn't
innovate we couldn't bring our best
ideas for projects for resources that
our students needed we couldn't bring
them to life and in fact just to
underline the issue here public school
teachers in the United States spend on
average five hundred dollars out of
their own pockets on school supplies and
if you can imagine an average thirty
thousand dollar teacher salary which
after taxes maybe twenty four thousand
bucks spending five hundred dollars of
that on the copy paper and the pencils
and and some of the basic supplies that
your students don't have that's a really
big deal and so while my colleagues and
I were griping about that state of
affairs and talking about all these
projects we would do if only there were
there were funding I figured that there
were all these people who wanted to help
improve our public schools but as John
said we're getting skeptical about
making a donation that kind of feels
like you're just throwing something over
the wall I felt like people were getting
skeptical about writing a hundred dollar
check to a charity and feeling like it
went off into a black hole not
able to choose a project that they could
bring the life not really seeing their
dollars at work not hearing back from
the people whom they chose to help so I
figured if we could create this website
where public school teachers could post
classroom projects in need of funding
and where donors could come and choose
the classroom project that really spoke
to them personally and see whether money
was going know that their dollars were
spent as designated and hear back from
the classroom and thank you letters and
photographs then I figured my colleagues
and I would be able to go on that field
trip and give our students those books
and do that art project so created this
this rudimentary website teachers at my
school started using it started putting
up projects that ranged from a set of
baby think it over dolls which are
life-size life weight dolls that cry at
three in the morning and show a teenager
what it would be like if they had a kid
to a set of s80 review books to a quilt
making project and with my colleagues
starting to put up projects my students
volunteered after school every day and
they hand wrote letters to people all
across the country telling them about
this website where somebody with ten
dollars could get the same kind of
choice and accountability and
transparency that that a millionaire
gets when they're making a huge gift so
that is that's how the website came into
being for our first few years we
operated out of my parents apartment and
out of my classroom my students where
our staff members for years one two and
three and we expanded only bit by bit at
first we were open to new york city
public schools then we opened to North
Carolina than the Chicago than to the
Bay Area bit by bit and only last year a
group of Silicon Valley leaders got
together it was a vinod khosla of
kleiner perkins david Philo the
co-founder of Yahoo Pierre Omidyar the
founder of you bae Reed Hastings the
founder of Netflix that they formed a
group and provided the funding for our
website for donorschoose.org to open to
every public school in a matter
cut so we're now national and that's in
good part why we're really psyched to to
be here and to be showing you our
website so I'm Oliver I'm the
donorschoose.org CTO so the only way I
know how to talk about what we do is to
show you guys a demo really quickly of
how it works so up on the screen is the
donorschoose.org homepage here if you're
a user a prospective donor you show up
there and if we get really lucky you
might like the first project you see you
click on the big red button and you're
off to the races and with just a few
clicks you give us some info and you
input your credit card number and that's
it you've just helped fund a classroom
project and bring it to life for that
teacher and their students what I wanted
to also show you as you can imagine some
donors prospective donors as Charles
mention really like wrapping their heads
around exactly what type of project
they're going to support and so we
provide a lot of information for donors
to make the best decision and find the
project that inspires them the most so
for example someone might drill into a
specific project and this is an example
of what they'd see this is a you see
sort of front and center is a picture of
the classroom that was uploaded by the
teacher the text in the middle is an
essay that was written by the teacher
explaining what they need and why and
and how they'll put it to use and of
course in the upper right is in an
indication of how much money they need
and how much money they've already
received most projects are funded by
multiple donors coming together and what
I wanted to call your attention to is if
you look on the the left column you'll
notice sort of a whole bunch of metadata
that we have around each project so for
example we know what the poverty level
is in that classroom we know what grades
are being served by that classroom we
know how many projects that teacher has
gotten funded donorschoose.org this
teacher is seems to be extremely
prolific making great use of the site
and you can see she's had 25 projects
brought to life through the site already
and thank you punctuality and I'll get
to later you also see some sort of
taxonomic designations with regard to
what subject is the
so they've indicated this is a math
oriented project the type of resource
they're being received and a whole bunch
of other metadata when it was submitted
when it expires how many students will
be impacted how many instructional hours
it will deliver and whether the
resources were usable that's the will it
be used by future students and what I
also will show you is that in in the
case where we have a photo for safety
reasons which is something we're very
conscious about because we're dealing
with teachers and students of course we
don't show very specific location
information so at the lower left you see
it just says North Carolina but some
donors that you might imagine care very
deeply about which zip code they're
giving two or even which specific school
so for them we make all that information
available so I'm just switching to
another project where there's no photo
and in turn in the lower left you see
exactly where this information from and
where the resources will go so this is a
East Palo Alto school with a ninety-five
percent high poverty rates actually a
charter school as well which you can see
there and in addition one of the things
we like to do for our donors is provide
really granular detail on where exactly
the money is going so you can see we
have this thing called a project cost
report which is essentially an itemized
call it almost an invoice or a pre
invoice indicating exactly how the money
will be spent so you click on it it's a
PDF and it would look like this so for
that project the resources that the
teacher is looking to bring into the
classroom are all laid out here item by
item you can see the vendor that they're
coming from the price the quantity and
I'll scroll down and you can see all the
extra information that you would expect
to see the shipping charges and attacks
and payment processing fees and so on
now I'm going to do the the part of the
demo that everyone says you shouldn't do
but it's where you ask the crowd to
suggest a ask the audience to suggest a
search term because you know at all
times we've about between 12 and 13
thousand projects live on the site so we
actually have some longtail properties
going on and a lot of our donors can
search for very specific
big things that are meaningful to them
and find them so cross my fingers does
anybody have a search term that I can
put in and see if we can find a project
that would meet that criteria let's try
that so they're five actually this was
filtered because I was looking at a
barrier project so in just in Northern
California there's five projects
matching those criteria and if we dig
into them we could learn more about them
one thing that our donors enjoy doing is
in addition to just keyword search
they're able to make use of all that
metadata that I showed you before and do
very specific structured searches using
that information as well so what we just
searched for actually I accidentally had
the Northern California filter on as you
can see down here was poetry projects in
Northern California but a donor could
also say well you know I'd like them to
be in these specific subject areas or I
would like you know I'm today I'm
feeling generous I'd like to spend
between 100 and 200 dollars so they can
indicate that preference they could also
indicate the type of resource they'd
like to fund whether it supplies a trip
or technology they'd say I might want to
pile on a project that already has some
money attached to it they can pick the
grade level that they like to fund and
they can also indicate for example that
they might want to find a classroom that
is a high level of need we give them
very granular controls over geography
for a lot of folks giving in their
community matters a lot or giving it
another specific community for example
hurricane impacted communities is
important so a donor could drill into
just Northern California or all the
counties they're in or they could say
you know I'd like to give to someone who
is from Teach for America or they could
say I'd like to give to a magnet school
or a charter school or even a special
education project what we do after the
donation takes place is that for every
donor almost like your etrade account or
like you
B of A or wells fargo online account we
have a sort of a donor profile that just
they can see and we tabulate for them
all of the students that they've
impacted all of the hours of learning
that they've enabled we give them links
back to all the projects that they
funded they can review the cost report
for any of them and then we also do some
slicing and dicing of all that data you
saw before that we have for each project
so for example in this first graph the
donor can see the the distribution by
need of their gifts below that they can
see we've cut the data by the amount of
dollars against the grade level and then
also against the subject area and in
addition we provide them a geographic
information for the privacy of our
donors I didn't want to pull up just any
random account so this is in fact
Charles account and as you can see most
of the giving is centered in New York
City what we also do with this same data
is we aggregated and roll it up across
all of our donors and this is just on
the website for anyone to see and weary
crank the numbers every day so what you
can see is as of today in fact a very
cool mouse don't happen just a couple
days ago we cross the 20 million dollar
mark a total amount of resources
delivered through donorschoose.org to
teachers and their students and when you
think about the average project size
being about four hundred dollars and
being funded by multiple donors coming
together you realize this is sort of
real micro philanthropy at work so you
can see there the total dollars total
number of students impacted you can see
our year-over-year growth in the early
years out of Charles classroom we did a
lot less donation revenue that we've
been able to do in the last 24 18 months
and the same stats are here as well you
can see 46,000 projects funded the
breakdown by need the breakdown by the
same slice and dice I showed before
having to do with grades and subjects
and you can also see here where the
donations are coming from and this is
state by state so I don't want you guys
to think that there's somebody in San
Luis Obispo who's just doing all the
heavy lifting for California this is
that that big circle is at all of
California rolled into one and the same
information
what can actually be sliced by region so
I can zoom in and say hey for Northern
California which is a region we've been
in for a couple years now what's the
impact bin of donorschoose.org and
here's all the same information but just
for Northern California primarily the
Bay Area and I would say that that a in
addition to the choice accountability
and transparency we provide the donors
without question the coolest part of the
donorschoose.org experience for someone
who's giving is what we call the Thank
You packet and the way this works is
that after the project is completed a
packet is sent from the classroom to
through us to the donor and it's really
quite impactful I brought one with me
today to show you guys and what it
contains is this is sent to to the donor
and it's got an impact statement from
the teacher saying how the project went
and how the students are reacted to it
it also has the cost report I showed you
earlier sort of with the itemized
breakdown of where the money went but
you know probably most impactful are
every teacher includes pictures of the
kids doing the project and then every
kid in the class writes a handwritten
thank you note indicating the you know
their gratitude to the donor for their
gift and this is really a powerful part
of the process as you can imagine a lot
of people get this go back and give and
I think what it does in addition to
really creating a personal connection
between the donor in the classroom is
it's a real strong sense of
accountability it's is a pretty darn
good chance this project really happened
if you're getting a letter from the
teacher and thank you notes from the
students and you're seeing pictures of
them with the resources in hand so the
for the donors we try to make this a
very simple and easy experience right
this is the consumer web and people have
a lot of things they could be doing and
we just want to make the seamless and
easy but behind the scenes there's a ton
of work we do to enable this we call it
sort of the general category of ensuring
the integrity of the philanthropic
marketplace and one analogy we like to
make with our small charitable
organization which is obviously a bit of
an aspirational analogy is that we think
we're sort of craigslist or
ebay type on the front end because we're
trying to make a market between teachers
and donors but in the back office we're
a little bit more like Netflix which is
that we actually have a lot of real deal
stuff and fulfillment effort that's
going on there in order to make the
marketplace work so for example we
screen and price every single project
that goes up on the side that means that
we've confirmed it's a real teacher at a
real school and also by validating the
pricing we've made sure that if a donor
says I'm giving $350 that it's not just
the guests from the teacher that that's
what it takes and that they might find
out the hard way two weeks later that
they actually need 450 bucks we've
priced it out so we know that $350 is
the right amount to bring that project
to life we also do all of the purchasing
in our back office we're not just firing
off checks to these teachers so well we
have a team that is is getting the
resources and getting them delivered to
every classroom so one of the things I
wanted to show you was for example what
that user experience looks like for the
teacher when a teacher is putting
together a project after they've written
the essay and indicated some basic
information they actually through our
site go into what I might call kind of a
multi-vendor shopping cart experience
where they're browsing around through
about 36 vendors that we make available
and they're picking out the stuff they
need this is does two really powerful
things for the marketplace one as I
mentioned we know the pricing is real
because they've actually found the items
and we've gotten the data from the
vendor electronically what it also does
is at the point where the project is
funded and it's time to deliver the
resources well we have a manifest of
exactly what needs to be ordered behind
the scenes there's a fair amount of work
that even takes place after the project
is funded which includes for example
distributing these purchase orders to
all these vendors keeping track of the
order status you know hopefully
something didn't get back order
something didn't go missing we then get
in voiced by all of these vendors and we
have to reconcile those invoices against
the
against the actual purchase orders and
then we have to pay them so I mention
all this you know not because it's the
most sexy stuff in the world in fact
it's really not and and I think if you
told Charles and and if you told me that
that part of donorschoose.org when we
first got involved was going to be
becoming near experts in eprocurement
and electronic invoicing we wouldn't
really we would have been very surprised
but the main message is that to do this
right and to really ensure that the
resources get delivered and to have
integrity in a philanthropic marketplace
we found that we needed to move this far
down the supply chain in order to make
sure that the classrooms really got what
they needed and most importantly perhaps
that the donor who has made a commitment
with their money is getting what they
paid for another part of our back office
operation is processing the Thank You
packets that you saw so of course we're
not sending the teachers a donor's
address so what we do is we send the
teacher a kit they take pictures with a
disposable camera they have the kids
right to thank you notes these are
coming back through our office we then
process them get the film developed and
route those back out now one classroom
project may have five donors so we're
then sending that out to all five donors
so we actually have close integration
with the US Postal Service fortunately
there's a large office of the Postal
Service right near ours but every day we
have these guys from the usps walk into
the office with a huge hand truck and
dump you know a lot of mail in our
office which is the feedback packets
coming back from the teachers all of
this in addition to getting the
resources where they need to go and
getting a thank-you packets into
teachers hands there's a couple
important things for the marketplace and
and as you guys know sometimes there is
an unseemly kind of underbelly to what
happens on the internet sometimes there
is some fraud and there's some folks who
might not play by the rules and what a
lot of these measures do is give us a
basic level of kind of anti fraud so for
example by screening the projects by
associating the teachers with known
schools by doing the purchasing by only
shipping two addresses of schools that
we get from the government we're able to
really ensure that
you know no funny business is happening
one other thing we do is when a when
resources go to a school we send an
email to all the teachers at that school
who are using donorschoose.org and say
you know great news new resources are on
the way which ostensibly is to you know
increase awareness and help make sure
that the stuff gets where it needs to go
but it also creates awareness that might
discourage someone from doing something
that's untoward in addition we send a
fax for example electronically to the
principal's office so that they know
that resources are inbound as well jump
in yeah for sure so one question that
may occur to folks is how we support the
this back office operation because
donorschoose.org is not simply a
Craigslist where teachers and donors are
connecting and and making an exchange
without our needing to do anything so
how do we pay for our industrial loft in
the garment district and pay for
operations well although we're a charity
donorschoose.org has a business model
and it centers on this option that you
see here which essentially invites the
donor to either dedicate a hundred
percent of their donation just to the
resources that they're funding it's
one-click easy for a donor to say I want
a hundred percent of my donation going
only to the bus company to the bus
that's going to take these students to
Washington DC to see the Supreme Court
argue a case but there's a second option
with a smiley face and this smiley face
is apparently persuasive because ninety
percent of our donors choose to include
a 15-percent fulfillment fee that covers
the work we do to validate the project
fulfill it process the thank-you package
and so as more and more classroom
projects get funded on donorschoose.org
we become increasingly self-sustaining
we're able to pay more of our rent bill
through donors inclusion of this
optional fulfillment fee and so actually
when those Silicon Valley leaders
provided our charity with this round of
funding it wasn't just to open our
website to every public school in
America
it was also with the expectation that
donorschoose.org would within just two
to three years be able to cover a
hundred percent of its operating
expenses through donors inclusion of
that fulfillment fee for us that
break-even point is when 50 million
dollars a year of classroom projects are
being funded through our site so then
the question is all right how do we get
to 50 million because right now where
this school year will do about 13
million next school year we're planning
to do 25 million how do we get to 50
well will rattle off just a few ways
that we've been using technology to
bring donors to our website one way
started with a blogger in Brooklyn about
three years ago this blogger does a blog
called tomato nation it's named after
the tomato tattoo on her forearm and she
does like a Dear Abby letter she does
Dear Abby advice writes about the
Yankees her readership happens to be a
little bit politically left of center
and so when Bush won re-election her
readers were really disappointed and
this blogger wanted to do something to
lift their spirits so she went on to
donorschoose.org and found a project for
a class set of George Orwell's 1984 and
she linked to that 1984 project from her
blog and encouraged her readers to
support it it was going to be a way to
make themselves feel better by doing
something good for a classroom but their
choice of which project on our site was
a statement about where they thought the
world was headed her readers her blog
readers funded this project in seconds
and so the bloggers behind tomato nation
went on to pick more projects on
donorschoose.org that she thought would
be really appealing to her readers and
she joked that her readers wouldn't let
her go to the bathroom for two weeks
because she would link to a project and
her readers would fund it and she'd
linked to another project her readers
would fund it and these readers were
mostly of not of great economic means it
actually had to wait until pay day
before they could make most of their
contributions because they needed that
paycheck to deposit it
to be able to make a donation so we saw
what happens with tomato nation and we
decided we should make that easier for
other bloggers to do so we created this
platform where a blogger can create a
page on donorschoose.org listing their
favorite projects or projects that they
think will appeal to their blog
readership so if I blog about
environmental issues I can create a page
on donorschoose.org featuring hiking
field trips and environmental science
projects and then I can put up a widget
showing progress toward getting all
those projects funded and most
importantly I can put my page in
competition with other bloggers pages on
donorschoose.org and we can see which
bloggers out there is capable of helping
the most students and inspiring the most
generosity from his or her blog readers
so last October we put this platform to
the test and we got TechCrunch and
engadget and kara swisher of all things
D and Fred Wilson of a VC and some of
the top blogs in the country to agree to
throw their hats in the ring create a
page on donorschoose.org featuring
classroom projects that would appeal to
their blog readers and have what was
what was referred to on all things d as
a blogger smackdown and in fact we did
get some smack talking michael arrington
of TechCrunch wrote a post saying that
TechCrunch readers needed to fund more
classroom projects than Fred Wilson's
blog readers of a VC calm and then Fred
Wilson had to talk smack back to Michael
Arrington about whose readership was the
most generous and who could help the
most students through our website and
that was really awesome and there's a
technology leader board that you can see
right there and for whatever it's worth
Fred Wilson managed just to barely edged
ahead the most interesting thing though
we had these amazing blogs raising some
real sums of money you see TechCrunch
raising eighty four hundred bucks from
its readers in gadget raising eighty
four hundred bucks as well
really really exciting but the big
surprise was how much tomato nation
raised so they had been the inspiration
for this platform a few years ago they
came back to participate in the blogger
challenge the bloggers told her readers
that she would dress up as a tomato and
dance through Rockefeller Center if her
blog readers funded all of the classroom
projects that she selected for them and
this blog read this blogger tomato
nation who has a tech narada authority
that is a fraction of that of engadget a
fraction of the readers of engadget in
TechCrunch she raised hundred thousand
dollars from her readers who again are
of really mixed economic needs and that
was fascinating us and here's sort of
one area where we'd love your thoughts
and advice for the next blog or
challenge we're trying to figure out
what are the other tomato nation blogs
out there that are capable of driving a
hundred thousand dollars of help to
public school students because it's
clearly not about readership because in
gadget and TechCrunch have way more
readers it's not about how many blobs
are linking to you because tomato nation
wouldn't really register it by that
measure either on is it is it about
blogs that still have a single voice
that are more like a diary and not so
much like a magazine with multiple
authors is is that what we should be
looking for should we be using the
number of messages posted by readers as
a proxy for engagement how can we find
the other tomato nation blogs out there
that we should really approach to make
sure that they participate in the next
blogger challenge and in fact it is
google that bestowed an award on the
bloggers who inspired the greatest
number of readers to get so as you guys
know sometimes when you build something
for one purpose it ends up being used in
another way that you never anticipated
and that's happened to us with the blog
or challenge we built this for the
reasons Charles described and envisioned
bloggers using it almost exclusively but
we've had some other organizations
essentially reaper
same technology for their means and so
for example there's a local organization
in new york city called mustaches for
kids they actually have a bunch of
different they do this in a bunch of
different cities so you might have heard
of them and the way it works is very
highbrow the way it works is that the
participants commit to a mustache
growing contest for one month they shave
their faces clean at the beginning and
then they grow a mustache for one month
and at the end have sort of an Olympic
style showdown to see who has grown the
best mustache and they have as you can
imagine a lot of fun doing it and in the
past they always raise money for in the
way they raise money is that the growers
go out and ask their friends you know
with the signup sheet to sponsor their
mustache it's kind of like team and
training but with less running and more
mustaches so that I'm just trying to
paint a picture and what's really cool
about mustaches for kids is that they
got excited about the challenge
functionality and said we'd like to use
this so that our growers and our donors
can pick the projects that the money we
raise goes to fund and so so so the New
York team got together and said we want
to try to raise twenty five thirty
thousand dollars and they did so and I
want to show you the picture from the
end of contest these are our generous
donors and so you know this is not the
picture these are not classic
philanthropists by any definition but
they had clearly a lot of fun raising
money in very small amounts and having
control over their giving what happened
next was the mustaches for kids group in
charlotte north carolina decided that
they wanted to try to one-up the new
york city group by raising more money
and also by using donorschoose.org to
give their growers and their donors
control over where the money went and so
this is their challenge and they set a
goal of 25 thousand dollars and not only
obliterate of that goal but are now over
fifty thousand dollars in donations not
all have cleared the site yet so this
was a really cool thing for us to see
because you know mustaches for kids this
is a very small grassroots you know
charity oriented or you know communal
organization that is some friends
getting together to do something
positive and they repurposed our
challenge functionality to help make
their experience via the web a better
one for their donors one more way that
we've driven donors to our site that we
want to tell you about that will
directly relate to to you and your
company and I'm going to do an
abbreviated version because we want to
get to the to this piece of technology
that we're unveiling where we need your
help and so I will simply say that
there's a wall street journal article
about companies giving donorschoose.org
gift certificates to their customers and
clients if we give you a
donorschoose.org gift certificate and in
fact we have a gift certificate for each
of you that you need to go spend and
when you spend this gift certificate
that we're going to give each of you
you'll be able to spend it on the
classroom project of your choice and
you'll become the honorary donor and get
to thank you from the classroom last
December Google decided that whereas
they had given a digital picture frame
to all 28,000 of their best advertising
clients in the United States last
holiday season this this holiday season
this past December google gave a
100-dollar donorschoose.org gift
certificate to the top 28,000 adwords
and adsense clients it was totally
awesome the redemption rate so
twenty-nine percent of Google clients
who received these gift certificates
redeemed them that is a record-breaking
the average use of coupons when a
supermarket gives them out is between
one and two percent when people go to
bestbuy or circuit city and they get a
cash back rebate only four percent of
people actually mail that in so a
twenty-nine percent redemption rate is
record-breaking and as a result of
Google clients spending their gift
certificates you to the next slide there
are 150,000 students in public schools
have resources who have books art
supplies field trips as a result as a
direct result of Google clients spending
their donorschoose.org gift certificates
on projects specifically on 5,700
classroom projects so thank you another
aspect of the way that we try to drive
awareness of donorschoose.org to help
bring teachers and and perhaps more
importantly for liquidity in the market
place prospective donors to the site is
an area that we've been focused on
lately and it's in the general category
of of what I might call notification and
syndication of our project listings so
one of the pieces of functionality that
I wanted to show you guys was our new
RSS feed functionality you all you all
know about feeds what we've enabled is
essentially a feed to be created for any
criteria of projects on the site so that
a person can subscribe and be notified
when new projects meet their criteria so
for example I'm going to select
technology resources that need between
one and two hundred dollars high level
of poverty and I'm going to set the
region to Santa Clara County
and these are the search results of
projects currently on the side so
someone might choose the fun days but if
they decided you know this is always of
interest to me I might I might be
perpetually interested in funding these
projects and I want to know about them
without having to go back to the site
which is exactly the great thing about
feeds they can actually just create one
so for example I can add this to my
google reader and now you would be
notified every time a project met these
criteria in addition what we what we've
done to even further extend this is to
enable the syndication of our the
syndication of our project listings and
we've done this using a very simple API
that basically would let any other piece
of software programmatically access the
projects in our database and essentially
opening up all these projects so they
can be viewed not just on our website
but essentially syndicated anywhere so
what's our hope for this our hope is
that there's some basic scenarios that
are simple and exciting like a school
showing all the projects from its
teachers on their homepage or a school
district showing all the projects from
its teachers on their homepage but
perhaps at the other end of the spectrum
are or even more inventive things that
that you know we haven't come up with or
we couldn't implement with our very
small tech team so perhaps somebody
mashing up our project listings with
Google Maps or perhaps somebody building
a Facebook widget to display projects
that a teacher has on their own Facebook
page in order to drive awareness of
their projects so this is very exciting
for us we only release this recently and
you know for for the engineers in the
audience we've tried to build this in a
way that you know we we've adopted a
very universal format and it's easy and
essentially you could you could do this
server side by pulling data in where the
JSON parser or you can even do this in
the client because it's javascript-based
so that would enable cool mashups or
something that's sort of very dynamic in
the client experience one other thing I
wanted to mention you guys to give a
picture of our organization is some of
the tech infrastructure challenges we
faced as a
small business small charity trying to
operate at scale on the internet we've a
pretty modern technology stack we use
linux and apache and tomcat and spring
MVC framework and we have Postgres
database and decent machines running all
this but nonetheless big spikes in
interest due to media exposure in
particular have been really hard for us
to handle we were really fortunate we
were on ABC 2020 not that long ago I
believe it was October or maybe november
and then in December Bill Clinton
mentioned donorschoose.org on the early
show and in fact last October Stephen
Colbert and Craig Newmark from
craigslist got to talking about
donorschoose.org on the colbert show and
in all three of these cases suffice to
say a significant amount of traffic much
more than we normally handle I got sent
our way so I guess the challenge for us
that we wrestle with this is just some
stats from the colbert show and well
first of all let me point out that the
first bike is the East Coast airing the
next two spikes are the the showings
across the country and then what
happened with Stephen Colbert went on
vacation for a week and then rerun
started and it actually she the the
turns out his reruns generate a fair
amount of traffic as well what we
learned so so what's significant here is
that I don't know exactly Google stats
but when you guys have a big day maybe
you do to 3x your search traffic or
traffic to google news but in our world
we have a big day and we do 20 X our
normal traffic and in fact this is
Colbert when we were on ABC 2020 we
believe that number might have been more
like a hundred X but frankly it just
blew us away and we don't have the data
to show that the main point is simply a
you know what's the best way for a small
organization to handle the 99.99
percentile scenario will you get great
media exposure you want to be there for
those visitors but building out to
handle that traffic well that would
never make sense it wouldn't be cost
effective because most of the time the
overwhelming majority of the time it
would be wasted resources
and also just to be clear for the
techies out there we have a CDN we do
really heavy caching and and what is
actually punishing us is personalized
experiences like the my donor page and
transactions well which we do have to
handle ourselves so it's not you know
this isn't as simple as saying oh you
know we just need two more aggressively
cash our static stuff so one other thing
I wanted to mention is that a the this
and sort of great news and been very
reassuring to us the it turns out the
tech community enjoys getting behind
good causes and they've been really
generous to us so for example we benefit
from a lot of donated software and
services we have a procurement
technology that's been donated by or
Weibo which is your neighbor and
sunnyvale they build enterprise-scale
electronic procurement invoicing and
reconciliation software which is what
we're going to be using to address some
of the back office stuff that I
mentioned also we have donated bandwidth
from a CDN I don't know if those of you
know joel on software who's a popular
blogger but he's donated to us his fog
bugs software which we use as a bug base
and also for release management and that
in fact his suffer does such a great job
of email integration that we use it to
do don't a teacher facing customer
service that's how our staff interacts
almost like a CRM system with our
teachers so we've been really fortunate
in this area and also salesforce com i
shouldn't forget has donated to us
greatly discounted services of theirs
and of course google has made generous
donations to us not just the gift
certificates we also have a AdWords
account which has a significant amount
of donated dollars on it and also we
make great use of some free products
that you guys provide like Google
Analytics and also jot spot that we've
been using for 18 months so what we've
been inspired by is this way that the
tech community has gotten behind what
we're doing and we're hopeful that the
tech community also embraces for example
the new syndication the API the access
to our project database that we've
provided and can help us get the word
out and build awareness
and create innovative ways to deliver
our project listings to prospective
donors everywhere so I'm going to close
it and ask you any ask you for questions
that might be on your mind I'll just
close and saying that we're in the Kitty
Hawk stage of development we're on a
nice exponential curve of growth but we
have not figured out how we're going to
really get to scale how we're going to
help not hundreds of thousands but
millions of students in public schools
every year and we would really welcome
ideas and help in figuring out how
donorschoose.org can fulfill its it's
very real potential to help millions of
kids in public schools three ways you
can help one is just telling teachers
about our website all the teachers you
know all the teachers you come in
contact with second way is by spending
the gift certificate that we're going to
give you because that's how you can
bring a classroom project to life and
third I just wanted to reiterate what
Oliver was saying about our really keen
hope that each of you will think about
ways to to present and distribute and do
mashups with our project listings we
have no idea how our API it can be used
but we suspect that if you put your
imaginations to work with there might be
some some really cool things that flow
out of this and mashups and and and
project distribution that might really
impact the lives of a lot of students in
public schools so thank you so much for
lending an ear and we hope you've got a
few questions
we should sorry if anybody has to duck
out you please come up and or I want to
put this somewhere so it's not
distracting but please come up and grab
a 30-dollar donorschoose.org gift
certificate so you helped bring a
classroom project to life hey I think do
you want to go first then yeah or we can
repeat your question either one this is
really interesting I realize now that I
was aware of your site I think I have
friends who were actually teachers who
teach for america who use it but this
was a very great demo to me it raises an
interesting question though which is
sort of the critique of public education
you know the fact that what you can
channel so much money from private
donors to public schools isn't that
something that our school should have
any way and how do you address that
question yeah that's a fair question
opposed are we letting government off
the hook or are we enabling private
citizens to do what the system ought to
be doing for us it kind of boils down to
what happened in North Carolina when the
former governor Jim Hunt was going
through donorschoose.org projects from
his home county and he came across a
request for class set of dictionaries
and he flipped out that there was a
classroom in his home county that didn't
have any dictionaries and he called up
local school officials to find out what
was going on and to demand some change
and when we heard about that story we
decided to see whether that experience
that governor hunt had was
characteristic of our whole donor base
and it turned out that sixty percent of
our donors said that they were more
interested in public education reform of
the whole system as a result of their
experience on our website because for
them it was their first really vivid
encounter their first real like physical
awakening to what's going on in our
public schools and they emerged from
that website experience much more
politically energized civically
energized than if they had read you know
a statistic in a newspaper article and
twenty two percent of our donors said
that they were likelier to vote in an
election or in an education budget
referendum as a result of their
experience on our website and that's
what what gives us this dream of a year
or two from now
converting not just visitors into donors
but donors into civic actors and
inviting somebody who has funded a field
trip in santa clara county to click here
to sign a petition click here to tell
your elected representative about the
need that you've just discovered click
here to join your local PTA so we
actually see our website acting as an
energizer of the the whole population
especially those people who don't attend
academic conferences or don't even have
Teach for America friends really
awakening those folks to what's going on
in our public schools and in how the
government could do a better job of
providing public education well that was
seventy-five percent of what I wanted to
ask and that was a great answer it's
real concern of mine the other part is
what about having the students often
low-income students writing these thank
you's to these lady and Lord bountiful
who are providing them with things that
some of us think that the government
should provide has anyone have any of
the teachers or any of your staff or
donors expressed any discomfort with
that I understand your reasons for doing
so sure we suggesting we have had I got
an email from a donor on a week and a
half ago who was saying I don't want to
receive thank you letters for something
that I think the government ought to be
providing and that I'm providing as a
necessity we don't get that reaction
from our teachers in fact we did sort of
a focus group with our teachers a year
or two ago year ago and asked our
teachers if writing these thank you
letters was was a burden or distraction
from their teaching day and we had
almost this like near revolt from our
teachers who said that even if we were
going to throw out there thank you
packages they were going to send them in
anyway because number one it's a
wonderful teachable moment about the
importance of writing thank you letters
which is often the difference between
getting a job and not getting a job
after a job interview when you write
that follow up thank you note and number
two was a literacy exercise where
students cared a lot more about their
grammar and
writing than if they were doing a
homework assignment yet one more
homework assignment so our teachers
overwhelmingly have said that it's it's
a wonderful teachable moment we've even
some teachers who've had so many
projects funded and have had their
students right so many thank-you letters
that they started attributing
improvements and their students literacy
scores at the end of the year to all the
thank you notes that they wrote I don't
know if you'd add anything to that
Oliver but hope that sure
I was wondering if you guys have
considered targeting progressive sites
and progressive bloggers you're
mentioning tomato nation as an example
and wondering what the secret was and
not to stereotype but as you know
bleeding hearts tend to try to put our
money where our mouth is so sorry if you
guys are targeting them do we noted we
had we had daily costs do it do a nice
blog post about us but that actually
wasn't part of the bloggers challenge so
we'll take that as a note and go back
and and I also asked you for suggestions
of other progressive blogs we should
reach out to hi thanks a lot for coming
today my dad works at he's worked at a
bunch of different private schools which
are located a lot of poor poor areas
from newark new jersey to Harlem etc and
there they have a lot of teachers that
are working you know for very small
salaries not to mention the books and
all that resources very low obviously
the best place to start is at public
schools here and I agree with that I was
wondering if eventually especially
because a lot of private schools might
have a religious tilt that would
encourage donors of that religion for
instance do you see yourself eventually
expanding into that as there are
probably a lot of donors that would be
more willing to give to a school that
has shares their beliefs yeah well right
now we're open to as you pointed out
just to public schools and that includes
charter schools that isn't so much a
political decision to just be open to
public schools as an operational focus
decision and we are thinking carefully
about how to extend our platform not
just as to whether Catholic schools
would be the next best expansion but
also thinking about whether an extension
of our model ought to be to other
frontline public servants like social
workers or police officers or doctors or
two schools in another country and we're
thinking through whether we ought to
open source our platform or donate our
code base to some initiatives we can
trust to get the model right
we're really wary of licensing our code
base donorschoose.org itself expanding
would be the most aggressive way to
extend our platform and those are all
question marks I'm afraid we don't have
an answer yet on that front thank you
I'm another idea for raising funds a lot
of us support a political candidate but
aren't that exciting about giving money
for ads um to trash um say the other
democratic candidate um I I don't know
if you could have campaigns giving money
in honor of say um Barack Obama yeah
okay can't believe you're asking that
question that's awesome that you asked
that so we created we used the we've
never met before I never met before yeah
I Wow oh thank you for that um so that
blogger platform that we described we
decided to use it to create a straw poll
that makes a difference where you can go
on to Barack Obama's page and see
projects that we've put on his page that
resonate with his platform or with his
home state of Illinois and support a
project in and this in this candidates
honor and every donation that you make
pushes your favorite candidate higher in
this straw poll that makes a difference
now right now we have Stephen Colbert
actually beating all the other
candidates and beating them by a long
shot and that was in good part because
of the Stephen Colbert interview with
Craig Newmark where Stephen Colbert
asked all of his viewers to make him
number one in the donorschoose.org straw
poll that makes a difference though he
was actually out in front in the number
one spot even before he asked always
viewers 22 totally put him over the top
I can't believe you so there you go um
in Turkey talking about all the
behind-the-scenes stuff that you guys
are doing in terms of channeling the
resources from the donors to the
teachers it seems like you're making a
trade off for inefficient
to use and scalability with like having
that accountability for the donors and
if you do you think you're kind of the
peak balance there or have you thought
about making a trade off of being more
efficient and scalable with higher risk
potentially it's it's a really good
question it's something we wrestle with
I think that that they're there first of
all may not be an all-or-nothing answer
there may be ways that we decide that in
order to go from from 12 to 25 million
and to scale the fulfillment we have to
you know cut back a little bit on some
of the back office stuff so I think
we're always looking hard at that one
thing I will mention that we keep in
mind and this is part of our challenge
is that I think for many of us when you
operate as a consumer or even as a
vendor at a Craigslist or an ebay you
know it's a marketplace you you probably
know that one in 20 transactions are
going to go bad and someone's going to
run off with your money and that's just
a cost of doing business and it's it's
kind of akin to a real marketplace you
know where sometimes you walk home and
you get home and you open the thing up
and it's not quite what you thought and
I think people have a certain tolerance
for that in sort of purely commercial
buyer beware marketplaces and
potentially a different tolerance much
lower tolerance when things are
charitable or philanthropic so for
example one of the things we we worry
about is you know if we backed off some
of these measures and something were to
go wrong and that were to be discussed
in the media well you know people have a
lot of options for making gifts and if
someone reads an article and there's
some negative blog buzz about 10 one
teacher who wasn't really a teacher
because we didn't authenticate in that
way because we backed off it to scale
anyway so the answer isn't know the
answer is we're thinking hard about
those considerations but we're also
trying to figure out what's the right
balance because we think that people
have different expectations when they're
doing philanthropic things versus purely
commercial things
oh hey Oliver um have you considered
integrating with some of the activity
stream technology out there for example
the controversial beacon technology by
Facebook wondering if you have any
thoughts on that you want to share can
you tell me how it might work oh um well
when it when somebody contributes to a
project it would show up in their
activity streams so for example i log
onto facebook and see what my friends
are doing one of the items would be you
know greg has contributed whatever X
dollars maybe that would be a private
amount maybe not Gregory has contributed
money to you know some children in Los
Angeles to give them textbooks or
something like that that might be an
interesting way to spread the message is
the kind of thing that there are certain
things like I don't know if I want all
my friends to know that I just rented
ghost from netflix but you know
certainly I this kind of this kind of
phenomenon is the kind of needs to be
shared and so I think a lot of people
would be amenable to that yeah I think
that's a great idea I think that we you
know we have a small tech team but we've
we've brainstormed about things for
example in in social networks the big
ones like Facebook where there is this
sort of event stream and announcements
dream and what could we do there and we
also think about stuff like you know
good good well-meaning people who are
humble do like to sometimes show off
their giving so what's the Lance
Armstrong bracelet equivalent for
donorschoose.org is it a facebook badge
that shows your donations or something
like that so I think there's I think
there's a lot of promise there and we're
just trying to figure out what the best
thing is to do and would love ideas and
suggestions cool thanks I think we've
hit our hour so but we'd love to engage
with any of you who have questions right
now thank ya definitely take a gift
certificate yeah
you
