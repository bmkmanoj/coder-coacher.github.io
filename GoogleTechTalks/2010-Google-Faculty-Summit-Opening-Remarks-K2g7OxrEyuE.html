Alfred his bio was included in the
booklet that you received but he's a VP
of research and special initiatives he's
based in the New York office one other
neat fact about Alfred is that he played
the piano this morning and he likes to
run and I'm gonna let him talk thank you
thanks very much yes that I guess that's
a slightly unique fact I was trying to
think of what what I could save it's
more unique the really bad thing is my
toothbrush fell in the toilet this
morning if you really want to know the
most unique guy but but you know I'm a
distributed systems person by training
so I carry a backup toothbrush lest you
wondered what I did because you know
there was suspense d what do you do with
it so anyway it no longer exists it's
been obliterated any case I would like
to to first thank you all for coming we
hopefully will have a lot of fun
together and learn from each other which
is the goal so thanks for coming and
we'll have a good day and a half also I
want to thank Hana and how for the work
they've done in putting this together
with also with some people from our
university relations team like Jeff Walz
for example they've just done a
tremendous job and organizing this so
thank you how thank you enough for doing
that so without further ado let me try
to introduce a few topics that I think
will be relevant for you a couple things
about this event Google is a big company
now we could probably afford to stage a
500-person faculty summit and make it
really big but it's our view that if we
did that we'd lose the intimacy which
allows for a lot of communication so we
really want this to be a small event we
thought about this actually just when I
joined Google a few years back we wanted
to keep it small but we wanted to make
sure we kept seeing new people so we we
sort of solved those simultaneous
equations and we realized we can't
invite the same people over and over
again so typically many of you were not
here last year in fact i would guess
almost none of you are here last year
from to a faculty summit and
keep rotating this over time and that
way we'll keep the small but will try to
see a large number of faculty throughout
the field our objectives are to explain
some of the things we're doing we
obviously don't have time to explain
everything in planar e sessions but
there are lots of Googlers around so
interact with them many of them were
your students many of them are your
friends and colleagues talk to them and
we can cover as many topics as as we can
it's actually a lot easier to talk about
things in informal situations as you'll
see we have these roundtables in the
afternoon when we have groups of I don't
know 5 or 10 or 12 people or something
like that that get together and it's a
much easier way to talk about a diverse
set of subjects hope you learn something
have fun that's it's a fun campus we try
to make the environment fund it's one of
our approaches to try to stay vibrant
and be innovative despite being growing
and you hopefully you'll see that so
there are three themes in this so to try
to keep things somewhat focused we've
decided to focus on cloud computing and
in particular some of the key aspects of
it like storage so we won't discuss
everything in cloud computing it's now
too big for if we did only dad for a day
and a half but we'll pick and choose
some topics that you'll find interesting
particularly things relating to scale as
you would guess because that's something
that we we major in security and privacy
that's been you know in increasingly
focused upon subject for all sorts of
reasons in the commercial and even in
diplomatic space as I was reading the
economist this morning and the was a
couple weeks ago but there was a four or
five page article on security this in
the in the domain of of you know
relationships between countries but it
was all about computer security and the
issue so we think it's a very important
topic and will touch as we do this on
privacy as well which is clearly also
important particularly given for example
the growth of the social web and what we
want to talk about in the social web is
some of the science and all the
opportunities for advanced work in the
social web we're not doing product stuff
around it
talking about science and technology in
that domain so the agenda looks roughly
like this you may have seen this there's
some major sort of presentations in this
room that are in the mornings and the
afternoon later in the afternoon today
we have roundtable discussions will
break up into there'll be a nice
cocktail reception and dinner that's an
important part of the events it's a
chance for us all to talk informally all
right so a little bit more specifics
here i'm not going to read all of this
now you'll see this as it as it unfolds
but you'll see some various various
parts of this and will will present this
as we go along you see the research
roundtables going on from 4 to 5 30 of
this afternoon and tomorrow again we'll
show you this again but this is what
we're doing in the morning tomorrow Vint
Cerf is here and will provide some
closing remarks before we adjourn and
we'll see who else drops by during the
course of the amount all right so that's
a part one there any questions on the
conference logistics anything like that
feel free to ask me or if you don't have
any broad questions I'll keep going all
right so up two things I want to talk
about that are the backdrop for what we
do so first is our mission you probably
seen this this is a mission statement
that works it does to a very large
degree focus our company on on very
large amounts of what we do relate to
this mission statement it's worth
stating because frankly it's why a lot
of people come to Google to work it's
why a lot of people trust us because the
mission seems to be unarguably good
organizing the world's information and
making it useful seems like just a
fundamentally good thing and we are
really focused on it it's also great
from the perspective that it is a great
umbrella for a vast number of the grand
challenge problems in computer science
so that's something that's great for the
computer scientists amongst us now the
other side of Google and one that we're
very proud of and by no means it is is
it anything but but a really exciting
part of the business
is google and its focus on commerce and
what we can do to enable markets
worldwide and in fact make money so the
Google commercial side is very large I
mean we're talking about you know
million advertisers worldwide that use
the AdWords features that exist in
google search and I could go on and read
you the rest of these statistics you can
sort of scan them as I'm talking and see
this but these this is billions of
dollars or tens of billions of dollars
in economic activity that one can count
that we facilitate and I think we break
down barriers and make the world more
efficient by what we do create markets
where they could not previously exist
for example it's a worldwide phenomenon
and a reason to mention it here is not
just for completeness along with the
primary mission but also so much of the
research focus not only at Google but in
universities today relate to auctions
and algorithms and issues of that form
so there's an enormous amount of
research that this kind of electronic
marketplace stuff really really
engenders so that could be the topic of
a of a focus in some future of faculty
summit it would be a perfectly valid
thing to do and you'll see that a lot of
our research grants are in fact related
to that a lot of breadth won't go
through this but when you think about
what's implied by our mission you know
almost every subject in computer science
is something that's quite relevant to
what we do now given all that we have to
be innovative we're you know roughly
speaking 20-something thousand people at
Google roughly half in the engineering
domain we have to work at it to not get
started that how do we do it what's our
focus on it the first is that I think
from Eric Schmidt of course a PhD in the
field our founders we're at Stanford etc
the senior vice presidents who are
typically PhDs in computer science all
the way through this business is led by
people that are committed to advancing
technology you might think the research
VP has a hard sell on advanced things to
the founders etc but it's not true it's
the other way around I tend to be the
pragmatic one and they're always pushing
for more so it's an interesting dynamic
in that regard and we have to continue
we have this commitment which I think
enables us to try to keep doing new
things and in pretty much every domain
second is as I said already the domain
is really rich because of the mission
statement as well as our focus on
Commerce which both lead to really
interesting problem areas I think many
of them are Grand Challenge problems
i'll try to portray a few of them later
another aspect of google though that has
been important and this is one that i
think is a bit confounding to
universities and university graduate
students that come work here is that we
have an internal consensus that the
production issues of product izing a
service and operating the service at
scale are often every bit as challenging
and fun as the pure invention of the
concept to begin with so what that
argues to us is that we ultimately blur
the boundaries between research and
development and operation and the
roughly a one-third phd's one-third
masters and one-third bachelors that we
have at Google and the engineering
groups are split among many different
kinds of activities we don't say the
PhDs are you know the pure thinkers and
everybody else implements it's a mixture
because the problems of doing things at
the scale and with the quality that we
aspire to are so great that it requires
great minds and great innovation across
the board so we have tended to blur the
boundaries of our D at Google the last
part about why I think we have a good
shot at remaining very innovative is
what I call technical leverage so three
decisions were made pretty early on at
Google that I think are very important
i'm going to do these in a slightly
different order than listed here
the first is this focus on services so
lots of people had been talking about
utility computing and service-oriented
architectures and things even as Google
was being founded but Google took it
very seriously and really understood
that providing services across a network
while you know it's in principle it's
very similar to providing a packaged
software offering there really were very
big differences in terms of the amount
of time and cost it took to do a product
release the ability to gain huge
economies of scale and the like and many
more I could spend you know 15 minutes
as to how all that really played out but
it really was a game-changer it wasn't
just you know some ice and morphism
between the product being local and
remote and it was the same and you could
just you know with location transparency
move something it was very different to
be able to run things in a central way
for a broad audience so that's number
one we have built the company around
that thought and we gained huge leverage
from being able to rapidly release
services we built a common distributed
infrastructure to make that feasible so
as you know you've seen MapReduce things
written about our gfs and other
technologies that we've written about in
the systems domain those systems that we
built a so-called common distributed
system give us a lot of leverage to
releasing services rapidly so if we want
to go release a service that can be used
by hundred million people you know
essentially overnight scale to that we
have the technology to do that we of
course you have to have the idea of
something that people want but in terms
of the infrastructure we have that
available so that's been a really big
technical lever which means very small
numbers of people can do very large
things really rapidly and they're
they're very interesting examples of it
we have a YouTube effort i'll just
mention i mean an Android product called
Google lissome and you put in search
strings and it compiles a sequence of
podcasts that you may want to listen to
on a drive to work and we support huge
numbers of people that do it it's a very
popular Android application
it was done with a couple people that
built it despite the fact that so you
know full-fledged Android product and
just you can do an enormous amount with
leverage the third thing I think that
that is you fairly unique still for us
is I have never seen a business that is
more empirical in its focus so that
leads to a holistic approach to design a
means what is it that we would measure
does the design meet that measurement
goal and the measurement goal may be the
number of clicks or the number of users
or whether something generates more
revenue for our advertisers who knows
what it is there are many different
things but because we have this sort of
central facility we're in a very good
good position to measure and those
measurements impact everything we do the
measurements may be a tack or spring in
which case we can decide should we
release a new interface or not and we
could do that at a coarse grain they
could be at a finer grain it's a small
change to an interface a small
percentage of the public is given that
if the public likes that more than what
we had before we use it otherwise we
don't we throw it away and start over
again or it could be at a very fine
grain level and then it's machine
learning and it's we're getting to the
point with speech recognition we're on a
very fine grain we can take
reinforcements from correct recognitions
of Google searches and feed that into
our language models and do a better and
better job with search and do that not
on the scale of you know a month or two
or three but maybe on the scale of a
week or a day if it's some time in the
future so that ability to do very fine
grain learning is an empirical kind of
thing as well over all those of us that
have been in this field a long time have
seen the field shift from being
primarily analytical in nature
mathematical discipline to one which
much more closely resembles the site the
the physical sciences as well because of
this empirical notion so computer
science has been making this shift it's
by no means still it's no by no means
not in analytical science as well but
there's them in this great addition of
empiricism the other part of I think
innovation is culture so we do focus on
talent we thank
bill Korn said this last night those of
you who are at the reception we thank
you for allowing your students to come
to Google we need them they are they are
Google the talent of these students is
remarkable and we are indebted to the
academic sphere for educating so many
smart people I'm already mentioned that
we believe we have to distribute the
talent throughout our organization
because we think to impact the world at
the scale we want to do it its
production and research both and that
leads to this sort of second bullet on
research here and we do research in our
engineering teams and we do engineering
and our research teams and we try to
blend it as much as we possibly can so
it's it's not an issue if a few
engineers want to go work on a on a
research thing it can happen if it's a
longer-term effort if a few folks and
research want to go and devote their
time to a product launch wouldn't have
any problem with that food we like it we
like that fluidity back and forth so it
means that our research careers are in
some sense less pure of them in
traditional research labs and industry
but we think it's better there is one
other additional thing that makes this
work well and that is that our
comparative advantage and research is
data so it makes a lot of sense for our
researchers to be very close to in vivo
systems so that they can operate on
production systems that's an advantage
that we have that we have big production
systems with lots of users that's a an
aspect of this that I think really helps
us um I want to turn now to just a few
themes and that that I see going on that
you should think about as we delve
deeply into security and cloud computing
and social networking topics um one of
them is prodigious pneus so who thinks
this is actually an English word for
digis pneus I looked it up I think it's
a word so I hope so because I was a
liberal arts major large degrees I hope
it's a word but it's I wanted to use a
word that you know didn't just
say scale or some other word that you
tune out on I wanted a word that you'd
think about a little bit so um we should
be I mean all of us I am we should be
astounded at the scale of the systems
that we either build or are
contemplating building over the next few
years because it is to a very large
degree what's driving everything that we
talked about so you know if you're you
don't have zettabyte on the tip of your
tongue you should there are things we
will now begin to measure and zettabytes
so that's that's exabyte we're used to
probably for the most point but
zettabyte we have to think about up so
just a couple of things we publicized
that we have a big table of 70 petabytes
with 10 million operations per second
hitting it that's a big number I
remember I was a student of Jim Gray and
transaction processing i remember a
presentation at the high performance
transaction processing systems workshop
in a cillum are a decade ago maybe 15
years ago I can't remember exactly and
we were wringing our hands over what
were we going to do with more than
10,000 transactions per second or more
than 20,000 transactions per second the
argument went that you know no matter
how big the airline you just couldn't
book enough reservations per day to
warrant the scale of systems that we'd
be capable of doing and I remember I
remember this discussion and we were all
wondering if you know we had worked
ourselves out of a job and we hadn't we
didn't really think we did but we were
we were thinking about this doesn't seem
to happen and by the way unlike you
don't airline reservation which used to
be I can't remember the numbers but you
know 20 disk i/os we tried to get it
down to 20 disk i/o so that you could
actually do it efficiently enough these
operations that we do for our users are
not simple a search is computationally
intensive with enormous amounts of
lookups going on in this as an example
so we're doing very complicated
operations and with the desire to do
semantic search and such things it's
even going to get more so the world has
gotten very big we've talked about
warehouse computer
so think of the warehouse effectively as
the unit of computation uh you know you
can I'm not a hardware architect at this
point I don't really know the layouts of
numbers of cores per chip or a number of
chips per board or number of boards per
rack and how many racks in a row by a
column but those numbers for the things
that I just mentioned are not in any way
outside of the realm of sensibility
right a hundred course per chip seems
like a certainly valid thing to be
happening there certainly experimental
things where that's happened and and
more so you look at that that means
you're going to end up with 16 million
processing nodes in a building a big
building but it's not impossible in fact
it's likely in the future so that's the
kind of thing so I did distributed
systems when I was much younger when I
was a faculty member we thought about a
hundred servers this is a very big
difference 100 servers you can kind of
man it manually configure this is a
fascinating problem in an automatic
management that requires to make
something of this prodigious pneus work
so storage today you know an exabyte is
a kind of a number that you'd see in
things I can see a factor of two or
three two orders of magnitude three
orders of magnitude happening users were
ten to the ninth today you know roughly
speaking of these internet systems one
could get another factor of ten everyone
on the planet we don't want a digital
divide I don't know what the number of
devices are today I don't know if anyone
knows I couldn't figure that out when I
was writing this down but you know I can
you could see you know hundred devices
per person something like that that
certainly seems feasible the network is
getting towards over the next few years
apparently 10 to the 21st bytes per year
of transmission so that's the first time
I can use that abide in my career a
zettabyte of transmission per year over
the internet so that's you know if there
were a billion users that's 32 kilobytes
per second continuously for every man
woman and child in that billion people
and then the number of apps so this is a
phasing anime
anything actually that should be that's
10 to the fifth is wrong that's a
mistake that should be 10 to the sixth
getting to 10 to the seventh time to add
the iphone store is already hundred
thousand ish kinds of i guess that's ten
to the fifth i guess that is right after
all so anyway ten to the fifth apps
we're going to get to a much larger
number and in fact if how label sin and
others that have been pushing you know
end user programming or write the
numbers are going to be hundreds of
millions of apps and we'll we'll talk a
little bit about something we're doing
in that so it's just a huge this is this
is going to drive I think vast amounts
of our focus and our in our careers in
the field all these things the comment
was made you know I'm selling my 95 car
soon I guess I'm trading in one ECU for
50 or something like that in the new car
I mean it's an amazing change in cars
over the 15 years since I've had it so
that's one thing second is distributed
computing perhaps leveraging this not
surprisingly we now have the distributed
computing problem of all these clouds or
big server complexes whatever you want
to call them and vast numbers of
endpoints or devices how do we do that
in an ideal way with all the load
balancing and self management and
security monitoring etc that is needed
for something of this super human scale
complexity so I think that's a another
theme that's behind this certainly why
we're talking about cloud computing
today one of the things i think Google
is responsible to do for the academic
community is try to tee up for the
academic community the problems that we
feel are relevant and and we need help
on and that the world should work on
other people that are taking pictures it
will post these if you want so you don't
you're welcome to take pictures of them
but you will be happy to post them might
might save you some energy up well mail
them to you whatever you want so one is
we've talked about this and we funded
how do we deal with energy efficiency so
it's not a huge issue today in the
general scheme of things but it will
become one so we should be getting ahead
of this issue and there are lots of
things to do we've been
discussing these kinds of topics for
years but but I think it's relevant
today and the scale is now large enough
what's the server operating system
design for these servers that are these
individual processors or chips or racks
that are running in these warehouses we
have a good abstraction for MapReduce
for batch we have a good abstraction we
feel for when there's embarrassing inter
transaction parallelism the
multithreading you know the while true
do receive request process send response
to all those things in parallel that
that's a pretty good model we don't have
other good unifying abstractions for
parallelism and people are worried about
that not just in the cloud but on these
multi-hundred you know si core chips
that will be running on our desktops so
that's a big a big topic um we are
always interested in latency reduction
I've you heard I play the pen I'm hoping
that will reduce internet latency enough
so that I'll still be able to accompany
my children when they're in college
remotely but I think we have to get you
know Layton sees of videoconferencing
down to 30 40 50 milliseconds for that
to work otherwise I will be starting at
the wrong time with respect to each
other and getting very frustrated but I
think it may be feasible we don't have
good models of replication it's not as
if we don't have thousands of models of
replication or tens of thousands of
research papers in the subject but we
don't have good models of what to do
when and how to sort of reduce this to
good engineering we're very interested
in how to apply machine learning not
just to say all the crowd source the
information but to our but the big
systems so machine learning and systems
how do we do dynamic worldwide placement
of data so with all of these systems and
interconnected warehouses how do we do
all that and in fact how do we do that
keeping track of government regulation I
saw an article in the newspaper there's
discussion today about whether the EU
will harmonize regulations on data where
data resides in the EU or whether it's
going to be
country country basis a very interesting
discussion topic obviously whatever the
rules are we have to abide by those
rules that adds further complexity to
data placement um many security topics
but you'd access control is play an
important role how do you manage them
and use them given how many there are
are there better privacy models or is
this sort of inevitably a complicated
multifaceted space what's the user
interface to all of this given that
we're not using a single computer we're
using any number of devices and we want
to seamlessly use those devices either
in parallel or sequentially as you see
fit against the cloud which is hopefully
always there so a lot of challenges I
think in this ideal distributed
computing place another theme I wanted
to mention that I've been beating the
drum on is what I call totally
transparent processing so what in our
mission of organizing the world's
information but really many missions we
desire to provide communication and
access to information regardless of
device so in a device transparent way
that's an old theme that's been going on
for decades um a grand challenge problem
has been to do it independent of human
language with computer-based translation
we'd like to do it across all modalities
we'd like to be able to convert from
image to text and text image and
understand video and all of those AI
challenges so that when you type
something in English you can get an
image result if you give an image you
can get a text result or another image
result whatever it is all of these
things make sense in our to a large
degree done today on the net although
not quite as coherently and as well as
we hope to do them in the future and
then of course you'd like to do this
with all the corpora of the world of
course would do regard to intellectual
property ownership so you'd like to do
this across all of these things I think
this is a grand challenge problem that
computers are in the process of solving
and that we didn't may not see it but
our kids will see it our kids my kids
who've grown up with google they're 11
and 10 they just assume that everything
is available you want to picture
something you describe it will show you
the picture
if you have a picture of something we'll
find other pictures all of these cross
modality things are there they're
already assuming they can get
translations of language so they just
assume that now and you know that's a
that's a new thing in the world that
that's feasible but in fact if I give a
talk at a university campus and ask your
students i'm going to use translate
today about eighty or ninety percent use
google translate now so it's very
interesting it's very very deep
penetration of that notion so there are
lots of grand challenges this is one of
them that shows all of the
transformations video to video is what's
the recommended video that's the usual
mode of finding something on youtube we
want to do it better because we want to
do it based on theme and theme is hard
to understand so that's a deep AI
problem that we still want to work on
image navigation is something you've
seen a new image interface from google
navigation app mount across images is a
central part of that so all of these
things are going voice search is an
extremely popular thing voice has found
voice found an application and call
center automation a few years back that
was a big one that was sort of the first
really big application of voice
recognition the second one now is in
voice search and voice input on mobile
devices more broadly and that's where we
played a large role and it's remarkably
heavily used and it's remarkably good
and getting better because of that
feedback system that i mentioned earlier
in things um all this leads i I think
this is all enhanced by what I often
call hybrid intelligence and this
ability to extend the capability of
people not in isolation based upon
continual learning is just working
extremely well so we're doing this in
many many places you know spelling
correction at Google is based on this
and vast numbers of things are based on
it I see this continuing and I see this
as a major theme of course it relates to
the prodigious pneus again without vast
numbers of information sources and
feedback on whether we do things well or
not we couldn't do it so the prodigious
pneus leads to the ability to do this
hybrid intelligence and that's that's
the one bed an AI that you can be sure
continue to really grow effectively I
think there's just no doubt about it so
lots of challenges here what are all the
applications how do we address limits to
where we don't have data to learn from
how do we get data how do we integrate
user feedback in acceptable fashions so
how do we do this from a privacy
perspective how do we integrate that
user feedback their new signals we
should be getting so we desire to do
deeper semantic analysis of text so how
do we get all the semantic signals that
we want to enable us to learn meaning
and we're working on that how do we
explain why we reach conclusions based
on machine learning algorithms machine
learning algorithms come up with
coefficients we apply them and we get a
result but if someone if a physician
said why has your system reach this
diagnosis we're not in a very good
position to answer why that's very
interesting our challenge I think in
machine learning another problem with
machine learning is we typically manage
to averages or means but variance is a
big problem so you don't want to have
real bad results even if the algorithm
is on average pretty good I've been very
interested in what i call the
combination hypothesis how do we apply
very diverse signals and apply them
together so how do we apply syntax
semantics as well as machine learning
together to do far better and speech or
understanding images than we've done
previously how do we deal with devices
of increasing variety and subpopulations
that use them like the elderly and the
elderly cannot deal with the cognitive
complexity of a lot of what we build and
privacy issues are a very big one and a
complicated and fascinating topic for
all of us no matter no matter where we
sit on it their societal implications
their technical implications their legal
implications there all sorts of things
that come together as we find our way
through this so very interesting
challenges here and in many new domains
of application clearly this these things
are being applied in search and
translation speech and vision but this
hybrid intelligence what about remedial
education just I'll just go through one
exam
in the interest of time but if we had
huge numbers of systems that were being
used by students we would find out what
works and what doesn't work just based
on usage and that feedback would say gee
when we teach students these kinds of
things when they had this kind of a
problem they then solve their problem in
the future and if we show them this
stuff it doesn't help so the possibility
of applying machine learning and
education systems and my opinion is huge
and might allow us to do really
personalized education in a way that
would never be feasible with humans
doing everything so that's just an
example and there are many many more
some of these you will recognize some of
them you may not sure what I'm getting
at be happy to talk more later so it's a
real exciting time I tell students when
I give talks on campuses some of them
say you know we're too late right Bill
Gates already invented Doss and we're
too late you know Larry and Sergey
already invented Google and whatever i
don't get it i hope you exuded this as
well the field is far more interesting
today than when i was a student I mean
it was a big deal at that time to write
a programming language interpreter in a
machine independent way that could be
compiled on different machine
architectures I mean that was this that
was it that was a big deal in
programming languages to be able to do
that today it seems trivial in
comparison to these challenges that we
as computer scientists get to lead so
it's a really exciting time we're trying
to help in university relations to
nurture universities and to nurture our
relationship with the universities and
we think about recruiting of course we
think about supporting research that
benefits everyone and being relevant so
just a few things about us and what
we're doing now remember we're about
what 12 years old is a company so we've
grown this fairly fast as many things at
Google in fact I would say the whole
programs are more or less double what
they were a year a couple years ago so
we've doubled this kinds of things we do
with universities in about the last two
years maybe not the numbers of
internships that's one thing that's not
grown quite as rapidly so at Google we
have now about 800 plus internships
around the world so that's a tremendous
thing that means that for every Google
employee there there's you know every 10
employees is an intern something of that
form in engineering it's extremely
valuable to us I do roundtables with
interns I will do five or six round
tables as summer and meet 60 interns
it's by far the highlight of my summers
is doing that I mean I enjoy that I love
doing this talk to but the in turn
around tables are even better to be
frank it's just wonderful they all have
a great time and intern programs are
great we we certainly we love them we
generate hundreds of full-time hires
from university campuses it's a kind of
a growing percentage of what we're doing
we have a lot of scholarships that we
provide in particularly reaching out
into underrepresented groups in computer
science as you see in this list many of
you know about the Anita Borg
fellowships or the UNCF fellowships etc
we have a lot of desire to increase the
pipeline of people that want to go into
computer science or fields perhaps
fields even related to computer science
later in life so one point of leverage
i'll discuss it probably a bit more is
can we train high school teachers to
excite high school students about
computer science so that when they get
to your universities they don't conclude
that CS is boring and old-fashioned and
already done so that's something we've
been doing and you see the numbers here
fifteen hundred high school teachers
we've trained and if you look at their
fan out the number of students they
teach we think we've got an impact on in
nearly a hundred thousand high school
students we have a program called the
summer of code and i'll describe that a
little bit more in a minute and this
this chart so the the idea is that for
many students rather than getting a job
at a fast-food restaurant of course i
have nothing against that because i did
that for a couple of years myself it was
a good experience also
we would like students have an
opportunity to do programming in summers
so we fund a large number of open-source
efforts and enable those open-source
efforts to recruit students to work with
a mentor to achieve something in that
open source community so this year we'll
work with will support a thousand
students in 70 about 70 countries and
over 100 about 150 organizations so it's
a big program and we've been doing it
for a number of years I talked to many
of the open-source leaders and they
loved it and there's a growing demand to
keep doing this as they're more and more
open source things going on it seems
like a tremendous way for people to get
involved a a little bit more on CS for
high school we do this not ourselves we
don't invite all these teachers say just
to Google and then try to teach them we
do it through universities because
that's where the skill is in teaching so
we've these are some of the universities
that were involved in and some of the
people that have been involved in this
each University may do things a little
bit differently we're okay with that
there can be variation for example
scratch is heavily used in some places
and perhaps not elsewhere and that's
fine there are many ways of teaching
this field there's not a single right
way but getting to lots of teachers and
exciting them so that they can do a good
job is I think very important now let's
turn to research for a minute in the
last year we funded 230 projects and our
research awards program we have three
calls per year for proposals the next
due date is mid-august and we'll have
some additional Awards a smaller number
of awards in that domain of marketplaces
and auctions and such things that I
mentioned is important with a due date
on October 15th there's a email address
research awards at google com for
further information also you can look at
our website which has an enormous amount
of information on it that's research
google com we have a visiting faculty
program we have about 20 visiting
faculty members here at any time either
and I in here broadly and at Google
maybe in overseas or in New York or
Cambridge
is your Pittsburgh or wherever a war
mountain view so they're about 20 on
going that's tended to be a good thing
we tend to like it when we have a clear
project in mind so the faculty member
can do something at Google that they
wanted to do that we want to do and at
the end of the year that will have
happened and that's something that we
think is mutually beneficial and quite
exciting and a good a good thing for a
faculty member to periodically do a year
ago we announced a PhD fellowship
program so last year was our first year
we did it in North America we had 13
fellowships that we supported these were
named fellowships the google search
fellow for example or the google machine
learning fellow and then we now have
expanded that outside of North America
to the rest of the world we've done
about double the number this year as you
see on this so that will keep growing
and will these are usually three maybe
four year stipends depending upon the
student yes three years typically so the
number will keep building arithmetic
alee over time as the students get
through ah one thing we've introduced as
well in what we've done to grow our
commitment to research in the
universities is to do some focused
research grants which are bigger than
our usual grants in some areas where
Googlers are really interested and
committed to being advisors and kind of
involved in the projects so we're doing
that in energy efficient computing and
privacy and security in open mobile data
collection at with on a project
involving this kind of hybrid
intelligence with machine learning and
new applications and people in the loop
in a cultural cult can I pronounce that
culture oh no mix that's a hard one to
pronounce for me and I have a slide on
that one and on worldly knowledge I have
a slide as well and we're just about to
do one in auctions and markets so an
interesting one of that we're doing now
always called cultural mix what we think
is feasible is to and and more
importantly
arras Lieberman and I know it's feasible
that it's possible to do an immense
amount of learning from the Google
scanned in books corpus so one can do
processing of tens of millions or
millions of books whatever the number is
that's available under copyright
availability to prove or disprove or
just learn what's happened over time so
dr. Lieberman for example a couple years
back looked at word frequencies in these
large corpora and he analyzed the
frequency that irregular verbs became
regularize as a function of their usage
so he looked at words irregular verbs
that were used a lot and saw that they
persisted in irregular verbs that were
rarely used died out and they became you
know regularize din the normal patterns
of language so he was able to conclude
that and wrote an article that was quite
well received based on that that
actually described the phenomenon
modeled how it happened there are many
more things like this in it so we're
very interested in the application of
machine learning and these kinds of
analysis vast data based analyses too
large a large bodies of information and
we think that's entirely consistent with
our mission of trying to organize
information and make it universally
accessible and useful we're working with
Tom Mitchell and other faculty members
as an example and extracting facts and
context so there we've all many of us I
have been for many years even though i'm
not an AI per se we've always been
interested in semantics and the question
is do we have to teach semantics to
computers as n say Doug Lynette's work
or can we learn it now given all of the
inputs in vast amounts of data so I'm
very pleased to see Tom's working on the
learning side of this which is if
possible much more scalable and
adaptable and stays in sync it's a much
more scalable
thing to do worldwide so that's a focus
problem we're working on we're
supporting the amp lab at at Berkeley
this is i would say broadly given that i
presented it earlier i would call this a
program and hybrid intelligence broadly
to work in that domain and dance term
and just to give you an idea again of
how things work at Google dance Turman
is based in the New York lab he's an
engineering director he's actually a PhD
in computer science with quite a
research background and distributed
systems but he leads an engineering team
he's the group working with the amp lab
because we're actually very interested
in how this will affect systems in the
future um we're looking at how we bring
technologies to schools and universities
we have a lot of course where we make
apps available i'll describe that i want
to just mention app inventor for a
moment and we do provide occasionally we
find ways of providing data that have no
negative privacy implications so we have
google code university there's an
enormous amount of course material and
not just you know raw text of what you
might put in a lecture but problem sets
and slides and tutorials on a bunch of
topics that we think are really relevant
and useful in universities so these
might be useful for you to think about
and augmenting education you do it could
even be done by you know other groups in
the university that use these like a
computer science club or something like
that to augment the curriculum and make
it a very relevant and practical for
people so that's something we do we are
making our apps available many many
universities in many ways use gmail and
other apps just to save money and to
allow for the benefits of sharing
through the cloud I wanted to mention
this effort this was an example of a
really interesting thing that started
when how labels him from MIT came to
Google as hell are you in the room hell
or he's here or not okay just I would
say the same thing anyway but the the
he came and had this idea of building a
programming language that would be aimed
at at i would say novices and that would
bring together the excitement of visual
programming as in like scratch or
whatever up the programming that was
able to mash up all the cloud-based
abstractions that we now are beginning
to believe just exist like location
services or chat or email or you know
image repositories and like calendaring
all those kinds of abstractions or
objects that exist in the cloud and then
also finally the third part of it is all
of the objects that exist on the
handheld device so the display the
microphone the fact that it's always
with you so when you get its location
it's your location of the ability to
play music all of those things try to
bring those all together in one
programming environment that would be
highly motivational if easy enough and
seamless enough for the sort of cs the
intro CS course for everyone at a
university not not safe for majors but
for everybody and inmate and would
perhaps in fact be useful in the high
schools and maybe middle schools so he
worked really hard he I think extended
is stay here somewhat is work part-time
at MIT found MIT interns to work on this
a lot of Google engineers worked on it
and we put this out now our main
challenge of course is supporting the
demand because first it's evolutionarily
better so we have to support demand as
it improves and just it's it's a it's a
it's a lot of people I mean on a huge
number of people signed up so we have
this in a sort of early form of
supporting some of them into man now and
gradually turning it on to more and more
people but this could have a very big
impact in any case it's certainly
illustrative of the kind of bet we want
to make with a visiting faculty member
it's what we do another example of
something that turned out very well is
Google
sky which also came for a visiting
faculty position someone who is
interested in the Google Earth ideas but
knew a lot about astronomy so research
google com more information about these
things check the site my final words
this is really the last chart up share
please talk to each other share with us
will share with you I try to will try to
learn please critique us both the format
of the event we're glad to hear it I can
assure you Hana was critiqued me last
night and a very blunt terms so that was
very good please keep it up she can give
you directions nuts great I really I
sent her a thank you note today actually
for it meet old and new friends and have
fun and consider as we go through these
foci on security cloud and social
networking how they impact and are
impacted by these other tectonic forces
that i mentioned around prodigious nuh
sand and artifice and hybrid
intelligence and you know vast
distributed computing cetera how all
those come together and support and are
impacted by this so thank you very much
for coming and thanks for listening to
me
now I could take a couple of questions
for just a minute I started a few
minutes late so if there were any
questions on logistics or I'd be happy
to pass those questions to Hana or try
to answer them or any questions or
thoughts on what I said yeah so I
context is abroad right it doesn't just
mean location it means maybe what's the
user doing right so what's you know what
you should show me you know when I was
madly adding a few charts this morning
wasn't very much but if I was at home
you know surfing the web before bedtime
I'm kind of looking for interesting
things to look at my context my mental
state is somewhat different you're right
geolocation is an important one so i
think i think context services are
something that it would make sense to
have some open standards around and be
able to provide we have course have to
deal with privacy implications of that
so it has to that's a kind of thing
where transparency of what's happening
in clear you know announcement to the
user community with a lot of focus on
human factors is necessary if you're
going to do it but I think context
awareness is extremely important and
you're right it is I mean if you know if
I say pizza restaurants and it gives me
the name of my typical pizza restaurant
in Mount Vernon New York near where I
live while I'm out here that's just
stupid I don't want that I mean Google
might say see how smart God
number you always go to that pizza
restaurant well i'm in mountain view
guys it doesn't make any sense so we
need that yeah question well I suppose
I'm I give this talk I think right
partially to try to tell you what I
think we as a community will be
addressing in the future so these issues
of scale and privacy and security and
all these things the main topics of this
before we would like you to keep them in
mind as you give these courses draw
examples from them you know aim problem
sets in that domain but i think the core
of the field is algorithmic right i mean
you know knuth volume 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 serve us
well or whatever the modern renditions
of that are you know understanding
formal language theory and that's among
the most beautiful results in our field
I think they're very important so I in
my judgment the problem solving skills
that come from algorithms and the study
of algorithms and data abstraction and
modularity are very good we have to
continue to emphasize that I think in
terms of programming we like we at
Google certainly like people to program
a lot so we like programming classes
with lots of programming group
programming is excellent because that's
more the real world than sitting in your
dorm room and doing something entirely
yourself so opportunities to learn a lot
about programming or valuable the field
is now specialized enough that I think
we would like students to have some
ability to choose advanced foci in
different domains among undergraduate
masters so you know there'll be people
to take a lot of security there's a lot
of stuff in that today it's a sub area
etc etc and there many sub areas so
diversity of opportunities for students
I don't think we could say gee everyone
should come out with a security course
not everyone should right now we don't
have every we don't need everyone to be
an expert in absolutely everything so
one of the things maybe to keep in mind
is the diversity of the field know that
it's now an old enough field where there
is a lot of specification within it so
it's a it's a long answer we're quite
happy with a lot of students we hire
many but just keep an i would just say
if I were fatima are we keep in mind
where are things going and how do we
stay relevant to that group of things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
