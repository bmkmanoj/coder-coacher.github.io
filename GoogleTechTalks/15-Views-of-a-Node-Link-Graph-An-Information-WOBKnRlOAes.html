pleasure to welcome tomorrow monster
from the University of British Columbia
to give our tech talk today I've known
tomorrow's since she was at Stanford and
I was at park and you know how these
things work social networks and
everything and she is also an alum of
building 43 which you lived here in a
previous existence at SGI I wanted to
remind everyone to keep confidential
Google questions too after the talk so
they won't end up on video google com
which is considered a bad thing so
please save those questions and when you
ask your questions either say them
extremely loudly or will have tomorrow
remember to repeat them so let me turn
it over tomorrow welcome okay next step
um so today I'm going to talk about 15
views of a node link graph an in-focus
portfolio so let me start out by
defining a few of my terms node link
graph this is a very common idea in
computer science all I mean is any kind
of a abstraction where it's useful to
think of data as nodes connected by
edges and of course trees are a special
case of graphs where you've got a
hierarchical structure so there's no
cycles in the graph now what do I mean
by information visualization I'm going
to typically abbreviate this is in focus
for the talk to save myself some
syllables on any kind of a visual
representation of an abstract data set
now that's a pretty general way to think
about something and of course that did
not originate with computers people have
been making diagrams to help them think
for a long time what's relatively new
say in the past 15 years or so is making
these interactive with the computer and
a lot of the examples that all show
allow interactivity to give you more
power than you could from just static
pictures alone and also there's some
idea that we're not just making pretty
pictures in a vacuum for beauty alone
we're making them to help people get
some particular job done either faster
or more effectively
so there's a lot I could say about how
to design these kinds of info is
interface um and I will say very little
today most of what I'll be doing is
showing you a gallery of examples to get
you thinking about what the design space
is like and rather than ranting for six
hours or 18 hours about how to do these
which I'd be happy to do some other time
I'll start with just really a single
slide to give you one of the ideas
behind what are some of the things that
makes this tricky so if we are using
marks to have some kind of meaning for a
person um there are ways we can do this
that actually can communicate
information through your perceptual
system so you've got say some mark and a
page or in 3d space well the position of
the mark could mean something we could
encode the information using color or
the size or the shape of the orientation
there's a lot of these ways to do it
I'll call these visual channels and I'll
call a general idea of how to visually
represent our data visual encoding and
it's the talk goes on we'll talk about
the particular visual encoding choices
in these 15 examples but some of the
reasons it's not so easy to just say
well we've got all these ways to encode
information and so surely if we've got
say just across the top I've got five
different ways to encode information so
does that mean I can easily just encode
any kind of five dimensional data set so
that you can get it unfortunately the
answer is it's not quite so easy these
are not all orthogonal channels in the
way that the human brain actually
interprets visual information so some of
these are quite nicely separable in your
brain so for example on the left it's
really easy to see that there's two
groups of dots one on the top and on the
bottom so we're encoding by position and
it's really easy to see that there's
green dots versus black dots so those
are two highly separable vigilant
coatings no trickiness here but as we go
across towards the right your ability to
disentangle two separate variables gets
less less facile so for example if we go
further over the right where we got
excise and why sighs if you stare at
that and concentrate you can try and
pick out groups that are based on
whether or not something is on wide and
X or tall and why but if you don't
to trade hard it's easy just to perceive
that as an area you just tend to
perceive oh this is how large the thing
is so you've got x and y sighs starting
to collapse into each other the example
on the far right is a pathological
example even if you concentrate you
can't actually group these dots into
clumps based on their position along the
axis from red to green in color space
and their position along the axis from
yellow to blue in color space you're
just perceiving a color you're not able
to actually separate those out even with
concentration so we go from you can
separate these out even in fact without
a lot of concentration at all to you
can't at all there's a lot more of the
theory of how to do this kind of
visualization design that I won't get
into this is just enough to give you a
tiny little taste of some of these
issues in the fact that the human eye is
not a camera the human brain is not a
perfect memory recorder and we're
designing for the specific perceptual
systems of people so I'm going to start
out in this walk through the design
space with some relatively traditional
representations of graphs go on to some
less traditional ones and then move on
and focus on trees and there's a whole
class of techniques for interacting with
them that's called focus was context and
give some more examples there and then
wrap up quickly at the end feel free to
interrupt with questions in the middle
if you like so I'm going to start with
an example I should have called this
example zero can in some sense it's not
a visualization example at all it's
simply a listing of edges now I'm
putting this up and it's not just a
strong man because I want to make a
point about when the perceptual system
helps you in when it doesn't so the book
gonna lecture Bach is about a multitude
of computer science topics and how they
all relate to each other it's a tour de
force and he actually does for example
connect infinity to a lot of other
topics and if I ask you to read off from
this list of things well what's
connected to infinity you have to go
along store off the fact that the
halting problem is connected to infinity
keep that a little mental buffer as you
continue going on you see ah Lewis
Carroll's also connected into infinity
and then you continue to co decision
procedures are connected to the halting
problem and what you're doing is you're
using a lot
memory and you're having to do specific
cognitive processing to reach the
conclusion of what's in the nearby
vicinity of infinity so what's nice
about this is it's dead easy to create
and what's horrendous about this is it's
actually requiring a lot of work for the
human and we're not doing any of its
exploiting of the perceptual system that
is what's the hallmark of visualization
so if you are allowed to draw a picture
of these things you can read the answer
off the graph so that might sound simple
but what's actually happening is
interesting from the point of view of
your using your perceptual system when I
see a link between infineon of paradoxes
then that gets translated into the
knowledge that there's a relationship
and then I can read off when there's
another link connecting paradoxes to
edit ease I can now avoid doing
cognitive processing on swapping in
perception so it's making an external
source of memory where your eyes can
move around very quickly and you can get
information without having to do a lot
of memorization or cognitive processing
now so what are some ways they can get
these pictures well if you're maniacal
as hofstetter arguably was you can hand
draw your pictures so this is a page
from the book of the semantic network
and go to the Shabak now there are some
strengths about this hand-drawn picture
one is it's got very high what I'll call
information density so talking about the
ratio of the marks to the white space of
course if you go too high all you have
is clutter too low and you're wasting a
lot of white space and typically pixels
are a precious resource but this is
actually very nicely done and there's a
lot of subtleties here I think I'll use
the mouse because I'm not tall enough to
reach so although it's probably hard to
see except from the very front of the
room this book Bhima godel escher bach
there's girdle on top I believe Usher
and Bach are essential triangle there's
the node right in the center that has to
do with all the connections to go
through all three there's notice how the
edges are carefully routed around the
nodes to avoid running through their
centers there's even visual puns like
this note is called jumping out of the
system and the edge goes to nowhere so
it would certainly be hard to make a
completely automatic drawing that had
all of these subtleties but of course
this probably took him hours if not days
to create what if of course instead of
300 nodes you had a hundred thousand
nodes and they were changing over time
clearly hand drawing is not going to
save the day so I took the same data set
and I put it into one of the early
successful grafting systems this is dot
a system from 80s part of the graph is
packaged so one of the central problems
in graph drawing is given this
assemblage of nodes and edges which is
just a purely on topological structure
how do you make a visual representation
for it that is let's compute the
position for the nodes and somehow route
the edges in between them either as
straight lines or in this case it's nice
flying curves and that's the automatic
problem of graph drawing now the
strengths of this is that it's very fast
this took about a second um notice how
there are some aspects of the careful
hand-drawn picture that are preserved
these edges here are actually routed
around all the nodes none of these
spline edges pass through a node now the
downside is you can't actually read any
of the labels even the ones of you in
the very front the scale of the size of
the entire graph compared to the size of
the text labels of nodes is much greater
than than the other one and the other
one you had a fighting chance at reading
the labels so you actually had greater
information density this one's going to
require a lot more navigation way in to
read the nodes and then zooming out to
see the structure of the graph is the
whole so one of the big problems in
graph drawing is how can we do a better
and better job of the technical aspects
of trying to make it so that you can see
as much structure and detail as possible
and of course ultimately also is the
picture that you're drawing actually
properly tuned for the job they're
trying to do with that data set and so
we'll be looking at more points in this
design space so why is this hard well
people have developed a set
metrics to try to encode some kind of
aesthetic criteria that people use when
they look at a graph and try to make
sense of it so for example one of the
typical aesthetic criterias that you
want to minimize a bunch of things like
crossings of lines or the total amount
of area you use or the number of curves
or bends you also want to maximize some
things in this case angular resolution
is so that if you look at the graph from
far away you can distinguish those two
lines are separate as opposed to drawn
right on top of each other or if they're
symmetry in the graph try and have a
layout that shows that now what makes
life rough is that most of these
criteria each one of them is np-hard
most of them have been proved that long
ago so what's interesting is that we
know that we're not just going to have
some brute force computation where we'll
find an optimal answer and go home and
be done for a long time yet we'll be
doing heuristics to try to find
something reasonable and it's likely
that these heuristics may well depend on
the specifics of the problem that you're
trying to solve just to make life even
worse many of these criteria are in fact
mutually incompatible even with a tiny
graph of four nodes already you can see
that these criteria of symmetry and edge
crossings give you different optimal
layouts so there's been quite a bit of
work both on trying to formalize the
ideas of how can you understand a
picture that's encoded as a graph and
what are the computational complexity of
these various approaches so one thing
that a lot of people have tried doing
and in fact a lot of wheels have been
reinvented um is something I'll call in
the general category of fourth direct
replacement so you've got this physical
analogy that your nodes are like magnets
that are repelling each other but your
edges are like Springs drawing them
together and often you'll start either
from some random position or maybe some
more carefully computed initial position
and then you run the system to
convergence and what you get is the idea
that you're trying to have the geometry
of the final placement of the nodes on
the page be roughly correlated to the
graph theoretic distance the number of
hops it is from one node to the other in
the graph so here's an example for
very small graph of just starting at
some initial position and gradually
evolving into some layout now there have
been many many different mathematical
approaches to doing this the nice thing
about this approach is you can throw a
lot of heavy lifting mathematical
infrastructure at this to try to get
some traction for this problem so the
strengths is it's easy to explain it
there's a lot of different ways to try
to tackle it mathematically but the
fundamental weakness is that you've got
this n-body problem and fundamentally
you're saying what's the forces on one
node compared to all the other nodes you
have to do this multiple times until you
converge so you end up with an N cubed
algorithm and that's simply not going to
scale so one approach people have done
more recently say in the last five to
ten years is let's not just tackle the
entire graph at once let's chop it up
into pieces hopefully in some kind of a
clever way and have some kind of a
multi-level structure on the graph where
we can try to solve an easier problem
use back to springboard to solve the
harder problem and so on with refinement
until we have some way to lay out the
graph as a whole so they've been a bunch
of approaches to this multi-level layout
and one that I'm enthusiastic because
we've been working on it lately has just
got into the journal TV CG a couple
weeks ago is to try to chop this up by
topological features so the idea is
we've got a bunch of specialized
algorithms that are good at say drawing
trees or drawing clusters or drawing
near trees or finding structure that
actually is meaningful in terms of some
the way people think about it like chop
it up into by connected components so
the Chuckle layout approach says we'll
chop up the graph and two components
based on these topological features use
algorithms that are well tuned for the
particular feature to lay it out there's
some special sauce at the end which is
try to make sure that then the final
drawing when you put all these pieces
together is refined so that you have
good information density which tends to
always be one of the hard problems so
I'm not going to have time to go into
detail on this since I'm kind of
whipping through many things in this
brief tour of info visit
but you can look at data sets like say
websites or the structure of the
internet router backbone and get better
results than in previous methods that
didn't try to take this topological
structure into account now the strength
and weakness of this algorithm is pretty
much the same if the features we detect
and layout well are present in the graph
then we do great if those features
aren't present then we're not going to
do well or there's even a more subtle
thing which is that if those features
don't correspond to the way that the
user actually needs to think about that
graph to get their job done then you
could argue that it might even actively
mislead in the red are those it's your
city the question was are those of same
graph are different and the answer is
different graph the graph on the left is
the structure of a website the graph on
the right is the structure of an
Internet router backbone the bill
jesuits been doing internet tomography
to try to mine that structure so so far
I've been talking about a static problem
which is you're given a graph and then
you have to draw it but of course a lot
of the interesting data sets have
dynamic data where over time the
structure of that graph changes and
there's an interesting problem which is
that you want to minimize the
unnecessary changes in the layout so you
want to have as little change as
possible as the graph changes visually
yet the actual structure is changing and
so the drawing should always reflect
that current structure but it's possible
but if you don't take into account a
careful analysis of how the change could
happen you could have a lot of
unnecessary visual change question over
there are many things I mentioned by vs
methionine scale
that for the chain that each gena voided
okay how they mean user studies would
say that it's really something that
people get about is it something that
nobody needs it again so so the question
was for these metrics I talked about
have they been validated by user studies
or they just mathematically elegant but
we're not quite sure whether they match
so the short answer is most of them have
been validated by user studies and of
course like all user studies and you can
start to quibble about whether you
believe those particular ones are
whether they're capturing the full story
but for example Helen purchase and Colin
where our two researchers who've done a
fair amount of trying to go from
intuition to formalization of a metric
to user studies that say which of these
metrics actually meet have the most
impact in terms of users perception of
the graph structure miss sue is another
one who's done a fair amount of that so
yes they've actually been working on
validating these of course going back to
that previous slide about multi-level
hierarchies one thing we're right in the
middle of working on which I'm really
excited about is trying to take some of
these metrics and generalize them to do
something useful at the multi-level
structure because all the work so far
has been at a single level so there's a
lot left to do on that but a lot of that
has been validated back to actually use
your studies so for this question about
dynamic graphs um there's this question
about how to minimize unnecessary
changes so let's go ahead and look at a
video this is work that we've done it
Berkeley a couple years ago and
I'm actually going to talk over this
instead of using their voiceover so here
with autograph that's changing over time
and right now they're actually I believe
just monitoring on a tell'n network so
one aspect is there's whether the graph
itself is dynamically changing which we
saw at the middle and then the ability
to interact with the graph and in this
case it's a radial layout that's based
on some idea of a current focus node the
user can change which note is the focus
and then the graph is moving accordingly
going to move this down a little bit so
we can see the top of the screen that's
what you're seeing here is the
navigation and now that they're going to
talk about again I want to see the very
top of the screen is specific ways of
doing that animation that's easier or
harder to follow so if you just
interpolate the position of the nodes
rectangular lee what you'll notice is
that you get this kind of collapsing
into the middle effect that this graph
and it's relatively hard to follow if
instead you interpolate by moving things
around in polar coordinates instead of
the rectangular coordinate so they
roughly stay on at the radio level that
they'll be it's easier to follow hear
what they're showing is that if you have
no constraints at all on maintaining
sibling orderings when you move around
you again get a lot of unnecessary
motion in the graph by saying instead
let's impose a constraint on enforce
that sibling ordering is maintained it's
easier to see what's happening as the
graph moves there's another constraint
based on some of the physics of disney
animation which is instead of just
moving linearly in time you start up
slowly and then go more quickly um so
this is enough at least to give you some
sense of the fact that by imposing some
constraints you can actually make these
kinds of motions easier to follow
visually so i'm not going to show the
whole video but it's enough to give you
a sense
so one thing that that approach did well
at was simply by saying let's
interpolate in polar instead of
rectangular coordinates and have some
constraints on maintaining the neighbor
order it's actually easier to follow the
animations and in general the idea that
if you've got two states and you want to
go from one state to the other there's a
one of the conventional wisdoms and info
because you definitely want to have some
kind of a smoothly interpolated animated
transition instead of just a jump cut so
that you don't have to reacquire some
target of interest in one picture and
see where it went to in the other you
can just track it as it moves along so
there's typically been a lot of effort
put into what are the right kinds of
animated transitions so this approach
actually did succeed in having smoother
transitions one of the weaknesses though
is that it doesn't scale up to larger
data sets I'll be talking later on about
some approaches that actually try to
take into account what if instead of
having hundreds of nodes you had tens of
thousands or hundreds of thousands or
Millions there's a bunch more typically
graphics infrastructure you need to do
under the hood to make that kind of a
system scale up this one was pretty
limited to several hundred points one
thing I'll note is that the dynamic
problem is much harder than the static
problem that's pretty much the state of
the art in dynamic graph layout although
people have made a lot of strides lately
and trying to scale up static layout so
much larger data sets getting up into
the hundreds of thousands so here's a
different approach um and this is an
approach for what's basically visual
debugging so this is a system designed
for a small number of people of
computational linguists who were taking
an entire online dictionary on making a
semantic network for the nodes for
English words and the links are these
two words we used together in some
dictionary entry sentence that was a
definition and what they're trying to do
is determine whether or not their
networks for creating and using the
semantic network match the intuition of
an English speaker so it was really
debugging their own algorithms not
intended for end users but really a kind
of very specialized kind of visual
debugging and one of the design
principles we use when designing the
system was i mentioned how
important information density is that
you really want it to use all of your
screen space effectively so that is an
important principle so one of the things
we said in an early version was well
let's make sure that if we have a
certain amount of room to draw a word
will compute what font um we can fit and
then we use the maximum possible font
when we actually watch the linguists try
to use this system we found that they
were misjudging something important
which was that they thought that longer
words were less important than shorter
words because a shorter words are drawn
bigger right so this there tends to be a
bunch of trade-offs in the design space
and often they bite you in the ankle
only when you actually see your intended
users using it because of course you the
designer knew what you had in mind um so
typically there's a lot of iterative
design and systems like this so what we
found was it was really important that
the visual salience that is the the the
visual weight of something should match
this idea of computational importance
that we are trying to convey so in the
final version of the system we made sure
that words they were equally
computationally important for a drawn of
equal size so we didn't just have this
idea that to draw things as big as
possible if we've got the pixels and
then we found that that was a reasonable
compromise that had both information in
city and the vigil salience matching in
the orange did you see anything about
the color so the question is did we see
any effect about the color we're
actually using that this is a system
where we're using color coding in some
very specific ways that are
interactively changing over time as you
interact with the system sorry the
procession a different color or have
again the question is whether a
different colored word would have a
different perception um one thing we did
was actually buy into some of the
literature which is that it's hot it
gets fairly hard to read colored text
and that it's a lot more effective to
have text that's either say all black
were all white against a colored
background so we switch to something
where the color coding was that you had
these blocks containing the words rather
than trying to actually draw the words
of different colors um to get the
maximum contrast for legibility
between your visual salient ounces we
taking account just with text labels for
all occasions so what's wicked really
sailing so Dan after in this visual
salience analysis did you take into
account just the text or all the
features what's visually salient as if
you were an audience plant going on to
my next point which is some issues about
visual salience and what did we do in
this design it was different than some
others so hopefully I'll answer this
question within the next two slides so I
mentioned that one of the traditional
metrics and graph drawing is avoiding
too many crossings of edges on one of
the reasons we do that is that there is
some visual ambiguity and salience of
the wrong things in the design so in
particular it's not obvious here is a
going to C&amp;amp;B happen to be in the way or
is a going to be and be going to see
there's actually five or six
possibilities here and there is an
ambiguity so there's confusion this one
is slightly more subtle there's not an
ambiguity here but the important thing
is that a is connected c and b is
connected to d the place that your eyes
immediately go to when you see this
picture is the X in the middle so the ex
is a salient vigil artifact that draws
your eye that doesn't actually have
meaning so that's another one of the
reasons why people try to avoid edge
crossings is they're overloading a
perceptual system with stuff that's not
so important so fundamentally the
problem is you see things that are
confusing or that misdirect your visual
attention in this system what we decided
to do was create a perceptual layering
effect where when you interacted with
the system what you would see was that
some small set of words and edges would
be highlighted and this highlighting was
actually based a combination of
increased saturation of brightness and
size with line would and then this layer
in effect was effective in the sense
that you'd see a foreground layer and a
background layer and even though there
are quite a few crossing lines that you
can see this picture here once there's a
visual foreground layer it's fairly
clear that this line is connecting up
and going up that way and the fact that
a lot of other lines are
saying it is not a problem perceptually
speaking so we basically said if you
consider interaction to be a first-class
primitive and you're allowed to interact
as a fundamental way that you deal with
the system then you can see different
snapshots being highlighted and avoid
perceiving the false attachments and not
have to have the spatial layout to do
all the work I'll show you a short video
to get a sense of what that system looks
like in action so here's an example
where what's been selected is a small
again I think I'll just narrate over
this as it goes what's been selected
it's pretty obvious is a visual
foreground layer and you can see that
there's a small number of these what
you'll also notice is that there's some
specific kinds of zooming where when
you're far out one word is large and the
rest are small as you actually get to
the point where you've got more room
available as you zooming in it's not
quite a linear zooming in to the point
where you can read all the lines and
then there's a lot of again interaction
where you can flip through and quickly
get a sense of where one word connects
with all the other words and
specifically I'll now bring up the movie
right after this which is showing more
of the
they're flipping through so here's the
idea that you could either flip through
various pathways in this case the
pathways or these paths that had been
computed through the system um there's
going to the more teaching about the
exact interface approach using a little
scroll wheel on a mouse what's
interesting here then is you can either
flip through the pathways or through
entire definitions all at once which
correspond to one of these rectangular
blocks that's starting right about now
so the key thing is that you actually
are getting this perceptual layering in
this case they were going through all
the connections to particular words so
that's enough of that to at least give
you a flavor of it so what's interesting
about this system is that its strengths
and its weakness or the same thing it's
very highly specialized so I mentioned
this was designed for a small group of
computational linguists and the methods
that they used before to try to
understand whether or not their
algorithms working involved bringing up
a vast number of windows and flipping
around in between them and they're
having to remember a bunch of things in
their head and compare the memory of
something to what they saw on the screen
in front of them one of the things the
system was designed for for us to try to
have all the information they needed
more available in one space at once and
use interaction rather than having to
just use the memory of what you had seen
before so it was much much better than
any off-the-shelf system for doing that
yet it took a designer me quite a bit of
time to actually design and build that
system so information visualization is
at the point we're building these kinds
of highly targeted systems where it's
really clear whether you've helped or
not because their task is really crisp
and concrete is one of the modes that
this field is in now so that we can then
learn from that evaluate whether it
worked and build a richer set of design
principles about how to do this to get
to the point where we as a field can
kind of give you a cookbook which says
ah here's your data set here's your user
here's your task here are some
suggestions about what to do you have to
start by exploring the design space
before you can have that kind of
prescriptive cookbook advice
so even though that kind of custom
system is really expensive there's some
value in trying to choose some case
studies and learn from them now some
things that work is that we actually did
succeed in the final version of having a
nice trade-off between the information
density and the visual salience of
making sure that they drew the right
conclusions from what they were seeing
and this perceptual layin approach
they'd end up working out where we had a
bunch of visual channels all redundantly
enforcing this idea that there's a
foreground @ a background layer so let
me move on to some less traditional
representations of graphs and trees so
typically if i told you about some
little hierarchical structure of six or
seven nodes and I asked you discussion
on a napkin you'd probably draw a
picture like the one that's on the left
where you've got this node link graph
where you're saying that there's a
parent-child relationship by drawing a
line between them but you can also use
another visual vocabulary item for doing
that you could say well I can have
things contained within so containment
instead of connection now what are the
pros and cons of this an approach called
tree maps uses containment instead of
connection to show this structure if you
really care about the topological
structure of exactly how the parent and
children relate then this connection
system that most people use is probably
the right way to go but if you've got
attributes at the leaf nodes or the
interior nodes of the graph that you
want to try to encode visually you can
actually do that here here we can see
that D is much larger than C say and
that F is larger than E and you're
seeing that with your perceptual system
rather than having to read a number and
think about it and cognitively compare
this number three to ten so always
trying to exploit perception here so
typically that attribute might be
something like the size if it's a file
or file system or the performance of a
stock so this trade-off approach is
really effective it's showing outliers
in this attribute that your encoding say
through sides you could also encode
things through color the map of the
market is one of the applications of
info visit a real
world that most people have actually
seen shree maps were initially invented
almost 15 years ago but they've been
percolating in tech transfer from
infovis into the mass market in the past
few years now to show you how you can
take this idea and then try to refine it
one of the problems is there is some
structure that's clear on the top it's a
lot harder to see if we just use black
and white to understand the
relationships of the parents and the
children we're essentially losing a lot
of the internal hierarchical structure
and just focused on the leaves here so
one of the ways to try to make that
structure more visually apparent without
using up another one of these visual
channels of color is this approach where
you're assigning these areas to
basically virtual bumps so you're
simulating the shading as if this were a
bumpy surface and you're more able to
see the hierarchical structure in this
picture without using up color coding
now what's nice about this approach is
just by manipulating the relative sizes
of these virtual bumps you can either be
focused on the really low level
structure or smoothly change to be more
focused on a higher level structure just
by relating this the size of the bumps
to each other so tree maps are
eventually originally proposed by
Johnson and Schneiderman and this
refinement was proposed by fenway
convened wetering so it's nice about
that is it's not getting rid of the
fundamental nice attribute of tree maps
which is try to show this attribute
information but it adds back a little
bit more of the topological structure
and then it frees up color to be used
for something else like some categorical
information about the kinds of note
attributes you have now still if you are
actually trying to understand
topological structure you would just use
the more traditional formulation so if
you're mostly focused on attributes but
there's a little bit of topological
structure you like to see this is
actually an improvement
so another approach that's been proposed
by several people as well sometimes
instead of actually seeing that all the
details of the graph structure you want
to take a bigger view so if you go from
the idea of having a node link graph
that you layout and then take away after
you do the layout take away your edges
think about where you've got your nodes
and plant them in the plane and treat
that as a density function and then try
to wrap a skin over on top of it and you
get this virtual landscape or a terrain
on this example across the top is
actually using gene expression data
where you start out with just a table
full of numbers about the amount of
influence that one say gene or protein
has on another you threshold back to get
some kind of way to edge structure and
do that use that for graph layout and
then for your terrain on the example on
the bottom was a corpus of a week's
worth of news stories and trying to give
people some sense of this terrain of
news of what were the most most covered
topics that week so this was originally
proposed from two folks at Pacific
Northwest National Labs up in the
Pacific Northwest now what's interesting
about this approach is it's one of these
model that's very intuitive people are
used to thinking about terrains
especially people in general public kind
of will latch onto this view and say AHA
it's hills I get hills so people tend to
find it fairly evocative I argue it's
probably fairly good for things like an
overview um a lot of the methods that
have been proposed using this allow you
to then go in and explore maybe in a
little more detail because you're losing
a bunch of the information when you go
off to make these terrains so I'm
personally interested in trying to
evaluate when exactly people might get
some benefit from using this or is it
just that they find it sexy as opposed
to actually useful question and gray
holographs that are used with the same
layout professional ethics can serve
your country
Springs
Laska
very sparse that the breath
so the question was do you have to be
familiar with that family of graphs
before that kind of terrain layout will
do any good um now most of the people
proposing this kind of approach would
say no you don't have to be in
particular so this gets back to this
question of does it matter exactly where
the hills are in relation to each other
or simply that there are hills in that
some are tall so I'd already that really
what this approach is going to get you
is oh look there's a couple tall hills
what are those labels and if the
clustering is actually reliable that is
if you instead of having a random
scenery of a whole different set of
Hills every time if you can reliably say
yes the clustering is legitimate and
actually reflects a structure the data
set then maybe they're going to learn
something effective so one of these
papers is actually about the idea of
making sure that you do get reliable
clustering so that it's meaningful on
which I think made this technique a
little more effective so their argument
is actually so what I agree with in the
last part of your question was well what
if you had a sparse and bad layout then
probably this wouldn't be helpful I
definitely agree with that this is
probably something that's more suited
for showing you clusters than for
showing you the exact subtleties of the
layout I also caution that it's probably
a little dangerous in the sense that if
you've taken a bunch of samples and then
you're interpolating them and then
people start drawing conclusions about
this interpolate ax data you have to be
careful that they're not drawing
conclusions about artifacts about the
idea that oh maybe there's actually a
gradual slope here when in fact you
don't know you're just interpolate in
between two things that's typically
always something you have to worry about
is are they drawing conclusions from an
artifact of your visual representation
or something that's actually truly
present there in the data so here's
another approach um again you would
typically draw a picture of a graph if
you were given a little one in a napkin
with this connection between the nodes
in the graph another way to visually
represent that is in a matrix where one
side of the matrix is all the nodes in
the graph same for the other side and
then in the cell where they need if
there is an edge between them
then you dark in that cell in this case
they've actually got a 2 of a color
coding of green versus red edges here
now there's some interesting aspects to
this approach so it's certainly true
that if you get a larger and larger
graph if you're not careful you get more
and more of the kind of ball of yarn or
tangle of spaghetti problem where you
just have this thicket of edges and
nodes and it's really hard to understand
structure so in some sense the matrix
approach is an end run around the
problem of how do you reasonably layout
a graph in a way that shows some kind of
structure this particular project by
frank van ham was trying to take a large
scale software project and show the
developers something about the structure
in this case for example was a call in
the specification or did it creeped into
the implementation without actually
having been desired in the specification
that's sort of showing in red there now
what makes this a multilevel project is
the argument that matrices are nice if
what you want to do is have some kind of
multi-level structure where you can
either have a very coarse level view or
you could zoom in say to one of these
and see a more fine level view and you
can do that with in exactly the same
amount of room you've got this kind of
recruits stable structure for doing this
kind of recursive zooming across the
levels of the graph um in contrast you
can imagine that if you wanted to zoom
in to something like that force directed
graph in the middle it can get tricky to
know exactly what's the area of the
screen you'll know you'll need to do
that so there's some knife aspects of
being able to just look at these matrix
blocks and one of the things that this
project did well was it actually did
show developers who'd spent a lot of
time in their code base some things that
they did not already know by looking at
this visualization so literally they had
spent months working with this and
discovered some new things about some
problems between the implementation the
spec now there's a really fundamental
issue here which is only some tasks are
well supported by this kind of a matrix
view so for example a recent paper by
conium and Phuket um
I to do user studies about what tasks
can you do with a matrix view and what
tasks do you really need the more
traditional node lakeview for so when
they started on characterizing the kinds
of things you can do with these views so
let's now move on to some more
interactive systems that we're going to
be focusing specifically on trees
although I'm going to speak a little bit
of gene sequences in there right at the
end and we're going to talk about this
class of techniques called focus plus
context so that's a buzz word from the
info visit literature which really means
this idea that we're trying to combine
information about an overview with
information about details into some
single integrated view so that's as
opposed to something like having a
single view where you can navigate your
camera around freely so sometimes your
varies and then other times you might be
much more zoomed out and the problem
with that kind of a view is you have to
remember what it looked like before and
that kind of using your memory instead
of just being able to read the answer
off it's typically the kind of thing
that we're trying to get around with
visualization or you could imagine what
if you had multiple views um it's very
common in something like Photoshop where
you've got your main view and then a
little overview window showing you
roughly where you are so that helps a
little bit but there's still the
conjecture is some cognitive load and
trying to correlate between those two
views so the question is can you try to
integrate information into one view will
that make things easier for the person
so one of the systems this is by close
on to Dolph from Maryland it's called
space tree and it's a very interaction
based system so it's saying it's true
that there might be a very large data
set that you're trying to explore but
what we're trying to show you is just a
small set of that that you're looking at
it once but give you some sense of where
you're on relation to the whole so let
me show you a demo of that to get a
sense of what that's about and I will
shrink this view a bit so right now
we're looking at the very top level this
is actually a node link rap present
representing relationships between
species and
when you click on one versus another
you're really focused on the path from
your current choice back to the roof
sorry back back to the root so let's
zoom into the mollusks so the thing to
notice is you don't necessarily see
everything at once um but and you have
some kinds of hints about things that
are likely to be large for example the
little glyph by the chordates things
that backbones is pretty large so this
is showing you a fairly small set at
once but it's making it really easy
always to see where you are in relation
to through the graph you can imagine
that if it were drawing out the whole
thing this is 200,000 nodes it would be
quite hard to keep track of where you
are in relation to the root because
things would be very very very very
spread out so it's allowing you to
interact and pick a small set at once to
see so the strengths is that again
coming back to the steam that as you
move to the graph you typically want
animated transitions between the
different states to be able to track
things but if the task you're doing only
requires seeing a small amount of
information especially halves up towards
the root then this is going to be a nice
tool if you have to see a bigger picture
then you're actually seeing only a small
fraction of the information another
approach that was proposed by I lamping
it on land things now here at Google
last I checked is trying to use some of
the mathematics of hyperbolic geometry
to give you this fish I like effect the
idea being that again if you just draw
completely traditional drawing of the
tree it's going to be very very spread
out in particular it's going to require
an exponential amount of space is then
the number of nodes in your tree grows
to draw that picture what you want is
this carefully chosen distortion to say
that some parts of the tree are drawn
large and others around the fringe are
drawn small so this is actually inspired
by the same kind of hyperbolic geometry
that extra used in some of his
sures we're technically it's a whole
other talk together the mathematics of
this but grab me afterwards if you care
because it's really nifty so you can
actually move things around on a
hyperboloid and project down into the
plane to get this kind of effect where
some things are large things are smaller
on the periphery and the key thing from
the point of view of interacting is that
you can by selecting a node that's
currently far away in small and dragging
it back towards the center you can then
see that that becomes big and what used
to be big gets pushed out towards the
periphery so this is using a single
focus so there's essentially one thing
that's large in the middle and then
things are all fall off around that so
this is using the mathematics of 2d
hyperbolic geometry let me actually just
show you a quick demo to get a sense of
what that's about so this was something
I've been working with a lot of
biologists so I tend to pick examples
lately looking at relationships between
species so this is another relationship
between species one notice how we're
actually a little bit cut off here let
me zoom down this isn't a rough oval
shape but you can pick what's going to
be large and then other things get
pushed off towards the edge and we can
go back down to the original root node
so this kind of a fisheye like effect is
showing you a larger neighborhood of the
graph then you could see with the purely
traditional view and you notice how you
get some information of what is a
possibly fruitful direction to go in
versus a place where there's nothing
there at all so we can see that there is
some structure here that we can then
zoom into to see in more detail whereas
we can know that right over here in fact
there's nothing and there's no need to
explore there anymore
so it slices that this can actually
start scaling up beyond just hundreds of
gnomes this works well even in its
graphs of over 10,000 nodes um there's a
couple caveats one is any kind of these
methods where you're trying to do some
kind of distortion to see more things
smushed around something you've got to
be careful if you're doing any task wary
judgment of distance is important then
you don't want to use this whole class
of methods because we're actually
changing the distance as you interact to
try to show you more things at once and
it is possible to get lost and lose
track of where the route is if the graph
gets big enough some slightly later work
that was from my own thesis work again
the age 3 system is trying to use the
mathematics of 3d hyperbolic geometry
instead of 2d hyperbolic geometry to try
to fit more information in at once and
do better on the information density so
I'll briefly show you a little bit of a
video of this system in action or you
can download it and play with it off the
website it's a free system
so in this one we are moving around and
there's some similarities to the 2d
system in the sense that they both have
a single focus in this case it's at the
center of a ball rather than on the
surface of a disc and it's got that same
property where you can move things very
far away and they'll get small or
whatever you move towards the center
will be drawn large and in this kind of
a system simply by you can either freely
drag around or if you click on a node
like we did just here it'll move towards
the center with all of its ancestors on
the left and it's descendants on the
right so the aspect of this where we're
seeing a little more information than in
the 2d case is that the aggregate
information on the fringe is about say
there's stuff here and there's no stuff
elsewhere you're getting to see about
more nodes at once let me flip to the
next piece of the movie to show you
another aspect of this which is you'll
notice I said this is a system for
graphs but what I'm showing you now is a
spanning tree so the idea is that
there's a lot of trees we're showing a
spanning tree can be a useful way to
think about it if you do everything this
is basically the what not to do picture
it's a mess right this is an example of
actually an entire website where if you
try to show all the interconnections
it's very hard to understand what's
going on what this system was built for
was allowing you to say don't just try
everything instead select some node in
particular and then draw the non tree
links either incoming or outgoing just
for that node and allows you to do a
more fine-grained investigation and
understand some of that structure so
you're looking at a piece by piece
instead of being able to see all of it
at once but that's basically a way to
give you traction now the argument is
when could you use these kind of
spanning tree based methods to look at a
general graph and the answer I given
this paper is well a lot of tasks
actually have some idea that there's
hierarchical structure even in a very
dense graph like in this case websites
are dense they're not just trees but
there's a mental model where you can say
that based on the directory structure
the URL I can infer
hierarchical structure that actually is
probably what the webmaster was using to
think about similarly you could do
computations to try to show structure of
some software call graphs where you're
doing a combination static and runtime
analysis to try to find what's a good
spanning tree it's actually going to be
helpful rather than misleading
so this one actually scaled up to larger
data sets you can usefully navigate data
sets of over a hundred thousand nodes it
still has the same weakness about you'd
never want to use a method like this if
you care about distance judgments and
even though you saw a bigger
neighborhood you could still get lost
when the graph got big enough so my next
system was kind of a direct result of
trying to solve the problem of if the
graph gets big enough you could get lost
in these systems I wanted to build
something where you never would get lost
you'd always have a sense of where you
were so my next system called tree
junkies or was specifically aimed at
biologists who needed to compare trees
side-by-side and those trees might
actually get to be quite large so I'm
going to start off by showing you a demo
I believe we're here is that right
ignore the errors behind the curtain
it's just a little bit of java nonsense
so one interesting thing here is if
you're trying to compare the structure
of these trees let me actually turn off
something useful as an example if you
just have to stare at these trees and I
tell you that they are similar but not
identical and it's your job to figure
out exactly how they differ um it's
actually a hard problem even if you're
allowed to have some support like muff
ever highlighting where what's shown on
one side is also shown on the other so
we can start to see well wait there's
some difference here fo varia and car
thumb nets are down here but oh it looks
like they're still actually sibling so
maybe the problem is somewhere
downstream so you can go through and try
and mark pieces of structure and
understand well is what's contiguous on
one side still contiguous on the other
and then we can start to find ah here's
what's happened this tree branch down
there ended up getting moved over to
here in this version of the tree so you
can start to understand that structure
so one of the tasks we were supporting
in this was understanding these
differences between trees the part that
I turned off which is normally turned on
is automatically computing exactly those
spots in the tree where there are
differences on both sides now the part I
mentioned about navigating without
getting lost right now this tree is
actually not so huge so it's possible
for me to make one part larger or
smaller and have the rest compress
accordingly but it's nice and it's nippy
but I'd argue it's not critical now if
we try and look at a larger tree a
couple things become more obvious first
of all why you want an automatic
algorithm to find the structural
differences in the trees here's a case
where these are two trees that have been
reconstructed from the DNA of the
species themselves rather than and there
are two conjectures that are equally
likely given the data that the
biologists at hand you can actually get
back many possible trees that you then
have to under
standish topological structure of and
compare one of the things that's nice
about this kind of stretch and squish
navigation is instead of just having a
single focus like with the hyperbolic
stuff you can have multiple foes I where
you look at the tree in more detail now
this idea of taking parts of it and
stretching it and other parts having
being compressed accordingly is not a
new idea the part that's new that's
about trying to scale this up to large
data sets is the idea that says let's
say that we've gone into here and looked
at a rabid OSIS and we wanted to mark
that so let's make a colored mark here
and then let's say that we'd also gone
in explored some other part of the tree
by some biological thing I don't know
but it looks like it's related to
saccharine yeah now notice I one of the
East so mycoplasma sounds much for me
the thing to notice here is I'm making
these little marks that are showing me
some kind of a visual path through my
data set notice how even though i might
have compressed very highly a lot of
leads into one region i'm still actually
drawing these little colored blobs to
give me visual landmarks of where I've
been so one of the aspects of the system
is that it actually scales up to trees
of more than a million nodes and you can
interact with it at 30 frames a second
with this guaranteed frame rate
interaction but these little visual
landmarks will always be drawn even if
it doesn't have time to draw the whole
data set in a single frame it'll make
sure to try to maintain these visual
landmarks you have some sense of oh I
see the purple stuff is beneath the
green and the red and so on so this kind
of graphics infrastructure to preserve
visual landmarks and have fluid
interaction is something I think it's
really important scaling up to big data
sets
so this question about if you've got
these marks is it worth bothering to
draw them after all they're just small
colored blobs with a small data set if
you mark something it's easy you just
draw it in the color of the mark and you
can see it as your data sets get bigger
and bigger the possibility that some
mark that has important semantic meaning
might not be visible to you that gets to
be highly probable for example if you
can freely move your camera the mark
could just be completely outside the
viewport one of the reasons we're doing
this kind of stretch and squish
navigation where it's as if the borders
are nailed down is so that nothing can
actually be off-screen it could be
arbitrarily small on the side but it's
not going to be completely off screen or
if you're allowed to have a full 3d way
of drawing these then one mark could be
hidden behind another this kind of
rubber sheet navigation has a semantics
of being two dimensions even though you
couldn't do it directly on a piece of
paper but at least it's not 3d so you
can't have occluded marks now the tricky
part about when marks could be invisible
is if they're smaller than a pixel so
smaller than a pixel it's something
that's very common in a graphics card if
you're playing a game things that are
sufficiently far away you just don't
draw you let the graphic system call
them out in contrast that was marks
might actually be really meaningful in
this kind of visualization interface
even if they're quite far away or quite
small so we need a bunch of graphics
infrastructure to try to do a smarter
job of calling than just throwing
everything away the nice thing about
this approach is instead of having to do
some kind of a brute-force complete
search you can know if you don't see a
mark it truly isn't there so it can try
and make the task of navigating to
understand the structure more easy so
this approach actually does scale up on
to millions of nodes and not just from a
graphics point of view the algorithms
but from a perceptual point of view
actually understanding what the picture
means we've got this idea that we
guarantee mark nodes being visible and
you can have multiple areas of focus now
yet again all of these kind of
distortion based approaches aren't going
to work well if you have to do something
where distance estimation where
matters now a lot of tasks for your
drawing trees you just care about
topological structure like this is
connected to that it doesn't necessarily
matter exactly how far away that is
although for some biological tasks it
does matter and of course having this
infrastructure that guarantees that
these marks stay visible does require
some infrastructure although we've got a
paper published last year that goes into
the details of how to do all this
efficiently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
