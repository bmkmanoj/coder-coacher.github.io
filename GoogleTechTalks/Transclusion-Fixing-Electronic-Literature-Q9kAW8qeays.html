Tech Talk can everyone hear me
is the mic working doesn't matter does
it so I'm going to just briefly
introduce Ted Nelson he started in the
computer field in 1960 he called himself
a philosopher and a filmmaker and
believed that the field needed the ideas
that came from him from both philosophy
and filmmaking and accordingly in the
fall of 1960 he began designing new
constructs for a world of personal
computing and new constructs for a world
of electronic documents which he called
hypertext and others think his visions
of personal computing and electronic
documents have come true but Nelson sees
these worlds as having gone all wrong
personal computing should make life
easier and deep hypertext should make
personal computing easier as well make
the processes of writing annotation
version management document
intercomparison
and content reuse easier Nelson believes
all these are still possible and that it
is still his duty to make things right
and what he's going to do today is
explained to us how we might do it
together Thank You Ted Nelson
I'm very pleased that Google has
announced its objective as organizing
all the world's knowledge that's always
been my objective too but the approach
I've taken has gone in very different
directions from the computer world one
of the things I've discovered is that
the clearer your vision the harder it is
to explain because that means there are
more and more details for the other
people to assimilate my different dog
angle Bart has this same problem in fact
a lot of us old-timers have the problem
that nobody sees the way we originally
thought it should be and like Doug and
various others Ken Iverson al Bork I
continue to work on my original vision
trying to ignore the misunderstandings
that have produced the present world I
believe that and I have not tried to
exhume all my notes but there are notes
I have in profusion I believe that in
the fall of 1960 essentially within two
or three months of starting a computer
course I had a whole vision of a world
of personal computing and Industry of
personal computing which would change
the world because it was obviously clear
that the computer screen would be the
home of human work for the indefinite
future now there were very few at that
time but hey I had brochures from
Digital Equipment Corporation that
showed screens I'd seen NORAD pictures
what more do you need
the point is once you understand what
programming is hey it's all in principle
very simple it's all just a small matter
of programming or jazz mob
so essentially the first question I
asked because I also had a universal
vision that gradually crystallizes
a vision of a world of self-publishing
hypertext for the whole of humanity I
asked how can we improve on paper that's
not what they asked at Xerox PARC what
they asked at Xerox PARC is how do we
imitate paper with all its deficiencies
it's rectangular imprisonment it's
restricted cognitive connectivity its
lack of space and so we have Microsoft
Word Adobe Acrobat and the World Wide
Web all of which are simulations of
paper under glass because you can't
write on it you can't put sticky notes
on it oh they're always these these
these little fringe applications but
nothing general they can be used by
everyone so to this simple question how
do we improve on paper I thought of many
possible answers but one kept coming
back to me from about 6 or 7 different
pathways we can keep each quotation
connected to its original source now
what does that mean in today's formats
and terms absolutely nothing because
that's not what they did at Parc and
that's not what the paper wallopers
chose in imitating paper you see they
wanted to sell printers they wanted to
feed the paper publication process
whereas it seemed to me the objective
was to free the human race from the
prison of paper
so see each quotation in its original
context you say keep every quotation
connected to its original source now
this is manifestly impossible isn't it
no it's not it's quite possible and here
we are is our first demo of the Xanadu
transporter which you can download from
Sam to Australia and it is a collage of
quotations from here and there as I move
the mouse across each quotation is
separated and when I click there's the
original context okay we'll do it again
original context how are we doing that
because through an ingenious use of
cascading stylesheets
on this and a compliance server at the
University of Southampton the ePrint
server which some of you may know which
has as a default setting the delivery of
context when will it deliver this
context why when you use an EDL let's
let's look at another in honor of my
partner marlene Mallicoat let's look at
the let's look at the one she created
which is a little more coherent if I can
find the cursor there we
what does information want information
wants to be expensive who said that oh
is it coming there we hire information
wants to be free all right here's
another one
okay now how do we do this we do this by
a different representation of documents
you see there is a tradition in some
quarters in the computer field of what
we can call righteous oversimplification
let's solve this problem by doing the
first 60% they say I think that was a
Bell Labs slogan then we'll worry about
the rest but of course very often by
that time you're so embroiled with the
problems of the first 60% that you never
get to the rest and more important
you'll never get to the moon that way
there are some problems that have to be
tackled as a whole no matter how big so
the simple notion of documents the way
documents have been done oh okay
may bring this back how document have
been done is like Scrabble tiles in a
box a document is newborn we'll call
this a simple document a document is
newborn or assumed to be newborn and
each character is simply a consecutive
piece in this long row of characters it
has no identity it doesn't know where it
came from
and there you are well that gets you a
certain distance but it certainly
doesn't ring the bell as far as I'm
concerned let's look at the format for
the documents I just showed you here
again was the transportation page I'll
put that up and we'll look at the the
EDL which generated that what is an EDL
excuse me
I have to find it on the net sorry we go
to Xanadu Australia here we are yup we
go to Santa to Australia
and
I thought I had an a deal in there II do
is a Hollywood term and it refers to
edit decision list if you make if you
make a video if you make a movie you
take your footage to the so called
offline editing switch yeah offline
editing system and there you transfer
all the footage to stuff you can view on
the screen now you rearrange it and
choose the final or semi final structure
of what you want to show it then spits
out a floppy disk or put something on
your thumb drive which is the list of
shots one at a time that will generate
the actual movie you want you then take
that list of shots to the so-called
online session and it copies all the
video shots on to the final tape so an
EDL is a listing of the portions to be
put together now there's only done with
with video and movies at the present
time but in fact so here we are here's
the here's the EDL for what I just
showed you coming at us
right so this is a little longer a
little wider than you wanted to be here
is the document from which we're quoting
or rather here's the Dakin from which
recording and there is to this we have
appended and address within the document
saying I want to start with character
one nine four two and go on four 879
characters and similarly for the rest so
it extracts a string and that extraction
is done at the server but done does not
have to be thus concatenating the
resulting piece now why do you want to
do that there can be a number of reasons
one of them is that you can edit the
document and the addresses of the
content never change this is the key
you see everybody says how can you
possibly have none change non-breaking
links when people change the document
and the answer is if you distribute an
EDL and the links are two spans of
content they do not break all right
that's enough that was kind of abstract
what we seem to be if I don't wiggle the
mouse it goes dark let us look then at
the at what this results in when we go
to the new version of what my group is
working on
there we're not okay I'm one of those
people who keeps clicking when things
don't happen and that's not always a
good idea okay
so here is a document space let's see
running two windows on a on a screen it
takes a little more skill and I have
there we go okay here is a cluster of
documents if we had a nice fast graphics
machine we'd see much better what's
happening hundreds of millions I think
anyway millions of teenagers have
wonderful graphics software and they get
fabulous response but nobody's been
using this kind of thing for documents
this was partly designed by a teenager
we're still trying to fix it this is a
prototype dot the system is called
Xanadu space and we expect to give away
the viewer and sell the editor and what
you're seeing we call a flight of time
just trying to position this thing sorry
what you see we call a flight of
documents a flight of four documents and
on the Left what we can zoom in on it
this is a familiar document known as the
Declaration of Independence by Thomas
Jefferson promulgated in 1776 not as
sharp as it ought to be I can read it
from memory we hold these truths to be
self-evident that all men are created
equal that they are endowed by their
creator with certain unalienable rights
that among these are life liberty and
the pursuit of happiness we have linked
this to a corresponding paragraph in the
Virginia Declaration of Rights very slow
response here because partly because
we're refreshing the documents in full
and not optimizing right now so in the
Virginia Declaration of Rights
it says correspondingly in a rather more
pedantic phrase by written by George
Mason that all men are by nature equally
free and independent
and that they have I'm saying from
memory because we don't see it off the
side that they have certain inherent
rights of which when they enter into a
state of society they cannot buy any
compact deprive or divest their
posterity namely the enjoyment of life
and liberty with the means of acquiring
and possessing property and seeking
happiness and safety so this is an
important historical relationship
between these two Parrikar there we are
between these two paragraphs third
document over is the English Bill of
Rights and fourth document over is the
is John Locke's two treatises on
government I think one of the reasons
that this is so big right now so slow is
that where we are we are refreshing all
of John Locke's two treatises on
government no why should there be only
one view of the document because they
had a slogan at Xerox PARC WYSIWYG what
you see is what you get what does that
mean it means what you see on the screen
is what you get when you print it out
this sneaky phrase propagandize --is
turning the computer into a paper
simulator if we want to do more than you
can do on paper
WYSIWYG won't allow it and I think we
should have as many views as the as the
user could possibly want for example
rolling up a document in a ring for
example seeing them lined up at the top
or seeing them lined up according to the
link and by the way and we're saying not
link here but flink for a very important
reason these have no relation whatever
to HTML links HTML links are embedded
and therefore can only point outward
they cannot overlap and they have no
types need I well you can read my
apology and New Scientist last summer
for any part I had in creating HTML
links
because I think this is one of the worst
things that's happened to the human race
now that we are that everybody thinks
that's what a link is okay so these
links our first class freestanding
objects they are applied to the content
by the addresses the stabilized
addresses of the content so you can have
any number of overlapping links of any
type on this document on any of these
documents I proposed you that this
structure is a generalized structure for
all media not just for text but for
audio for video and we can fit in
everything else not just this view of
course but the fact that what we allow
parallelism parallelism and Inter
comparison so let me go back a little
bit in history to inter comparison
here's a picture from my very first
published or pardon me my I guess was my
second published piece but it was for
the ACM national conference I was what
24 and all the computer scientists in
the America were there I think in
Cleveland and I called this zippered
lists and what does it mean it's it it's
rather more abstracted than I see it now
and I realize why people had difficulty
understanding it the idea is you're
going to compare two things side by side
and this they're set up in advance for
comparison side by side and this one is
connected to that and this one is
connected to that so when you bring them
together they line up so you see the
corresponding parts and the differences
so this notion of inter comparison
side-by-side has been the center of my
designs for the last 46 years and it
seems to me if if there's one thing the
web doesn't have it's the ability to
inter compare things side by side and
see the differences and to annotate them
the way they ought to be a knitted yes
there a lot of local annotation sites
but nothing general so this is the
that's one view of it now let's
generalize it slightly yeah I've got to
change the magnification good old Adobe
Acrobat paper CIMMYT what area
sorry ok magnification did not change
thank you
why doesn't it want to change the
magnification oh okay one last try all
right so so basically the this was the
picture I saw I had in my mind of how
documents would weave together for side
by side into comparison over an ever
ever expanding tissue so I stand by that
that is the general idea and I'm just
showing you the structure it took us a
long time to work out that structure the
first structure I came up with was at
Brown University or the first structure
I'd implemented was at Brown University
and that was where is it now there's two
window thing really is a challenge yeah
okay this was one one of the sheets of
paper I worked out for for the president
as we were starting firing up the Brown
project but here we see essentially the
hypertext we know now except that's with
direction that swih thout direction
there's another one somewhere in this
complex with with the arrows so this was
the simplification I came up with in
1968 because the guy at Brown was in a
hurry but my team with the Xanadu
project as far as I'm concerned came up
with this true structure of documents in
1981 and that's what we're working with
now and that's what I've just presented
to you essentially by we can fulfill all
of these criteria all of these separate
objectives of a document in one
structure
nothing is embedded not even formats
links are applied from outside links
become user selectable and transclusion
czar not tracked but discovered from the
addresses so let's talk about
transclusion
it seems to mean two different things
if a document sends for a piece from
somewhere else I call that trans
delivery because it is coming from the
other place transclusion I define as the
same thing Noah bleah in two places so
that we can compare side-by-side and
know that this quotation is next to its
original whether or not the version of
that quotation we're seeing came from a
cache or somewhere else trans delivery
is now supposedly appearing in certain
web formats transclusion of the kind I'm
describing is a little trickier because
of course it we want to set it up for
side by side into comparison we want to
be able to use the side by side
structure which is natural to documents
don't you want to be able to annotate
everything why can't we annotate audio
recordings why can't we annotate video
because of the narrow hermetic view
everyone has taken of these separate
things as if they were separate whereas
there is only one media conglomerate in
the universe and we want to understand
it all so being able to annotate it
being able to structure it being able to
restructure it in place re-edit it in
place without changing it all these
things are vital
why do we want to see what contents are
the same well some of us are more
scholarly in orientation than others but
I have an anecdote I was once editor of
a magazine called creative computing and
someone submitted a paper on the small
talk language now I had been irritated
by the way that small talk was being
hoarded by Xerox PARC they were not
giving out information about it and Alan
Kay had had an article in Scientific
American about small talk which I
thought was pompous and odious and
difficult to understand where is this
new article that was submitted to me was
clear on the button and excellent so I
ran it guess what some bozo had retyped
Ellen Kay's article changed every
instance of we - they and submitted it
to create a computing magazine and I had
not recognized it why was it so much
better written than Alan Kay because
something had changed in me and if I
were not able to know these articles
were the same I would not have had that
listen of course the guy who wrote it
really got a lesson
both Alan and I wrote to his academic
department asking for mercy for him but
he was out the so I believe that being
able to master and understand the
relations of documents and their history
is very very important and this kind of
recognition of where things come from
which we do not have as a facility and
therefore don't miss if we had it what
could we do the idea that next to every
quotation you can see its original
context anytime you like the idea that
ok you watch it you watch on the TV
excerpts from movies I want to say hey I
want to see the rest of that keep going
why can't we do that you want to be able
I would like to be able to take a DVD
and re-edit it it's my DVD ok I can
forget a new list of the pieces in it
see them any way I want maybe some
people won't like that till they see a
new revenue stream the point is that we
want to give people control and
understanding of all media and right now
the extremely limited formats that hold
us back I think need to be shaken a
little bit now I spent the 1990s partly
in Japan trying to understand the world
of the desktop as it was evolving and
the world of the web and see how I can
fit my stuff in it I'll show you one
example which was which we called cosmic
book
I proposed in 1972 that we should have
side by side in a connection between
hypertext documents and people said Oh
Nelson doesn't understand computers but
we finally implemented this in Windows
like so so here we see can we see them
huh are we not seeing that the lines
between them well dang okay I think
maybe I've got too many applications
open all right never mind that in any
case that's that's the lesson you would
be seeing if this were working properly
but you're seeing a line between this
and that between each of these separate
windows
I guess the machine is overloaded but
that basically the the difficulty of
implementing this using Windows tools
and using a standard standard Windows
windowing methods made it clear to me
that I can't work that way and similarly
for the web the nothing I want to do can
be done in the web browser that for that
we have to go to an entirely different
viewing mechanism and that's what we're
starting with here as I think I
mentioned the viewer will be free and
the editor 30 bucks probably to begin
and that will allow you to create
flights of documents like this so
instead of sending unate ated unlinked
documents to people you can send a
flight of documents like this with ever
so many different link types and
transclusion
open and ready for the viewing so that
is essentially the kind of structure we
now see let me open let me give you
another example of the
Xanadu space structures
this is essentially today's
implementation of the picture you see
there it
you know I just have to worgle around
with the keys just a little bit sorry
ma'am
turn it sorry
there we go okay here we have three
documents that were just lying around my
computer and we have created a little
table a little trans cluesive table of
contents here I'll zoom in on it sorry
so this consists of a series of
headlines trans cluded from the actual
documents of the words the Xanadu space
hypertext transclusion and so forth are
featured on it all it is is a table of
contents for going around the others so
now as we step through it you'll see on
the left we step to the next item in the
list and everything lines up accordingly
now if you're like me and if you like
some writers this might be the current
version you're working on this might be
an outline and this might be all the
stuff you'd like to work into the
document if you have time so this
structure keeps them lined up side by
side by side in the way that other
documentary structures do not so that is
justice just a hint at the kind of
working mechanisms we can build with
this now if you're it seems to me this
would be very useful for programming
conventionally programmers embed their
comments embed their labels and so on
but there's no reason that these can't
be side-by-side
for a simpler way of reading the
contents so this gives you a different
way of seeing and manipulating documents
using trans cluesive table of contents
so
in this infrastructure everything is a
transclusion meaning that all you have
is a series of pointers to spams they
can be slow cailli local spans of text
they can be remote spans of audio etc
these to be composited in the viewer in
the viewer the links or Flinx are then
attached directly to the addresses of
the content and so it must be selected
by either those who are constructing the
document or by the user who only Dane's
to turn some of them on and some of them
off but this is a highly generalized
mechanism and need not be restricted by
any particularity of the structure now
this leads to the copyright solution
I've always wanted here was my ID in the
fall of 1960 and again as I say as an
early adopter I was always an early
adopter at the age of 6 I guess it was I
sent for things you've strapped on your
shoes that had Springs imagining myself
going down the block at an enormous
speed and immediately sprained both my
ankles when I was 12 or 13 I dreamt of
having my own earth satellite so when
everybody was a stud when most people
were stoned that Sputnik went up in 57
my view was what the what took them so
long and I've always wanted to make life
more convenient let make life easier and
increase human knowledge so it was very
cynical as a young man I thought god
there's no hope for politics there's no
hope for change the economic system
there's certainly no hope for the
educational system what can I believe in
and then I discovered the computer wait
a minute now we can make people smarter
no we can make people smarter so what
are the document structures that will
really increase human understanding
so the simple hypertext we have now was
a part of that yes but I think we have
to go much further now the copyright
system I envisioned and this was all I
think within the first three to six
months of thinking about this ok let's
let's go back to the frame of mind I had
I thought I would try to build something
like what is now AOL it would be the
utility something like perhaps Google
you would sign on and you would publish
anything you would pull out a document
and if copyrighted portions were used
you would be billed for those sections
which you then owned so if you like buy
a book even though whenever you came
back to the Machine you own those
portions and when you publish something
correspondingly if other people read
them you would get a royalty as well now
I think that's pretty good
why in a world where copyright is some
say under threat continue to hold this
view because the big copyright holders
are not going to let go they own most of
the stuff ok and while Creative Commons
is great for new small publishers it's
not going to shake loose the academic
presses or Hollywood vaults or any of
the writings after 1922 so the objective
from as I see it is to engage the
publishing industry in a new form of
micro-purchase so let's take let's
transpose that first notion that which I
gave you is a very simplified picture of
how to do it from a single utility let's
transpose it out now to today's dits
distributed system how could it possibly
work in today's distributed system and
the answer is through a system of micro
payments allowing each person to buy
individual quotations selected
what about getting permission to publish
the quotation you don't need it because
all you're sending out is an EDL which
invites the user to bring in this piece
or that piece nothing wrong with that
now the question is do you have a
legitimate way of obtaining that piece
and for those publishers who sign into
this form of publishing it will be a new
revenue stream I hope already it's a
small start but the biggest publisher in
Brazil will be putting their travel
articles under this system as an
experiment and I'm working with the
people that creative commons to put the
trans copyright license we call it trans
copyright because it is a copyright
license and so it has C in the circle in
the middle but if you put trans in the
front it is saying and you too may use
it and quote it freely according to the
two criteria one is that each downloader
obtains each quotation separately to
fill the holes in the ADL and secondly
that each quotation remains connected to
its original context so that nothing is
out of context and the reader may if
desiring continue on in that same
content no copyright is a difficult area
to tread because almost everybody's
heels are dug in for their own position
and it's extremely hard to get this
position heard because it does not fit
the current fight the current copyright
fight which is essentially reminds me of
the fight in Fantasia between
Tyrannosaurus and Stegosaurus will steal
at all you can't have any let's steal it
all you can't have any and I'm saying
there's a win-win solution in between
that changes the granularity of purchase
the granularity of ownership and
liberates and benefits everyone
now I suggested in the write-up that if
trans cluesive formats come in they
certainly ought to be recognized by
Google so that instead of just saying
there's a document here you can also
mention somehow that the other sources
from which it comes
and provide that line of connection for
those who want to maintain or follow
those connections so some people have
accused me of insisting on perfection
and I said no no no no no I don't want
things be perfect I just want the 90
percent of hypertext that the web cannot
possibly deliver so thank you and I'll
be happy to hear anything you say when
you publish the e do you have an ISP and
you're paying the ISP to put it there as
with today's web documents someone
downloads it if the content is free then
the EDL is fulfilled at no cost if some
of the content is not free you're in
court your request reaches the server of
the publisher a micro payment request is
then made to the downloader and if that
transaction is successful it comes in
the I strongly suggest a watermark with
the with a receipt rather than stronger
DRM certainly to start and I don't favor
DRM but I do hope people can see the
benefit is thank you
nice listen oh oh sorry yeah I didn't
see the microphones that's just that's
something else that's a corresponding
and-and-and-and counterpart structure
and whether or not it's a copyright
violation is none of my business that's
the problem the of the of the rights
holders if we want to register it then
you create a flink that says this is a
corresponding this this portion
corresponds or or should be compared to
this well sir they referred things you
talked about character positions about
what character positions yeah and this
creates for me a problem because it
means that if I want to make a document
available for transclusion that means
that I have to promise to keep it
available and unchanged for all time
because if I change one character than
all their all the quotations change no I
do you distribute an EDL which then
makes that yes the guy who holds and
controls the original text yes that EDL
is pointing to yes but then but then you
your next version that you promulgate is
also an EDL we regards that original
source as a source pool and then your
you do another version you do it as an
idio so that the so that the addresses
don't change so the original has to stay
is change the culture yes but but it
does not restrict your changes it only
restricts the way in which you
distribute them okay thank you so what
lessons from the adoption of the web do
you think can be applied to the Xanadu
system
because I tend to say harsh things and
occasionally things I don't want to say
I think I'll pass on the question you
described you said that the original
source is that you don't copy the source
into the the new document it's it's
copied by reference essentially if I see
what I'm concerned about that in the
context of of trust if I'm quoting for
example a political enemy who's made a
statement that they don't want to make
and I've caught them out in this and I'm
explaining why this is bad
what's to stop them from going and
editing the original text and making
changes so that their statement is no
longer you know is doublespeak gone this
is not a system for controlling
everybody this is a system for voluntary
participation and if if people start
doing that you watch them it basically
it's people who are in the game and who
aren't in the game if you may if you
make that change you're not in the game
and obviously if we want to go on
checking on who's doing what they're we
do all kinds of hashcode tricks and so
on to make sure nobody knows but that's
another side of things so he was saying
you could quote the original person I
there are the people behind me but the
the essential thing essentially you're
saying if you're not playing that game
you're gonna need to start including
text directly the issues are the same
regardless you can you can use the same
methods on net and web material it's
just that the tracking issues become
more difficult if you with for people
who are within the game it's a matter of
administration and and pragmatics who
people outside the game it gets more
complicated but you were still using the
same methods of tracking and address
equivalence and caching how do you know
who's in the game anytime you set up a
system like this especially when there's
money involved in micro payments you'll
get humongous community of spammers and
people who try to get you to make money
a few reading spam that's a very good
point
I won't paper spam and the questions
help me you know how are they going to
attract me to spam I used to read a lot
of spam until I figured out that it
wasn't worth it take a little bit if it
says in the name of God dear so-and-so
you quit a question about your
oppression oh but I think of a fairly
famous paper that came out about 1968 by
sty dextra on the discipline of go twos
yeah I so too statement considered
harmful
yes yeah I was wondering when that came
out what we should take on it did you
see it relevant to things you were
working on I bring it up because I think
it has in it there's a lack of
discipline you talked about the Internet
there's a lack of discipline in terms of
forming links that
going back to Dijkstra's paper I think
he he could called for a discipline
within programming and I see sort of an
analogy there
well you might look at my piece called
embedded markup considered harmful which
ran in the XML journal a couple years
ago I applaud what Dijkstra was trying
to do and what we had it was first
structured programming and somehow that
segwayed into object or in programming
but I don't know that whether that gave
us any lesson about order or not because
object-oriented programming ain't
standard either and and the the hopes of
unification that it seemed to promise
have gone away but still those of us who
try to simplify and clarify take take
inspiration from it thank you had any
notion of me so there do you have a
notion of like different versions of a
document I suppose where you publish a
different version this is following up
on a question about three questions back
about somebody changing the original
source and in some cases you you can
release a new decision list and there me
do that and that's the second version of
the document but what about when the
original version of value so all of the
all of the clients who were putting the
original version of the document are
still quoting the original version right
because these are all like character
lengths character based character
precision based right now obviously we
we can we can move on to optimizations
which which would say ok now after
version 6 we're going to go to a new
base addressing set thing of them so
it's not locked in submit I should tell
you that that the versioning scheme we
have is rather more simple than anybody
else's which which is just saving every
other every editorial change so that you
can roll back and forward in time and
also go sideways this was implemented by
Kenichi ohmae
at Cairo University under my in one of
my seminars and it works beautifully and
so we are reimplemented that so that
you'll be so that you will be able to
get an EDL for past present and sideways
versions
and also to transclude from one version
sideways to another what I'm interested
in this if you have links to a like I'm
interested in a particular piece of
information in the document not
necessarily how its laid out in a
particular in in the context but I want
that fact and say that fact in the
original document is discovered to be
wrong to be in to be incorrect or to be
slanderous or libelous I guess and that
original version needs to be changed as
the system allow for me to reference
notice that you can rewrite it you take
that ETL and you change the part you
want now how does anybody know you've
rewritten it well there's the end of
comparison facilities that's one of the
things one of the things we had to drop
from the Zen reduce the the older
senator structure so that finding
automatically that you've changed that
version will be very difficult whereas
that was also part of the spec in the
1981 Xanadu but being able to the fact
that you can put a note on a document
saying I have changed this and you'll
see my better version could be
beneficial to everyone say I don't know
the performance specifications of a
particular car saver of a jeep the jeep
FDA or the Toyota and whatever they have
to FJ cruiser so I with the with the
outward pointing links I can point to a
page that says this is where the
specifications are and that's the
authoritative source whatever they say
is what I believe
but with these Flinx I'm taking a
particular you know incarnation of those
specifications and then tying my
document permanently to that particular
incarnation distinction between the EDL
on the Flex the EDL is the content which
is collage underneath and then the Flinx
are any relationships or structures
imposed above whether a source is
authoritative or not is a social issue
you could say social and political issue
which will not change and who and
whether they have posted a thing whether
Toyota has posted weather versus whether
Joe bozo has posted it still becomes an
issue and I think that that is separable
from the structure
is that helpful room blink is as I
understand it if link is a reference to
a particular subset of a particular
version of a document no if link is any
relation or structure which you wish to
superpose so that so that a marginal
note a comment or a jump link a plant of
vanilla jump link ala the web all of
these are represented by flakes but they
are logically different in that their
inclusion in a document is nominal so
that they may or they may or may not
have been born in a document but they
may come from some other document but
all of this is visible it's a it's a
it's a it's a discussion given given you
have this system how do you get the
existing corpus of paper documents into
it in a reasonable way oh that's a
political question if there ever were
one and I'd like to know personally so
it's these are these are these are
matters of financing I was pleased to
see an ad the other day for a library
service where they come to you and
digitize I think this may very well bode
interestingly for the future because
remember we see we've seen Best Buy
we'll send their Geek Squad to repair
your computer on-site and similarly
digitization squads may be available in
the future like people come and and
photograph your wedding so I think that
that's that could be one one Avenue
which I hope will be become affordable
it's though it's the connections and the
links so if if an existing document has
a bunch of quotes from other documents
how does all that get reconnected in a
way I would have liked to have seen it
done in the first place
Hey I guess Google will do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
