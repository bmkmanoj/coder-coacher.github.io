for bit pusher and this talk is sort of
predicated on a somewhat presumptuous
assertion which is that bit pusher who
is orders of magnitude smaller than
Google faces some similar operations
challenges and and that our perspective
on some of that stuff may be useful to
you and I hope it is so the general
concept behind the talk so we're oh I
didn't yeah I didn't give a whole lot of
background so i've been i've been doing
you know internet operations for well my
career sort of followed when i was in
academia the internet was an academic
thing went to non-profit kind of done
the whole bin with the whole internet
space for a long time started as a
systems administrator done operations
management non knox stuff like that and
and then a few years ago i started my
own company doing web operations and so
what what bit pusher does is we we work
with small companies or actually some of
them a large companies but small web
applications where the it doesn't
necessarily make sense for them to hire
their own team or they just want it done
more efficiently then you can do a team
when you're managing a relatively small
environment so and in well I guess I've
kind of covered a little bit about about
bit pusher I and so it so our approach
is as a kind of complete outsource right
so are we look at it as it's our job to
make it unnecessary for our customers to
have a web operations team at all
they've got their developers and and
then operations is a different set of
competencies and and that's what we
focus on I one of the things that comes
up
early frequently for us is we r you know
the the other the other companies that
have on paper the same portfolio of
services are you know IBM Global
Services will sell the same combination
of the services and the infrastructure
we do the hosting as well and get a lot
of efficiencies out of that which is
actually where where the core of the
talk is and I and so we you know so we
find ourselves actually competing on on
a number of deals with IBM Global
Services mcmc I and 18t their their
consulting arms things like that and
even when we're not because those are
the only companies that have the same
nominal set of services we're often
asked to compare ourselves and I and
again on paper we looked very similar
one of the things that comes out right
away when we're actually bidding against
them as we end up being about a third of
the cost and given given that we're
providing the same set of services
people are a little bit you know a
little bit suspicious of that at first
and I and again that's sort of where I'm
going with this talk is on some of the
things we do to address that challenge
of being efficient and in particular in
our in our context the big challenge is
efficiency managing a lot of different
services on the same infrastructure and
the the thing that that comes up that
fundamentally distinguishes the way we
go about the web operations problem
relative to relative to these larger
companies is if you go to IBM yeah
they're going to obviously use their
their facilities and their and their
network but they're going to essentially
treat each web application as a silo
that it's it's it's own thing and and
focus on all right what's the best way
to do each of these layers for your
environment and we take a different
approach and it's not a black-and-white
thing but our whole
outlook on it is that word building
we've got one infrastructure platform
that I that we're taking we're taking
these services and figuring out how to
integrate them into that platform and do
it efficiently so and and really the
biggest the biggest way this changes the
game is that we're tackling different
problems we're when you're when you're
asking what's the best way to set up
this service in you know and you're
really just looking at that service
you're going to ask very different
questions then what's the best way to
integrate this service into a larger
environment and and so the the
fundamental challenge you end up with is
you know we're going to keep taking on
more and more diversity in our
environment and we we still want to keep
those economies of scale make it as
efficient as possible even though we're
going to have a pile different services
and in our case we have really very
little say about the code right these
are services that people are writing we
don't support every language out there
but we you know we have a variety of
languages variety of platforms but but
the goal is to to maintain the
efficiency as that grows and so there I
have kind of two quick quick answers to
how do we how do we tackle that one is
is the all right we're not reinventing
the wheel for each customer right we're
not we're not looking at every choice
about how do you configure apache or how
do you you know configure this layer
that layer separately for each customer
we're if you know for the most part
you've got configurations that work and
that you know what their properties are
no need to reinvent that the the of
course the flip side of that is you
don't you know some applications need
some amounts of customization so you
can't be foolish about it and and any
more flip answer is smart processes
right you know it's it's about how do
you tackle the test
how do you go about it I it's it's not
the the magic isn't in some piece of
technical magic that we bring into the
tape bring to the table it's really
about how do we how do we go through the
steps that we go through and what you
know what are those steps so before I
get into the real need of the of the
talk i wanted to talk a little bit about
the relationship between process and
work i mean the first first thing is you
know when when people talk about process
oftentimes they talk about in a very
sort of prescriptive mindset right okay
so you don't design processes and that
tells you how to work well the reality
is that's not how things work in the
real world right if you design processes
in a vacuum they're not actually going
to be implemented and and getting good
at that feedback loop is what's going to
get you good good processes that
actually work with the way the way your
operations team operates and my
perspective on this is the REE the
reason you hire smart people is to
design processes not a reason you hire
them the reason you hire them if you can
hire people who are competent and
competent and you can automate a lot of
things with computers and that's great
for executing processes that exist but
the whole reason you need smart people
is because you don't already know this
is the best way to do it right so so a
whole I find to me this is this is a
premise of almost any kind of teamwork
environment is that you really need to
get that feedback loop going you're
hiring smart people to think and to
think about what's you know always
improving it what's a better way to do
it and so forth actually covered that so
so I'm going to define something that I
call a con an economy of focus and what
it is
a choice of problems to solve with
certain criteria for those problems so
first you're trying to pick two so it
actually let me step back for just sex
so the the thing the reason I'm talking
about economies of focus is when I
looked at our own processes and you know
what's the you know particularly when
when I get asked that question about how
do we do what we do so much cheaper than
a lot of big companies do you know what
you know I know it's it's it's in our
processes right but when I really sat
down and said all right what what are
the key what's the key magic there are
several pieces but economy is a focus
really stood out and and again so an
economy of focus is a it's a choice of
problems to solve the choice so you you
start with a big task I've got this
service you know that maybe I have code
for it but I've got a service I've got
in operations infrastructure I've got to
implement now right so that can be
divided into problems in quite a number
of different ways and and so the
criteria for choosing those problems
that would make it an economy of focus
is one you choose problems which are not
broad you're saying all right I can I
can have someone fairly quickly become
you know become a master at this right
so if I'm tackling a web server
configuration I'm not going to define
the problem as you know do you know
setting up apache in the best possible
way right I'm going to narrow it down
with a set of criteria that that are
appropriate for my environment the same
time that it's narrow it has to be broad
in the sense that you've chosen a
problem that that solution is going to
be useful in lots of different places in
the environment that you know so if I'm
restricting down the the you know to two
or three different ways of setting up
apache I really want to choose those
intelligently so that that's going to
cover as many possible cases as it can
and then the third thing that actually
turns it into an economy of focus is
that you really master it you own that
process it becomes something that you
know you're really good at you as an
organization and so so it's sort of this
kind of combination of its we've taken
we've now down the problem or chosen
problems at a manageable level we've
chosen them intelligently so we're going
to be able to apply them in a broad set
of context and then we said all right
those were going to master we're gonna
we're going to say we're going to be
real experts in that narrow set and the
the other thing in terms of the the
guiding you know to in terms of
economies of focus at a high level it's
you know like a lot of things it's you
know can you necessarily say oh this is
an economy of focus and this is and it's
you know it's not lack and white it's a
set of guiding principles it's not this
is not not processing the descriptive
process sense right this is an approach
that gets us to a place where we can
manage diversity in an efficient way so
the the when you're looking at these all
right what's the problem domain right
what are the things that you need to
solve the the most obvious target for
this approach is your specific technical
choices right like I was talking about
with Apache your you know narrow that
down but i think you know as important
as a as a target for this approach or a
place to apply this is applying it to a
variety of the processes that you do
day-to-day right so you know by thinking
through how you deploy and by deployment
i mean that initial process of taking
the service and implementing it on on
the infrastructure in addition to the
technical choices there's the ways you
go about it the the the how do you
project manage that how do you how do
you choose the steps same things apply
in
in other pieces of the process puzzle as
well so I'm starting looking at at the
technical design and configuration
aspect because that's sort of the the
most obvious and easiest to talk about
and the point here is you could look at
you know however you divide up the
layers that you're looking at your
problem you can look at each of these as
a fairly wide set of problems to solve
or abroad you know there's huge realm
even just from an Operations perspective
there's a huge realm within operating
systems right that you can say all right
you know let's master the best way to
set it up but obviously you're not going
to you don't need to do that to set
something up right so when you're
actually when you actually narrow it
down the whole point is let's let's take
each of each of the different layers
that we're looking at and try to make it
all right with in operating systems
we're going to choose you know one
standard configuration very limited set
of of things you know yeah some will we
may have groups of packages that we do
or don't install whatever but that can
be reduced to almost a non-problem
almost fully automated in in an
Operations environment some layers are
easier to filter down than others and
talk in a minute more about in more
specifics about those but but before I
do I wanted to comment a little bit on
again an economy of focus is a choice of
problems right so the so when you're
choosing problems in in a technical
realm usually you look at things in
terms of a set of layers and there's
there's usually usually when you're
choosing those layers you're trying to
look for you know what sort of the
canonical set of layers what's the
what's the most technically elegant set
of layers and my suggestion is that it
actually makes more sense to be a little
more pragmatic and say all right keep it
technologically simple don't create a
you know a complex problem but let's
let's divide the problem into layers in
a way
that in particular what we found matters
is it fits the way you update that layer
and it fits the way it fits the kinds of
customizations and the modes of
customization that you need to apply to
that layer I'm going to go through a
little bit the specific layers that that
we use in it you know that the point
isn't to say these are the best layers
but I'm going to use them to explain how
we've used our choice of layers to
narrow down the the problem space so
that we can solve we can solve those the
set of small problems in order to apply
broadly to the diversity of services on
on a single infrastructure obviously
things you're taking stock out of the
operating system you know we you know we
use an existing distro we use its
existing update service right it's you
know it's we do filter the updates make
sure that sanity check it but pretty
much this is this is sort of obvious how
you narrow that down one thing about
this is that we don't you can you can
add sorry I lost the thought there so
two things about this one is that we we
don't worry too much about about being
too precise about exactly what's allowed
in and what's allowed out what's the
what's the set of packages we're
installing that actually in our
experience you know at a huge scale it
probably causes you a lot of brief to
have some variation in exactly what set
of packages are installed but in you
know we're at a decent scale and for us
you know it's sort of okay as so long as
we track that that application has those
dependencies it you know we don't stress
too much about that right the the other
thing is we take out of that layer
packages that we often customize we
don't say well if the version in the
distro is good enough for us we use it
and otherwise we don't know it keeps it
much cleaner to to say
if we if we customize it almost ever we
don't count it in this layer right
because it's going to be updated a
different way it's going to be
customized a different way and then you
get confused because it's one of the
things that really helps is knowing with
an economy of focus what is part of the
problem you're solving and what's not
right so so we know you know apache is
never part of OS stock right you know
and a lot of those different layers that
usually get customized or mesa often get
customized we just say no they're not
going to be part of this layer we're
going to treat them a different way we
also have I we also have our set of
stock packages and sort of you know
standard configurations like our ntp
configuration which is pretty much the
same across the board right these also
like operating system yes there's some
R&amp;amp;D work that goes into creating
maintaining this more than at the
operating system level but pretty much
it's also added from an operations
perspective it's it's a set of things
automated you know automated deployments
automated updates though though there is
a bit of a different process because
we're not using the we're not using the
operating system stock feeding process
so it makes sense for us to manage this
as a separate layer I then we have for
us the things like Apache and my sequel
and the whichever language they're using
and so forth what what I can I call
those different things middleware that's
just that my term for the layers of
software that you're not considering
part of the operating system but they
aren't the application code either
they're your support tools they're your
software stack and and within this realm
these get updated very differently each
service does need attention when we
update these and the customizations
happen happen on a per per service or
for us that's a per customer basis so it
doesn't squash it down to his little
work
either in the setup or on an ongoing
basis as these other layers because it
can write because a lot of that you do
need to factor in what is specific to to
the ott to that service but we we try
when i say template-based the point is
that we're going to try to take that and
say they vary but vary within a
relatively small space we're going to
say we're going to say all right the
Apache configuration yeah we've got two
or three basic templates and and you
start from there minor modifications but
because we have a diversity of services
that you know because we have a wide
diversity of services we don't try to
list here the choices you're allowed to
make on these for the most part we say
let's make them let let's say let's
allow any customization but you know
that doesn't really make it completely
different which will handle it at a
different level but but we don't have a
specific set of rules because we can't
anticipate every every customization
that isn't a radical change that we
might want to make so then then we have
what I call the one off middleware
packages this is where we're installing
something that really is unique to this
service whether it's a package we don't
do anywhere else or it just needs to be
configured in a way that you know that's
unique enough that it's not template
eyes you know that again we choose it as
we separate that out as a different
layer because it's I because it's going
to be updated and customized in a
different way
the what I call the always unique
configuration this is actually an easier
part than it sounds like because this is
things like you know your your which
service what are the public facing
services associated with this
application at a you know in an IP
import level so this layer for us though
so this this refers to a lot of the
different networking things that that
are inherently all right define what the
public face of this application is this
needs to go into a bunch of different
places right so this needs to go not
just on the servers but also into the
load balancers and firewalls and and so
this stands out as its own layer I you
know it's just interacted with very
differently and again that that the
update and customization are are
different the the application code
itself is sort of a different piece of
the puzzle right we're the way we look
at it in the way most operations
organizations look at it you know the
code is something you may have some say
in the code you may be able to define
standards but but it's it's you know
it's not really the operations realm and
then the and then the last piece is the
the automation that that you do for for
deploying and administering a given
service and that's another one obviously
it's different it's heavy on on internal
rd as far as how its developed the way
we manage it is also sort of a template
model but at a larger scale probably
probably would be much more much more
formulaic and automated but but still
it's it's going to be again a different
set of problems a different set of of
things to master
so I so as I mentioned before while the
well the the technical realm is the most
obvious place to say all right let's
figure out how to narrow down our
problem domain the the processes are
actually at least as relevant and
interesting because well it's it's the
part that you tend to not be as
conscious about and sometimes you find
it these tend to be very personal right
so you'll get somebody who's really good
at really good at defining the the set
of parameters for setting up for setting
up the service you know what I'm calling
the specification realm and and at some
point those processes mature to the
point where you have everyone doing it
the same way but it's it's not as
obvious that that they're all going to
be that they're all going to be done the
same way by different people people tend
to say all right I'm really good at this
I have my magic for doing it so and so
has his own different way of doing it
right so so so at the process level it
requires being a little more a little
more conscious to really really look at
what that problem domain is where your
your dwelling in it even more in some
levels than the technical side but it
again it's not it's not as obvious to us
sometimes to to think of the the
processes the way we go about doing
things as a problem domain that can be
simplified so the technical process is
10 I'm not going to talk too much about
because they tend to be tied very much
to the the technical design and
configuration for us specification is is
definitely something where we've taken
we've taken that and said all right
let's let's you know for us we're
getting handed these services from a lot
of different places right customers with
completely completely different
perspectives we so we've put a lot of
conscious effort into how do we take
that handoff specify what we needed an
operational level which for us is
actually a handoff between
sales department and the operations
department but but all the way back into
the essentially sales role of of what
are we what are we in our case selling
what are we providing add an operations
infrastructure level and we we say all
right let's do that you know we've
worked out you know the nitty-gritty
isn't all that interesting but we've
worked out how does this work how can we
do this in a way that works for a wide
variety of customers that they don't
feel like they're pigeon-holed into a
process but when we hand that off it
translates really nicely into how is it
going to fit on the operations
infrastructure right and I you know some
of these how do we install test and
troubleshoot code I would say that's
less something that we you know going
back to the three criteria for an
economy of focus you know the the narrow
brought and owned some of them are
higher up on one criteria than another
the thing with installing testing and
troubleshooting code so that part of the
deployment process where you said all
right we've got it running on the
operations infrastructure but isn't
running correctly and how do we make
sure it is and and get to the point
where it's it's going to you know when
its scales we're going to be ready for
it that the focus there is you know if
we don't get to narrow it quite as much
but we spend a lot of effort owning that
process that's something that we have to
be really really good at and then and
then even at the project management
level there are I you know even in terms
of how we communicate to customers what
our project status is we we've kind of
worked out how to do that in a way that
or how'd it had a project managing way
that we have status for customers that
make sense to them right for us that's a
particular problem that we need to solve
because we're we're reporting to
customers that in general don't have any
operation staff so they don't understand
the operations and they don't want to so
we
you have to learn how to project manage
in a way that turns operations stuff
into into business explanations things
that a manager can make sense of and use
so on the management processes and by
management I mean operations management
the you know I mean I think I think the
first one is is one that that you get in
any mature operations organization that
you get good at your tool set right and
if you think about it that that is an
economy of focus that that is something
that that is I think a pretty widely
used concept of all right we're going to
get good at our tool set we're going to
say the that you know the things that we
graph or we you know are the numbers
that we extract we really know how to
use that to identify Oh your problem is
that you're doing a heavy join right so
so getting good at using the tool set
and and the reality is there is a lot in
common with different web applications
so you are you know you can narrow that
down pretty well in in terms of getting
a set of you know relatively small
problem to solve relatively I mean
performance management is a huge realm
but narrowing it down to you know yes
you need you need the expertise in-house
that can do any kind of performance
analysis but the vast majority of what
you do day to day is using the same
tools to identify the same set of issues
so we focus in on that likewise likewise
with how do you how do you update things
how do you do your upgrades as I was
talking about with the choice of layers
we we've chosen our layers so that we
can get those economies of focus that
they you know are we've got our process
for updating the operating system layer
and that just works we've got our
process for operating for updating the
layers that our template eyes dright so
okay we can't just roll out that same
package everywhere we may need to you
know
I mean we have you know about a third of
our customer base is PHP and you know
most of them are unique unique builds
because that's the way PHP is right so I
so but we've got a process down that's
for the template the template eyes
middleware as I call it that gets us I
that we can make it a very routine
process a all right this security issue
came out we do the we do the work on the
on the master on the gold standard
template and then how do we how do we
just build all the others and make sure
along the way that we've managed our
internal knowledge about the different
customers so that we don't trip over
something that was unique about that
customer so getting that process down I
and again this is this is actually you
could look at it as several different
economies of focus in terms of how do we
update each of those different layers
and I think hardware expansion you know
just how do you scale at a pure throw
more servers at it level you know is is
also what's your tool set don't don't
turn it into more or more or more or
broader problems than you need to on the
what I call technology integration is
the the process of like you know wasn't
that long ago that we took our first
ruby-on-rails customer right and we need
to get to the point where that
technology is no so it starts as one off
the first time we do it and eventually
gets to something where as much of it as
possible as automated right and I think
you know when people talk about this
sort of maturing the role of a
technology in your organization the
focus tends to be in how do you get it
to automated right how do you automate
as much as possible in in our experience
when you're managing a lot of diversity
yes getting the scalability automation
is is going to be instrumental but the
focus for us is actually much more on
that copy and change part what i mean by
by copying change so you start with the
one off and then when you implement it
the second time you copy the first one
you make some modifications copied again
third fourth fifth and that
says is really really how you get how
you you know back to the you hire smart
people to design processes that's really
where you design your processes and a
narrow your problem space for your new
technology that you're integrating into
your infrastructure so so we really we
really focus on how do you get that get
that technology move through from the
one-off side of copy and change where
it's the second time you're implementing
it and in as few as few iterations as
possible as few times through as
possible how do you get how do you get
it to the point where it's a template
and then and then you know and then
that's something where the amount of
attention that it requires drops
radically right because it because you
essentially know all right let's look at
the unique requirements of this service
and then we only need to address those
because we've got a good template that
addresses everything that isn't unique
about a given service that we're
implementing so so we you know in the
sense of ownership what scent of
economies of scale economies of focus we
we really focus on that that copy and
change part but also it's having that
focus really helps us helps us design
that design that set of problems that
will say all right how do we how do we
make it so that we've only got three or
four areas that we need to address to
implement the vast majority of rail
services that we might be asked to
implement right how do we narrow down
that problem space we really it's in
this copy and change cycle where we
where we give it where we do a lot of
that work on at on the technical side of
creating creating those small problems
that we can build together to be to be a
fairly complete solution or a broadly
applicable solution I and then just talk
briefly on so improvement processes in
the sense of how do you
you know how do you make sure your
organization keeps getting better what
it does this is this is largely you know
sort of standard operations management
practice but sort of learning from
problems you know every you know any
operations management teacher if you
will will say all right you should learn
you know you do your incident reports
make sure that you actually use them
part of our focus is let's let's pay
attention to how do we end up using the
information from the incident reports
and how do we generate them let's let's
let's narrow down what's the process for
doing it so that it's going to give us
as much value as possible capturing and
documenting the knowledge and and again
this sort of is back to that feedback
loop of of how how you build process you
know you do work use that to build
processes and and if you do that in in
in an intelligent way then you're going
to be able to use that to narrow down
the problem space into these economies
of focus and one that I'm I'm
particularly fond of is capturing
internal complaints it's the old you
know anyone in operations knows you've
got these peeves that that that isn't
the way it should be a mat isn't the way
it should be and that isn't the way it
should be we really try to make sure the
barrier to putting that into a ticket in
our case and you know getting that into
not necessarily actionable because it
may not be a high enough priority but
but make sure that it's that we capture
that and trying to the the interesting
thing from an economy a focus angle in
this is that we try to say all right you
run into these peeves in a lot of
different places and some of them are
some of them are places where your thick
in the middle of something some of them
are ones where you're kind of surveying
things and let's try to make it so that
no matter where you are you've got
something that's a habit that you use
the same the same easy thing to do to to
to register those complaints in
somewhere
where you where it won't just be a peeve
forever if it really should get
addressed so kind of looking back you
know economies of focus will you build a
a high what I call you know high value
mesh of areas of mastery right you're
you're saying all right I'm going to
choose these areas that our organization
is going to master so that that
combination of them is is going to get
me a lot of value relative to the both
the amount of effort that we put in
along the way in in executing those
those processes and also the amount of
R&amp;amp;D effort in or the more training and
training effort in becoming masters in
in those spaces and another way to look
at is it's sort of building blocks the
problem with building blocks is they
they fit together in a certain way right
a lot of where you know where we do a
lot of things in the more template eyes
dwai and that that kind of philosophy we
we use that to get to get pieces that
are more broadly applicable than
building blocks and you know in it just
one more way to look at it is it's sort
of leveraged economies of scale how do
we get an economy of scale before we're
before we're big right well by focusing
in you get to you get to have these
areas where you really are at scale in
solving how to implement it in that
specific way because that's what you do
more than a much larger organization
because you've focused in on that and
then you know so what is what is it
buying US labor efficiency right you
know the whole point is to to get more
for less work that's you know in our
case that's how do we charge a third of
what the big cost the big consulting
firms do I and and in general making
diversity manageable right you know I'm
diversity no matter how much staffing
you have can become a broad set of
problems that I they
that they don't really fit together well
when you're doing it in in in a single
infrastructure and and then also
diversity diversity in you know in a lot
of environments the rate at which you
implement new applications keeps
increasing so how do you manage all that
so that's that's my talk and open to Q&amp;amp;A
or generally kind of comments on you
know how does this land for for you
dealing with a Google scale environment
versus us dealing with a much smaller
environment
the question was are there particular
tools that we find valuable for for this
stuff and the answer is yes and they're
the the familiar roster right so you
know we used our tea for our ticketing
we use we use cacti for our graphing we
have now give us from honoring we use
we're we use we have a custom set of
scripts for for our automated
deployments and an automated
administration and then you know we use
the the sleds distro we one of the
reasons we chose that distro is we like
the we like the way that that they do
the operating system updates the auto
Yost versus kick-start thing yes parfait
so the question is what do we think of
other competitors who are even more
focused than we are that are going to
just focus on certain areas of
Technology in the way that a you know an
engine yarder is in key does and it's
interesting for us you know we've we've
gone back and forth on how brought a set
of technologies to support and what we
found is I do think that it'll at a
larger scale than we are it there are
benefits in focusing down even further
there's there's a whole lot that our
experiences yes you know a PHP app
versus a rails app versus a Java app
there are significant areas that are
unique to those but I would say that
that's probably about fifteen percent of
the total problem space so yes you can
be even more targeted and focused with a
with a more limited set of technology
technologies but it's it's not as big a
benefit as might seem the other thing
that's interesting in it's sort of the
the other side of the coin from
economies of focus is there there's we
actually learn a lot about like we've
learned a lot about caching effectively
for Java because we have to solve that
problem so much with rails right so you
know I mean caching as always and you
know I mean any any technology caching
is going to be key you know any language
caching is going to be key but just the
it turn you know the way job is versus
the way rails is very similar structures
in terms of how you need to solve that
problem so there is at the at the
process design level there is some
cross-pollination between the different
technologies so the you can you can
reduce this to small I it to the point
where we're being two mono focused is a
disadvantage you know and that's that's
where you know the back and forth
between having just general seen your ex
tease and getting good at these things
it's not all economies of focus but i'd
say it's it's a large chunk of what we
do it's it's more than half of the
technical work probably closer to three
quarters other questions
all right yeah when when you're
yeah so the question is how do we go
about communicating to our staff do we
do we say alright be thinking about
layers or do we already hand them those
layers the the the answer is we we try
to communicate it more as an overall
philosophy than as an arrow set right
the and in particular we you know we we
talk about things like okay during this
process of you know you're you're
implementing Yoram you're implementing
our third rails customer that's a key
time to make sure you're capturing that
knowledge and building towards the
template right but in general we're
really more focused on think about it
right but it's it's it's funny because
it's think about it and don't on the
layers side right it's a it's sort of
note if the layers aren't working for
you in any way right this is sort of the
capturing internal complaints let notice
what's out but don't question things for
the sake of questioning them I mean
occasionally you want to do that but in
general when you question things as a
matter of habit you end up with two
diverse to diverse a set of solutions
right so we try to encourage the the
thinking in a high level and there's a
lot of do with this do it by the process
now and use doing it by the process is a
way to learn how we should be improving
the process later wait but die so does
that answer your question yeah yeah
yes so the question is about content
delivery networks and whether we offer
our customers integration with them and
the answer is we we do we we've talked
about it with a bunch of customers we
haven't actually done that yet to be
honest we what we're looking at we would
manage the relationship and and the
services from a CDN we're also looking
at at a start-up that's that's building
some CDN technology that looks like they
may be a good match for us to to partner
with where you know that they're they're
building the software we would build the
ops infrastructure for that because
we've already we've already done a lot
of tackling the how do we tackling some
of those global performance issues I you
know we're certainly not masters at that
but it's I I'd say in the last six to
nine months that's become something that
comes up a lot may have to do also with
taking on some global 100 companies in
your yeah the question is if we were ten
times larger what would we do
differently I think the biggest answer
is if we were ten times larger there
would be more effort spent on the rd
side more explicit effort spent on the
rd side I still think the focus would be
so a lot of this you know there's
there's some explicit right tool
building and and and just fiddling with
the technology in the lab before we
actually roll out a live customer with
it but we tend to really try to combine
that sort of combine the the rd stuff
with the implementation you know even a
lot of the tools that we have they were
built to handle a new need for a
specific customer but they were built
from day one with that eye towards I
towards using them for lots of different
customers if we were larger I think just
as you grow the just the resource
equation comes out that makes more sense
to I you still want to make sure to
collect along the way hmm
this could be improved this tool would
be handy but to have have a little more
of a team that's focused on that i think
would just be a little more efficient
and and would get us some things we get
a lot of those peeves addressed faster
other questions
yeah architecture describing proceeded
cost me to release the other leg
offensive thanks 87 yet as the
architecture you described with the
layers have been tested by the migration
of the major yeah so the question is has
our has our set of layers been tested
across the migration a major operating
system version migration we actually did
just about three months ago we migrated
almost all of our customers there's
still some that for various reasons are
left behind from / 92 / 10 I mean
they're both to six Colonels but it's
you know complete new complete upgrade
on on all the different toolset layers
and it actually was a lot less painful
than we expected we and and I think part
of it is that the different layers that
we sit on top the the layers that the
lot of that template template based
middleware we what we found is because
we're used to those layers rebuilding
those frequently you know it's sort of
you know because they're getting built
for little customizations here and there
it was relatively easy to say all right
we've got to figure out a couple of
things at the base level 44 Apache or
Java or PHP that need to change when we
upgrade the operating system but but
mostly the layers there weren't too many
painful layers because the layer we had
the right layers were being rebuilt
right the right layers that that we
where we do our customizations were used
to rebuilding anyway that's part of the
standard processes you know change the
change the config dot nice and set it
said it going and build a new package
from it that's that really that really I
think made it a lot easier the fact the
fact that we had it had that layer
specifically separate clearly
distinguished
from the operating system layer as
opposed to having a set of tools a set
of tools that that sometimes are in the
OS and sometimes not yes did that yeah
so the question was did that extend also
from 32 to 64 bit transition the the
realities most of our most of our
customers have started 64 bit so we you
know we were using we were using opteron
as of I think three years ago so it's so
it hasn't really been and we've been
doing this you know the company's been
around for for over eight years but in
terms of really this business model
we've been doing doing that about three
and a half and so so we were pretty
small by the time we were you know we
were pretty pretty much got started on
64-bit other questions yeah
so the question is are there customers
we turn away because they're not they're
not the right technology or because we
think they can't be focused we can't get
the economies of focus there and the
answer is sort of known yes the in
general are our sort of pricing model is
that we're willing to customize as much
as you want but you're going to pay for
that level of customization if you're
going to be a one-off you're not going
to get the economy of focus pricing that
says you know if you're really going to
need custom this custom that all the way
through you know you it's just going to
be a lot more expensive but you know
that'll pay for itself if you know and
that in effect ends up turning away some
customers definitely the other kind of
customer that we tend to turn turn away
our customers that I that we will turn
away a customer that will not will not
truly do it outsourced if they say we
still want some administrative access on
these servers that that's that's a
showstopper right we've we learned very
early that sharing responsibility means
that we do way more work not less by
letting them take on some piece of the
problem because they're not going to be
integrated even if they have just as
good an ops team as we do which which
you know isn't generally going to be the
case but even if they did they're not
going to they're going to have a
different way of slicing out the problem
domain they're going to their focuses
are going to be different and without
them being really tightly integrated
into our organization we're we're going
to lose those economies of those
economies even you know even on the
areas where we do it already if they're
tackling the problems from a different
perspective on the same infrastructure
Oh anything else
