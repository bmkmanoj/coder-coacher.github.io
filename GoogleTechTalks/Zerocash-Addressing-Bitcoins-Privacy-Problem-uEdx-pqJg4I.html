morning so it's my great pleasure to
introduce Alessandro Alessandra's abuse
was a PhD student at MIT
he's now a professor at Berkeley and
he's done some fantastic work in crypto
I think he's done excellent work on zero
knowledge proof accent arguments and
he's one of the few people I know who
does some fantastic theory but also
writes really good code and is able to
meet in these big projects like zero
cash and today he's going to talk to you
about applying these zero knowledge
arguments improves to Bitcoin
so take it away thank you and thank you
for having me here today so yeah so
today I would like to communicate two
things with this talk first I would like
to describe to you what I think is a
pretty fundamental problem with Bitcoin
having to do with its privacy and then I
would like to talk about system that we
developed to address it and many of you
might have heard zero cash before but
I'm not how many of you actually know
how it works so too I planned a fairly
technical talk where we jump into the
design and we reason about how exactly
we put it together so I hope to today if
you serve two main takeaways is a wise
privacy problem and so how do I address
it using specific zero improves and not
so just a few words maybe a few more
words about myself so I this is just one
project that I work on but something I'm
very excited about in general are zero
knowledge proof and I really like them
not just because they are a very useful
to us from a technical perspective they
touch upon not just applications but the
theory and application so much boost is
very deep from a mathematical
perspective so it's very exciting to
work on that and so I would this is
something I will not talk about today
but I'm happy to talk about the legacy
after joke all right let's jump in jump
into it and talk about that because
privacy problem problem so let's start
with maybe an allegory and suppose that
your bank approaches you and sort of
offers you a new credit cards
and with the switch clearly we'll pay
almost no fees right and you're a bit
suspicious in Alaska is there any fine
print that says I'm not really but we'll
just publicly broadcast every payment on
your maker so here's for example how it
might be Alice goes to Starbucks she
pays an $8 or sometimes a cup of coffee
I'm going because probably gets
broadcast maybe that should be except
Bluebird right again same thing gets
broadcast to the amount and the time the
bank claim is no big deal it's a very
busy few payment history actually
reveals lots of information let's just
kind of let it sink in okay so there's
many confirmation you could for example
that they use the special to view
doctors that tells something about your
your health right insurance companies
could look at that and use it increase
the premium or even deny coverage
practice women this happens even without
already happens even without people
broadcasting a payment history right
never mind if people did that a it also
reveals not just timing but timing
correlated with specific establishments
so it reveals your travel patterns right
it's a goldmine for stalkers burglars in
fact even assassins this may be like
almost a joke in this country but in
other parts of the world this may not be
such as so much of a joke right so a
from the business perspective if you own
a shop or a small company suddenly you
you're revealing a lot of information
about your suppliers your daily sales in
fact there are laws today that prevent
people with insider knowledge from
training like that right so if suddenly
other sensory information is available
to the public then sort of the training
becomes so public trading and parrot
training so they become almost the same
thing it's very difficult so yeah so
when you say payment is to reveal vast
information it feels like yeah it's
probably right then what you think about
it the worse it sounds okay right so
it's really bad thing right so you
should not accept this deal
and like banks don't do these things
okay and obviously it's not just our
magnanimity in fact probably banks don't
have souls anyways as actually federal
laws that mandate some care with
financial privacy so one example would
be the gramm-leach-bliley Act that
actually mandates pretty hefty civil
penalties to banks for violations of
financial privacy okay so they care
about it but there is good incentives
around attendance of regulations work in
this case so let's go back come back to
Bitcoin there's actually no opt out okay
so the way it works is yeah a every
payment is publicly broadcast and here
how it might look in some abstract way
but you might say well it's not the same
these are just addresses so you see here
alice is not Rita says you know some
some arbitrary address the recipient
doesn't say Bob or uber or Starbucks
whatever it says some other address
those are just addresses well their
addresses are known by everyone interact
with rights at some point you actually
do maybe buy some you show up at the
cashier right and so maybe that person
knows that you were there and anyone
really can analyze the ledger right so
you can actually even though the ledger
is sort of sequence of transactions you
can actually pictorially show them so if
you think about the y-axis as addresses
and time go in that direction you can
literally write down a graph of the way
the cash flows on the on the blockchain
and you can try to infer from the way
the graph looks like about whether this
is changing hands or it's the same hands
right different people and you can
correlate this information with real
world information and suddenly it's
actually not so hard to turn addresses
into real people this has been done
there's not just a practical possibility
the FBI investigation into the Silk Road
dark dark net market was completely
fallacy facilitated of information that
was available on the transaction graph
there's a really nice talk by Kathryn
Hahn who led today the persecution of
several people involved in the Silk Road
and I think there's a TED talk where
describes how the FBI used the
transaction graph information to track
down these people and actually make
concrete cases in court so yeah like
carol information if you also maybe a
more recent example there is a how many
of you have heard of this subpoena to
coinbase
right so the IRS issued something called
like was it John Doe summons to coin
things it said please give me please
turn over the identity of all your
registered customers from like 2013 to
2015
so this means that so by the way we'll
use an exchange for Bitcoin you have to
hand over your identity so coinbase does
know which what is your address and
which is your real will identity okay if
if coinbase were actual were to turn
over all of these records suddenly the
IRS would be able to link your identity
with your addresses at the exchange and
then work backward in future words it
from that learn a lot about your
financial history right so a coin bail
is fighting back because there was no
concrete cause I mean they didn't he
didn't try to elaborate any concrete
argument while I think make a large
fraction of cannabis users might be
evading taxes but still the really is
really worrisome okay
there's also all kinds of academic the
anonymization studies that actually go
ahead and take the transaction graph and
try to extract patterns a real-world
identity is really interesting work to
read basically them the more you look at
the graph the more you can learn it's
actually it's the fact that maybe in
2008-2009 when Bitcoin came about people
thought it was anonymous it was just one
big as
conception okay it's not at all
anonymous is very far from it
so because of this people have tried all
kinds of mitigations to address this
privacy problem one of the useful sort
of sticks is to say well never use an
address
okay just every time you move some money
just whip up some your address the
question or is what you get anything
okay
it really does stop me anytime you have
questions okay it's in my name on Monday
morning maybe you're still sleeping but
then just in case so use a new address
for each payment and so that it's never
the case that you have the payment
appearing multiple times which means
that for sure you can deduce that it was
the same person moving that money you
can also say even more not you could
just get together with your friends
launder money together so what does it
mean you pick some either service or
some trusted friend everybody gives say
one Bitcoin to the trusted friend and
the trusted friend redistributes now
what happens is that save this is Alice
she together with a bunch other friends
pull their money now coming out it's not
clear who is bitcoins Alice's okay this
is just the Bitcoin equivalent of money
laundering which is the traditional so
even the cash based systems is how you
launder money right so you you pass it
through some transactions where kind of
it's not clear where it came up right
now all these mitigations and heuristics
they seem harder to analyze and probably
are harder to analyze this is hard to
quantify and either way tracks remain
okay because for example yeah you have
to get together with your friends some
other friends maybe stayed at home and
didn't participate so you know that they
can participate so it's a small
so-called anonymity set right so either
way there are still correlations and
recent work actually just this year was
analyzing these types of ways of washing
money to protect protector tracks for
example in the context of Manero when
air is not a cryptocurrency I'm not
going to talk about it but essentially
what it does is it mitigates the little
bit
techniques of this sort that are server
they're not just overlaid on top of the
cryptocurrency that can be kinda
custom-designed as part of it but you
need to do these things there's still a
lot of information that leaks through a
transaction so either just mitigations
okay do they make sense at high level
and at the end of the day the history of
all transactions is there to stay
forever okay so maybe today you don't
really understand it me tomorrow you
understand it better and as I as you
correlate more and more addresses with
the real world just the amount of
information that you understand about
the transaction graph in monotonic
increases right just never comes down
right just can only go up right so it's
more even as a simple example suppose
that maybe you have done an excellent
job but using money laundering services
using new addresses for the past five
years and suddenly you interact with
your best friend who is completely
incapable of hiding his tracks
okay everybody knows it's him okay on
the on the on the check who is him on a
transaction graph but they also know
that you're the best friend that you
guys are best friends the interactive
recently suddenly the father he
connected to you right he got the onion
eyes maybe you get annoyed as well right
so you can't even be responsible for
your own fate right so because anyways
your interaction with other people and
they may be careless so this really I
mean even mitigations would be a
compliment to this technique right so in
the long run this is not gonna work okay
I'll be convinced there's a privacy
problem oops I see nothing so I'm gonna
take it as a that you convinced and so
move on from here okay now if even if
you don't care about privacy there's a
separate argument to be made about this
transaction graph that comes from a
fungibility of money how many of you
have heard the term fringe ability okay
a good fraction great
so essentially what it says is that the
dollar is a dollar regardless of its
history the property that was actually
recognized very early on in the history
of money it was actually a lawsuit
dating back to over 350
years ago in England where there was a
thing a merchant the misplaced some bill
that he had marked for forget for what
reason and later he found this bill in
the possession of a bank and wanted to
clean it back because he recognized his
mark and it claimed it was his and in
the end whatever court was worth
deciding the case ruled in the favor
Bank saying that the bank in so legally
acquired that piece of money it doesn't
matter whether in the past of this piece
of money was stolen from the merchant or
which hands it went through the bank
legally obtained it so it was theirs and
as part of the ruling of the case the
the court argued that if history of
money matters to the point where it can
be expropriated from legal owners of
that money later on then suddenly it's
not clear anybody can trust money
anymore right because even the ownership
of money is have you defined okay and in
this from this perspective Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrencies are not fungible
at all because the coins the degree is
it's completely public right it's very
explicit by design almost right and
these are has many dangerous
consequences not just a matter of expert
getting money that may belong to you
that was stolen it can just go beyond
ill-defined value can have yeah
different people who value the same coin
different thing just because they think
differently the same pervert person may
value different coins different inches
because the pedigrees are different
right just think about it write you up
you talk to erections you never talked
before who knows maybe they have one
religion or one political affiliation
and depending upon that they might
interpret your particular Bitcoin very
differently and you can that business
like this wait you can't feel like like
a large stable economy that you can
reason about and in traditional economic
terms when even value is not defined
great and this basically created says
that
new coins are sort of more valuable than
old coins what's the correct premium who
assesses that and now there is almost a
tendency to come back to centralized
architectures where there are central
evaluators at vouched for coins and
maybe the insured them right it's not
where you want to go right so entire
point of the centralization was to avoid
these things so again notice that this
has nothing to do with user privacy yet
it is something that arises because of
the lack of user privacy okay so even if
you are mean is not maybe they travel to
start arming Google cares all about
privacy but an ingenuity didn't care
about privacy
is there enough grounds to worry a lot
about the transaction
yes for serial numbers or I love that
serial numbers or not of course there is
the aspect of how you keep track of
treated how do you investigate criminals
I keep track of money flows and whatnot
clearly having a transaction graph only
helps m-n of debts your numbers are not
for these things in the past but kind of
a point about forgiving to stands
regardless even with serial numbers
right so if I sum only steal your wallet
right and and then goes and buys I don't
know a bottle of water because they run
away from you on their tired and need to
drink a the they $5 acquired by the
kiosk owner that salted the water bottle
like actually owns those five dollars
even if they were stolen from you and
where you can track it or figure it out
it's kind of foggy no like some from
economic terms you you want to argue
that that that store owner has a legal
right to those five dollars does it make
sense like it's kind of a sudden
electricity yeah maybe but then you
would have had an economic theory to
back it up and so to develop it around
it and so I don't know whether it's not
enough retractable or or interesting to
develop an economic theory on
currency that comes with pedigree
attached to it they'd be my been
interesting research reaction that
actually I'm not an economist so I I
don't know whether anybody has
investigated it but say yeah good
question so even we should be beyond the
weather values that well-defined or not
the lack of fungibility also causes all
kinds of other issues like price
discrimination right so if you know who
is paying you and they have deep pockets
maybe a you you ask them to pay you more
right in censorship right so if some
unpleasant people starts using bitcoin
with the - pick them up right so with
the with - kick up transactions from
Trump family I will just say just leave
in there don't pick them up right no
geographical thing if you show up yes I
can repeat the Civic sorry but not I
should have been doing it
the question was don't we have some of
these problems already with cash so they
found us not clearly em so if you walk
into a store right so it's not that the
store owner can look at you and infer
from the way you look or behave like all
of your transaction history in the past
and sort of a charge you for a water
bottle of different price depending on
how you look right so we become you can
actually do that very precisely it's not
just a guess right so you could walk
into a store and maybe just the way you
behave or what you're wearing they can
more or less assess your status
socioeconomic status right but with
Bitcoin this takes it to a completely
new level like they can actually assess
very precisely your regular income your
maybe your assets so this is a very
sophisticated level of price
discrimination you can do it
but the bank can do it not an arbitrary
person okay so right now your bank knows
everything about you right but it's not
entire world was a lot of information
about you but this is a very different
I'm okay with my back knowing knowing
you know all the dirty details of all
the transactions that I do it's fun but
you know I don't want some arbitrary
people that they could try to frame me
or to have right so that's all so thanks
is one of the most regulated sector of
the entire economy right so they're not
just sort of bandits out there so it's
very different but a good check is you
know it's about they will not tell them
how much you earn per month right so
you're good questions I mean of course
some amount of you know to conduct
business you need to have some idea on
financial status the other person and so
on and so forth is also true at higher
levels when you cannot company but that
has to be reputation and there are other
mechanisms to keep track of these things
all right okay so but I think I just
want to think we have I hope you're
convinced that privacy is an important
problem and why so wise in private might
become private okay why not I mean says
somebody designed it they did a good job
otherwise why wasn't this like on the
priorities so I think it's like privacy
and accountability are bitter thoughts
so if you think about the way that
Bitcoin works it says so I'm not gonna
go over it by the way how it can work
sometimes assume that otherwise we don't
get to talk about the exciting part
today so you have this like chain of
payments right and at some point you're
wondering whether say Bob wants to pay
if I say one Bitcoin why can't you do it
okay
well yeah
I can just go back and see when did Bob
receive it okay he received it you know
five days ago from Alex so yes you can
spend it right so the integrity of the
system is predicated on the lack of
privacy because the entire state of
everything that happened is public okay
so of course Myers can just keep the is
they maintain the state of the system
always correct right it's it's trivial
right they say well I want privacy kind
of the monitor you want privacy and I
shall ever get to actually to say just
great you know just encrypt everything
you send encrypted transactions right
but if not suddenly users send encrypted
transactions it's not clear how you go
back and check say when when you use a
sense of transaction maybe he does
increase the payment under the use a
public key so if can decrypt it and
figure out what both meant when he said
that a cryptic message but the rest of
his system is just looking at this
encrypted transact like what the hell do
I do with it
I know maybe say that maybe it's double
spending some money underneath right so
so here practicing code to be if there
are thoughts so this is not of course
not the first time it happened it's
always the case that there are thoughts
and but in particular thoughts here and
it causes like a big privacy problem for
because right so so extent this first
design of cryptocurrency it is not
surprising that maybe privacy was short
bit to the side because it's kind of
really not clear what to do to maintain
integrity of system otherwise okay era
so Zen cache protocol is something I
worked on a few years ago it is a
cryptographic protocol to achieve absorb
it going like digital currency that
addresses this problem first it also
works in the same model that you know
given some let's say ideal ledger some
append-only log so you can post
transactions and but it's more of its
privacy preserving in the sense that
anybody can post a payment transaction
to anybody else kind of a key in Bitcoin
except that this transaction itself will
probably hide the payments send the
receiver and amount also just for the
sake of today let's just worry about the
three pieces of information
that we want to hide or who sends it who
receives it and how much okay is there
the three main pieces there are other
things you could try to hide but they
just worry about this stick for them
okay
three key for important parts of a
payment and it wasn't just a sort of
theoretical interest we also used and
specialized therapy techniques to the
particular setting and achieved what I
think are fairly feasible parameters
were producing transactions where it
takes like a minute very fine them a few
milliseconds and they're not that big
maybe kill button sucks so in today I
want to tell you about the actual
designer is protocol because I like it a
lot it's I think it's is a real exciting
applications around roofs and given that
bitcoin is it's a very exciting system
it also has a big problem it's competing
with understand how it gets fixed okay
so the basic intuition is the following
at very high level the problem with just
merely standing encrypting front
encrypted transactions is not nobody can
check them so the very high level is to
say let's just ask users to send
encrypted transactions along with proofs
that whatever is in the plain text
underneath the cipher text is good is
some value payment okay
so now if Alice Bob she says okay when
encrypt it post it and by the way here's
the proof everybody else that double
spend my money and everybody does it
okay and very roughly extremely high
level Alice will be saying the following
I am posting as a transaction it
contains three cipher texts these
ciphertexts are encryption so my Sandra
address a receiver address and transfer
amount respectively and of course since
encrypted them you don't know what these
are so I must convince you an amount has
not double spent and to do that I've
generated a cryptographic proof that all
this is true okay so XSS are generally
of course was Devon to what this means
completely but as a general approach it
seems reasonable right encrypt people
don't know so you prove on the side that
it's something is valued underneath
right okay so from this basic intuition
the protocol there's a couple of things
that we need to answer okay what kind of
cryptographic proof okay because there's
many types of to Tecate proofs so which
ones sort of capture the crack security
properties to make this work and second
is yeah this is just English here what
do you mean I've contain encryptions of
what do you mean the amount transferred
has not been double spent right so at
some point I have to give it the formal
meaning okay so what I want to do is to
dig into these two questions let's just
quickly get rid of it first question for
a moment and and we'll spend the rest of
the talk on a second question to try to
talk about the protocol itself so what
kind of pictographic proof first they
ought to be a proof you may not be
familiar with proofs this is not a talk
where I'm going to dig into them but
roughly proof says that you can prove
true statements but not false ones right
that's what's the proof is right so if
you try to prove that you have a
transaction that doesn't about spend
when in reality you did double spend you
shouldn't be able to do that okay that's
what proof means she also be
non-interactive proof because we need to
be able to write it down into into a
transaction and broadcast it for records
there's a lot of very useful proofs in
computer science the cryptography that
are interactive those are no use to us
because we have to write them down it
also has to be seer knowledge again I
will not be going to the finish of your
knowledge it's not the talk where I talk
about these things very roughly if you
were trying to protect plain texts by
encrypting them and I will touch a proof
about the plain texts you don't want the
proof to leak information about the
plain texts in fact here's a trivial
proof for the plain texts just include
the plain texts and then somebody can
check it right so that would not be like
as your knowledge proof okay so you have
to listen something different that
basically doesn't leak information about
what you're proving so about the
information that you're talking about
beyond what you prove it which is a
valid state everybody paint
has to be a proof of knowledge I will
not get in what this means but what I'm
getting to is that this full property is
something you may have seen before
something called an ironclad physiology
proof it comes up sometimes in
cryptographic cryptography courses you
may have taken before coming to go but
another key aspect that is kind of knew
about the second Bitcoin is it is proved
to be really particularly shortened easy
to verify where is that because if now I
mean the the blockchain is very long as
easy even without proofs even if you
just have plain payments in a signature
which is what big winnings and now you
have every day every hour every minute
every second bunch of transactions and
everybody has to remember them in a in a
distributed replicated data structure
you can't a big proofs okay so when you
put all those things together I forget
this part it's something that the
cryptography we call a snarky stands for
zero knowledge 16 no there's the
argument of knowledge which is basically
the entire things any other basically
proofs that are zero knowledge and with
the right efficiency guarantees for
setting like Bitcoin or becoming like
payments it's actually something I've
worked on a lot here in my PhD and if
you wanna run with it we also have an
open source library that also Howard
here did a lot of very nice as I work
with alright so this is not formal of
course is just discussing a little bit
in more detail what type of
cryptographic proofs what I wanted to do
more of is the protocol design so what
exactly are we proving
okay well in how you're setting up what
is inside a transaction what are you
saying and this requires some thought
and it's up some design fun okay so do
that so before I jump into maybe the
technical part of the talk there are
other questions so I think the high
level our intuition approach makes sense
right whatever it is proofs are we can
try to use them we can just think
there's your on whatever that means
right it just doesn't leak and now we
can just go ahead and try to use them
yeah what some extent will make the
problem worse right because instead of
leaving just plain payments we'll have
encrypted payments plus proofs but the
proofs will be so small compared to
other things there that it will be very
small a separate issue is regardless of
privacy how do you deal with
ever-growing data structures maybe to
contrast it with certificate
transparency where I assume you're
familiar from your theory certain big
transparency where certificates have
expiration dates right so when you have
some big metal tree that is finished can
you freeze it right and when all the all
of the certificates in it are expired
you can just throw it away right this is
not something that happens with me come
even if all of the payments in the past
have been kind of exhausted there's
still other reasons that you need to
keep around to the address value that's
a that's a problem that's the result
follow-up this one will be making it
worse but only sort of in relative terms
not very much very much all right all
right so I will be a first the way to
understand a protocol is to try to build
it in there and see the problems and go
over several iterations so we'll be
going through several straumann they all
have the same format so step zero will
be describing the format of this drama
okay
so I in the top part of the slide I'll
be showing the view of the blockchain
different colors will denote different
types of transactions and I will
describe each type of transactions only
have two types of transactions okay and
will be little by little building a coin
data structure if I can move it no sorry
you can move in the decisional too so
here in the bottom left will be little
by little building a coin data structure
just to keep track what that means okay
and let's go ahead let's start with a
very stupid
design okay let's just define a coin to
be a random serial number okay so I then
so I caught a coin as an English word I
just identified with a random serial
number okay so I have a coin however
notes you know how does it come into
existence there is something that we
call a mint transaction a means
transaction consists of the string m int
concatenated with the serial number and
you should supposed to interpret it as
saying I have consumed one amount one
Bitcoin to create a value one coin with
your number SN okay this you do it in
the privacy of your house and then you
can suspend it so let's see someone
could just post a min transaction saying
hey world I have made a coin serial
number of SN 1 maybe somebody else so
maybe you again you say hey world have
done I've created a serial number listen
to and then maybe this person is sighs
okay
I'm spending it here it is I'm burning
it up okay I continues like this yeah so
for now you can just think about that
we're building a privacy overlay on top
of Bitcoin with some other like maybe
lotion on top or like maybe you can
think about the system has is aware of
different types of transactions they
they will get rid of the get overlay
would just do everything in one option
so for now all I want to say is just
create some currency has to come from
somewhere so I'm just saying for now
define a system to borrow it from
Bitcoin now this this this design is so
broken in many ways maybe you have a lot
of questions in your in your mind so
let's just go through them so first I
just want to tell you that the fact that
we associate a coin with your number at
least it says that the system doesn't
allow me to say spend twice with the
same serial number all right so it's a
good thing there are many bad things
here for example when you see a spend
you can see the mean
responding to it so they're linkable
said that anybody can spend there's
nothing that says that I own that point
right so you mean the coin suddenly
somebody I see the serial number of
spend so it's very clear what it means
throwing a coin right men have many
other things but I just wanted all I
really wanted to do with this slide was
to say let's think of serial numbers
because they help us with double
spending okay
all right so let's try to improve from
here as I've committed serial numbers so
now they call data structure it's not
just a serial number but you commit to
it of course we do have some randomness
to commit to it and you get something
that I call a coin commitment okay so
now that you meet you can broadcast not
the plain serial number but a commitment
to it and it says I have consumed one
Bitcoin to create a value one called
commitment okay but one coin with
commitment see on and when you spend you
just reveal the the commitment
information okay just say here's this
remember his randomness I used for a
commitment okay so how would it work
so now you meet and you reveal that your
commitment meet again it's you or me
somebody else when you spend you say hey
here's their the commitment information
because I'm providing both the serial
number and the randomness you can
actually go and check that it
corresponds to some previous commitment
okay
it continues like this so that's again
let's go see what's good and what's bad
it is still the case you cannot that was
spent because if you see twice a spent
transaction which seems your number you
will reject it others can't spend on the
coins is already an improvement right
because I know the economy information
right you don't know it right
so to reveal it you need to kind of
invert the commitment okay which is
supposed to cryptographic art that's
what bad things so we certainly haven't
made any progress in terms of privacy
particularly when you can like in
Bitcoin
judging the value of spend requires
finding the corresponding meet right so
we have lot of linking going on here
it's not a problems
okay we're making progress so let's try
to do a little bit of progress in the
linking part let's keep the mint
transaction the same but now in the
spend instead of revealing the serial
number and the randomness I'm gonna
reveal a proof that I know the Romulus
0h proof that anonymous okay let's look
at that
so it's spent transaction now it will
have cylinder and a proof and the proof
will be saying the following I know a
secret randomness are such that first
and foremost cm the coin commitment that
I have in mind was minted at some point
in the past so it belongs to the list of
all prior commitments okay but we have
to do this efficiently you can use a
marquetry forget about so they don't
somehow in the previous list of all
commitments and moreover the commitment
the having might actually corresponds to
the serial number that I'm revealing
okay so once again I'm telling you I
seen a number and a proof and it proof
is saying I know some secret are such
that if you take the tower and you put
together what is your number I'm
revealing I get some commitment and this
commitment appears in the list of all
coin commitments I have ever appeared on
the blockchain okay never mind how you
do this this is the magic of zero
knowledge proof I can't explain right
now how you procedurally go ahead bar it
let's just think it is a given that
whatever statement think of right now I
can prove okay suppose it proved this
okay now what has happened anyway
actually interesting is what I'm
describing right now is actually ideas
that we're around already twenty years
ago in the context of verifiable banks
you can actually construct an auditable
Bank using these ideas in just
rephrasing them in the blockchain
world so you want to look up the papers
very interesting shortened and quite
understandable so what's good about this
design first is still the case account
that was pen because we still have this
idea of serial numbers we still have
trapped there information about coins so
that it's not like arbitrary people
could spend my coins
but I'll spend am interlinking because
when you spend you don't know which of
the previous means no of course you do
know that it relates to one of the
biggest means because you can only spend
things are being created so there's
unlimited set there yes there's a
question so the question is is a reason
why I sent to has an index into it no
it's just for this slide of course
somebody observing the blockchain will
only know that s s suppose the
blockchain actually starts at the
beginning of the slide ok whoever if you
have where the case you see a spend you
don't know whether he belongs with first
or a second but it must be one of the
first tool if the blockchain starts here
of course the blockchain goes way into
the last thing it will be any of the
means that came before the question so
we're making progress so so what is left
that some extent to do it why does
actually all those things that are still
done we just haven't gotten around first
is there's a fix to the nomination which
is actually a side channel because I
have to pay you five bitcoins have to
five transactions and can see that we
got to be correlated in time there will
be right so there is a side channel of
information so I want to be able to have
variable or no relation so let's let's
fix that first okay and now we call some
problems you have to fix those two go
together so far all right variable
domination again so you make a coin data
structure a little bit more complicated
so now we have a nested a nested
commitment the outer commitment keeps
the value and the inner commitment is
like before we have a serial on Burlison
randomness okay now because I've changed
my data structure I will have to change
the mint the mint procedure because I'm
my kind of my coin is different so when
I mean I will reveal the coin commitment
the value the inner commitment I'm
calling it K and the randomness for the
outer commitment okay
why because first and foremost when
somebody sees all this stuff they can
check that this coin commitment
actually corresponds to this stuff okay
if you're just basically bloody
commitments to the concatenation of the
value the other commitment and the
randomness you should you be left in
this part why am i revealing the value
because I have to I mean you're creating
a value of the coin you have to say how
much you're generating because you're
burning Bitcoin from some other part
right system now when you spend you want
to be able to some extent recreate an
amount of V so you have to tell the
system that is the case so I'm gonna
reveal the student number the value and
a proof that I could spend this so it's
it's just a simple generalization worth
it before I prove their you know secret
randomness not just art but arnessk
because now there are two commitments
such that first and foremost they come
commitment have in mind does appear like
before moreover the commit with this is
well-formed namely if I take the serial
number together with the inner
randomness against the inner commitments
and when I pass this inner commitment to
the other committee in the correct
laminates that I changed notes okay the
commitment here that I'm saying it's
part of the previous list okay if this
is we're just adding value to whatever
we had before okay and twelve value we
have to have these two commitments so
that's what happens okay now this fine
it's variable denomination it causes
problems so first I'll just see at least
yes you can still not double spend
others can spend my coins and spend and
meter and linkable and we have variable
elimination well let anybody see Y
variable dimension caused some trouble
just from privacy perspective yeah yeah
there's only a subset of these mid
transactions so you've revealed much
more information the anonymity set was
partitioned according to value when I
spend say 5 bitcoins it could only have
come from people that have mean 2 to 5
bitcoins and there could be a much
smaller subset of all of the means okay
it doesn't extent this is really really
problematic because if I'm relying on
some underlying currency to burn and
create coins and I have this private
private channel to go to and then spend
I will need to come back to week and
after declare the value at the end so
the next thing that I want to do yeah it
seems like that show me the show me in
cash system
show me why I have this problem okay but
now we'll be trying to do more than that
right so now what we're gonna try to do
is think about how can we just forget
about the base currency that we're
borrowing from I just want to be able to
conduct payments so within the system
without talking about burning and so
recreating Bighorn underneath in order
to do that I need to introduce the
notion of address within this world - so
in the next two slides where I want to
do is I want to introduce addresses and
with the notional addresses will be able
to have users address each other
directly pay each other directly without
having to reveal the value of coins when
they pay and then lose generally me
Cosette okay is it clear alright so next
slide let's introduce payment addresses
so if you introduced payment addresses
that's again more data structures right
so I'm gonna leave my coin almost the
same but now I want to tell you what is
an address okay an address is going to
be very simple first there's gonna be
some public key that denotes ownership
of the coin that you will just plug in
here okay before there was nothing there
was no notion of ownership now when you
create a coil commitment you throwing
them in also publicly what is the public
key it's just some hash of a secret key
okay so you think you just think about
this some hash you write you you sample
some random string you hash if it's
republican okay
formally use of random function indexed
by the hash key and your value tickets
you sometimes I think about it just -
correct
so and before we had a serial number
directly plugged into here okay
but now for reasons that will become
a moment I want the serial number have
to depend on the secret key this would
be like a key aspect of the design but I
can't explain this slide in this light
all I want to do is to want to introduce
addresses okay now we're going to
leverage the fact that serial number
depends on the secret key you know
moment in a very crucial well okay but
listen tactically again all have done is
we still have the two sides of the
commitment the the outer in England we
depends on it all the concomitant
depends on the public key it is some
correlated randomness that connects the
coin and the serial number okay
assume number depends on the secret key
and of course with public key recipe are
related okay now all I really want to do
is to redo the previous slide with this
data structure and then we can reason
about why use a search the structure
helps us so now if we want to meet I'm
still gonna mean like before
it's just that create the committee in a
different way and when I suspend I just
have a slightly different statement
before I was saying I hello randomness
rns now I have to reveal a lot of
information because for example when I
spent I'm not revealing who owns it
right I'm not saying that a certain
public he was responsible for this spend
so it means that that's also part of my
secret all my Syrian information that
I'm proving knowledge of right so now
what I'm gonna do is say okay I have in
mind a coin commitment it's it was
minted at some point in the past it is
well formed now what four means that if
I take my public key I put together the
serial number in randomness so this is
what ever created zero number I got the
inner commitment and I compute the outer
commitment I get the correct one
and moreover I provided a public key
secret key pair that is well constructed
okay so the hash of a secret key really
is the public key
I don't know my let me just provide just
garbage right I have to check that the
keep hair is well-formed and moreover
the serial number is completed correctly
okay there's not a few remarks about
this construction again first I am not
revealing anything about who
these coins for now I'm still revealing
the value okay we'll fix that in a
moment and we know that the value is a
problem because it partitions the limit
yourself all I wanted to say was if I
have these addresses I don't need to
reveal them when I spend okay so at
least if I am partitioning the limited
set according to values I'm not further
partitioning it according to addresses
okay but these different addresses spend
the same amount of money they would look
the same for third party observer okay
are we together this yes question okay
yeah we're getting to an interesting
place if so make sure prior commitments
this is not well I think it would be but
it would be inefficient so let's go
through it suppose that here I really
did say list of all prior commitments I
literally all right then I just say one
of them that's okay I'm not telling you
which one of course you know you already
know the list of all prior commitments
because I'm posting a particular moment
in time and you can just look back and
everybody knows the list of prior
commitments is public all I'm including
is your knowledge is that a membership
that it is one of them now to do it
efficiently the way you do it is not
actually read them all out you have you
have the system and Thema Merkle tree
overall coin commitments and really here
you will talk about the route saying
that relative to the route of the
miracle tree of all previous coin
commitments I can exhibit an
authentication path to one coin
commitment within them right I'm noting
opossum for you that I know a path but
I'm not telling you which one yeah yeah
yeah that's a different talk here for
other things
he said secret key yeah here input so if
actually is a sorry I've not been always
repeating the questions so mmm question
is is public key super key usually it's
in the context of public key crypto and
there's number three associated with it
maybe like factoring or the script
algorithms in this case because we're
using the knowledge proofs that to some
extent are public key crypto I can
afford to to relate to even use
symmetric key primitives to create
public and secret key pairs yeah so yeah
I'm literally thinking of a hash here
actually you know implementation the
point I want to make what yeah so we're
all to get to to the punchline but not
at some point we have to make believe
and just have users each other directly
now at least we have identities because
if I want to pay somebody I can think of
an address right before the wasn't the
notion of who do I pay right at least
now the koihime account has an owner
right so and I can try to pay somebody
so let's see how I could try to do it
right so this was just how you do it
right direct payments how do we do them
but me I'm still not gonna change it
okay and I just want to commit for a
moment is that if later spent doesn't
reveal values we are not going to have
issues with a minute you set right
because I've been you haven't yet
currency money into the system somehow
this is just one choice of how you can
inject money into it there are many
other designs but here you can still say
when you mint you burn some amount of
money from somewhere else another system
has this amount of money but if it never
comes out that's okay your anonymity set
is gonna be good because if later a
spender doesn't reveal how much it
spends you still benefit from all means
regardless whether the means can be
divided by by value okay
so here I'm not gonna change it
certainly still refer to a single
previous myth
now we're gonna see that it's not gonna
do it great question so question is
there's a there's a mint there's a spend
have to refer to a mint yes there's no
it we could refer to a priest and and
now regressivity
this is just how to pull up the system
with currency in fact you don't even
have to do it like this you can just say
that when things are mined it
automatically is or adds some currency
into the system doesn't have to be sort
of doesn't have leverage off of any
previous minute versus previous spend I
was thinking about can you spend the sum
of several minutes you spend a subset
for several days yes so we will get
enough as well and now I'm going to do
coin to coin transactions and they they
will see how to merge and split but the
hard part is to just get like direct so
user to user even without merging or
splitting all right so now what they
want to do is the misspent I want you to
do two things
spent so far has only done one job burn
a coil now I want the spent to burn a
coin and create another one we already
know what it means to burn economy it
means to review it's your number so it's
your number of coin name if I want to
create another coin I know what to do I
just create a coin commitment for it for
the coin be okay just expect all you
need to do is to produce Iran's proof
then I need all this stuff properly
there's no value here okay just bring
some coin and create another one of the
same body let's see just what the
statement might look like we're doing
with time okay so I have like you think
me a second here's the swatch proof
there I know a bunch of secret
information for the first coin which
means the value the address information
whatever just all the chapter
information is very first point and it's
worth formed this is the same thing as
before I'm just saying it was created at
some point it's well formed I know the
secret key the public is whether is is
well formed okay I didn't change
anything here but now I don't stop here
I also say I'm revealing a coin
commitment from another coin that I
dreamed up okay it's another data
structure it has this coin
this value okay as this public key okay
and it's well-formed and they have the
same value okay so notice what is
happening I have burned the coin and
create another one and in creating
another one I did not need to know a
secret here so in particular this
address may have not been mine
it was yours okay and this is the point
or less symmetric that the structure
here that the core part of the coin only
depends on the public key because when I
want to pay somebody I want to be able
to create this part without a structure
you know to create the coin but only
when I spend it I need to know more
about it you see this is the main point
of the payments okay it is important
that the coin is bounced to an owner
through its public key but for spending
if you have a different piece of
information that depends on the secret
key okay that's why when I spend it I
need to know more travel information
when I meet it I need to know less okay
so with this mechanism I can tell other
people or myself even if I want to so
maybe shift around some money and this
gives us their pains okay so now this
stance don't reveal any information
about that shotgun all right so last
slide let's look at a Minton and so
let's look at the join and split this is
a point to look for okay
but at some point you can get to a
symmetric situation you can just spend
your coins you cannot spend other
people's coins because of the symmetry
of the lava structure okay and basically
you can prove all this since your
knowledge so then you're fine okay
okay let's read the comment how about
joining and splitting I just generalize
you just say hey Mint is the same now
when you're poor we call it poor instead
of spending you can just pass in two
coins in create two coins okay and you
can just merge a speaker where you want
and of course if you have two coins
coming in then you prove the same thing
you were doing before for the each of
these two coins and if your two coins
coming out you could be same thing about
those two other coins you were doing for
the output before and yet it also proves
that the sum of the input values because
it's and the output values that balance
is preserved okay and again like I'm not
writing it out but you just basically do
the same thing I mean it's something we
called poor and now if you have two of
your coins you can merge them together
first or you can split them right
I hope this makes sense and then your
transactions will look like this okay
you're not sure this is the zero cash
for coffee okay so what we're doing is
they're encrypting we're not really
encrypting we're kind of committing to
stuff okay revealing just where the bury
mean there is necessary to prevent
double spending and the rest is
basically under the hood proved on the
side uses your knowledge proof to make
sense
okay so see there's a bit of a gap
between saying I proved the payment is
valid to actually design your protocol
because you have to actually the site
for exactly reveal obscuring so let's
say you need to come to you actually
mint the value 10 or should you do like
ten coins that are all it's better to me
to the value of 10 because there is no
that the question is if you want to mean
10 10 10 bitcoins do you want you want
to do it across ten transactions on one
transaction you can tell you it in one
transaction because later in whether you
can you split your coin multiple times
or not it kind of gets lost in everybody
else's transactions right so whether
you're
taking your 10 value coin and splitting
into ten ways or 20 ways which by itself
really could reveal how many times you
split right there is anyways everybody
else's transactions look exactly the
same as yours okay so the limit is
satisfied
so you no matter what you do your
anonymity set is precisely sort of the
all the previous coin commitments
whether they're part of means or spends
right so there was another question
first
here introduction well first the results
are great to talk by Shafi goldwasser
recorded by the sun was instituted UC
berkeley i think it's a it's a survey
talk let's say an introduction I think
that there's a book by a castle in
Jonathan cats on Yahoo that in Dell I
think covers basics of George proofs I
think that would be like a great place
to because I think it's a good luck so
early on I followed how it is that the
protocol across your first several
translations how it is what we're
projecting it's double spending and no
longer see how your so one aspect of
double spending is a fact that yeah once
you commit to a coin you have also
committed to the serial number and your
comic King so when you try to spend this
coin there is only once your number that
you can give and that is the one used by
your serial number randomness see and
you see the king why because you cannot
find two different super keys that give
the same public king okay
and similarly and also this one is
collision resistant so you cannot find
two different secret keys or difference
your number seems that give you the keys
but being missing in this alright so you
have a public key you cannot have two
different secret keys that give rise to
it okay
so that and there's only once your
number you can see later probability
sense
great question yeah
yeah I really like the others but I
assume this is not for the record this
this protocol you know was invented
years ago and then about a year ago we
launched it as a separate cryptocurrency
so it's completely unconnected it's a
blockchain of its own and in particular
you don't have to mean anything is just
money gets created in the usual way as a
Bitcoin mining and then it kind of
enters the system like that okay so it
sets another change in that perspective
so it doesn't hit the face in any way
okay so maybe let's jump well maybe
conclude and I will address this
question because they told me so I think
to get out to me in five or ten minutes
so I'm gonna jump to some sort of the
question that is related to a set up so
I want to briefly talk about because I
think it's very interesting
hmm what happened here all right here
all right so for the record
0h proofs are the main tool used and the
current tool concrete associations
launch proofs used in system requires at
one time centralized trust itself is
they're inconvenient obviously because
if you wanted to set up as Iran's proof
to use it in a centralized system there
is no trusted party right it's at one
time but you know still a problem so
what we did in this particular case for
launching this cryptocurrency is that we
actually designed a tailor-made secure
multi-party computation protocol such
that you would have to corrupt all
parties participating in a protocol in
order to corrupt the self itself we
actually ran it across six parties it
took like two days to run beyond the
protocol itself was all difficult
in terms of practical security because
you don't only need to run it you just
need to a security system itself and so
it's a different story it's a different
talk there's a lot of information you
can find the line there's also a really
funny regular podcast about this but it
doesn't have to be so from a third legal
perspective there are zero knowledge
proof constructions all they really need
is public romulus so you could just take
I don't know
stock market values for the first 50
years of the 20th century can boil it
down to like a short random string using
some randomized extractor and use that
okay so that would be like a more
reliable source actually a lot of my
research these days is on improving the
efficiency of such as large proofs there
is a lot of exciting progress and I
think we will see some deployment to
these things in the next two or three
years so yeah there is progress and it's
one of the problems that I care about
the most because this is set up as very
normally it is basically constructing
this type of 0h proofs in their own work
on you know these I hope that answers
the question
trust a key King has to be sent yah
Thunder in order for that person in
general actually not just that I think
it'd be a hopefully knows it it's their
address but there's other chapter
information I created in creating their
corn that they need to know to spend it
okay and there's language to do it you
could send it out of band with me it's
your friend you call him or you send it
via signal whatever you can also just
encrypted input in adoption you can just
encrypt it right and the person which is
decrypted with their public key and they
can just scan the blockchain for
payments
address to them and you can just figure
it out by decrypting and see in theatres
garbage and abuse or not and but
kind of like exactly how you communicate
that information is orthogonal and may
vary across different applications so I
wanna take more questions but I want to
make you late one concluding remark so
the so we know that all this is a
transition between trust from trusting
to trust but verify maybe at Google it's
a most well captured by certificate
transparency right so it comes
yeah series are usually fine but it's
better to have like additional checks
but if the way of verifying things is to
add a lot of information about this
system the state of a system in fact the
full information stereo system that's
what Bitcoin does and first let's also
what certificate transparency does it
just makes everything public now you get
into a situation where privacy actually
becomes an issue accountability sudden
is fixed by definition because
everything is public so you can always
audit it right but I know these issues
of privacy that sometimes do get in the
way of a particular applications so kind
of some extent I think like the right
answer sits someone immediately
yeah you should trust that verifies your
knowledge we're sorry you explicitly
designate certain things to be public
and you keep the rest as private okay
that's actually what we did here in the
air cache and actually zero cash we took
a very extreme view maybe we could have
revealed more maybe we could have said
if you're transacting like more than ten
thousand dollars and your payment should
be public right so there are more
fine-grained choices of what you reveal
and what not revealed and that's a fixed
EBT as your knowledge brings you and
that's why I'm very excited about
working as your knowledge because I
think this if I be in the future of
system systems you know it's something
people start caring about but the moment
you have published the entire system
state causes other issues your knowledge
seems to be like a really good tool for
so finding this designing this middle
accountability and privacy together and
zero cash is just one example so now I
can take more questions and I did one do
you want to take say that pointer
especially I got a question sir sure um
so when I think of anonymity I think of
a man Arizona - I think of
- why would someone who cares about
anonymity today purchase zero cash III I
don't know I mean so there's a question
of what are these cryptocurrencies for
right so first and foremost regardless
of Z Cash Money row or - even Bitcoin
it's not clear why you would buy it
because you cannot spend it at most
cafeterias or so even though kind of
usability of these cryptocurrencies for
day-to-day payments or just yeah the
financial applications is very limited
so all these cryptocurrencies for
general users they need to sort of
penetrate various markets more then is
the obstacle speculation I don't know I
I don't I'm not a traitor I cannot give
a financial advice on cryptocurrencies
to invest or not I certainly do believe
that from a usability perspective
cryptocurrencies some cryptocurrency
will benefit so fractions of uniting the
future in places where financial
traditional financial services are not
easily available think of remittance
money or like developing countries were
just it's very hard to find a branch of
a bank today yeah I mean
cryptocurrencies are mostly speculative
market and and just some aficionados
maybe use them for something oh hey I
paid in Bitcoin my coffee I'm so happy
today but didn't really make a
difference to their life so but that's
the way it is right so it's systems have
to start from stuff from humble starts
and whether these cryptocurrencies will
eventually achieve wide penetration of
markets or other ones I kind of didn't
really care too much as long as
something works eventually I think it's
that's the creates a great reaction does
it that does help with the answer I'm
more for my anonymity perspective so
what would be the industry compared to
manera or - or the perspective is
completely different because the cash
provides strong provable guarantees
whereas Manero and is everything is it's
at best laundering services that there's
already like a lot of evidence that they
can be analyzed so I personally would
not feel comfortable like putting all my
transactions on
I also them to it in Z cash for other
reasons because I wrote the code so I
feel like I don't trust myself in that
respect
now I'm joking but also saying that in
principle in ideal world where they're
doing our issues and the fact that the
cash is a new technology which has been
deploying but not the math is there and
yeah it's totally fine to put all of
your transactions there it's provable
net respect of course the other side
channels like your IP address are using
tor underneath these are orthogonal
issues that you need to have to really
use it all the time as a user being an
individual or a business you need to
take care of the entire attack surface
for privacy problems right but I mean
when I talked about today is the only
approach that we know of today to get
strong provable anonymity guarantees is
absolutely not the case at all there
there's just there is an actual
transaction graph that leaks a lot of
information less than Bitcoin wetzel
have information Google answers the
question based strikes very different
traders in terms of technology they use
very standard crypto and asking you so
that's also a great advantage changing
some point in session and back yeah of
course you can do that you can if you're
in the business of money laundering
there are many tools up there and there
always will always be and there is no
true stability right now you don't even
have you can just enter the cash and
stay there forever and you can exit when
you want and in that case you will have
a full-on unit is that not just the
difference that cut together for that
specific money-laundering operation wait
100 units like a terrible name right
because I think even when you're not
cream you know you can still want to
launder money right because that's your
financial privacy right so in zero cash
there's no money on during anymore it is
it's kind of any transaction is
automatically protected nothing much
really so first I wasn't really involved
in this design but essentially we use a
slightly different hash function for
it's a little bit less prone to higher
optimizations and creates all these
lopsided world like in Bitcoin but
otherwise we use the same type of moto
style protocol Remy just for the record
there's a lot of exciting developments
in after achieve consensus protocols
happening right now
not just with iam planning to move to
proof of state by living inside the
computer science that all really cool
new ideas that are sort of more
efficient more fair than a notion of
fairness also you can define I think
there will be like a lot of changes in
future the currencies Nakamoto style
protocols will also become definitely
very soon for now the cash there's
enough innovation last if we went on
something proven technology it works
Nakamoto style proof of work for a
consensus vertical no questions even
remotely sorry like you guys if you
raise your hands I cannot see you okay
alright so any more questions yeah I
mean it's good stuff I mean but confuse
in the beginning of that did I go
confuse in the beginning but now that
especially after their the super
investigations I think they realize it's
just like so
one observation is that Bitcoin doesn't
actually have any encryption it's just
it uses cryptography hashing but there's
no information being high that it hidden
there's and so if something like to see
casual words who take protocol both of
those things have changed - now it does
using grips don't and so now I'm worried
that the government could say okay so
the expert restrictions would not bring
them back again it means and also the
government might just say screw this we
are not having we're not going back to
you do you have an opinion about that
second part if she kept harder to take
hold
would it be squished has it happened so
first is that our CEO spent a lot of
time actually talking to regulators and
law enforcement to communicate techno
technology and communicate the fact that
actually it can help businesses usually
with technologists help with people more
than bad people and since I do believe
there are more good people and bad
people are all things work out yeah so
if you want to help with people and in
the process you also have people that's
alright because don't move the people
and in a particular case economy there's
all kinds of businesses that it could be
made more efficient by maybe updating a
financial infrastructure and certainly
can do cannot do it with Bitcoin because
it's just not private not a separate
point is that the cash is just one
particular trade off point in the
privacy versus accountability space
again you could change it easily so that
maybe any large payment is not private
right so that's a key fact already the
case right so if you enter the United
States with like a little cash in your
pocket if it's up to $1,000 you can just
bring it in and maybe you spend it in
all the pop store maybe buy some garage
door it doesn't really matter like the
unknown right but if you're being in
like many dollars in cash do you have to
declare it right so there's already some
sense in which kind of your financial
crisis you have a right to your own
financial privacy as long as you're not
poking around millions of dollars right
otherwise can be used to start declaring
things very cute it is something you can
easily do it with your own proves the
point of
but we cannot have this this could be a
discussion before anyone who's convinced
that this stuff is real right so and nor
am I the person to understand these
trade-offs it's not I'm a cryptographer
the hell do I know about what the right
trade-offs of this account that you use
to spark the trade first need to educate
people about the privacy problems of
Bitcoin the tools that are out there and
how they fix it and then you can start
going out there and trying to figure out
okay
maybe government is worried about
distant changes everything and so I
think overall it's important to have
some technology that feels in I mean I
don't believe anything these
cryptocurrencies will ever take over
cash or traditional credit cards I think
it will just feeling or create different
markets so could maybe address
underneath the wearing a dress but also
I think it's fun to create a good
ecosystem and it's just a start and as a
company we're very open and very so our
CEO spends an awful lot amount of time
explaining these things and
communicating and he ain't good sense
for both regulators and law enforcement
so I'm really not worried about that I
also think from their perspective in
terms of just economic development and
technology penetration I see no reason
sure okay I'll just be out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
