welcome this is a presentation about
solar energy basically from the point of
view of people who had it installed and
and then also from the point of view of
one of the people working in the
industry my name is heimer bite i'm a
research scientist here at Google and I
had the experience of basically paying
somebody and having them install solar
panels in my house that's the typical
story that most people who have solar
panels done would do David talking is
going to come on in about 25 minutes and
he did it himself and he put it in a
house in the country without any access
normal access to electricity and thats
how he's providing electricity to his
house a totally different do-it-yourself
experience dave is going to talk to you
about and then we're going to finish up
with Kurt who is actually the guy i work
with tough solar panels installed in my
house and he's just said in addition to
working in horizon that does the solar
installations he was a founding member
of the global warming and Energy
Committee for the Loma Prieta chapter in
the Sierra Club and has been working to
fight global warming for the last five
years is really committed to this kind
of technology saving that introduction
here we go I you know you could take a
look right here at the at the top of my
house and the solar panels that I have
that are working now in producing
electricity so why would anybody here
want to do solar electricity you know
obviously for the good looks right you
know makes your now select terrific
makes a statement to the world if you
care you can save money by producing
your own electricity and the course you
may have to produce electricity somehow
if you're like David and you don't have
access to the solar panels here's a
picture of the front of my house you
know it is a concern I mean some people
say what the heck is this there's a
recent news story about some guy who is
prevented from bias homeowners as
install cattle in front of my house my
opinion looks terrific but we actually
did have an issue where we because of
the amount of shade I had around my
house we didn't have room to put all the
solar panels I would like and we
actually had to put some panels in the
rear and the rear is north is a is a
north-facing so you really couldn't put
panels on your you know in the northern
hemisphere you have to pay South for
things like that and so there it's a
little more intrusive right because it
had to be racked up to face the Sun a
little bit more but anyway that gives
you an idea what these things look like
before I get into the meat of the talk I
wanted to talk just a little terminology
many you guys maybe most of you guys
understand this but it's going to get it
out of the way just in case the
difference between power and energy and
what you buy from PG&amp;amp;E or whoever your
electric utility is no power is measured
in wattage you know you can think of it
is is how hard something is pushing or
you know you're trying to lift the
weight what kind of force you have to
put on that way energy is power times
time you know you're pushing it for an
hour that's the amount of energy you
have to put out that kind of thing
that's the difference in power and
energy powers measured in watts energy
is measured in you know like watt hours
or kilowatt hours and so you may buy
from PG&amp;amp;E in the course of a month you
know 600 700 800 kilowatt hours of
electricity in luck and they'll charge
you whatever ten twenty thirty cents per
kilowatt hour and that's the deal
basically you have with your rope with
your utility and so as I said kilowatt
hours as a number I'll be mentioning a
lot during the time and this is how PG&amp;amp;E
charges you right now it not everybody
not not Google but most residential
customers could get use this e1 rate
schedule for electricity and you can see
they'll charge you about eleven cents
per kilowatt hour at your initial you
but then as you use more and more you're
the charge per kilowatt-hour goes up so
the marginal charge could be Fred quite
high he's a lot of electricity before I
started this project my baseline usage
was 380 kilowatt hours and i discovered
i was using 1,300 kilowatt hours a month
I wasn't paying a lot of attention to my
electric bill and and I had my electric
bills and I was paying 36 cents a
kilowatt AR for each marginal you know
if I turn something new on that's how
much I paid the question will review
have you said I right now I don't use
the one but because I'm solar I'll get
to that so just to show you guys you
know this should be obvious but so here
you up here say to the 650 kilowatt hour
I'm closer to this now but the user and
you know with a $90 electric bill and
but if you just doubled that to 1300
kilowatt hours per month which is about
where i was before i started this whole
bill you have triple the electric bill
right so that second 650 kilowatt-hours
cost you twice as much as your first 650
so you can actually save money with
solar energy if you tend to displace
those expensive kilowatt hours if you're
trying to displace those cheap kilowatt
hours that's actually harder to to make
this a money-saving deal but before you
get into I mean basically what happened
with me as I decided to do the solar
panel thing solar it was hot I said
let's get into it I call up Curt and I'd
say even teach me about this i want to
buy this from you guys and he comes over
with a whole bunch of light bulbs and
things like that and says you know well
before you replied you know you just
like the energy let's talk about saving
and you know you really need to use all
you need to do and that's really the
right idea so I've been it sort of you
know bass ackwards as they say I would
recommend that you know even before you
start this project go figure out how
much
to use and see if you can save some and
I'm going to go through what I what I
went through so first thing you got to
know is how much you're using and then
where you're using it and there's a
number of ways of figuring that out
obviously you can look at your utility
bill and see you know how much they're
charging you and it'll tell you right
there how many kill a lot of hours
you're using a month you can use a
device like this called the kilowatt if
you're curious about any individual
device you just plug this into the wall
if it has this kind of plug you plug
into that and it just displays you know
70 watts 300 watts whatever whatever it
is you're using you can use your
electric meter to see how much energy
your house or having power your house is
using right now or obviously you could
look on the web and see with the typical
refrigerator whatever uses and they're
usually pretty close there's many things
that you can't really measure you know
what's the power consumption of my you
know pool or something like a pool
filter or something like that where it
doesn't plug in its been wired into the
house how do you how do you deal with
stuff like that and the way I wound up
dealing with stuff like that is looking
at my meter and this is the
old-fashioned meter that many of you
would have in your houses and you've
probably seen it you know this thing
spins around and every time it spins
around it shows you a certain amount of
energy news this is the dials of helga
not much reviews you know at the end of
the month the genie comes out they read
it they read you know they have written
down the previous months they subtracts
and you bill the interesting thing about
this is there's a little mark on this
style it spins around and you could you
know there's just one mark on it so
every time it comes around you know you
could measure how how much time one
revolution took and you can see right
here on the thing a little number three
point six well it turns out that tells
you how many watts each watt hours each
revolution is and so by using this
little formula you could you could
realize that oh if it took ten seconds
to go around that was about thirteen
hundred watts that you're using
currently right now and you know I'm
none less a turn on a thousand-watt
appliance that should go up to 2300 or
if you know that ten seconds bad in
three seconds is that and so I would do
stuff like that
I would turn on my pool pump or my
outdoor lighting and and just notice the
change of course you have to be careful
that the heater didn't just kick on or
the fridge and just kick on and stuff
like that so you may have to do multiple
measurements but that's the idea of how
you can do a little hot into your house
well I started doing my audit first
thing I noticed was my pool and there is
my pool pump and it was using a whopping
400 kilowatt hours per month because the
pool guy had said it to basically filter
and sweep and these motors were
effectively on 11 hours every day this
was in December I mean we don't use the
pool in December near in California in
Northern California and and we were
using a lot of unnecessary electricity
and I won't go into the details but the
bottom line is you know in the
wintertime I say bill knows 300 kilowatt
hours a month just turning that down and
then in the summer time a significant
amount and on average but throughout the
year you know remember i started with a
1300 bill and I per month on average
through cross near probably got rid of
about 240 kilowatt hours and I'm telling
you that that I was spending over a
hundred dollars a month just on
electricity to filter a fool halogen
lamps a lot of people buy these either
really cheap they're like ten twenty
thirty dollars at costco or somewhere
like that these 300 watt halogen lamps
amazing users of electricity in fact
you'll figure out I think a typical user
will spend a hundred dollars a year on
electricity for your twenty thirty
dollar lamp and it's sort of a false
economy anyway I had a couple of those
in high use areas that I replace and I
think I saved about 40 or so kilowatt
hours a month I did this little hack to
mine where I replaced I switched it to a
non halogen version and I you know put
in a couple complex fluorescence of mine
and now actually I found that you can
buy fluorescent versions of these things
and that's probably the way to go there
a little more expensive it may be like
seventy dollars instead of the 23
but actually over a year they're a lot
cheaper we have a lot of lighting you
know the obvious thing people tell you
is you know replace all your lights with
complex lore essence i did that i also
found though that i had a lot of these
fixtures in the ceilings these are 150
watt halogens in high use areas that i
actually went and replaced the fixtures
themselves that's a hundred dollar
investment for fixture but it probably
saved me in the long run especially if I
wasn't going to sell her that we would
have saved in platteville I'm right it's
probably good thing to do anyway in the
end I replaced around 2,000 watts of
lighting in my house with about 450 but
quite honestly there's a lot of lighting
left that's sort of harder to replace
computers are another story we have you
know for the four people in our house
five computers are probably not the only
one with that kind of ratio in this room
and you know a few of them were left on
twenty-four/seven the 24 seven and a
nine talking about monitors just
computers 24 7 computer probably cos you
know it won't sporty kilowatt hours and
lucky just for that one computer and if
it doesn't need to be on at night when
you can save a lot so anyway bottom line
of my any energy conservation project
you can see that the top was my original
usage my new usage after doing these
basically these four kinds of things was
there you can see I saved myself about
400 kilowatt hours a month the funny
part about the stories we started this
project with Kirk before I did this add
the system design where you know it was
going to actually pay me back and I
don't know 10 12 years but because of
the fact that I saved all his energy and
I didn't change the size of the system
the paid back you know is probably
marginal at best that's not a bad thing
in my opinion you know
but you know if your goal was to just
you know make it pay back you know at
that point I could use the smaller solar
system park I can buy myself a cool
electric car right you can use more
electricity that way so that's the end
of the conservation part then let me
talk a little bit you know about what is
a solar panel system at least from my
point of view the layman if you will is
point of view what do I know about that
well you know this is a sort of your
basic block diagram you have your solar
panels on your roof they generate DC
electricity not AC not the kind that you
could plug your TV into right so you got
to convert that Thun AC and you do that
by these big devices or these electrical
devices calling burgers you know I have
a pair of 3.3 kilowatt and burgers and
Google we have 150 kill a lot in burgers
because we have a lot more solar panels
but you get the idea you can convert
that to sort of basic house electricity
gets mixed into your electric panel
where all your electricity got it could
go into your house iono can go out to
PG&amp;amp;E if you're producing more
electricity than you're using you sell
it to PG&amp;amp;E if you're producing less or
none you can buy it from PG&amp;amp;E and that's
basic way that the system works David is
going to talk pretty soon about what
happens if you don't have a PG&amp;amp;E to sell
you electricity well you can have
basically the same setup except the
panel's go to some batteries that store
it in my case peachy any of my bathrooms
effectively so here's a picture of my
panels you probably seen some solar
panel since there's nine thousand of
them scattered all around Google and
telling their amazing exact same kind
but they're very similar and they're
about 13 square feet about five feet
wide two and a half feet each panel as
you can see they're installed in these
grids so you pack them pretty close
together they're very sensitive to sun
to shade and clouds you know directs i
hitting up is terrific cloud flies over
you can see that production shoot down
there's somewhat sensitive
with somewhat sensitive to sun angle you
know if the sun's hitting them square on
that's a lot better than the Bleak angle
and they're sensitive to temperature
sadly when it gets warmer and the sun is
better the efficiency the panel's
actually goes down someone ten percent
or whether they respect if you really
get the spec sheet of my panels their
spec to 215 watts per panel practically
speaking mine dunk over a hundred 5560
was so that spec is under ideal
conditions and those ideal conditions
just aren't meant so don't go like i did
not even i started this project and
multiply two hundred and fifteen times a
number of panels and expect that that's
what you're going to get because you
will the sun is this is how much a power
the Sun puts out about a thousand watts
per square meter you can see these
panels for me are generating hundred and
fifty-five for her you know one point
two square meters so it's getting what
ten twenty percent of the of the energy
the sun's putting out I think they
degraded like a percent a year so I'm
like that curtain curtain mentioned that
one a quarter percent sorry these are
the inverters like I say each of these
can put out about 3.3 kilowatts I have
to because I have a six kilowatt
installation that actually on a typical
sunny day puts out about five kilowatts
you know have been in the middle of the
day and you look at them you can see
that they'll tell you you know how much
his comment how much power right now 26
hundred watts and that day so far and
had put out 27 kilowatts and so that's
the the panels and then the inverter and
then they're connected up to the mix
into the your electric box over here you
notice it says this electric box is
serviced by pv by pv system that so you
know somebody you know shuts off the
utility power and goes to work on the
electricity in your house it doesn't
electrocute themselves with the solar
panels right they got to know that
because you know the typical house
doesn't have multiple
sources and powers we've got to inform
community and stuff like that that you
have to switch meters when you install a
PV system as well and you get this new
digital meter and the reason you get
this digital meter is because you're
going to switch over from that electric
plan the e1 plan that we were just
talking about to a time of Use Plan that
where your rate actually varies by the
time of day that's the kind of how
Google's build and that's how you want
to be billed if you have a TV system
what happens in this kind of time of use
is that you know peak hours where
there's more demand on electricity or
charge a lot more than non-peak as you
can see but the good news is in peak
hours that's when the sun's out that's
when you're selling to PG&amp;amp;E so you get
to sell the PG&amp;amp;E and 29 and then you buy
back in the evening that is dying so you
want you can also say by the way in the
winter it's different than in summer and
again she's more demand on behind the
utility winter so I'm going to move on
to where to place the solar panels if
you have a lot of Sun and you don't have
these shading issues it's really not a
big issue you know you get some nice
southern exposure roof and put your
panels their figure out how many panels
you want Kurt will talk to you about
that and off you go but as you can see
from my house it wasn't quite that easy
and in fact if you look to the south
there are these giant what what kind of
trees are though lino red Pines right in
there Melanie our neighbors monterey
pines our favorite trees in the world
and their right to our house which isn't
a problem in the summer but wait until
the fall and the sun angle gets lower in
the sky and those things are going to
start shading my panels and my
production will go way down and in the
fall to the west there's these trees so
in the evening or the late afternoon now
i'm going to
a lot of energy by that to the east so
in the morning I lose some but but I do
have some set in the middle of the day
that's enough to make this project
worthwhile so how do you figure out
where to put the panels there's a
picture of Kurt who's going to be
talking to us on my roof surveying the
roof trying to figure out where the heck
to put the panels how does he do that
see this device called a solar
Pathfinder we have one here you could
look at more or less you you put it down
and level it and you can see well well
here on the slide there you can see on
what the sign Neal what you'll see what
far to the sky will the Sun be hitting
this this clock of your roof at what
time of day what time is wet left in the
year so for instance over here you can
see that at one o'clock in September in
sunny but at you know right there at 9am
in September it would be behind that
tree and more or less you can survey
your roof and decide where and you can
see that those trees that I had in the
winter part of the sky that was in the
southern sky I guess another western sky
are causing a lot of shade during that
part of the year you can see right there
I'm losing electricity and I believe in
the end my entire solar system is only
about sixty percent as efficient as it
could be because of all these trees so
Kurt did an analysis of this thing and
came up with the prediction of the
performance of my system and there it is
the liner part is the prediction and the
darker part is the actual performance
for the four months I've got the system
so far you can see he's pretty pretty
much right on and there was actually
some panels that way honey not an
inverter that went down that month so
that's actually was pretty close to the
prediction that we were correct for that
installation is it was a snap i mean
more or less i paid the money was
installed in three days no it
it was great I talked about the rear
panels having to be installed on these
racks i'm going to show you the effects
of shade the you can see at ten-fifteen
and at about 3 45 this time of year i'm
out of the the Sun starts shading a
panel by the way once one or two panels
are shaded panels are wired in like
strings of eight or nine or they could
Google they're 14 I think and they can
be as low as 6 but anyway you have these
strings that are that are in series and
then connected in parallel if one or two
panels is in even a little bit of shade
that string is more or less gone that's
just the way they work and that's you're
the reason but anyway so anyway you can
see as we're coming out of the Sun 1015
we start to go up to full power you know
for them as much of hours it's going to
get for that time of day and last pretty
well til the Sun hits those other trees
that I showed you and we get shaded
there against the shade is a significant
effect clouds you know different kind of
shade instead of the tree or shaded from
a cloud big deal here's a clear day
here's a cloudy day you see a difference
obviously there's a lot of cloud that
part of the day an interesting factor
those you'll see it actually peaked
higher over here then it did 12s runs
like sorry well whatever you saw a peak
tire over there I got doesn't seem to
want to go back and so I think that's
because of the temperature I think it's
actually cooler on the cloudy day so
when it was in the Sun it was it was
moving ah we're back okay let me talk oh
yeah yeah I wanted to talk about
temperature again another example of
temperature one day I went on my roof
and I cleaned up my panels because you
get this new set of solar panels you're
so cool keeping them clean you know it's
the pollen messing me up is there's no
the problems i messing you up when you
go on the roof and you hose down your
solar panels what
as you cool them off and even see their
by cooling a lot I actually have this
big spike in performance it just shows
you how temperature affects things I
built this monitor for you know so going
on my local website where you can see
the performance of my system I wanted to
give you an idea of what my system
performs like for the course of a couple
months to take a look at this here we
are at the start this is the end of May
started June and you can see we have
some clouds and what not does things are
a little little glitches in the
inverters by the way that Sun power is
going to come and fix for me it only
costed me about half a percent overall
performance but you can see that in
there after a while starting about here
and we're now mid-june things are pretty
sunny and they stay sunny pretty much
for the rest of June July there was
another cloudy day but you get the idea
performance for me stays pretty close to
30 kilowatt hours a day there you go
this is the performance overall over the
year we have a cloudy April that's when
my invert one of my inverters went down
I went to have power and then more or
less since then until yesterday things
were pretty for pretty good my last
slide just shows you when I announced
this presentation I got uh several
emails from people showing that they too
and it's the all solar systems in a few
of them and put up solar websites and so
these are sites of the top three mine
damn Caleb's and Steve Lacey's who may
or may not be in this room I don't know
what they look like are their website so
how their solar systems are doing I'll
leave this up for a minute they even get
ready I'm ready to switch over to you
and this is of course our google system
that shows are you know i have a 32
solar panels i did mention that on my
roof google you know that's 9000 so you
know about a factor of three hundred
so we of course you probably heard have
a web page that shows different ones of
that system so with that David are you
ready to take it away this is new ok go
for it so greetings I'm going to talk
about a system that we have installed
southeastern the United States an
opinion and my country place we actually
have a bit of a history on reaching the
solar since the eighties we've only
recently gotten serious cried about
three years ago we built an octagonal
cabin and we put in a proper well and
put in a 240 but I want direct solar
pumped well so that's a neat well pump
that does not involve batteries or
anything it just pumps directly into a
tank of sport then you grab me think the
tank to the house we have a 481 a
battery inverter set up for that boom
cap this is enough electricity for our
refrigerator computer lights and so
forth I haven't said like an athlete's
actually work for millions and that
Wilden harder that might happen so
called modified
later but in general that's to be the
point that you want to get a true sign
of a murder and we're now in process of
building a full-size house and that's
really where this particular story
begins so there's the old cabin of the
pre built in 2003 and it's just a one
room meeting in kitchen Basin where we
have parties and hang out for attention
and there is the enough 481 array with
his little lost set of batteries
inverted on the pole later there's a
primitive charge controller that keeps
those marine batteries charged about 12
volt systems would emerge from troubles
110 volt AC for that modified sine-wave
perfect now our new PV system was the
motivation behind it was the contract
wanted confers power tools and we
actually beat are written in there and
nobody went to listen to a generator
drawn on throughout construction and I
thought it'd be kind of cool to show
that construction workers and others
from the area other locals would be down
the solar so recited week what did they
put on beforehand and went down there
and quickly install temporary systems of
the contract with that power so I've got
a really good deal on 181 modules about
30 of them there 24 will modules and
real run and so
2 volts AC of the input of every charger
that's three of the panels in parallel
with a 10 Syria three of them in series
in tenement parallel so give us any tool
input to our better turn the batteries
themselves will be able thanks to be a
48 volt battery type where you've got a
maximum power point tracker I didn't
touch on what that is it's very
important thing solar panels are
basically constant current device almost
perfect constant current devices so the
amount of party again is kind of what
voltage your point out to applaud as
close as you can really to their to the
to a high voltage something close to
their maximum old really about
seventy-five or eighty percent other
maximum voltage so they maximum power
point trackers basically impedance
matching device between the panels can
output and what the batteries out of
these pensaba i'm going to use on the
house at 24 kilowatt hours of storage
that will be 12 these marine batteries
aren't it can be our families and our
other cheaper than costco for better
season box above on the temporary
install 10 of these handles seven Beach
160 watts and I'm really going to have a
kilowatt hours of storage without be
plenty of shorts first and I got a
couple really nice in da ting pure sine
wave inverter now they're not really
pure sorry they've got about five
percent are my storage but they're
really amazing and girders there 30 600
watts each I get two of them they can
hook up out facing at 240 110 to 240 120
volts ac 0 so here's a sort of block
diagram for those who demand filaments
or is it we've got the day according to
the stage for a constant current source
which life spans both into the power
around seven two bolts you can short it
down 20 rolls instilling it's slightly
more current so you want to keep it up +
that 72 volts that's what the maximum
power point charting does it keeps
manage downs with 48 volt batteries when
used it also is great as a very thanks
to control logic it keeps the batteries
happy and then assabet matters very thin
charge the problem just leaving a
battery set flat or not enough to take
years of its life so the batteries
themselves and the ultimate system will
be 24 these are 15 amber our bubble
marine lead acid batteries hope dies for
our series six parallel to give me 48
volts with a lot of storage the battery
said again they're both is 48 volts and
that's input DC to the ax murder and the
inverter set up with an autotransformer
so I can only have one inverter on from
one look at 240 volts or if the load of
names wasn't theirs have come on and
supply up to the city center 200 watts
of course till batteries go flat at the
recipes most nurses fire is going to
show you the legacy of putting in this
little up temporary setup for the
contract between a duck 10 post help
setting speed post is inch and a quarter
kanya for the rail civil with elijah
wood panels on this is all set to get it
on the lower cost
lowes or whatever and there we had a
little cocky act because an 18-wheeler
pulled out the end of the country road I
wanted to unload the panel's of course
we're about four miles from there and so
we had to slide the 13-yard a pound
calvin off of the book game that
18-wheeler runs in my friend nick's
truck there and my heart was in my mouth
must be the time so that's 30 of panels
around 1300 wats 1,300 pounds including
the way to the pallets over so this
these are the 12 that people off the
stack now he is for the temporary setup
and that's what it looks like when there
are lashed to those rails and we want a
trash can cover our electronic gear in
all societies see what a typical riveted
to project when he is and in fact we
tried our best to to short out the
inverter to see if there was going to be
any trouble so I cut that boss bitch two
and a half worth of our compressor and
basically got it almost pumped up to his
work pressure
that unplugged it and plugged back in
together when you do that that basically
puts the maximum upload as you could
possibly ever have so I did that while
it was dripping with the seven quarter
inch mark our skill saw which also could
cause about 13 and communication are and
they avert it didn't even grunt they
just they just perform beautifully so
here's a larger scale picture you can
see inside of the trash can cover the 22
about that converters and the big parts
on the left is the AC output of the box
and right is an AC input switching shut
pc shunts and other things at the top of
their infancy laying on the side maybe
of the outback charge controller and
that's the same page matter between
panels and batteries and also keeps
batteries happy and then here's a closer
up picture the same thing and I can't
really recommend this objects up to Alex
just joined use very robust at one point
I had the inverse wired up so they were
give aids that out phase across that
barbican from which means that they were
ashore driving into one hug I switch the
thing on it with the with the air
compressor on and grunted a little bit
on the side it was going to pack it in
and turn
so many of them started up the
impressment just fine I did that a
pharmacist time so if it was wrong and
I've been with this one so here's the
finished set up there and that's what
contractors are plugging into they've
been using a half just to find everyone
they keep bringing new things over the
plugins evening right and there's my
house under construction it's actually
out at Walter so what did we learn well
but I thought about bringing up this
temporary setup for the contractor I've
done be a piece of cake when I have it
all done a couple days we spent mid with
my friends spent for our days together
then I spend another three days by
myself hiding it up it was a lot more
something found go wrong in our case the
worst thing was relationship having this
stuff delivered four miles away in
Duncan off the back making bill instead
of having delivered to the site I have a
few of mine but don't go into it
something like this video he's going to
be smooth always estimate longer than
you think if you possibly take and
papered main components I've been
through a number achievement burgers and
charge controllers and having worked
that out back stronger too good and good
and by all means use pure sine wave
inverters because he took off I saw me
they
for sure and if you're eating order with
the different resistance he or something
sure you get that for fun but you're
driving an inductive load like a
refrigerator something like that
contractors terrible and it makes it a
motor running water and you don't get
anything like behind a national park
mysteries like to have shop around for
prices I end up by my nails for about a
half the going rate and a very fine
panels learn about very caring feeding
the sort of the common law ran off the
resistances the first time you get your
battery back you're insulting and run
your batteries may need an unsub every
start out by there any kind of pic care
batteries because they're very the less
a relatively long time if you take care
of and you can write them overnight
literally no but answering often created
really really works and as I pointed out
my team's starting to set up a system
having this sword power bill website
really makes me where the energy comes
from the worst one so that's really all
I have can you hear me ok ok there we
are start my presentation there ok
come back up in a minute just look I'm
just looking at blue screen anyway CD
press the arrow key to our you'll see
what's one year ago thank you for next
there you go okay yeah I'm Kurt noak
founder of Cold War me committee with
the Sierra Club and blah blah this is
what shady does i'm going to go back
here home for the bill back SP go back
this is shading on a cloudy day shading
is very important and very sensitive on
a cloudy day it doesn't matter that much
i'm going to go back he should go back
doesn't want to go better half it'll put
that okay they're shading on a cold day
okay just go back one all right on this
is just a little pine tree that shades
your writers or two and murders it's
normally a bell-shaped curve this is
time on the x-axis and power on the
y-axis just a little bit of shade that
stripes your ray knocks out the
production forty percent big production
so i wanted to drill that in your head
to get a good shading analysis very
important if you want nothing else this
is the same array and a cloudy day and a
cloudy day there is technically no
because the Sun scatters and the crowds
it comes down evenly so on that same
array it only loses fourteen percent of
its energy on a cloudy day so if you
have some shade in the winter it's not
as big of a deal because it tends to be
rainy and cloudy I'm just going to
breeze through some pictures there's
trying to amazos fit on a hip roof there
I am on a roof with the boss that's what
they look like on installations this is
a wood shake roof you can occur this
they look nice when they're even rose
and compare that with that so this is a
strip lining cooperation that's a valid
comparison and aesthetics
I love that picture I had to fill it in
I pressed their ok twice so it's going
to storm through twice I'm trying to get
off this it's not my goal to stay here
but anyway the next picture I guess just
takes a minute here now will be four
slides ahead so you guys are going to
speed blast these were made computer
catches up to us but it's going to be a
subpar installation there's I'm going to
go through at the end of a fact sheet
over here anyone must have sighs them as
a technical formulas I created myself ok
it was a solar Arbor ok that's our best
looking system compared to the previous
slide we built our vers too ok just
gonna have to wait the computer here
what's story of our life wait for
computer right these are the important
benefits of solid rising electric costs
are avoided solar costs less up front
when you finance it anyone over a
hundred dollars a month your electric
bill it's going to cost you less money
to take a loan and pay that than you all
the systems like going in the house
investment is recouped upon resale so
your principles protected because when
you sell your house it will be worth
more than what you paid for the system
and the really kicker is is appreciate
over time it's your savings increase
over time as possible echt rissa t goes
up an autograph to show you that but
most important thing of all there's not
money in my book it's a success of the
humans
cases if we fail to put in solar we may
fail as a species but trumps everything
in my book PG knees solar payback rates
in graphic form I had a great thing in
the summer you can see it's 29 cents a
kilowatt hour noon to six three and a
half times the rate as when you use it
if nine cents in the summer so you can
size a system thirty-eight percent
smaller and the south-facing sunny array
thirty-eight percent less cost and still
zero out your bill using the time of you
straight schedule it's huge let's say so
many people put in solar in California
net metering is just when you get retail
credits and your meter goes backwards
you get credit at the retail rate
whatever that is and the summer and
excess can be applied to winter it's on
a true up and the billing cycle and you
get three to one ratio during the summer
on the Gator goes backwards is three
times as fast as when it goes forwards
because the credits are worth more and
you get full retail credits this is how
much solar costs this is what the great
way to look at i love this slide has
three different users 1 600 kilowatts
hours a month which is go normal one is
hot medium-high and when is very high
1350 so you see the highest user was
paying 326 dollars for their electricity
every month and this is gonna cost after
rebate should probably go less than that
with the sun comment conservatively 47 k
over the course of 25 years you spent 47
k out front after 25 years of 5% price
inflation is
fifteen thousand dollars for a date
system and that's a three hundred and
thirty-five percent of what the system
costs most people are closer to one of
these to the medium or small and I just
love that slide I'm going to go to the
next one this is why I put in solar I
also love this one look with electricity
costs of 1970 that's two cents a
kilowatt hour look what it cost now what
depends on what your pain but on average
it's about 14 or 15 cents a kilowatt
hour so and that's going to continue
that long-term trend as fossil fuels run
out so you're really protected from this
kind of thing with solar because it's
free to operate once you pay for it I'm
going to wait for the computer now I
guess they use arrow keys so I just want
to make a plug for my class on August
25th here we go this is how to size a
system pick up the fact sheet on the
back basically take your annual electric
usage and here's a formula and AC watts
of its system size you divide it by 4.4
so your average daily electric load
excuse me / 4.4 let's go through the
formula 20 kilowatt hours a day is
normal divide that by four point four so
to generate as much power as the average
retail electric user needs you need a
4.5 kill at AC system size or that's
without a time use meter to zero out
your bill with an e7 PG&amp;amp;E Tommy use
meter you divide your average electric
load by seven and you can actually put
in like a 2.9 kilowatt AC system size
and you will have a zero villages
substantial savings over
point plot so there's kind of two ways
to look at those are the formulas and
people have their own this is assuming
san jose california which is equivalent
to five point four peeps sent hours and
self facing some your red if you're
facing a different direction and a
different location it may be different
this is my class august 25th i go
through tons of details it's a great
class you're welcome to come to that and
that's what I am so with up questions
now I think so this first yes I'll win
second we have a microphone to pass
around or spinning currency that's all
you can use mine is if you have ten
thousand dollars to spend any on a save
the world from global warming how
effective do you think getting solar
panels on your house is compared to
other things you can invest the money
yet a great question let's say it is all
individual depends on the person solar
panels renewable energy is the solution
to global warming is the way to create
the power responsibly if you can do
things to save energy you might be
cheaper to conserve but eventually you
can have to get your power from
somewhere I'd say when power so in any
renewable energy is a source each one I
mean even just a David's microphone on
feel free to pipe up if you do
answer these questions okay balloon
who's next okay we pass to my awesome
I wanted to ask I guess David and Kurt
about the lead batteries in their
lifetime and if there are other
solutions really the only way to get
this is on batteries are great if you're
off grid is your honor it I really
against my mother fam because they are
expensive during efficient that we're
all from toxic that's why but if you're
off grid they're great there you can
just tear for your batteries that you
want to talk about this on the other
side there in New York oh yeah go
carefully taking very spirited taken
care of last five years and they're
actually amazingly recyclable when you
return the battery as poor and gets new
battery there's a no for additional
pollution to speak up at all and
training that back into another battery
so they're pretty ugly things and I
tried I resisted for years getting
involved with batteries that's why my
original water pump said it was a direct
solar and I spent a lot of time fighting
scheming I can build the frigerators
atropine directs over everything else
but i acquiesced the batteries because
otherwise you're talking about I a lot
of specialized for a major on
specialized equipment that costs much
much more than the standard equipment
and definitely have to pay back for
instance you can never appreciated this
design be great solar but the
refrigerator alone for very small
capacitor figures from that five and a
half cubic feet cost around sixteen
hundred dollars and it requires pc
brought right to the house so now you're
trying to make that copper wires to
bring DC to the house versus having the
batteries well covers a copper mining as
a problem as well so I hate batteries
but I just don't know what else to do
and keep in mind that there are new
better technologies coming online that
are more efficient than that acid the
lithium ion and the nickel metal hydride
batteries showing a lot of promise so
yes I agree better a little bit off the
grid this was gone and it working good
and they're perfect of the lettuce when
do you have a great one like local 1015
another question that's my cover go
ahead so I have a solar system and
actually is my second system second
house and I had East 7 for a while and I
thought that that didn't really work for
me because I was consuming more than I
was producing so I never had the puppy
and three times and whatever you have a
comment on that so what I have now is I
have a solar system when i'm using
depends on the size or system and use
energy for welding the afternoon you
don't when you set it all depends
everyone uses energy different time hi
reprogram is pulled around at different
times so it tries to conserve into 695
seven people we deal with it e seven or
eight schedule some people may not care
about building a bigger system thirty
percent bigger you don't need e74
generates my powers going to put in
bigger system but almost everyone puts
any sevens for their benefit unless
you're welding in the afternoon where
you made you have two small the system
or something I'm not sure we can go over
that offline one another question what's
there I just might have mentioned so in
our system but you know its sides a
little bigger I where significant
producers in the afternoon you know 26
and right now in the summertime you know
when I turned on my pool pump I up the
bullpup were actually slight consumers
of electricity overall but you know it's
strongly producing so for us it works
out I'm a little worried act with the
winner see how that goes
so you mentioned the importance of the
angle of solar panels so if I have a
house where the roof is pitched let's
say this is how because they're
basically normal for me no westwards
great to the finders facing west blessed
herself are equally good financially
south I'll produced over the course of
the year as long as it's not too steep
on the west before and 12 left pitch is
really very very good but east you want
to avoid because a time use rates you
want to face the afternoon Sun West is
fine I would just add that you don't
have to be too worried about went here
five degrees off around the other the
computation this request paid towards
the cosine of the error angle that is
the city error for the normal it's
really only have to worry about for
modern angles anything up to say 15-20
grades all the lawsuits that you're
going to see is equivalent to the
percentage
panel yeah and to add my two arrays are
slowed significantly differently right
so the one that goes on the back is
what's it like a five percent slope and
one of them facing the west is more like
a 20-percent slow so and you know you
can see that you know so that the back
array is better in the mornings which is
optimal for from a PG d point of view
maybe from a global warming point of
view it's irrelevant but from a PG any
point of view it's a little different
but you know it's okay I think that's a
minor effect as long as you know you're
in general facing the right directions
and the major effective cloud comes
interested in the solar cell industry
itself and how that nine to ten dollars
might change over the next IV agent if
you're the rate is cost of the
equipment's gradually going down the
rebates are going down to three times
faster so if anyone's considering solar
did serve customers right away and
that's been pretty sure the best time to
buy solar was three years ago Lorraine's
for 450 watt rebate and the equipment
costs actually gone up a little bit
because demand so bright but I think
it's kind of peaked now there's been a
huge long downward trend of panel prices
over the last 20 30 years now they're
kind of leveling off they're gradually
going down and they will continue that
depend on supply and demand but the
rebates in California go down two to
three times faster than the cost of the
gradual decline comedy that is in
dollars is equipment costs versus today
oh yeah the content the solar panels
about sixty percent of the cost
converters about ten percent and
everything else is about thirty percent
the rails the electrical installation
the permitting the discussion the Palio
the whatnots is thirty percent John just
have
my operating system has ended up cost me
around forty fifty cents is called what
plus a lot of burner another question
over here go ahead i have received two
bids and two of the bits almost exactly
the same the only difference was that
one couple of losing BB panels and
others using junkins difference those
are both great panels it doesn't really
matter as long as their crystalline
technology any of the major
manufacturers have fantastic products
out there those are all reputable
manufacturer sharp i personally that's
my favorite between those two but i
don't want to say bad things about the
other company but the sharps are very
very hot calling in my opinion initially
you know I google here we have the
sharps on the roof my house that's the
Sun power ones they seem to work by my
issues have never been in the Sun
I hope anybody here from his solar
project but I forget that they you know
they installed 9000 panels they have a
pretty good idea of how many above
malfunctioned I seem to remember hearing
like one or two you know so the product
seemed pretty good I'll say this in
about that though about you know picking
contractors we got two bids to I got one
from Kurt and I got one from solar city
and you know I'm sure they would it
would have been fine either way quite
honestly I wound up picking you know my
gut told me what you've been easier to
deal with maybe solar say we've been
fine too but you know I just got more
warm fuzzies and you know the truth is
you know things do happen in the project
we you know I Kurt and I we're on the
roof or three hours one day changing our
design you know I think in the end if
you see small differences in prices you
know pick who you think you know from
you is going to be easy to work with and
work with them but I think the good news
is that probably uh most of the
contractors around here are quite good I
know a lot of people for instance who
got SolarCity jobs done in the garden so
I could go either way so just comment
there
certainly as any copper sorry I'm
getting my solar panels in through solar
city and they seem pretty good I'm sure
definitely shop around but for this one
okay sorry one time in when you got to
mine therapy thing yeah the solar
contractors are very responsible bunch
of people people go into the business
because it's the right thing to do not
to make a lot of money so their parts in
the right place when they're choosing a
contract will end on experience trust
your gut interview your contractor find
out their credentials with their
experiences and then trust yourself and
go for because I I don't think of rarely
her divorce yeah I don't think you ever
had people at difficult some
satisfaction with different solar
contractors but there's really no of
course presenter because it was that the
panel's themselves they generally have
manufacturer warranties it was 120 years
and the expected lifetime in panel is
more like four years so and also a lot
of the how many companies students who
are probably a fair number also have the
installation guarantees for certain
number of years as well yeah its report
in your escalation guarantee with the
California Solar Initiative and the
panels are 20 to 25 year warranties
Milko 40 plus years
I went into sped up a creek side slide
about the question on solar angles I
mean I some angles to the Sun for a
second you can see here you can see my
two arrays the green line and the the
blue line on the bottom right so the
green line is the front array that's
tilted 22% for the West I guess and the
blue line is like whatever eight percent
toward the west and I actually have 18
panels and green and 14 panels it is
blue and so you could you know it should
be you know there should be a big
difference in the ending production rate
or more panels you can see as you know
in the earlier part of the day where the
Sun angle is favoring the blue panels to
see they're about equal and then you can
see as the Sun moves West in fact you do
see the difference if you could also see
you know at peeking you know as this
one's facing more straight up it
speaking you know closer to the middle
of the day where it's this one is you
know tilton to the west and it speaking
later on in a day so you can see the
effect of Sun angle right here and you
know there is a you know between us a
2020 600 you know there is a difference
that it makes on your production but
it's not like you know after 20 degrees
out you go down to half power and let
them
your mother
most guys are talking about maintenance
how often do you clean your pals and you
talk to scrub it or it just hose it down
duh I don't think quite honestly I mean
I've only had them for four months in
class I don't think that there's a big
effect on that yeah you know I i heard
that Google made the decision that it's
actually cheaper not to scrub the panels
that you know the loss of production
that they get from whatever you know
winds up on those panels up there is
minor compared to the cost of hiring
people to go up there and clean them
somehow so i think google made that
decision you know for me i'm pretty sure
that went you know in the fall when we
get all sorts of leaves and stuff like
that it might be worth my while to go up
there and you know I've got the trees to
produce those leaves and perhaps google
doesn't but i think in general it isn't
in it i had you know being a new solar
up on her i showed you that slide where
I you know I was that by keeping them
clean and I went up there and sure
enough I got this big game performance
and then a half hour later the game was
gone and like I say that was all cooling
 ugly let me just say that the
408 month raise that I've got my country
place has never been cleaning is at a
slight pitch that you saw and just rain
after wash off
but issues related to tracking systems
it will track this in yeah that's more
important if you're an offering
application northern latitudes around
here it's really a waste of money would
get maybe twenty five percent more power
I took up moving parts some people break
down and you can really I'd recommend
people to spend extra money for the
tracker and put up our solar panels feel
much better off it's maintenance-free
what you're putting the panel's once you
forget about office if you clean them
you know some people once or twice a
year in the summer in California just
hose them down that's what you recommend
you do get you know five percent more if
they're really dusty we seem ten percent
if it's very dusty locally so trackers
are a waste of a waste of my personal
opinion we install them a forum past
they're really good if you're in
northern climates you're trying to
optimize winter Sun but in the summer
here in the winter Sun is not really
that financially you know beneficial
calculates are flowing as some of you
I completely agree with her just spend
the extra money on more panel have
another question there okay you
mentioned called the cooling effect on
the fact that you have served a faction
I has there been any research into
looking at you know setting up my
sprinklers you know funny that you are
areas bush i won't i won't answer the
question director like particular but
they also sell pool heaters aren't old
warrant right then that's their business
in fact i guess they're have to business
originally doing that and so you know i
suggest that hey make this combination
pull right warmer solar system you know
and then the pool will cool off your
panels and it's a win-win and curtain
groups both came back and said are you
crazy you know mix water with high
voltage Elena like our electricity you
know what a terrible idea but but I
think they're actually our ideas like
that would see what's the question again
I'm so it was just running down you're
going down yes yeah there's a there's an
that's done you know some with a gas
station that does that you know every 20
minutes it comes on in the Central
Valley and they get better performance
because water is free over there that's
one of the benefits of solar that
requires no water so you can do and you
know hose him down it goes up
temporarily but it's it's a very minor
thing and most people don't do that and
no I don't know any product out there
but just put some sprinklers up there
but you know you want to be careful that
you don't firmly shock your panels
because it gets very hot me 150 degrees
in the afternoon to spray went to water
in the afternoon that'll calm you cool
down rapidly metal cause expansion and
contraction over time that may weaken
some of the wiring in them so I don't
know what to really gain anything is
going to be because problems in the long
run but by cycling those thermal
expansions and contractions more could
you see all right
