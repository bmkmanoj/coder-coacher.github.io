engineering manager in the Waterloo
office
I was actually the the first Google hire
into that office the office started with
a small acquisition so I was employee
number four in in Waterloo and so I've
seen it go from four people in 2006 to
over a hundred today and I wanted to
take a little bit of time to talk about
the the cool stuff we've done there so
before joining Google I was running a
little database startup that had to do
with building a database engine using
text search data structures instead of
beech trees and that was really cool
because it had all kinds of different
performance characteristics than a
traditional database so naturally I
assumed when I came to Google I would
work on search but no actually I worked
on completely different things so we'll
talk about the the stuff that we've
actually done in Waterloo we recently
moved you can see here a picture of our
new building we're in the tannery in
downtown Kitchener now and this new
space is really beautiful inside it's
all very old original flooring and old
original construction combined with a
very modern Google look and feel and so
the best picture I got of the new office
was of our the fastest method from
getting from the third floor to the
second floor the the slide I would
recommend that if you ever use the slide
you should keep your feet off of the
bottom to maximize your speed and lie
back and it's very very quick and you
can ignore the sign that says don't take
your laptop down it's really fine so the
the new space that we're in is very
exciting to us because we were kind of
crammed into our old space as we got
really big and so now we have space in
this new location to at least double and
possibly triple the current population
of Googlers working Waterloo and so
that's really exciting we also have some
great new facilities like on-site
cooking staff who make our meals for us
which is really great and it's fun to be
able to talk the chef and complain to
her about the lack of your favorite kind
of food and then it will likely appear
the following week so that's been very
good and we we do social TGIF every
Friday where we just get together with
beer and pizza and you know
well not that different actually than
what we have here and treats to get
together and play games and socialize
and then we do the companies TGIF on on
Monday for for people outside maybe they
don't know every every week there's TGIF
meeting in Mountain View where the
founders stand up and talk about the
significant events of the past week and
answer questions and things like that so
it's a great way to connect with what's
going on across the entire company and
we do a replay of that video on Mondays
for the informational aspect and we do
the beer and party thing on Fridays for
the for the social aspect so it's been a
great new facility and we're having a
lot of fun there in terms of the areas
that we work on in wire Lou
I'd say broadly speaking there's four
categories of work going on we're
working on ads we're working on Chrome
and Chrome OS we're working on Commerce
and we're working on mobile applications
so in each of these areas we have a
pretty significant team commerce is the
newest one where they'll be working on
things like shopping google.com and
other shopping related experiences on
the commerce side we're really looking
forward to a day where we can connect
the sorts of searches that you do online
with the actual shopping experience that
you have offline and we think there's a
really big opportunity there for us
where today you might do a whole bunch
of searches about a camera that you're
gonna buy and then go buy it and there's
no connection for the merchants to
figure out whether they're advertising
got you to go to their shop or things
like that but you could imagine a world
where because of some interaction that
you had online when you arrived at the
store somebody would come out to you and
say oh hello Alex I know you're in stood
in the Nikon d70 I have yours here for
you and you're just ready to go ahead
and purchase it with whatever discount
comes with having found it through
through us so we're trying to really
connect the whole shopping experience
together in a way that makes it
significantly more fun to shop as a
consumer and also gives the advertisers
some additional value by connecting the
consumer to the to the to the vendor to
the so I started the search career that
got in there now that's all speculative
I mean we might or might not build
something exactly like what I just
described but there's very interesting
ideas you can think about about
scenarios like that that could really
change the face of how people shop in
commerce
on the outside we've got a couple of big
projects that are that are making a huge
impact on a Google scale now making
impact at Google is kind of hard to do
because things tend to be measured in
the billions
and so having projects at our site which
are measured in the billions is pretty
significant to us and so we do have a
adds product called conversion optimizer
which essentially what it does is bid
more for your ad at a time when the user
is more likely to buy your product and
so that's really cool and I have a whole
slide about that later and around Google
we like to share figures quite a bit but
for our purposes here I'll just say it
this makes X billion dollars for Google
every year and so that's a very
significant project to be coming out of
our site also in ads we work on ad
exchange which is like a stock exchange
for advertising and infrastructure
projects that keep the the whole system
humming and ads takes a lot of traffic
and so there's a lot of heavy-duty
infrastructure work to be done there on
Chrome Westside I'm leading the chrome
OS team in waar Liu and we are working
on porting Chrome OS to new devices and
so there's lots of cool stuff that I
can't talk about to this audience going
on in that sphere but let's just say
that we see lots of new devices coming
to market in the next two to four years
and we want Chrome OS to be a great
platform for those devices and then
finally in mobile apps we've been
building mobile apps for all platforms
except Android in Waterloo and so that
always causes confusion whenever I say
we're working on mobile in Waterloo
everybody always says oh what are you
building for Android
well actually working all the rest of
mobile in Waterloo we do do some Android
development but it's predominantly
things like the version of Gmail that
you get to when you go to gmail.com and
your iPad or iPhone or things like that
and so we've got a very significant team
working on those things as well so I
wanted to dive into three specific case
studies of events that I've had a lot of
fun with in Waterloo and how the people
in Waterloo made a big difference to
Google so back when the iPad was
launching it turns out desktop Gmail
just wasn't a fit you went and fired it
up your fingers were too fat for the
targets there was too much on the screen
at once for this
sort of tablet experience it just didn't
feel like a good way to deal with your
mail on this device that was too big to
be called a phone but too small to be
called a computer we tried running the
mobile version on it and it just looked
crazy wide it was like oh honey I blew
up my cell phone it didn't really feel
like the right experience there either
it was so much white space and so much
wasted space so on March 15th we pitched
a plan to build an iPad optimized
version of mobile Gmail so for people
who don't remember the launch dates
around the launch of the Apple iPad they
were launching in the first week of
April so March 15th was relatively close
to the anticipated launch date of the
actual hardware that we were going to
ship on and so this was a pretty amazing
effort by my team we executed really
fast and we actually had it shipped in
time for launch day live in time for
launch day and that was really amazing
so even by Google standards where things
move very fast going from nothing to a
product launch in three weeks was was
incredible and I managed to connect with
somebody at Apple and convince them that
although it was not supposed to be
possible for me to buy devices on that
day that I should be allowed to buy
devices because having Google stuff work
well and their hardware was going to be
important to them as well as to us and
so we managed to make some special
arrangements and Alex Ken Berg who's
sitting in the second row here and I got
to drive down to Buffalo and pick it up
on the madness of launch day and verify
that there there were no significant
bugs actually what I was expecting was
we were gonna hit significant bugs and
we'd have to wake up the whole team back
home to go fix them but as it turned out
there were no significant bugs which no
doubt was due to our superior planning
and execution and a little bit of luck
so so we had a great time it was a lot
of fun a very sort of quick reaction to
a situation where we were sort of
unprepared for this product launch and
went to something that was pretty
credible and we got some great press
lots of people blogging about it and
talking about it and asking why they
couldn't use this interface on their
other computers and only on the iPad and
so it was a very pleasing moment for the
Waterloo mobile team putting this out
there the second one I want to talk
about is already alluded to is
conversion optimizer and conversion
optimizer is so
the canonical ads win at Google I mean
how do you build a company around
advertising in a way that you don't
irritate people this is I think very
difficult to think about right I mean
how about I've always thought of ads as
an irritant
I've always wondered how Google made
money and the way we make money it turns
out is by providing ads that provide
real value and this is a great product
in that vein
it's win-win-win for everybody so the
way it works is the advertiser will
build bid more for the ad if you're more
likely to buy the product and if you
think about that if you click on an ad
and the result of that is that you
actually buy the product on the other
end of the ad then you must have liked
what you clicked on or you wouldn't have
paid for it right either that or the
advertisers are really hoodwinked you
once you click on the ad and saw their
landing page but the bottom line is we
can assume that if you're spending your
money on the advertiser site after
clicking on an ad it's because you
really got what you wanted so much so
that you're prepared to put your hard
cash behind it
so you as a consumer are happy with that
it gave you what you wanted you were
able to buy what you needed the
advertiser is happy because what
conversion optimizer basically gives
them is for the same dollar amount of
spending they get more conversions so
they sell more product for the same
amount of advertising budget and so
that's great for them in some cases the
difference is dramatic you can see some
of the examples here the the first
example they boosted their conversion
rates four hundred and thirty three
percent you know that's that's a big
difference and essentially all you have
to do is click a checkbox and the ads
interface that's what it entails getting
this set up so that's a big difference
for a very low effort on the part of the
advertiser and in each of the cases that
are on the on the display here they saw
similar big big big results so it's
pretty clear to me that the consumer
wins because they buy what they want and
that the advertiser wins because they
make more money for spending less money
and so it's perhaps not as obvious how
Google wins but at the end of the day of
course Google wins by having the highest
quality advertising product in the
market and what actually happens in our
experience is that once an advertiser
realizes that they can click this
checkbox spend the same amount of money
and make more they spend even more
because now they're making more money
and it's worth it to them to spend even
more to get even more
customers acquired so it is really
win-win-win for everybody you know the
advertiser makes more and spends more
Google's customers are happier and
Google's product is stronger so it's a
fantastic contribution and it's been
really exciting to have this product you
know led out of the engineering team in
Waterloo the team in this case is split
between Waterloo and Mountain View but
they found the founding member of the
team is in war loo and a lot of the you
know the fundamentals behind what makes
it work are all Waterloo driven so it's
been a it's really been fun to be doing
something that makes a difference the
bottom line of a company as big as ours
from our office last thing I want to
talk about is 20% impact how many people
have heard of 20% time about 20% of you
so maybe I'll describe it briefly so the
notion of 20% is that every engineer can
spend 20% of their time inventing
whatever they want and it sounds great
right I actually asked every interviewer
back in 2006 when I was interviewing to
come to Google you know tell me is 20%
for reals
you know I can just take a day off every
week and do whatever I want and they all
assured me that it was well it turns out
you know it is a challenge to get good
results out of your 20% time it's easy
enough to take a day a week to go fix a
bug but then once you get within Google
and you're trying to figure out how to
make an impact on a Google scale it's
more challenging and we've had some
things come out of our 20% time Waterloo
that I'm pretty proud of but I wanted to
highlight three specific ones here one
of them was a couple of engineers went
off and started experimenting with this
augmented reality idea where you could
hold up your cell phone and look through
the viewfinder of your camera and have
metadata marked up on the live view of
the things that were in your camera's
viewfinder based on information that was
inside the Google Maps database so this
was really neat because you could you
know hold it up and point it at a
landmark and get told what it was or
point at a store and get told her that
was and so this is a really successful
20 percent demo we flew those engineers
here at Mountain View to demonstrate it
to a bunch of people and wound up
getting that added as a feature to the
Google Google Goggles product for its
launch and so that was a really exciting
seeing something go from you know
prototype concept that a couple of
engineers had done in a week or two in
our office
- something that launched as a live
feature and a finished product the my
entire project is actually the result of
20% time so basically I took a few
engineers and said look just disappear
for a couple of weeks and go build this
demo for me and then I will pitch it to
the relevant VPS and get a project
started and so we went from a 20% sprint
that we did hmm I guess last November
now so a year in three months ago or so
and to the point now where we have a 17
person team working on this project
building chrome wants four new devices
all based around that demo and so that
was really great to see how we could
take an idea a concept translate it into
a prototype and then translate it into a
full-on project at Google and then
finally also had a lot of fun over the
years building mobile apps and
frameworks that show how much you can do
on mobile browsers so I think this is
still something that has relatively low
penetration in the marketplaces
consciousness today but if you go into
airplane mode on your iPhone and go to
the gmail.com website it can actually
load up Gmail and show you your email
even though you're offline you can
compose an email and start a message and
read messages that you've read recently
and that all works even though you're in
a web browser and you have no
connectivity so this is the kind of wow
you can do that in a browser effect that
we're trying to push out there and get
the development community aware of and
we've had a lot of fun building
frameworks that demonstrate this
spending our 20% time writing technical
blog posts we've been solicited to go
write a book about it stuff like that
and it's being great to see this sort of
technology leadership that we've done on
the mobile side getting such terrific
press so it's been it's been lots of fun
these are just a sampling of sort of the
biggest projects that I think have made
a difference and so I wanted to share
them with you so then for the finish I
just wanted to say kind of what's the
overall goal of the site I'm one of the
managers in the site and my goal is a
manager of the Waterloo site is to make
sure that we have projects that fit
together in such a way that the
individual's work can be double or
triple counted so what do I mean by that
I want to have projects where there's
obvious interconnects between them so
we're working on commerce we're working
on mobile it's natural that we should do
some things in the mobile commerce
intersection where
on ads and we're working on Chrome OS
it's natural that we should look at
something that goes between ads and
Chrome lights and I think it's really
valuable to find these interconnections
and one of the great things about being
in a small site with a small management
team who's looking for things like that
is that we can find ways to make sure
that the work that the individual teams
do has really high impact in the
marketplace as a whole but also high
impact within Google by by satisfying
the needs of multiple stakeholders who
aren't necessarily all always looking
out for each other so we're looking for
those interconnects and finding ways
that we can build products that are at
the intersection of various different
efforts within Google and take
advantages of the strengths of our teams
so that's been a lot of fun doing that
as well so in terms of stuff I have to
say that that's about it but I wanted to
leave a good chunk of time at the end of
my talk for QA and I have just shy of 10
minutes here for questions so don't be
shy raise your hand and have at me yes
oh that sounds bad I'll help you debug
that afterwards it should it should work
that's a bit strange that it doesn't
work for you but you know it should work
whether you were in it or not it should
launch from nothing in airplane mode we
I'll be happy to look at that afterwards
and try to figure out why it's not
working for you the person next to you
also had a question the question is what
do I see is the difference between
Chrome OS and Android and when will they
converge I think the the fundamental
difference between Chrome OS and Android
is that Chrome OS has a less-is-more
philosophy of providing you with just a
browser which is your window into the
Internet in which you do everything and
Android is more of an app based
philosophy more similar to the iPhone or
other devices where you know the
expected use cases that you're
installing applications to do what you
want I think it's completely unclear
which of these models is gonna win out
I'm working on Chrome OS I must have a
bias right but let's say that Google as
a company is big enough to be able to
invest in multiple potentially
contradictory approaches and
and be there on the winning side
whichever side wins right so I mean
right now I think we're gonna see huge
success in Android this year they're
gonna sell an unbelievable quantity
devices we're gonna see a huge upsurge
in the development of apps for Android
and so I think 2011 will be the year of
Android you know long term I have an
opinion about the web's longevity and
its ability to win and so I think that
that's also worth investing in I could
be wrong and that's okay we can do both
yeah oh yeah hey so similar question yes
so what do you what do you see the
future of frameworks such as PhoneGap
being things that take these html5
mobile apps and actually integrate them
with the phone's hardware do you do you
see that as the path that mobile
development is going to be going down in
general okay so the question is about
PhoneGap which is a library that lets
you write a JavaScript HTML app and
embed it inside an iPhone or an Android
application and then access the devices
native functionality through your
JavaScript API is that ultimately call
through to the C++ layer embedded in
PhoneGap and the question is how do I
see that is that the future of mobile
development actually the way I see those
technologies is as transition
technologies I think that eventually web
standards will move forwards and we'll
see people writing to more and more
advanced api's are available directly
within the browser but these these
transition technologies will give us
environments where they'll provide those
api's and we will see what's popular and
what kind of apps get written that will
ultimately drive the standardization of
similar api's for the browser so I think
these things provide a very useful
interim environment where people can do
stuff without going through the really
really slow standardization process in
order to get their apps written but
ultimately I think that the transit the
real transition here is for w3c or what
working group to take the ideas that are
in those apps and make them actual web
standards
there's a motivation people are asking
questions getting t-shirts yes sir take
sabbatical and work at Google you have
faculty and grad students come and so
the question is what kind of
relationship do we have with the
University of Waterloo and the answer is
we really need more people to help
deepen that relationship but we do do a
bunch of things there so first of all
Google as a whole has a Grants program
that we give small grants to students
who are doing interesting research and
so we've certainly gone multiple times
the University to get the profs to pitch
grant applications and then I've helped
the university match that money because
there's usually matching money from
industry and n circ around a grant so we
can start with a small you know $25,000
grant for a masters or PhD student and
then match it two or three times to wind
up with 75 or a hundred thousand dollars
and that becomes a pretty significant
research project so we've done that a
number of times and that's been fun
we've invited these students who have
done those projects to then come and
give a talk about their work after it's
finished you know a year year and a half
after the fact - at our site we've gone
occasionally to see talks that are at
the University or to try to you know get
get interest amongst the grad students
and in working at Google and so on in
terms of visiting professorships right
now we do that by connecting profs with
the research team here in Mountain View
there's the Waterloo office is an
engineering office there's not a
research arm there and so for people who
want to come on sort of a sabbatical and
work at Google we try to arrange it that
they can come here where the research
team is so and that's the extent of the
relationship I seem like my companion
wants to say something more on this
point Alex we did have a professor come
in for a sabbatical last fall oh I was
at work with ads it worked with ads
those ads people hit their professor
well okay so apparently we've also had a
professor in sabbatical with ads but I
wasn't aware of that case so that but
that's the extent of the relationship so
far it would be great to do even more
there
have more talks back and forth and so on
and that's basically limited by the
bandwidth of people who volunteer to
organize those things doesn't you get a
shirt he does okay over here on the
right what's the expected growth for
your office which technologies do you
think is gonna grow and how are you
compared to the salaries in the valley
okay three questions
what's expect to go through the office
what are the important technologies in
my opinion I assume I can't presume to
speak for Google and what is the
salaries like so expected growth for the
office is basically as fast as we can
hire so we need a lot more people for
commerce we need to double my team on
Chrome OS we need to do a significant
expansion in ads and we need to add more
people to the various mobile things that
were working on so in all dimensions
we're trying to grow the office and I
suspect that we'll start to hit the wall
in Waterloo once we break 200 people it
will start to get hard to hire as fast
as we want to but we're gonna keep going
indefinitely so the the growth is
definitely there in terms of what
technologies are important it's a bit
it's a bit hard to step away from my
biases here so I think web is gonna be
very very important continued investment
in both chrome as a platform as well as
javascript as language and web
development platforms obviously to
Google as a whole the Android platform
is very relevant in terms of things that
prospective applicants would need to
know to be successful at Google knowing
at least two of the the big three
languages well is definitely an asset
and the big three languages at Google
are Java C++ and Python oh and
JavaScript I guess - okay well two of
the four languages would be would be an
asset in terms of language knowledge the
company as a whole is doing so many
things that it's it's hard to say I mean
it's hard to be an Oracle and say what
will truly come out to be important in
the future and there was a third
question that I've now forgotten
salaries Oh
I guess the best thing I can say about
salaries is that we had somebody who
transferred from Mountain View to
Waterloo because he couldn't afford a
house in Mountain View and he got to
parley when he bought two of them so so
I think that the the the the standard of
living in Waterloo is significantly
higher than in the valley on a monetary
vs. value basis I mean certainly there
are some things that are more expensive
in Canada than in the US but on balance
it's it's easier to live high in
Waterloo than it is here and the
salaries are very competitive yes sir
but so this is an awkward one the
question is do we plan to have the
Chrome browser ported to Android is that
coming and unfortunately answer is I
know the answer to your question but I
don't know if I'm allowed to tell it to
you so I will try to look that up while
the next speaker is speaking and come
back and answer it if it's if there is
public knowledge on this point do we
have a need for for parallel computing
so Google as a whole certainly has a
need for parallel computing within the
projects that we're doing in Waterloo
specifically the places where we do the
most parallel computing are in ads where
there are machine learning systems and
also systems that process huge
quantities of simultaneous queries from
end users at the same time so we do do
that the kind of parallelism that we do
at Google is mostly coarse-grained
cluster type computing as opposed to
single programs that are highly
paralyzed that doesn't mean that there
aren't places where a single highly
paralyzed programs are important to but
the bias within Google is definitely
towards cluster type computing right
behind you yes you
the question is does Google have a plan
to establish an office in Toronto and if
so when would that be
there is an office in Toronto it's a
sales office so nope I was gonna say no
people work there so no engineers so no
engineers work there we we do run three
shuttles from the Toronto area to
Waterloo so right now if you were
planning on living in Toronto you could
ride one of the shuttles and the way
those shuttles work is there vanpools so
a different Googler drives the shuttle
each day and the other people can use
the wireless that's on board the van to
to do work or play games on their way to
the office each day not have to you know
worry about driving I can't speculate as
to whether we would ever open an office
in Toronto other than say that we are
always expanding and there is already a
site there it just doesn't do
engineering work it is also possible on
an occasional basis to work in the
Toronto office so if you were based in
Toronto and for some reason couldn't
come into our loo say perhaps due to
inclement weather you could go to the
Toronto office instead and they would
house you temporarily for a day on the
edge here do you plan to hire project
managers as well or it's a purely
development that you're looking at right
now the question is do we plan to hire
project managers or is it purely
development so at Google we don't hire
too many project managers we do hire a
fair number of product managers the
subtle distinction there so we don't
currently have a plan for a project
manager in Waterloo as we grow we will
eventually need that role but it's a
very uncommon role at Google as a whole
product managers on the other hand we
are constantly hiring and so are always
looking for people interested in product
management yes Google office in Mountain
View or is that all the synergy happens
within the Waterloo office so the
question is how much synergy is there
between our office and other sites and
so it depends on the on the team so on
the ads team
most of those teams are split between
Waterloo and New York or Waterloo and
Mountain View and so although we we make
a significant contribution from our new
almost every ads team has engineers at
one of the other sites on the mobile
projects most of those teams are
self-contained and completely autonomous
they basically execute and they
coordinate with teams here in Mountain
View but they're more kind of more
isolated in terms of they have more
autonomy from the rest of the company in
the in terms of Chrome OS which is the
team I'm running it's a small piece of a
much bigger team that's based here in
Mountain View and so we have autonomy
and control over certain sections of
chrome and Chrome OS but there's other
sections where we need to visit here to
coordinate and then in terms of commerce
we own primarily the mobile commerce
piece of Commerce and the other parts of
commerce are being done on other sites
so there's always some interaction
between the sites now specifically in
terms of word synergy I described how we
choose our products to try to create
connections across the different groups
and that's a within Waterloo effort
that's something we do in order to try
to make sure that the engineers inside
our office are getting more impact per
engineer than you would typically see at
other Google Sites and eventually like
all good ideas this will get copied by
other sites within Google but so far so
far so good where I believe we are in
the lead so you know in terms of
creating the cross team connections
that's an idea that seems to be unique
to our office at the moment and I'm
interested in whether you're hiring
people who are in media for the commerce
marketing for the ads I'm just
interested about those type of tires for
the Waterloo site so the question is are
we hiring people who are in media for
either
ads or commerce in the wirele site and
the answer is no we're not currently
hiring for those roles at our site that
doesn't mean you shouldn't engage with
Google I'm sure we're hiring for those
roles elsewhere and my tip would be if
you get to a point where you have an
offer from Google and it's for a site
that you don't wish to be at that's the
perfect time to approach your recruiter
and say
I really rather work somewhere else no
guarantees about how that would go but
that's that's the time to have that
conversation yes sir someone gave me a
t-shirt so I guess I owe you a question
now that's the kind of good conscience I
like to see in people so any extra
points poopy for being a Waterloo
alumnus in the next Googler not so far
as I'm aware although you know we do
have a large number of Waterloo alums in
in Waterloo and being an ex-googler
would mean that you're a known quantity
which would presumably make it much
easier to bring you on board so yeah
well we should talk afterwards we needed
to hear your story I should probably
hand off to my colleague from Montreal
who's gonna tell you all about how you
should really want to be in Montreal and
not in Waterloo hi my name is Nev I'm a
software developer in the Montreal
office I work in a security team
specifically on the anti-malware team
mr. offline stuff acting up on the
anti-malware team we provide you those
warnings in Firefox Safari Chrome
Facebook Twitter bunch of other sites
that use our Safe Browsing service to to
prevent you from going to sites any harm
your computer drive-by downloads or
phishing so LOX is right I'm here to
convince you to come to Montreal let's
see that so this is a my talk is
structured I'm gonna talk a little bit
about me I'm all unique in the office I
started my career at Google in Mountain
View actually I was started in this
office and a different career path as a
site reliability engineer it's more like
a system administrator like a super
system an administrator and I worked in
San Francisco I came from Victoria to
San Fran I stayed here for a couple
years and then I transferred to the
Montreal office and I changed ladders
and kind of career paths as well so I've
been in Montreal for about half and in
Mountainview for about half so talk
about my experiences there
I'll talk about the office the projects
we have in the office and the kind of
dynamic that we have and then I'll sell
you on the city if you don't know
already but if you don't know much about
it already I my first trip to Montreal
was actually to check out the office so
I'm not like a x.x Montreal or I'm from
West
I'm from the Kootenays in DC so I really
had no reason to be there
so here the numbers Alex talked a little
bit about the guy who went bought two
houses in Waterloo and you know it's a
similar kind of story in Montreal I was
paying about 1,500 for a half a bedroom
or half a bitch half a two-bedroom I
have one bedroom in impac Heights and in
the mission and then I moved to Montreal
and that's about my mortgage for a
two-bedroom place in my own and that's
that's huge difference and my commuting
time you know I lived in San Fran I'm
sure I think but she live in Mountain
View so it's probably a whole different
story for commuting but it my my life
changed as a result of buying power as
well as commuting time so here's a
little bit more about like the
experience differences in the office
when I first went to much for all I was
a little bit shocked it felt like maybe
you know what wasn't used to that I was
used to like a dozen cafes and like
scooters and stuff everywhere and you
know now we're like on one floor and one
cafe and only one massage person it was
yeah but anyway you know I I I started
appreciating it now when I come to like
larger offices like this I feel like you
know I'm one small kind of person
amongst thousands of people and I don't
know everybody's name and I don't know
their story so you know I I enjoy that
in the small in the small environment
it's a start-up environment without the
startup hours the majority of the people
in our office have families and they
they do the typical like nine-to-five
kind of deal and I end up doing the same
kind of thing too because I like working
working with them but there's some
people who come in at like 10:00 11:00
12:00 or 1:00 or 2:00
yeah here yes there's some people who
come in that's totally fine - so you
have the same flexible flexibly in your
schedule but this nine-to-five thing
means is that and without the commute
timings you can actually like have a
life outside of work which is something
I didn't quite have when I was living
the life in the valley so that impact my
social life I just kind of impacted like
Who I am and I'm really happy with the
person I am today with the move that I
made - that much feel that alone should
be enough for you to go but you know our
office we participate in each other's
lives which is kind of an interesting
thing I mean we you know I've gone to
like there's a I'm 20 when I joined the
officers like 25 or 26 and there's a
colleague on my team who's like in his
early forties you know I'm over it is
how it's like helping him build his
fence you know and he'll come to my
house parties and stuff you know and and
we've done road trips to Oktoberfest
like unofficial like not work-related
road trips and house parties and things
like that so it is it is like like I
said it really the startup environment
it's just really cool startup
environment but we don't work those
hours and we have money to play with all
right I can talk more about like the
intrinsic transition and stuff
afterwards if you guys want - I have
like interesting stories about all that
that I shouldn't say in front of
everybody and here's the office we're
located in a central location if you
know much you're all it's on the corner
of McGill and st. Catherine we're on top
of the table at Sur which is a
microbrewery brew pub and just two
minutes down from McGill University so
it's a prominent location the heart of
downtown walking distance from
everything I mentioned it's on top of a
brew pub we try to we're trying still I
guess to try to get like a keg kind of
like a tap put it right in her office
but I were pretty close and actually if
you don't been to Montreal
there's parts of the sea they're kind of
connected through underground so you can
but there's some condos you can actually
live in which are also connected to the
subway system so you can in some places
get to work without ever going outside
and from our office we can like get
stood like the gym
the movie theater dozens of tim horton's
without ever going outside i've want a
haircut it's like down the stairs
haircut get my pet you know it's very
cool very good location so I'm trying to
say I'll talk a little bit about the
projects now when I joined a couple
years ago we had less than 20 people
maybe like 17 and we're kind of on a
hiring frenzy now so we've dropped it 25
or 26 as of this week and we're
aggressively hiring so in the same boat
as out looks like we're probably not
gonna we're not gonna turn down talented
engineers at this point if you're smart
and you're good fit for Montreal we will
take you right now we have two focus
areas chrome and security I'll talk a
little bit more about those a couple
slides and we're looking at a third
focus area I honestly don't know what
that third focus area at me is it's
gonna be but it's in the works here's a
chrome team this is on I originally said
this was no pants day but this is pajama
day the no pants day pictures look quite
different we no pants you still wear
like boxers and stuff we didn't know
pants day we had like a candidate come
in for an interview and we did not say
anything to him like the guy who who met
him at the door was like our most senior
senior engineer and just showed up and
he was I think he was wearing sometimes
we do like to dress up no pants day
which means like a suit top but like
boxers and I think it was like a dress
up no pants today when he came and met
him at the door and our receptionist was
also like following the vibe and
everything in I was a very fun day so we
do these kind of things you know a small
office we can get a you know people come
up these crazy ideas and it's like
alright next week we're doing no pants
day or pajama day and I think we've done
a few no pants we've done a couple like
our one dress up no pants pajama day and
we all just for Halloween and all but
anything you can kind of imagine you
need a reason to dress up we do it these
are the teams these are some of the sub
teams working on Chrome GPU acceleration
its chrome UI kind of things the perform
for the performance stuff is interesting
it's a can't speak too much about the
details of it but they're like at the
end of the trying to make chrome faster
for everybody which is a good thing
which is a huge impact and Chrome Web
Store in webstore they're looking at
doing interesting things like
recommending extensions and apps for
Chrome users as well as Chrome OS people
and she kind of generalizing this
recommendation strategy and other
products throughout Google using
interesting tools like machine learning
and whatnot Chrome Frame is a project
that if you guys heard of it it it
allows you to run chrome inside of
Internet Explorer right yes not the
other way around
chrome inside of an explorer so you can
do things like I have an html5
experience inside of ie6 which sounds
crazy but it's possible I think YouTube
by default I think they as of like what
this year last year they stop supporting
i6 and the only way if you want i6
YouTube is used chrome frame and and
sites can get speed up by using chrome
frame and there's an open source project
that was released by some Googlers in
Montreal that shows you how you may run
used like this chrome frame
infrastructure areas to run Chrome
extensions Internet Explorer which is
very interesting as well and then this
pajama day security this is a day we did
we rented sumo suits and wrestled we
have come a come up with a crazy ideas
for tournaments we're all into
tournaments so we had a sumo tournament
we have an annual foosball tournament
what other kind of tournament so you
have you know lost track lost track so
yes we're probably working on an team
hour which I could described at the
beginning to talk and we're we've spun
up a new project for Chrome extensions
this is interesting it's it was the kind
of idea that was I guess I put it
forward and kind of got buy-in from
other people on scene as well as a
Chrome extension people here and it's
kind of created a new project so
we're hiring new engineers for that and
you know it's a new project kind of that
wasn't originally there that we kind of
created on our own
I'm just very interesting and our team
is known for whiskey Wednesdays and
thirsty Thursdays and things like that
so if you come to my desk you'll see
like five or six bottles of like whiskey
and scotch and poured and things like
that so we're like the party office if
you're in security it's kind of like
mandatory that's yeah all right this is
a little bit about Montreal I'm not
gonna read the numbers but I guess in
general you know we get these questions
like you need to speak French to live in
Montreal can you get back with English
or sometimes the opposite can I get by
without English and it was you know
French I guess in that case yeah you
need to know one of the languages but
you'll be good either way I went without
knowing French and I still don't know
French I know enough to order beers
coffees asked for directions
and comment on the weather and things
like that so I'm totally fine
most people are actually bilingual I
guess half the people available the
University is just up the block like you
said it's a large university town we do
interact with the University of we've
started to in the last year we have
recently we've had people come and gave
talks about projects that they're
working on they're kind of interested in
technology and we've visited the campus
as well like performing like mock
interviews like helping people get ready
for their careers and things like that
this is interesting that everybody in
the in our office like uses public
transit to get to the office it's a very
public transit friendly friendly City
and like I said earlier it's very
affordable real estate and education
we're talking earlier is actually it's
cheap it's more affordable in Canada in
general and in Quebec
it's especially affordable for Quebec
residents there are people in Montreal
that are taking classes at the
University and it's they took off in the
middle of the day go for a class and
come back culture and sports you know
the the city is know is like the city of
festivals so there's tons of cool stuff
going on
throughout the year you'll constantly be
busy it's up to you like how much you
participate obviously in these kind of
things but but there's something for
everybody if you're a hockey fan
sometimes I forget that I'm talking to
kittens because you guys are hockey fans
you'll find it cool that we're like ten
minute walk away from the arena so you
can often just like go by and like pick
up some scalp tickets I you know a
little bit into the first period and
you're good to go see this is a big
thing there in Quebec there's a tax
holiday you can like read the chart
there but what is it for a 150k income
that per trip since more than 100k bonus
in total after like five years there's
certain criteria needed meat for this
you can look up the details online I
don't like know all the details for this
but people in our office have been
successful in getting this and this is
like a huge bonus and a huge incentive
for getting you back to Canada as
specifically in Quebec Quebec is all
about bringing people and the Quebec and
one of the other advantage of people
with families is day care I think day
care is like seven dollars a day
it's what somebody was saying right
seven bucks a day and I think this is it
all right so anybody have questions
t-shirt I actually have not found a
family doctor yet but I haven't been
looking for a family doctor either
appeared do you know the answer to that
the people in the office that I know
that don't have family doctors are
because our big summer boat like me they
haven't actually gone to look for one I
don't know anybody's complaining that
they haven't found one but it is true
that it's not and there's that these
like kind of drop-in centers all over
the place they're very accessible and
give me follow-up for that yeah yeah can
you talk about I have two questions can
you talk about Google's business
decision and dropping each talk to
explore from chrome and second is why is
the majority of chrome development
happens in Montreal
okay I'll answer the second question
first cuz I didn't quite hear the first
one but the second was was why does the
majority of chrome development happen in
Montreal no no the chrome developments
kind of scattered all over but I think
it's primarily in Mountain View and I
think there's people working in New York
much how is open source projects just
actually people working like
non-googlers working on it as well
throughout the world but yeah it's
dropping an engineer nor would I even
try to answer that question if I you the
answer good try jomi ask him ask about
Google China way up here do you anything
else so there's more shirts to be had I
have more of a general question to
Google yeah um I heard somewhere that a
Google is encouraging people to transfer
from team to team and every so often for
satellite offices here in in Canada how
does that work oh yeah that's a good
question it does work i twelve so my
transfer was from a different team here
to it different you know team here to a
different team in Montreal right so once
I got so much
I've been happy on that team but there's
been transfers I've seen like across
team so we just joint I just had
somebody joined my new team the Chrome
extension security thing from the chrome
team and you know he'd spent I think a
year and a half on that project and then
kind of that project was kind of coming
to a close and he was deciding he was
kind of figuring out if he want to stay
with chrome or not he kind of shopped
around and he was a very talented
engineer so circle groups wanted him and
you know we kind of tried to sell him on
our projects and at the end he decided
to come and join my project so it does
happen people do transcript at your your
for the most part you kind of like
limited to to the projects that are
there so if you're happy with one of the
projects there you can you kind of
follow the same guidelines that other
offices do which is you should I don't
think the stuff so kind of written down
but it's like generally you should spend
like you know a year and a half or
something on a project your and a half
to two before you should transfer but it
happens in small office as well and if
you're interested in a new project oh my
god you know the thing I came up with
it's like it's kind of related to a
focus area that we have already so you
can kind of show a value for the project
you can there are cases there's actually
two or three cases that are they're
going through right now where we're
creating new teams and shuffling people
around and hiring new people because of
people's initiative to say you know I
want I think this is a good value and
build a prototype and show to somebody
and have somebody say yeah that is a
good idea you know create a new team
hire new people and that just kind of
creates more diversity and more
opportunities for people that are there
but you will have you know there's just
way more teams and Mountainview to do
that thank you
I think my my question was kind of
stolen already but along the same lines
you'd mentioned earlier on that you
switched ladders when he first came in
and your your colleague had mentioned
that he came in thinking oh I'm the
search expert so that's what I'm gonna
be working on so is that like a typical
entry into Google is that you come in
with you know your own expectations as
to why you you're gonna provide value
and then Google decides you know we
watch over somewhere else I can't say
what the typical case is I can tell you
like my my experience and yeah I I was
kind of a generalist you know I wasn't
sure what I was interested in I did a
lot of system in administrator type work
and I set up labs and environments and
did like you know managed managed
environments and more like planning and
designing of large systems right and and
I've done a lot of programming too at
that point so it's like I kind of liked
it all and I wasn't really sure what I
wanted to do and I talked to a friend
inside of Google and he's like you know
these guys are cool and I think they
kind of you know they see maybe like a
jack-of-all-trades kind of group this
sre group so I applied through there and
and and you know I asked him I said you
know I'm not sure that this is what I
want to do I guess it'd be great to work
on Gmail or something for example and
he's like well you start here and like
you can it seems to be like a jackal
tracing you can see where you where you
fit in and that's what happened you know
I got in I started you know doing what
I'm supposed to do and then I kind of
had a natural fit I started doing more
of the engineering work and so kind of
started doing more like 20% work with
these other kind of teams that I felt
like more of a fit and and then I kind
of made my you know my decisions saying
you know I enjoy this work but I've been
doing this other work for like a year as
well and I that's what I want to try
next and I worked out and I'm not sure
if that is your questions I can't say if
that's the typical story I know that
happened with me kind of might might a
little bit different than Alex's I
didn't come in with like I am the search
guy or I am this guy's just like I don't
know what I am like kid Google tell me
what I am you know and that position
felt like a good fit and then after
after that I I kind of within the
company I found like where I fit after
that I didn't see the beginning but I
came to Google like kind of straight out
of university so I had work experience
through coops
was like I had you know co-opted into a
real job at the University but I didn't
I didn't work outside of out of the
University before I came to Google so
it's more of a blank slate so I wanted
to chime in too since it connects to
what I had said earlier um my my full
background before I came to Google was
the first company I did a CAD cam system
for embroidery which my Santi but a lot
a lot a lot of computational geometry
patents out of that first job then I
worked at Waterloo maple building
software for doing mathematics symbolic
algebra on computers then I worked at a
start-up where we built a real-time java
engine that could schedule Java
components that playback media in real
time where I wrote like a compiler
back-end and a thing that loaded the
resulting azzam into the real time
expansion on Solaris and then I worked
at the database startup so you know more
what I was saying about coming into
Google was I just assumed that one of
the reasons that I might join Google
given my background working on tech
search was to do tech search stuff but
it wasn't that I had a preconceived
notion that that was what I had to do it
is the case whatever office you go to
that they will look at your background
and try to match you with a high
priority project that matches your
background but that won't necessarily
match you with what you're expecting to
work on coming in but then as with my
colleagues experience here if you decide
that you're not working on what you
really want to work on it's so easy to
change what you're doing once you're
inside that my typical recommendation do
people are worried about this is get
started and see if you like it if you're
really unhappy with where you end up
it's very easy to transfer internally
and there's so many projects going on
internally that aren't launched that you
know it's very likely that you'll get
into the company find out about all the
things we're doing that you never
imagined Google was working on and think
oh I really want to work on that is that
ever cool and so you could pick
something that you currently don't even
know exists or somebody could pick that
for you and so lots of people come and
say well I'd like to pick what I work on
at Google before I get there and it's
like well I can't really tell you what
we're working on and you know all I can
do is put you on something that secret
that you don't know about that might be
the most exciting thing ever to you and
then when you get here if you don't like
it you can change if we didn't do that
then we would never be able to staff all
the
it's being done that that has not seen
the light of day yet so we do have to
have some flexibility and getting people
allocated to jobs I find like when I
interviewed at Google there was like a
bunch of this it's a secret project or
whatever and here's kind of the category
it's in but like can't you just sign an
NDA and tell me about what the position
is because that tends to be what I
experienced well I'll try to make that
recommendation internally this is
certainly a pain point for for
applicants but no the short answer is
right now no we can't if you're at
Google and you want to transfer
internally it's not like a full
interview process you have to go through
again or well actually if you're
switching like team so it's in the same
job ladder like if you're a software
engineer and you want to be a suffering
to another team it's not a formal
interview process we thought that I know
it's like it's you interview with the
team really in people it's more of like
a people fit kind of thing yeah I
actually switch teams and I and didn't
end up doing a formal interview as well
I kind of did this I'll come to your
meetings give me work that you give to
anybody else in your team and in my 20
percent time I will like show you that I
can I can do that and at the end of like
yeah this guy although he didn't go
through this we interview process he's a
software engineer to us so I reflect and
there's not although there's even in my
process it was still like nothing really
written down it was a case-by-case kind
of basis so if you take initiative you
can kind of make anything happen staying
a team for a certain period of time
before you can switch why do you have to
you I'm not sure that you have to you is
just kind of like I don't know maybe
Alex can speak to more about like the
timing you spent on team he is a manager
after all an engineering manager sorry
so normally when when I'm
talking to people about potential
transfers I'm always trying to match
their desire to transfer with where they
are in their career path so as typically
as you work on the same team you know
quarter-over-quarter your performance
goes up and up and up as you accumulate
more knowledge and more skills on the
team that you're on and that ultimately
you know culminates in a promotion so if
you're three months away from a likely
promotion it's probably not a good time
to transfer geographies and be on a
whole new team learning you know whole
new systems and starting again whereas
if you wait you know four months get the
promotion and then transfer then you can
match up your learning curve with being
at the bottom of your new level as well
so that the year year-and-a-half
guideline helped to make sure that you
achieve worthy career goals in your
current project before you transfer now
there's no fixed rule I've had engineers
start for me in November of one year and
transfer to a new team in January of the
following year so less than three months
later be doing something completely
different and that's fine you know it's
all up to the manager and the individual
person situation to bend the rules as my
colleague said you know if you take
initiative you can make anything happen
but at the same time as as a manager
who's looking to optimize everybody's
career progress and make sure they
achieve as much as possible at Google on
make sure that they make their decisions
with our eyes open and don't set
themselves up for for starting again you
know on a whole new project when they're
went on the verge of a career event on
their current project so for me that's
more what the guidelines are about three
questions I'm guessing you're over they
do the same thing is it is it okay to
transfer between campuses as well or
like there's a policy you can transfer
between campuses I did exactly that I
did a chance a geolocation transfer I
was in this office and I transferred to
the Montreal office so its first about
transferring teams I transferred to that
team which happened to have like a
component here so it was like the split
between Mountain View and Montreal and
then I transferred locations and the
location thing from my experience at
least it was just like checking boxes
and stuff because the team existed here
and there so it was like a paperwork
kind of thing there was no real in
you process or anything like that sorry
well it's not like you pick your team
you kind of have to you know in my
experience again I shopped around I
looked at the teams that were in once
you're all like I you know I want to go
to Montreal what teams are there what
team looks interested in me and I proved
myself to that team you know I kind of
although it wasn't a formal interview
process I had to show them that there's
a reasons they would want me and once
you know I convinced them of that the
rest of it was pretty straightforward so
I'd imagined that like other scenarios
are gonna be similar I'm not sure I mean
Alex you have comments on that
I think time's running out so there's
like two people who have questions I saw
so you go first all right so my specific
case my team the answer member team is
split between Mountain View and Montreal
and we're like a three-hour time
difference right so we we do video
conference with them as needed we have
like a weekly meeting which is a video
conference and it's nice you know it's
like the big night screens it's very
it's not like the old old video converse
days right and we actually have like
video conferencing at the desktop as
well so you know Gmail trap video kind
of stuff we can do all that and we do
communicate as necessary you know and
actually our team communicates a lot and
on top of that I make like a trip to
Mountain View actually most people on
our team do like once a quarter so once
every four months I come down and like
do like you know interact with them and
like go out and kind of it's still nice
to have that like face-to-face time with
the people so we do communicate a lot
with the people in Mountain View and
they come up to from time to time as
well
right I worked here so this is a funny
story so our team right now is in
Crittenden which is like on the other
side of this campus so we have meetings
with other Googlers in Mountain View on
this side of campus and we will not come
to this side of campus well instead
we'll have the videoconference with them
so so the guys here like we were joking
about I'd say that we're here seeing our
team it's great then we're like
interacting with other Googlers by
videoconference and they're like they're
in the room down here yeah and that
happens a lot it's like a time saver
right so you you can get behind a lot
with like modern technology video
conferencing is talking so I don't feel
like I'm missing out at least on our
team we're like very very involved and
we make an effort to kind of like reach
out and we try to we try to like take
ownership of things right so in Canada
we try to take ownership of specific
components so that we can work together
and and then kind of communicate back
with the people in Mountain View and
when we need to like its phone calls and
video conferencing it's all very
interactive there's this guy I promised
and then how about that guy sorry
yeah Island have lots of ideas for ideas
that don't meet the sort of goals of
being big enough for Google and so on in
my experience one of one of three things
happens those ideas either never get
started because they don't look like
they're gonna be big enough or they do
get started by people putting their 20%
time into them even though they'll never
be the big projects that that they could
be or that you know that we aspire to
have or you figure out a way to convince
people that although your idea is not
you know 100 million person or a billion
dollar idea today that it is the kernel
of something that will lead to that kind
of big impact down the road so we're
willing to invest in things that are
gonna take you know three four or five
ten years to actually come to fruition
if we know that there's a path by which
it can become huge and so then there's
I've seen us do that with products and
it takes a long time to see those things
actually snowball but it but if it's an
idea that like literally will never meet
the bar then the only way it can really
get done is in people's 20% time and I
mean my inclination as a Google manager
would be normally to say why don't we
look for a way to generalize your ideas
that it is more applicable sets that it
is sort of you know big enough to gather
people's attention so definitely I mean
I I actually think this is a challenge
for us internally people can get
frustrated trying to think of ideas that
have the right level of impact to
actually get that buy-in right you can
still do them in your attorney sometime
but it's a high bar you said it like
billion dollar idea and I think you kind
of said that your questions like I've
heard time and time again that's like
build a product that people use and
we'll figure out the rest kind of later
right so I try to say oh yeah 100
million users like it's not just
necessarily about dollars it's about
it's about usage as well so you could do
an idea that you had no idea how it was
ever going to make money but if you were
sure that you know everybody in North
America was gonna use it that would be
big enough regardless of the revenue
model the revenue would follow from
having that kind of usage in some way
there's one more question and
we'll go to nice the size of and we'll
be around after so you can ask this
questions after to just grace about the
size of their groups and like for each
managers are bigger teams or how does
that vary across the company I can speak
about much girl again in general like
the size of a team just kind of grows
organically right like at least the
teams in Montreal we started with one
person on the anti-malware team in
Montreal the work the work and scope got
larger so you ask for more those two
people couldn't you know created more
projects and more ideas and now we're
like a five on that sub team growing
another smaller team of like two or
three people so in our case and watch
all this the size of the team couldn't
grow organically you can ask me or Alex
probably about that like after</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
