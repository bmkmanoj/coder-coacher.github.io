pleasure now to listen to so Joshua
Williams and Rasmus for Microsoft are
going to talk about something
interesting one score for quality so
that sounds exactly what we want to be
here now it's a to you alright thanks so
welcome back from lunch everybody we'll
do our best to keep things active and
keep you awake my name is ross smith and
i'm here with joshua from microsoft and
we're going to talk to some today about
some work that we've done to use games
and build on the on the sort of
crowdsourcing ideas that drone talked
about earlier this morning to help with
the language translation and we'll get
into some details there but really this
work for us goes back four or five years
and we've really kind of noticed a trend
in really in the population as a whole
but if you look at the way that Gen X
Gen Y Millennials whatever you'd like to
call them the way they learn the way
they behave in you know social
networking tools instant messaging
real-time communications it's way
different than than it used to be and so
people have if you come out of school
with a degree in database design you
probably don't have your first job in
database design doing the things that
you learn in school or that you're
passionate about you may find a part or
a portion of that but you'd have more to
give more ideas you know and more things
that you want to contribute and when we
look at how this incoming workforce
impacts the industry and impacts testing
is specifically there's some huge
generational changes come in and the
chart here talks its I know it's a
little hard to read but they it's the
age of the income incoming population
and and this the the right-hand side our
left hand side there is underdeveloped
countries and developed countries on the
right but you can see that there's a
large workforce that's coming as people
grow older and enter the workforce that
that wide band at the bottom is going to
move upwards and and
again if we look at the facebook and how
we communicate in the real time
expectations there is a lot of changes
that are coming and from that you know
we did some work on our team to kind of
understand how people felt in their jobs
and how they did they have those
opportunities to contribute google has a
program twenty percent time that I think
kind of goes after the same sort of
spirit and so using Mary Beth as a proxy
here for the for the typical employee
they feel underutilized hey there's more
projects I want to learn there's more
things I want to try there's more i can
give i have this interest that I work on
at home those types of things and and
could we capture some of that and bring
it into the into the test activity so as
we started to explore this you know it
really wasn't just Mary Beth this is
Gallup does a lot of surveys on employee
engagement and shows that up to seventy
percent of employees or at least
somewhat disengaged and and they asked
questions about you know how comfortable
they are how much they trust their work
environment do they like their manager
do they have a friend at work things
like that and the employee engagement
the green is the up top there is the
actively engaged and the rest are at
least somewhat disengaged so you can see
even a crawl around the world that this
is a this is a concern at least as as a
result of the Gallup research so we
started this initiative we called 42
projects which was really to attempt to
innovate in the way we manage to go
after this under utilization and part of
that a big part of that was building
trust in the organization and and
trusting sort of the individual tester
to know the best technique the best
methodology the best way to assure
quality in their component and then from
that trust building exercise people
start to innovate if they trust that hey
I can go learn this new technique i can
go experiment i want to go learn about
fault injection i can go do that they
come up with innovative ways to address
the quality concerns of their component
so building on some of the work then
from that we we kind of got into this
games as work or what we call
productivity game
and and the use of collaborative play to
build trust in the in the team and in
the environment as well as start to go
after the crowdsourcing activity and so
we've done this we did this for Windows
Vista and then threw out the windows 7
project in a variety of areas like code
inspection a lot of dog food and your
self hosting sort of crowdsourcing
getting a variety of people to try
different try different ways of
exercising our components to flush out
some of those defects OOP there we go so
many of you might have seen Josh's call
on the wave for the best bug story so we
wanted to do just a little contest and
hopefully keep things a little lively
and we have a couple small prizes here
so would so anyways would would you go
Simon you want to come up and tell us
your story first as a starter and we'll
we'll go from there and try it try and
keep these two about a minute so that we
can get through a few i'm sure there's
some good ones ok so my story's a bit of
a weird one i was working on a project
and i noticed that the build worked on
my machine in london and it works with
my colleagues machine who was working in
sydney but it failed with another
colleagues machine who was in mountain
view I was like the same code the same
CL nothing different everything the same
I was like what's going on so we dug in
eventually we found out that somebody
wanted to write a test to verify that at
some future date something didn't happen
so if you sort of tried to schedule
something for a future date it would
wait and wouldn't appear in the UI so
they decided to create a date object in
Java from Long max value which is great
so it's a maximum value but the
date-time library that we were using at
the time amended it four time zones so
in Sydney
subtract however many 12 hours brought
10 hours from from max long and it would
be okay in London it would leave it on
modified but when you ran the test in
mountain view because the local clock on
the machine was in Mountain View time it
tried to add to the maximum long value
which caused an overflow and the test to
fail took us ages to figure that one it
great alright so the next stage of the
contest is can someone beat that story
someone got a better story of a bug okay
we got one right here the front right my
one was I was asked to do performance
testing for a government related project
in the UK that had 20,000 machines
spaced out in different locations is
still confidential as I can't leave you
too many details but that's to perform
assessing forbidden from doing pom
Sasebo chief architect they wouldn't
give me an environment they wrote their
own ftp program they're running on Linux
but some reason they're out there on ftp
program and i ended up testing it by
hand by accident i mistyped things and
got some strange behaviors so Cuddy mom
so in short i wrote a Perl program about
10 miles long that proved I could send
an object files up to the system the
chief architect said well that's
something test he doesn't happen in
production I was given permission after
doing in a test environment doing the QA
environment he then wrote this very long
email saying that the production system
is very well defended its it possible to
do this while he wrote that email
unfortunately gave me access to
production I ran the test I sent the
results I was able to hack into
production I was able to control all
20,000 genes changer software they
didn't renew my contract all right that
was great Thank You Julian preciate ya
okay all right anybody else want to try
to beat that we have okay here we got
one out of here thank you I'd I just
really like how this one worked out we
were doing long run reliability testing
on release device only one particular
device we had this occasional problem
out of every you know hundred some our
test
we'd get this USB disk connection every
once in a while and we do pretty much
just key injection and screen scraping
on the device it's not very complicated
but we'd get this USB disconnection and
we'd have to wait 20 30 hours every time
to see it we could not figure out what
it was we figured out okay it happens
when there's a phone call coming in that
happens several hundred times during the
test not too unusual but sometimes it
causes a USB disconnection we kept
looking into that you figured out okay
it's when we take take the screenshot
and try to transfer it over just after
we've received the phone call so we have
some USB transfer in the phone call
going on we think there's some kind of
collaboration their hardware people have
no interest in looking at at that point
they want us to make absolutely sure
it's a hardware bug in a release device
as you can understand what we ended up
doing is through lots of trial and error
we put together a zip file about 300
megs connected the USB mass storage mode
copied the file over called the device
it crashed the transfer and that was we
sent that zip file over to hardware they
figured out there was a potential
interference between the USB chip and
the radio on the device could be solved
with a little bit of gold foil i guess i
had i got to let go of the bug at that
point but it was fun for a release
device that our major carrier was really
waiting on validation for us great great
story thank you all right should we do a
shrewd a vote on the phone shirt when
more than one more oh yeah one more okay
this is the last one then we're going to
do a quick quick vote yeah okay we have
a system can see much movies know
exactly into food production yet we have
master controller on machines that does
the lemon tree collection data
collection and we have a modem that
sense that data on words and that modern
talks to the master controller over a
serial port now we had to build a modem
usual with of doing the hardware as well
and we had
one functioning prototype hardware which
was done by another company and the
master controller and we were talking we
reverse-engineer the whole software when
started sending data down the serial
port and we figured out that the initial
prototype had the serial port at about
32 k with no parity bits and everything
and it was talking fine so the chip that
we have can grow up to 192 so we just
pushed the clock upwards and nothing
worked we just go garbled stuff like why
is that why is that why is that not for
after three or four days of phone calls
would faced the guy who actually written
software and he actually told us that he
had 10 millisecond pause after every
bite unfortunately that 10 millisecond
for they still there we can't go full
speed but good story outstanding okay so
let's take a quick vote I just want
everyone to kind of clap dissipate and
involve here let's go through the
different stories let's start with
Simon's story at max long plus a date
for mountain view all right Julian not
being invited back to ever work for the
UK government again ok I won out over
very good okay sorry I don't know your
name Alec okay Alex Alex story all right
bad hardware device okay and last what's
your name my scene ok my seams story
about surreal report with a 10
millisecond time out all right sound
like a cutter winner was Julian actually
Julian thank you get a your prizes they
want a real copy of our book yeah so I
got to say go ahead who's second I you
know Simon was a plant so okay so the
two guys got it so um we did this
contest one time
we did it I was speaking at a university
and we had I think three three books to
give out and one of the one of the
fourth person who won realized what it
was it's like oh if I'd known it that it
was that I'm I wouldn't have played and
said that so the threat then the next
time I go is I'm going to give one to
everyone who doesn't win all right so I
guess the question the question really
is is what was our objective with this
little contest right in a sense we just
played a little game it was a silly game
but everyone here has had experiences
like those that we heard so it's
something that everyone is familiar with
but what happened right we got hopefully
got people engaged we got people
clapping we got people to wake up from
their post lunch coma ideally right so
at least that was the goal did it work
ok so what our talk really is about is
this idea that you can use games to get
things done now why is it that games are
particularly powerful and useful well as
Ross mentioned we have a new generation
coming in generation really who has
played games and entire lives now it's
not just Jen why Millennials who play
games casual games have taken off in the
entire at all age brackets right so but
games is a pastime games as a way to
engage people have become a very
powerful medium okay some of these
statistics on this slide actually are
specific to the American or US market
I'm sure the trend is worldwide in May
of these cases right and as Reeves and
read talked about in their book total
engagement which is again a gap about
how do you engage employees they
actually assert that games in the
workplace will become more and more
inevitable they have taken over so many
other parts from our lives whether it's
sales competitions for driving work or
you know casual games trend that it
eventually will become more common even
in the workplace all right so what are
some of the benefits we hope to get from
games well ideally you get you get
employees engaged you get them doing new
things you get them maybe a higher
energy level because they're having fun
at work than they would have otherwise
had but most importantly is the ability
to more clearly communicate more
effectively communicate the objectives
of your corporation we order
right how many of us have seen the
executive memo that comes and says
please do X and what happens when you
get that memo every week please you know
dog food the latest product please do
this all right well the value of those
memos drops over time they just become
less and less effective so a game can be
a great way to communicate to the
employees what the objectives of the
organization are whether that's
dogfooding or self-hosting your own
product whether it's running some tools
specifically on your system a game can
help get people engaged right and by
increasing engagement you can save money
improve productivity etc right now last
but not least of course is this idea of
education and learning educational games
or games that motivate people to learn
are very common in in the world today
everyone everyone used to a lot of our
kids have those games I play on the
computer that teach mathematics whatever
basics but education in games education
is a pretty well drawn out field all
right so what are some of the things
about productivity games they make them
effective well it's not dissimilar from
the types of games people play whether
it's on their xbox or whether it's on
the internet right you want to get a
type of a game that's motivating to that
type of person and different types of
games appeal to different types of
people right there's the halo player who
likes to play through the levels on
their own but there's also the halo
player who really would rather be
playing in groups having battles against
other live people okay and those types
of play are different and will and what
draws those people into games is
different you know even different from
the halo players the solitaire player
someone who actually wants to do
something on their own okay in the end
gamers really want the same thing that
employees want they want the game dizi
transparent straightforward employees
want to be able to understand what the
point is of their job how they're being
judged related accordingly and unable to
be unable to succeed in it okay the
other important thing about games it's
which is actually the same concept
behind why crowdsourcing is important is
that you can scale out quickly and
easily a crowdsourcing or a games effort
in a way that you can't easily
crowdsource out other automation or
other types of tools okay especially for
activities which require some sort of
human human
action or human review okay things like
a mechanical turk right so what we're
really talking about here is a type of a
crowdsourcing effort but instead of
motivating with financial rewards we're
motivating with a game something that's
a little bit whimsical a little bit
silly a little bit fun okay and so let's
talk about where games work and where
games don't work really quickly I have I
have a little matrix sure to work with
okay along the top you see the types of
skills people have that they use or
don't use in their job so let's start
with core work skills the core work
skills are skills that everyone has
which makes then able to you know have
that job at all the ability to type on a
computer the ability to take apart and
reassemble a computer a basic
understanding of computers would be
techniques or skills core skills we
would all have okay there's unique work
skills which are the skills why my
employer pays me to work there I have
years of experience in testing I'm you
know proficient in n number of languages
and I specialize in design of these
types of these types of projects okay
and future work skills are the types of
skills which i have yet to learn which
would make me a warm more valuable
employee whether that's continued
education or whether it's just a new
particular technology or language I need
to learn that was me that different rate
of skills on that top axis along the
left you would actually see two
different types of behaviors one is in
job or they really the behaviors that
are your job what you do at work every
day and the lower one organizational
citizenship behaviors those are
activities you would participate in or
that we hope employees would have
participate in to make the workplace a
better place for example the person who
fills the coffee machine or you know
fixes it if it's broken right that's
something that's not necessarily part of
someone's a job but by them doing that
it makes the work place a better place
to be all right so let's go through a
couple of thought experiments of where
games don't work as well all right now
if you if you look at games in the
unique skill set right you really are
very closely well back you if you look
at game sneak skill set what you're
doing is you're excluding people who
don't have that exact same work the
exact same skill set okay and in a
crowdsourcing effort or in a type of
like productivity game we're talking
about
your real objective is to get as many
players as possible you really want as
many eyes working on the project as
possible okay or we like to say get as
many players onto the field as possible
you want that type of participation and
by going with a game that is based on a
skill that is unique to a small set of
people you have a harder time leveraging
a broad crowd okay now the next space
where games are difficult is games that
map specifically to someone's job and
this is a relatively simple thought
experiment if there was a game which was
do Josh's job and at the end of a
four-week period Josh wasn't in first
place that would be a very uncomfortable
conversation with my manager come review
time okay so we call this the do your
job syndrome and we did this place where
having games is very difficult to be
successful at because in the end
someone's going to be hurt now a classic
example this might be the netflix
challenge right your many of you are
familiar i'm sure with the netflix
challenge we're netflix challenge we
will come up with a better algorithm to
find suggested movies well there was an
employee at Netflix some point whose job
it was is to own that algorithm so now
Netflix is the corporation has decided
to hire that out and take something
better and pay them a million dollars I
bet you that guy wasn't getting a
million dollars so how do you feel how
did that help him feel more engaged or
less engaged there's consequences to
those types of those types of games so
let's jump to where games work well okay
as I mentioned a moment ago educational
games games are about learning new
skills or a new things is a pretty
well-established field I think I think
that most everyone's familiar with those
types of games the types of game is that
we have found to be the most successful
in our years of doing this really our
games that map to behaviors that we want
people to participate in on a voluntary
basis that make the work environment a
better place or they accomplish a task
which is beneficial to the organization
but that enables as many people that
participate as possible okay you want to
rely on core skill sets but you also
want to make it available to as many
people as possible that makes the
organization better all right
so let's take a problem that were many
many viewer partner with enough
localization testing locals it
localization testing is a problem that
has no bounds of challenges in terms of
scale in terms of just difficulty some
languages that you have to localize for
there are just very few vendors to
provide those services etc okay windows
seven ships in 100 over 100 languages
worldwide and there are in a single
version of Windows thousands of strings
thousands of screens that need to be
reviewed tested etc by different people
and you know with with with the work of
a couple people on different teams we
came up with some brainstorming ideas
and put together a game to help us solve
this challenge and we call it the
language quality game and now we're very
original in our naming okay but again
the idea being is that with a game we
can hopefully access a broad crowd of
people across the internal employees at
Microsoft to help us improve the quality
of localization in windows and let me
explain quickly how this works in a
little Silverlight app you load your
browser and you're actually given a
dialog in the language you choose and
you can highlight it as you see I've
highlighted this example and then when
it's highlighted you drag that entire
screen either to the something's wrong
bucket or if there are no problem still
looks good looks good bucket okay you
have the option to add comments if
necessary and so forth all right now for
every screen that is reviewed by a
player they aren't a point and in the
lower left here you'll see there's
actually a small leaderboard for people
who have the top number of points earned
in the game okay so we're using the
study of a leaderboard to show who's in
the lead who's doing the best as a
motivational technique to make people
feel like it's a game all right now we
launched this game and we launched this
game we had some outstanding results in
the period of four weeks launched only
two internal Microsoft employees we had
over 500,000 screens looked at and
reviewed by employees all right Fred an
among Microsoft employees which spanned
the world we had over 4,500 unique
players actually play the game
each averaging almost 120 screens so we
were able to actually get over 500,000
screens reviewed for free by Microsoft
employees now each individual screen was
reviewed multiple times by different
people and the reviewer on the backend
could look at those screens kind of
malade on top of each other
transparently and see that if the same
place had been highlighted by multiple
users yes that was a valid bug and if
only one out of several did it maybe it
wasn't as high priority of a bug but
still we're able to get a huge amount of
quality improvement in the windows 7
product in a very short period of time
based on a crowdsourcing effort but be
wrapped it in something whimsical funny
because there were points and there was
a leaderboard associated with it now
what's interesting notices there really
were no rewards for this game the
players that got on the leaderboard if
you give you a past certain levels like
you passed a hundred points you got one
gold star next to your name if you
passed a thousand points you got three
gold stars that literally was the entire
reward system for this game but as a
result we were able to engage the
subsidiaries around the world in a new
way and debate it easier for them to
provide quick and easy feedback about
the quality of the localization for
their product for the windows 7 product
in their language that they were already
passionate about and excited about all
right so what are some of the keys if
you're going to design a game yourself
and i encourage you trying it out
because it turns out they are a great
way to engage people and get them
excited first of all you got to have a
clear objective just like I said players
and employees both want the objective to
be clear transparent achievable right
and part of that is having a clear
objective for the game and then setting
those rules and guidelines out so
they're straightforward use rewards
carefully like I said with the language
quality game we were able to accomplish
a lot with a very little reward now
these poor guys weathered up with books
they didn't realize their award was
going to be a book but they still had
fun trying to tell their story because
these are stories were passionate about
their things people are still willing to
do all right as I mentioned earlier
there are different types of games
different types of mechanisms to appeal
to different types of players different
games that are interesting to them so
experiment try games out
try things out that appeal to different
types of competitive nature now
Microsoft is full of people who are
highly competitive so having
leaderboards generally works pretty well
but that may not work in every
organization in every place again as I
mentioned before organizational
citizenship behaviors are a great way to
get get work out of people because it's
something that's better for the
organization overall but that is
voluntary and it doesn't step on
anyone's toes for their job you don't
end up losing any egos in that respect
and you're able to get some great
effective valuable work done for your
company and finally I'll just mention
this idea of support we had this
experience where we launched a game and
the game was that if you completed a set
of tasks dog food run stress etc that
you earned letters and the letters
spelled the word beta and or beta one
actually and there's number one at the
end and the you know we launched the
game and there was this huge uptick
people all started doing these
activities because they wanted to earn
their four letters and down the
leaderboard and we actually got a call
from our vice president the next day and
he's like I keep hitting refresh where's
my e where's my II mean they you think
he would have more to do but he was just
excited and anxious about the game and
he wanted to be participating he wanted
to get his results on the board for
having done that particular task and
participate so the idea of support
really is you need to have people able
to answer those calls and help when
those types of games are going on we
call that real kind of game master you
can call it whatever you want but just
the ability to take those questions and
kind of flush out problems as they
happen ends up being an important way to
keep people engaged all right so so we
kind of finish up here but but really
what we've seen is tremendous so you
know Marybeth then actually is as a
proxy but these words actually did come
come out of her mouth that it doesn't
feel like work anymore we've done you
know we've kept the duration short but
we've and we've varied things the types
of games you know some very simple some
a little more complex we've had puzzle
games we've had leaderboards
and and for people on the team and
around the organization it doesn't feel
like work anymore and so they they now
have opportunities to you know to apply
that that that database design interest
or different ways to engage in a variety
of activities learn new skills develop
develop themselves and and at the same
time sort of help with the
organizational citizenship that the
altruistic behavior of sort of everyone
collaborating to make things better and
it has really been just amazing to watch
all kind of wrapped in in the context of
gaming which again appeals to sort of
this incoming generation and more and
more so through the casual games to
everybody so I think with that any
questions
hey since since the whole thing is a
game and since you have a reward system
do you ever find that people try and
game the system other words no maybe
dragging things that everything to be
it's okay or putting random words as
bugs where they really are yeah so uh
cheating in games I maybe you're
familiar with the classic Dilbert where
where the pointy hair manager says we're
going to reward people for ten dollars
per me bug they find and fix and while
it goes whoa I'm rich right um yes there
there is a risk of people rap engaging
in the wrong behavior if the rewards are
too great right but again that's why I
mentioned earlier we use rewards
carefully if the reward is small enough
that it won't modify their behavior
significantly then generally they won't
have a motivation to cheat right now the
reward is too great you need to build
mechanisms into your game that create a
balance or a trade-off so that you can
motivate them to do the right thing and
sometimes that has to take place right
but the more important challenge really
is you can usually flag out cheaters
it's usually obvious because they're way
ahead but you know how do you face the
scenario where you know one guy is
clearly in the lead and everybody else
gives up and doesn't want to play
anymore right there's another challenge
that you face which is clever game
design clever design how you're going to
give out prizes if you have prices right
sometimes it goes back to how what type
of mechanism you use to appeal to that
type of gamer and if they're competing
against everyone else that's one type of
mechanism if they're competing against
their own personal best score from the
day before the week before that changes
their behavior that lets it be more
against themselves and they don't have
to worry as much about the leader so
again part of that is game design part
of that is just being clever and how you
build your reward structure and one
thing I'll add there especially when
you're first starting to do this keep
the duration of the games very short
because you'll learn a lot about whether
it's about specific techniques that
people are really good at you if people
are trying to game the system you'll be
able to see that early and you know do
things in short bursts so you can learn
a knitter
made through to come up with the
appropriate game design that that really
just as josh said gets players on the
field because the more people playing
the more work that's getting done so
it's important to learn and evolve your
strategy as you go yeah yeah 2 comments
and a question the first comment is in
browser testing land there's a site
called test swarm created by a creditor
of jquery and it's the same thing
they've got a leaderboard got points and
that's that is live now have two data
points i can see that having
leaderboards and making a little bit of
a game you know there's interrupt but
there's another one actually i can't
remember the name of it but it's a site
where people go and post their problems
and people can comment on it and then
the comments that people provide or
rated and people gained a reputation
that's like a leaderboard as well yeah i
think i should overflow that's the right
so but people again gain reputation it
sounds like it's not dissimilar right
you gain a reputation by having the most
points this one is more of a great
environment like you're contributing
resources anyway so it's comments now
it's cool to see the gaming part of it
the other one was a windows 7 it's
actually pleasant to use i like it i'm
looking forward to use it so good job oh
and in case anyone hasn't heard windows
7 launched today and I'm not in a
Microsoft apologist so I i will i will
give an drops from windows 7 is the
localization localized versions are of
high quality because of the game yeah so
now with that again i had 2 comments and
one question did you do this process
with windows vista no now the language
quality game was actually specific to
windows sentence first time had been
done now the game didn't replace any
existing quality assurance techniques
that the international team already used
right this was augmenting top and still
reported a large number bugs that were
easily fixed because they were
highlighted very clear for the for the
vendor to actually repair that that
string so it was actually a very
valuable tool but i guess it you know
some lot of the gaming because we have
been until recently in the windows
organization for a long time and so yeah
some of the gaming early gaming
techniques we did we did do through this
so one question I wondered just many
when you introduce a scoring mechanism
into game does that affect the quality
of the results I mean one people care
for the points of how many dialogues
they reviewed instead of making sure
that each one has good quality yeah so
there there's a you can treat this like
a currency valuation problem right I
mean depending on what type of actions
you want performed in the game right so
for example we did a game where we
wanted people to sell post and then file
bugs they found during cell phone so two
separate actions and in the initial
iteration of the game we were awarded
those a certain value when was 100
points one was 50 points or something
like that I remember and what we found
is that people were frustrated because
they could very easily not install the
new build and just keep filing bugs and
able to win more points right because
the cost of doing one action or the
other was so significantly different so
it goes really to how do you value the
points now in the language quality game
one point per screen it just equalized
everything for everybody so it worked
right but again it goes back to the
reward structure the word structure in
language quality game was you get your
name on a leaderboard and there were
leaderboards on a per language basis so
within you know German are within
Chinese there was a leaderboard just for
that there was also an all-up
leaderboard for the whole world and then
people can try to compete that way but
also subsidiaries were given the
opportunity to compete against other
subsidiaries by having a per language
leaderboard so Japanese you know screams
reviewed vs. Korean screens reviewed was
another little competition going on
which encourage debate team base to play
so I don't know answer your question it
does it just real quickly you you are
introducing a secondary incentive system
right you've got your paycheck and
you've got the points and so you do have
to be the same maybe not quite the same
but significant effort in designing the
right reward system and the right
scoring system is important because if
you get it wrong you discourage people
from playing multi-mode at that point I
to fall upon its question which I may
have a little following for is
yes going one point per screen so
someone could look at a screen go oh
this is a misplaced piece of grammar
here pull it over to the no category but
have missed a whole bunch of other bugs
that are on that screen they still
getting a point where as a guy who's
gone in spent five minutes looking at
everything finding every bug that's
there and then pulls it over gets the
same point did you find anything so we
did actually provide a mechanism back to
users to give them some feedback on
their performance right so what would
happen is they could see the number of
screens they'd reviewed they could also
see the number of bugs that had come
from their total efforts they reviewed
100 screens six of those that they filed
as bugs became real bugs right but there
was also a column for screens you marked
as not having a problem but did have a
problem right but did become bugs and so
but that was the mechanism we use to
kind of inform people hey you're being a
little too careless please be more
careful etc and we have to say that by
providing the statistic and letting them
see it we then they then could learn
that on their own yeah on one comment
and a couple of questions I think people
here would be very interested very
interested in Louisville arnes work look
up GW AP do a Google search or being
searched for GW AP yeah putting the wave
yeah it's a lot of fun what he did and
he's got an excellent video presentation
which is a lot of fun so just if he also
worked on the Google Image label a great
crowd sourcing and he talks about that
and he specifically addresses the issue
of gaming the system so my question to
you is two questions has anyone to your
knowledge considered commercializing
this sort of thing and on the other side
has anyone developed some sort of open
source platform to allow other players
like Google to get into this sort of
space uh well I think about idea of
commercializing it we definitely have
considered taking this language quality
game external there are a lot more
challenges we're going to take it
external of the world and the idea would
be is we wouldn't just ask people in the
world review our own screens would
provided as a service to others
yes we've considered that we we don't
know where it will or won't go it's just
an idea that we had floating around as
far as open source code for it most of
the games we do really are very simple
it's a simple database and a simple
leaderboard on the front end the civil I
tap again primarily is a little
structure that lets you throw up a JPEG
or a PNG file and then drag the object
back and forth to it to a couple of
placeholders none of the code is
particularly complex are specialized in
that respect right i think the mechanism
or what we're trying to talk about today
is really the idea that you can use
games to motivate people and that that
motivation can also help raise the level
of engagement and excitement amongst
employees in the corporation I mean the
42 projects effort is only you in one
part is about games and play right but
it really is about how do we manage
differently how do we engage our
employees differently to make a happier
more productive workforce yeah I have a
trigger patient all the games you have
mentioned our sort of TBE games did a
sample of pvp game but can be used for
productivity we actually had one we had
one game I'll talk about really quickly
this it was actually called the code
review game there was a there was a
group of testers on a team who was
really getting into doing formal code
inspections and so they actually create
a little game of their own with a where
each of them built a small team of three
or four engineers and they each were
assigned a two or three hundred line
segments of code they're all given the
same checklist for the types of defects
to look for and they went through and
all reviewed the code and what happens
was is that each team then based on
their yield was scored accordingly so it
became a team-based challenge
challenging people against each other
but make sense but it was team-based so
that then should question out of that
way you look pvp play over there's a
player yes I think that's what the
leaderboard largely is is to compete
against other people who are visually
yeah we're trying to we're trying to
capture the attention of people who are
motivated by pvp games either and nurse
there's a couple really interesting
things we've seen with the leaderboard
is that that the you know
glory and shame of the leaderboard both
are very motivating right so
particularly when we try and attract
what we call self host or dog food
efforts to go I install a bill to go try
these activities rewarding that bye-bye
points on the leaderboard or letters or
something like that really gets peer
pressure on those who don't show up so
if a whole team is on there but the
manager is not the managers very
motivated to get as a manager I can say
that it's very motivated to perform the
activity and get on the get on the
leaderboard so so we're trying to appeal
to that pvp it's it's a it's an
interesting area because we are trying
to build collaboration and trust across
the team and so we don't have sort of
the head-to-head get like a good code
curls review of them I'm source of you
review of code yeah that yes oh yeah so
they're also talking me for you yeah
thank you seems to me that the game it's
a good way to encourage the hitters to
do man your test but is it also helped
for for the users to do the automation
test well so again a the objective
behind every game is to have a clear
objective for what task you want
accomplished and if the best way to
accomplish a task is through manual
testing then certainly you can use that
to encourage testers to try unusual
things right maybe you provide a point
value for trying some scenarios which
are rare or less commonly used versus a
point value of a single point for a
common action that everyone takes
there's a number of ways you could build
a game around that and I don't pretend
to have every possible or be able to
imagine every possible scenario right
but yes you can use a point system to
encourage any type of behavior or a game
because it's a different way people
engage but it's a different way to kind
of motivate people get them excited to
try something to be different than they
would otherwise
alright there's not one more Mario it's
the quick one how important is to have
an expert for setting up the game I mean
I a vibration that it's fairly easy to
screw it up to get something wrong you
know if I do that how many chances have
to get it right and how many chances
that you need to get someone hurt that
there is a lot and that's why we felt
very strongly keeping the games the
duration of the game short run it for a
day a couple days and learn and iterate
because each organization and the
cultures are going to be different and
it does it does you know this game went
out pretty fairly broadly and we had
thousands of players which we didn't
expect but it's been the you know maybe
the ten fifteenth one we've done had we
used some of the techniques in the first
game in this game it would have been a
disaster right we learned a lot in some
of those early games on how to make sure
we were we were going far enough but not
too far in terms of where games work and
what behaviors we were trying to drive
and we're a solid objective would make
sense but but I'll also also add that
yes there are times that games are going
to flop right you're encouraging the
wrong behavior or you happen to pick the
behavior that is one guy's job and he
wins by a landslide and everyone's
demotivated but that that happens that's
not necessarily a bad thing it's a good
learning experience right how do I learn
what to avoid in the future and by
having short duration games you can wait
a few weeks and try something totally
different and it turns out again we have
this young generation of incoming you
know employees of incoming students or
whatever it is that have games their
entire lives and had Nintendo since they
were born right I didn't grow up that
way I had to go find the Nintendo so but
you know nowadays everyone has
everyone's had one that so the
generational thing does have an impact
nimal question
well thanks a lot your brightness is
great big applies to the position as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
