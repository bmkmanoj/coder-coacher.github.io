I'm the education director here at
Google and it's my pleasure to introduce
team Antipodes which are three high
school seniors from Pacifica high school
or high school in Pacifica terra nova
and two of which are here today to show
you about all these wonderful gadgets
and robots that you see in front of you
this is there a third time here they
visited us in 2010 when they talked
about their adventures in Istanbul where
they were competing in an international
robotics competition since then they've
won numerous awards and competitions
most recently the best robot design at
the first world championship this year
in st. Louis which is one of the most
prestigious and prominent high school
competitions in robotics so they really
covered quite a lot of ground in the
last three years so they're here to talk
about their their design their
engineering process and about how
they're for going there last year of
competition in order to mentor younger
teams and sort of hopefully have them
follow in their footsteps so team in to
face all right Thank You Maggie so I'm
sure see I'm violet and we are Team
Antipodes so we like Maggie said we just
want to talk a little bit about our
experiences as well as what lots of
other kids around the country experience
through after school robotics and then
we want to tell you about the design
process that helped us win the design
world at award at the world competitions
and then we'll have a question and
answer and we'll drive around our robot
and let you guys drive around our robot
all right so when people think about
STEM education in schools they think
that each of the subjects are treated
equally however from our experiences
science and math is covered a lot more
than technology and engineering in fact
we don't barely get any education met
technology and engineering in schools
this is where robot design comes in an
organization which is trying to fill
this gap is called first first run first
runs for different levels of student
robotics competitions junior FLL for
younger elementary
students first lego league for older
elementary school students and middle
schoolers and first tech challenge at
first robotics challenge for high
schoolers in our first year as a team we
competed in FIRST LEGO League or FLL I
wrote this is our robot that we use as
you can see here so n FLL teams compete
on a four by eight obstacle for by eight
obstacle course which changes every year
they have two minutes and 30 seconds to
complete as many tasks as possible to
get a maximum number of points keep in
mind that everything the robot is doing
is autonomous so everything it's doing
is pre-programmed because this sensors
are really vital to help navigate around
the field so every time you see the
robot backing up against the wall it's
using a touch sensor to help it see
where it is FLL isn't completely about
robots teams also have to complete a
research project about an issue in their
community we completed a research
project on mag gloves or magnetic
levitation trains we built a small
working model which you can come and
check out after the presentation we did
so well that we were able to qualify to
go to the open european championships in
istanbul one of the most amazing things
about going since competition was
finding how many similarities we had
with kids from all around the world we
spent a lot of time from a team from
assemble and it seemed like they could
have been from another kalp another high
school in California our other teammate
and I spent a few months in Tasmania
Australia with our sister team where we
competed in robocop junior in the dance
theatre division so we made a sort of
autonomous robotic puppet show while
we're down there we also commuted an FLL
again and became the Tasmanian state
champions after a year of FLL we spent
two years in FTC you can see the two
robots that we made on our first year a
rockier here and our last year's robot
right there in the front our FTC team
has three to ten high school kids and in
a match
four teams compete on a 12 x 12 field
two teams make up an alliance and an
alliance works together to score points
an interesting thing about the Alliance
system is that your partner changes with
each round so a team that you work with
one match might be your opponent in the
next in FTC we also use different
materials mainly metal and with them
those were allowed to customize them
with different power tools like what you
can see there the language that you use
to program FTC robots is called robot
see which is a variation of the C
language with some functions that are
more specific to robotics like
programming your drive motors the
engineering notebook is another required
part of FTC we the teams use it to
record some of their design process any
notes or calculations that they make and
then computer-aided design is also is
another asset that the teams have many
teams use it to design some of the more
complex parts of the robot as well as
just create models too so people can see
the robot as you can see here our robot
is pretty dense and so we created a
build up of all the different parts so
we start with the crate grabber which we
use to grab the crate that we lift up
into the air using our forklift
controlled by a winch and it's drive
motors we have to get balls into the
crepe before we lift it using the
rollers shown there which us align the
balls to be lifted up and then get
sorted before their adopt you can also
see here a lot of the different motors
and servos and sensors that go into
making the robot then finally then we
have our frame here with our drive
motors and our vertical drive system and
then our arm that we use to control a
bowling ball which is another field
element and our plastic productive sides
at the beginning of the match we have to
fit into an 18-inch sizing cube so you
can see here when we're fully extended
we don't quite fit in but when we close
ourselves up we're nice and snug and you
can see our starting position we were
also able to create an animation
using CAD so that we could show people
just what all those different parts of
our robot do so here you can see when we
pick up the crate and then lift it up a
little bit so we can drive over to the
balls and then scoop them up where they
drop into the crate and then after we
lift it up and then after that we lift
it up we got more points the higher we
lift the crate inch of the air looks
quite dramatic the next now we want to
show you some real matches so the first
30 seconds of the match are autonomous
which is pre-programmed so here you can
see where the robot on this ramp in the
back and so we're driving off and then
going to turn and get the bowling ball
an interesting note is that we use quite
a few sensors just like an FLL we use a
gyroscope sensor to make accurate churns
and then an IR secret infrared seeker to
find the beacon that's in the corner so
we can score the bowling ball in the
correct split space the next two minutes
are tella or driver controlled so the
teams are allowed to pick up their
controllers and drive around the robots
manually you can see sort of the chaos
that exists on the field during tell
optela op so that's another reason that
that CAD animation is helpful so that
people could see what's going on it's
also worthy to note the different all
the different designs of robots that
there are on the field it's rare that
there are two robots that look the same
so here we are at the front now trying
to drive up onto the ramp so that when
we left we can get some extra points
during this particular match we ran out
of time so we weren't able to lift all
the way so in our first year of doing
FTC we were able yeah with this robot
right here we able to make it to the
World Championships in st. Louis and
then our second year with this robot in
the front here we are able to make it to
the World Championships again and became
the world champions in design so in
first teams are encouraged to reach out
to their community for example we like
talking to corporations and telling them
about the importance of student robotics
we also enjoy letting kids drive around
our robot we find out alpha often in
sparks at interest in technology they're
often also stunned that they actually
can drive the robot because so many
times they are allowed to interact with
expensive machinery when our local
libraries we're having the whole
community read a book about Mars
exploration we turned this robot on the
table here into a Mars rover by
attaching your wireless web camera to it
and us other kids could drive and the
robot around from a control room where
they couldn't actually see the robot
there's also a collaborative a
collaborative spirit within first for
example we mentor a younger all girls
FLL team and teams are also encouraged
to share the knowledge that they have
gained with other teams for example when
we got started out in FTC we didn't know
what tools we should buy so we looked
online but there wasn't really any
information about it so we decided to
make a presentation about it and along
with tool specifics about tools that we
found helpful we also address safety
hazards concerned with those tools after
winning the World Design the World
Design Award in our junior year we
figured the most logical thing for us to
do in our senior is to actually
establish robotics programs that would
last beyond our graduation so I
established and coached a team at an FLL
team at our old elementary school and
she really here has established and
coached to FTC teams at our current high
school so another thing after we won the
design award at Worlds we got up we were
approached pretty frequently about how
we designed our robot and as we
described the process that we went
through we realized that that was sort
of what was unique about it that we had
a process for designing at all so we put
together a presentation so people could
see some of the steps that we went
through and since some of you might be
engineers we thought you guys might be
interested to see what we did so as you
can see there are a lot of different
steps to our designing the first of
which
have nothing to do is design there's a
couple prep steps that we want to go
through starting with building the field
that you'll be competing on so we when
we built the field we were able to get a
sense of how much room would be able to
work with as well as what kind of
obstacles will have to maneuver around
on the field at your building field next
thing we want to do was understand the
game if we didn't understand the game
rules correctly we would end up building
the wrong robot understanding dialogue
materials is also very important we are
allowed to use mainly parts from a kit
for called tetrax as well as some parts
that you can buy outside like plastics
but we also emphasize not letting
ourselves be limited by the materials
were allowed to use in the middle here
you can see a nylon sprocket and on the
sides as that same 911 sprocket with a
shape with the sides shaved off and then
we eventually created that made that
into an Archimedes screw the last step
of the preparatory things that you want
to do is to drive last year's robot on
this year's field sometimes you can find
you learn very quickly about essential
things about the game and sometimes
you'll find things that you can reuse
for example on this robot over here we
had a sort of fork that we used to
control a field element and we realized
it was really great for maneuvering the
bowling ball so just with the addition
of a few extra pieces we're able to have
our bowling ball capture now that you've
got all those prep steps done you can go
and we could go into the real design
process which starts with strategizing
before you start designing you have to
know what you want your robot to do we
found working on a whiteboard to be very
valuable so that we can get all of our
ideas out there and then use some
pictures to express our ideas to to make
sure that everyone is on the same page
after you figured out our basic strategy
it was time to research so YouTube is
great place to look for past FTC and frc
challenges and by watching these videos
we could see very quickly and strategies
that have worked in the past
those that have haven't you know someone
keep an eye out for devices that fit
your strategy for example we knew we
wanted to make a forklift using a cable
pulley system so we found this forklift
from the real world that did the same
thing we used as a reference as we went
through our design process many of the
things that you find the real world will
have manuals that show schematics and
can give you a clue as to how you may
want to design your robot after you've
researched your ideas it's time to
identify what kind of sub assemblies
you're going to be building so a sub
assembly is a group of parts that work
together to accomplish a certain
function so here you can see a couple
different ideas for different sub
assemblies that we've had a gun using
the whiteboard and you've already seen
this build up but it also shows how all
the different sepa so all the different
supplements that go into building a
robot and how they all work together to
make one cohesive robot once you figure
out what once we figured out what we
want to put inside a robot it was time
to give them some space assignments so
space planning and tips anticipates
sub-assembly conflicts allowing more
complexity and better access one mistake
that's really easy to make is to just
put sub assembly on top of sub assembly
as you think in them however this is
going to make any of these intercept
assemblies completely inaccessible and
when one of them breaks you're going to
take apart half your robot to get to
them so what you want to do is plan
ahead and make all your sub decembe lees
accessible from some point either from
an exterior access or an interior access
so here's a space planning diagram that
we had for this robot in the front here
and in this picture you can see the
different access points that we had we
had exterior exterior access points from
the app from the size and the top and
then enter your access points from the
back into the sort of cavern another you
got your space assignments I the order
of integration sort of goes hand in hand
with that you have to decide what order
you're going to install yourself
assembly
so that they don't conflict with each
other and it also creates a sort of
build schedule for the team so now that
we had the overall planning done it was
time to go dive in into developing and
building each one of the sub assemblies
so the first step in this process was
solicited requirements and the
constraints for the sub-assembly after
you know what you want yourself as
something to do it's time to brainstorm
different designs that could accomplish
that so the way we like to do it was we
would have an idea proposed and then the
whole team would kind of talk about it
critique it maybe piggyback on it and
improve the idea before it was approved
so again we like to use whiteboards a
lot to discuss this because there's some
ideas that when you try to describe them
in words the message does just just
doesn't get across and drawing can be a
much better method of communication
after you brainstorm sometimes you have
an idea what you're not quite sure if
it's going to work or not so that's
where you want to have a proof of
concept so this is an expedient mock-up
to test a concept for example we didn't
know if 2 Chainz could in fact lift a
ball up in the air so we threw together
some sprockets some chains some motors
and tested it and found that they in
fact do after you've got idea that looks
like it's going to work it's time to
identify how this sub assembly might
interact with other sub assemblies that
you have so you can see here we have
gears and a sprocket that are doing two
completely different things we're very
close proximity to each other so we put
them we mocked it up to make sure that
they weren't going to conflict when they
started working then this is an example
of several sub assemblies that work
together to accomplish a task so on the
outsides here you can see two rollers
that keep the balls aligned while these
zip ties push them towards this chain at
the end which will lift them up to later
get dumped into a crate once you have
identified the sub-assembly interactions
you want to mock up your idea so mock-up
is a crude physical arrangement of parts
oftentimes screws don't even need to be
involved here we just place some pieces
on top of each other
see if they would fit within the space
requirement and here we only built half
of the ruler for testing and next that
you have an idea that looks like it's
going to work you need to test that idea
out so here you can see the half roller
that violet was talking about without
weights put on so that we could make
sure that we're counting for weight that
will be later added on extra parts and
here you can see we're testing if the
zip tie is going to actually push the
ball along as the robot is moving after
testing it's time to optimize your idea
so optimizations which are helpful in
FTC is making something smaller stronger
more reliable redundant more accessible
and sometimes faster and this o in CAD
can be very helpful during this process
so in this picture you can see a sort of
before and after optimization over here
we have the more reliable version and
then we made our pulleys smaller and
this sort of s cut we have in the
channels here allowed the two channels
to fit into a smaller space now that you
have an optimized idea then you can
start marking out and planning the kind
of pieces that you're going to cut so
that when you do cut them they are
accurate cuts and you don't have to redo
anything so for the five steps that you
see in the gray box those are steps
there is going to be really helpful to
use CAD to help you through them so now
that you have your pieces all marked up
and ready to go you can start to cut and
machine them this is a part with this is
a part of the process that's very
helpful if you plan ahead so that if
you're making a lot of one piece you can
use mass machining techniques and you
won't waste any time doing the same
thing over and over and over again so
after you cut out all your pieces you
can assemble them and so here we got
into some more specifics that would be
more helpful to FTC teams
and the last thing you want to do once
you've got a sub-assembly put together
and you think it's ready to go you need
to test it out hopefully with another
robot you can see this robot here before
was complete was a skeleton and it just
had a few sub assemblies put on that we
wanted to test out with another robot to
see if they were actually going to work
in a competition setting so nice thing
about this process is that you're
testing intimately so it means that if
something fails somewhere along the line
you don't have to go all the way back to
the drawing board you can just go back
to the last time you know it was working
and unique thing about our process our
design process is the fact that we go
through designing and developing and
building each sub assembly one at a time
before moving on to the next one and
also as you're designing something
that's going to come into play
eventually is your wire management as
you keep adding things on eventually
you're going to get a robot that looks
like this and it's very chaotic and it's
not going to run very smoothly so with
the addition of one simple piece we used
a wire channel we were able to control
all of these along one route and have a
robot that was a lot more clean so as we
back out here you can again see the sort
of layout that we have for our design
process and at the end of the
presentation we gave we had another
version of the video that you saw
earlier except this time you can see the
gears moving within our vertical drive
system alright so if you would like to
see this presentation again or look at
some other stuff about our team feel
free to go to our website ww1 robot calm
also there we have some resources for
FTC and FLL teams and if you're all
interested in getting involved in any of
the four levels first please contact us
through our website and hopefully we can
put you in touch with someone in your
area so now we're going to do some demos
and let you guys drive around our robot
and if you have any questions please
feel free to come up and ask us and if
you want to take a closer look at the
robots please feel free to do so okay
really quickly before we do that and
just want to show you the one thing that
this robot is
the arm lifting up in the air so you can
actually see it in real life all right
sorry all right all right there yeah
alright so yeah it's all the way I
lifted up so any questions uh how many
months as well as how many hours the
competition comes out in September and
for this robot we worked on it until
about January and that's about maybe two
or two to three days a week after school
for two to three hours and then one full
weekend day at the beginning and then
towards the end it becomes pretty much
every day after school for two to three
hours and then at least maybe like 10
hours 12 hours on the weekend so I don't
we haven't really added it all up we
could we get that question a lot we
still haven't really figured it out the
beginning of the project to the finish
of the product coming the mouse it'll be
about five to six months although
competitions start in November so teams
can build the robot in like two months
and then go to some preliminary
qualifying rounds but they continue from
november until februari so you can you
can go to up to three qualifying rounds
to make it to the regional tournament
and also between every competition if
you advance you can modify your robot in
between those two competitions and yeah
so that allows you a lot of time for
example this one we got it in early
September and our the World competition
was in late April so we were working on
the robot from early September too late
April first robot so Adam when you start
building this you are already pretty
Arians yes but the challenge does change
every year so we can't like use the
robot that we had last year to base our
design off of it for most parts we had
the one bowling ball thing but most of
time you have to start completely from
scratch for the FLL project no there's
no project in FTC and after you see it's
just um one thing is like I was the
primary builder so um after I'm done
building then they start doing the
programming so while they are doing the
programming I start to work on the
project says how we allocated it yeah a
lot of times I had to do with who had
the robot there was a lot of fighting
about who could use a robot the
programmers of the builders and so
usually whoever wasn't using it could
work on the project and sometimes we do
have days where we just said that we
needed to work just on the project do
you have a question
temperatures to build in control or
or just like we've only the only one
that we really designed fully in CAD was
the forklift and our first iteration we
had a four-stage forklift while this is
a six-stage and we want when we wanted
to make everything smaller so we could
fit more stages in we built that all on
CAD so that we didn't accidentally
machine six channels that weren't the
right size or something like that but
everything else we generally do a couple
iterations while but we don't build a
robot and then take it apart and rebuild
it we make every little sub assembly
very independent of the other so that we
don't have to rebuild the entire robot
you can figure out also kind of power
requirements as a battery how much power
you need us just use their system no we
don't use the power for a CAD we're only
allowed to use one battery there's one
specific kind of battery that we're
allowed to use and we have to make sure
that that will fit fit feed all of our
power needs so for this one for example
we had to change the battery after
almost every turn after every match
because it drink there are so many
motors and it just sets so much power
out well this one it could last like
maybe two or three turn a competition or
tournaments before we had to change the
battery again how do you make sure that
the peak of power can output from the
batteries in a folder well unfortunately
rinella to change how much power we're
given we have to use a certain battery
so power we haven't really taken power
into consideration when we build our
robots just kind of build it to perform
tasks in if it has enough power it has
enough power yeah yes
she
there were complications like your
contacts computer
yes sir I situates which controls like
the controls which you want to view
yourself
battlebots I've always wanted to be in
battle bots ever since our little year
I've been saying that we should make a
flame throwing one but that has never
happened that we yeah BattleBots well
they have a lot of penalties in this so
we're prohibited from being too violent
so how'd you get started I mean y on
your income you started at the enemies
Adam interest you can we started a
useful but you can get started right in
high school no actually we got started
in high school we started in high school
but we got started with FLL which is a
younger a smaller league for younger
kids some people start when they're nine
years old and keep doing FLL until they
advance on and end up doing robots for
most of their school years but you can
start your junior senior year we're
mentoring this year so there's a bunch
of that's a couple seniors on our team
because you have such a strong
interesting in Omaha use some happen to
have a school teacher who's good at this
well it was it was because our coach
actually went to a sort of big seminar
that had a bunch of that had a robotics
team there and he got interested in so
he asked just a couple of us if we
wanted to be on our robotics team or
like sure and violet was really
interested and I just did it for kicks
and then it turned out to be really
amazing and continued with it sure no
he's just the parent of one of our
friends he's an architect see ya um good
answer that too i'm coach for my second
year here and the answer is just do it
okay megan i got three elementary school
daughters and we got them and a few
other
a Girl Scout true and we just do make a
robotics and the time commitment is
really what you make of it I mean you
guys been totally awesome ours is will
meet for three hours on the Saturday
every week for you know several months
and there's not the after school and all
that kind of stuff and again it's what
you make of it in terms of time
commitment but even that amount of time
commitment it's just amazing what the
kids come up with it both in terms of
the robots and also the product projects
the project so sorry yeah and it's just
my answers just do it I mean you if you
work at Google you're smart enough to do
it it all depends on the kind of kids it
was easy if you're at for us to meet
after school because we all went to the
same school we'd all been friends for a
long time but if you're dealing with
kids who live for our part or go to
different schools or something that can
be that can be another like scheduling
thing that you'll have to take into
consideration yeah there's this sense of
online stuff I think they mentioned lazy
log shows online Safari web sites FLL
itself has all sorts of things and
videos and and to be honest I might feel
intimidated to look at this team I you
we wear a tie in to where yeah our robot
to our kind of advancing on the high end
of it there's a lot of teams that their
first year and there to try and figure
out how to do it and they have simple
robots but I mean personally for my
experience I was coaching a FLL team at
my elementary school and we just put in
I was really busy so I didn't have that
much time to put into the team and so we
met like once a week for a few hours and
we got a robot going and even though
they didn't do the best the kids had the
best time at the tournament like they
really loved it and it really made them
excited yeah it might help for you to
describe the like requirements of an FLL
robot because you home the kids there
are not doing all that machine
me and cat stuff probably and so that
might seem a little fight for the people
who are interested in coaching a FLL
team it might be a little more
approachable well for an FLL team I mean
you can see the robot we had over here
on so one ya know machines are evolved
is just Lego the programming language is
different you use NXT G instead of the
robot C language that we showed you and
NXT G is just an icon based programming
with little blocks of different kinds of
movement that you string together to
make the robot move and kids pick up on
it very quickly it's really great for
them for the first introduction to
programming yeah so you just build it
out of Lego you can use any LEGO pieces
