find the first bad commit and this is
done by using a kind of binary search
for efficiency on the graph on the
commit graph and why is it interesting
it's because you when you find the first
bad commit you have just a few hopefully
a small number of lines of God to to
check to find the burger hopefully
instead of the full software and also
the commit gives some extra information
like the commit auto under the message
the commit message the date and sing
like that oh sorry and I will use the
linux kernel as an example because it's
a very big cut bass with many users many
different developers it has been
developed for very long time and and
well and I will talk a little bit about
the development process of the Linux
kernel so there is a two weeks long
match window where new features are
integrated and then they are 8018 suvs
our CEO is to find bugs and especially
regressions and they are one week apart
and after that there is a release and
then some other stable release and
distribution distribution maintenance on
our okay so ingham all mold now is a is
a linux kernel developer and he uses git
bisect a lot he say he uses it on
average once per day which is quite a
lot and he uses mostly
I during the match window so because the
influx of birth is the highest and this
means that you you have to find
regressions or the time not only during
better or civilized as you know and so
good tools are needed anyway and what
tools are available the regular tools to
find bugs of course but also test treats
and tools like git bisect so we will see
mostly test street and git bisect and
test street are very useful because they
prevent regressions from happening in
the first place and also because you you
are sure to have a great amount of
testability and functionality or the
time but they are not enough in some
cases for example if you find a
regression after a release then you your
test treat is not enough to find the
first but commit easily and also there
is a combinatorial explosion problem
because with the street because it's
difficult to to test everything
especially for big software that has
many different configurations and
because you can see that the if you have
big n configurations big n tests and big
big c new commit then you have to
perform a really big amount of tests for
if you really want to test everything so
we saw that test suite needs a tool to
efficient cliff and the fatback commit
and the strategy to fight combinatorial
x
version but but now let's see how git
bisect is used so there are basically
two ways to to start it and bound it to
bisect on a smaller part of the graph so
you can do it in three steps like like
this or just in one step like this here
you just say git bisect start and then
you give a bad commit and some good
comments and for example with it's a
Tory example with the Linux kernel you
can start it like that and so you give
the kid basic start than the bad commit
and the good commit and it says that
there are working 14 steps after this
one and it check out who commits that
you have to test and so if you do it
manually you you test by yourself so the
software that the this the source code
that has been checked out and then you
tell git bisect Weser what does the
commit that has been checked out is good
or bad for example if it's bad then you
use get basic bad and then you have
searching steps left and this is the
next commit that will be tested and so
you start again to test and tell git
bisect and in the end hopefully you find
the first bad commit this one and it
gives you some information about this
commit so you have the auto date commit
message and the files so after that
you can use the the first but commit as
you want and then to reset by section
you use git bisect with it so this was a
manual process because H at each step
you have to manually build and test your
your software but there is a way to to
tell git bisect that it can run become a
common or script called the run script
to that will tell git bisect if the
current commit is good or bad so for
example if you want to bisect a broken
build you just have to use git bisect oh
and make a few if make is a bill common
and for the previous example so we start
like previously and then we say give
bisexual so this is a toy example here
we just try to find suburb of L equal 25
in the make file so it runs the command
you passed it then it check out the to
commit to test it runs a common to test
the commit and so on automatically so
and in the end you hear you find the
first that commits like privacy and it's
say it was a success so how does git
bisect knows if the git bisect one knows
if it's good or bad it's using the the
exit code of the run script so 0 means
good from 1 to 127 it means bad except
for 120 25 which means keep and after 12
h 28 it means
stop so skip marks who commit as
untestable and this means that git
bisect has to choose another commit to
be tested and stop stop cyber sings so
few words about untestable commits so in
if you manually beast bisect then and
you and you have to test a comet that
you cannot test for example if it
doesn't build then you have to use
either something to show you the graph
and to let you pick the commit you want
to test by yourself oh you can say git
bisect skip which is the same thing as
when the one script exit with 125 but
anyway what can happen is that sometimes
you're you're currently good and
currently bad commit our separated only
by untestable comets and this means we
that git bisect will exit with something
like this telling you that it cannot be
basic more because of untestable commit
ok so a few words about git bisect log
to save a basic clog and git bisect we
play to repay it and we are finished
with git bisect commands so then the the
bisection algorithm is used to find the
best bisection commit so it's a truly
stupid algorithm according to Linnaeus
toe hurts but it who created it but it
works very well and it's not simple
symmetric because it chooses only one
current bad commit and many good
comments and there are tools to
bounds a graph at each step so first you
have to remove all the commits that
don't have the bad commit as an ancestor
and then you have to remove all the
ancestor of the good commits and this
has some pitfalls because sometimes you
have you have so these are the commits
that are removed because they are not
ancestors that commit and these are the
commits that are removed because our
ancestor of the good commit but you can
see here that XY and z are not removed
and so it can be quite surprising
because sometimes here you will have for
example version 6 and here version 7 and
here you will have version 5 because
version 6 was created here and so it can
be can be surprising but it's quite
natural if you think about it and a few
words about the skip algorithm sometimes
the there are big areas with untestable
commits and you have to be careful not
to try to test in these areas all the
time because otherwise it will be not
efficient that also we use episode 01
damn number generator but we favor
commit any other best bisection commit
and there is another interesting case
where you know that a branch called main
is good and a branch called dave is bad
for example there you cannot apply the
bisection algorithm as it is
because otherwise you will remove all
these comets and so you will bisect on
this but what can happen is that the
burgh may have been fixed in the main
branch already and in this case if you
remove all these comets you if I see as
a first bad commit and this is wrong
because it's a is the first button so
what you have to do is you have to in
this case when the when so good when
some good commits are not on the start
of the bad commit you have to test the
merge by basis and if the merge basis is
bad well the bisection I will we stop
with a message like this because you you
cannot well here if you want you could
try to find so the fix between the bad
and the good but it's better to ask the
user what he wants to do so here let's
see a few tips you can use with git
bisect run so we saw that you can easily
basic broken build can easily by said
taste to it if you pass it the command
that run your test suite but it's more
efficient if you just can use one test
not the full test suite as at each step
and you can have some one line nose like
this one for example where you won't
make and if it fails you just exit with
125 to mean to say that you cannot test
and you have to skip the current commit
and afterwards if if you make if make
succeeds then you
can this with something like this for
example and you can basic performance
regressions with a script like this one
so you run the your application in the
background with the ampersand you get XP
ID you sleep for the normal time and
after this time the application should
have finished so it should not exist
anymore and if it exists it's bad and so
you exit with one and also why you exist
with you and it was there was a there
has been it has been taken from a real
world example it's not just made up so
again a few words from ingram mall now
and so he says he has a fully automated
by section script based on gay bisexual
and he uses it automatically free
automatically each were it builds and
then boot up a new karner fully
automatically so now let's see how you
can integrate git bisect with other
practices and first let's talk about
general best practices that are of
course small commit no commits that
break things and the good commit message
and things like that oh you of course
git bisect will be much more useful if
you you have a committee story like that
and also Maja's should be taken care
because they are quite work phone by
themselves and there are much more but
when they are not done correctly that
when that is when they're there is a lot
of god that is changed under by the
match commit so but anyways are there
are ways to to get around this problem
well you can use git rebase or you can
use short branches which is quite easy
with get or topic branches and
integration branches where you prepare
matches on a new test so now let's see
how you can fight combinatorial
explosion with git bisect so well if you
we saw that so sometimes there is a
really big number of configuration so
what people do is that they don't test
each commit on all the configurations
they just choose a few number of
configurations and this means a number
like that and what you can do too is
that you test with your test suite only
not on also commits but only on a few
number of them for example you can test
every two weeks or every are at beta
release and things like that and so this
means that you will add this number
which is not to begin and then when you
find a bug on all the configurations or
at least on many more configuration then
you can you can bisect and it gives a
small number two so with this this way
you can do as if you as if you tested
for all the configurations also commit
and so you can find more bugs more
efficiently so this means that test
Suites make it easy to bisect because
it's easy to write a new test case if
you already have many and as I make it
maintains testability so it also make by
something easier and more efficient and
git bisect in turn makes it works while
to develop new test cases and to help
overcome combinatorial explosion so we
can see that we have a virtuous cycle
and so if you don't use both get bisect
and dead streets I think huge have some
questions that you can ask yourself so
but what is more interesting is when you
can adapt your workflow and so you just
write a new test in your test suite when
you you have a new bug on your
regression you use git bisect run with
this new test case and you fix the bug
and commit both the fix and the test
script so andreas a week sun reported
some really good reason wizard by using
git and adopting this workflow and so
what you have to do is you want a good
workflow is to use general back best
practices and take advantage of the
virtuous cycle whistle and what is
interesting too is that git bisect you
can be used not only by developers it
can be used by QA people or end-user if
they have access to the to the source
code so it can be very interesting too
it what is interesting is that you don't
have in this case you don't have to
replicate the oven one month whereas the
bug happens if the user or the QE II I
can you can bisect because it will
automatically extract some information
and you can plug in other tools to like
sending emails when we're to the peep to
the guy who committed the bad commit or
are integrated with other tools like
bugzilla and so on and there is a good
builder tool that automatically build
test and bisect all the branches you
stand it all other branches that develop
our create on their own machine they can
send it to above a buffer repository
using git builder and it will be
automatically bisected if their problems
and this buffer can be used by
integration people to decide if they
want to to integrate bunches that have
been created so as I was also get
replaced that can make your your
committee story much more testable and
bisect able because in case of
untestable areas while you one good way
to work around them is to create fixed
up branches where you walk around the
the breakage and then you bisect on them
but as you can see this branches is not
connected to the rest of the graph so
this can be a problem if you have to
bisect again in the same area and so
what you can do is is that you can use
get replace
to to tell 22 in fact make the rest of
the graph connected to your new fixed up
branch and so it's quite new but it can
be interesting if you want to improve
the bisect ability of your own you are a
story so git bisect does not work really
well on sporadic bugs but there are some
experimental projects like BB job and
some ideas around that I was too lazy to
implement so and a few statistics about
git bisect usage so it you can see that
there are user surveys each year about
how people use git and you can see that
eighty percent of the nearly now 9000
people who once of the survey says they
use git bisect and in last year it was
even nearly fifty percent and the year
before 26 so we can see that many many
get user our well about git bisect but
the problem is that may they don't use
it really often so it can be because
they they don't find it necessary to use
it often archaea it can mean that they
have not already integrated it in their
workflow they use it when they when they
find sometimes when they find it cool to
to try and so we saw that it bisect can
work really well with the streets and
general best practices and that it can
be washed too
use a special workflow and also that it
already works very well and is used a
lot and very useful and for this last
point I will again quote angle more now
who said that it saves him a really lot
of time and before get bisect well he
spent days to sort out patches to do
some kind of bisection by hand and we'll
git bisect it's only 20 to 30 minutes in
the best case completely automated so he
has nothing two to do once it has
launches launched it and so so he says
that it's invaluable because there were
some bugs you didn't even try to debug
and so he say it's unconditional
goodness so i have to thank many people
especially junior manual in golmaal now
in use and many other people in the get
and Linux community and also gtech
organizer attendance and if an all of
you for listening to me do you have
questions
up yes and
okay so if you for some silly reason
would have really big changes is there
some way to kind of back fit and retro
but split up a change in smaller pieces
you can add more advantage of this thing
yes of course if you if you find the
first bad commit and you find that it
it's too big to be interested you you
can just create a branch like in the
untestable kasem you you can just create
a new branch where you split the
committee in too many comets and then
you bisect on this new bunch so it's no
problem so it I don't hear you each each
manual he's asking yes it's manual but
splitting commits where cannot be easily
done automatically you know because
there is a raja can so you you have to
take care about your history but once
you have done that well you can use get
replace if you want so next time you
won't have to do that if this commit
really was a big problem then next time
it won't be a big power
any other questions
just a thought I mean I would like to
kind of clarify is so what we do is that
when we have to kind of do this kind of
analytics to find out which commits
create a problem so so essentially in
the test test harness and test framework
so every test has a metadata every test
execution run has a as its own metadata
and every runs report has its own
metadata so if we can what we do is if
we kind of meta tag all these three
attributes and we maintain that bitter
if I come if I test fails then we did
not kind of run the every tests again
instead we start back putting through
this metadata and see which commits
failed so is this a lighter way of doing
things rather than running the exact
test again so I cygnets understand very
well you was what kind of ferrara me is
it wait so wait so wait the question is
that to find to reach the exact commit
which introduced the regression yes do
you actually run tests yes yes of course
that's what I was trying to ask is can
we reach there without running tests if
we maintain a good metadata on the test
execution runs and test itself no you
have to run tests but you can when only
is a test case that you are interested
in at each step and you know even when
the very big number of commits as it's a
kind of binner research it's it it's
quite fast because you you have you have
to test only or something like 15
commits honor on the Linux scanner which
is not a lot because they are really a
lot now or rat of commits much more than
than 15 men
okay thank you very much again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
