am a senior test engineer extraordinaire
here at Google and I'm going to take 15
minutes free time to talk about the
quirkier side of testing a quick fun
fact about me I'm an identical twin so
if you want to come talk to me later
memorize the shirt i'm wearing what is
the quark so a quark is an odd trait or
behavior so there we go so here are some
examples so so cats that have two
different colored eyes because of a
genetic mutation some some people sort
of build careers out of out of being
quirky this slide you see before you are
actually in themselves quirky because
one of them is actually a cork not a
quick a programming languages of course
have quirks and that's what we're going
to mostly talk about today what are a
few examples objective-c has anyone
coated in ejecta see before quicktime
Anza quite a few of you did you know
that there is a property called HM
characteristic value lock mechanism last
known action unsecured using physical
movement exterior this objective c is
very verbose it's very quirky this is
eighty seven characters of greatness
there's also an interior in case anyone
was curious javascript is everyone sort
of favorite language to pecan so of
course we'll do that so null eagles
eagles undefined does it it turns out
yes null is in fact undefined makes
sense is no finite it turns out that yes
no Liz of course finite is undefined
finite no because of course that they're
equal but they're not the same so that's
another sort of quark you see see quite
a bit enough to end languages that's why
a lot of languages sort of introduce the
triple equals operator that say that's
not just equal in value but also in type
as well so now an undefined are the same
value in quotes but not the same type
JavaScript fun so we'll keep going which
is larger three or zero hands up if you
think it's zero the answers 3 make sense
but what's greater 3 or true 3 is always
greater than the truth remember that
what's larger negative one or an array
of one an array of one because in
JavaScript the value of an array is the
value of the first element make sense we
can keep going all day of course what's
larger negative one or the empty set
zero we all saw that coming what's
greater negative 1 or undefined not a
number another number is greater than
that doesn't even make sense which is
largely negative one or null turns out
the answer is zero one thing you'll
notice is null is pretty much zero for
all intensive purposes so if you take a
value take nolan add one to it the
answer you get is one great so some
quirks are found in many languages
here's an example in Java so if I were
to say print my name but with a nice
fancy be on top and then I get fancy and
I'm going to make it all upper case it
turns out what that actually does is
that not only changes the value of this
room but changes the length of the
string so a little tidbit there when
you're doing testing you always be
careful about changing case when you're
using Unicode characters the too often
don't mix FYI some quirks are specific
and their last was lights some quirks
are specific to languages
and we'll pause here
does that for I will pause to take a
drink there we go as always saying none
of that just happened some quirks are
specific to a specific language so
here's an example in Java as well so if
I were to write a increment post
increment operator is the new a post
increment operator the answer of course
is 0 is the new one because it takes a
prince it then increments it takes a
prince it then incremented so zeros new
1a is now to make sense if you do the
exact same thing in C++ 0 was new one no
one is the new 0 that's weird it sits in
if you of course here's the C equivalent
it does the same thing so any sort of
see very intent that's something weird
that's not the same as Java why is this
so it all that has to do with secret
points so sequence points are defined
and see it's a point in time at which
side effects have been guaranteed so far
to be complete and they vary from
language to language as you can see jab
and C C++ are different because of
sequence points see also defines that
between the previous and next weekend's
point and object shall have stored value
modified at most once so as you saw we
modified it once then we try to modify
it again it had no effect because of
sequence points so again our example 1
is the new 0 because a was incremented
once and you can't increment it twice in
the same between to sikkre points so
that's why that works in fact if you
increment be a whole bunch of times it
will never actually increment because
this is equivalence plus it's actually
not valid in C or C++ because what
you're essentially saying is B equals B
then we increment it but it's not a site
again these are all sort of very
in-depth about the post increment
operator the pre pre increment operator
does work as expected because of course
it increments then does the assignment
wonderful but this is the interactive
port portion of the talk so I hope
you're all not too full from lunch so
finding the quark is all the fine so I'm
going to throw some examples at you and
I'm going to see if you can get
what the quark is so can anyone tell me
what this does and guess returns one I
heard well it returns 1 2 3 or doesn't
compile those your options it turns out
that that has to do with a comma
operator so in many languages the comma
operator basically says always evaluate
the real ft inside then always evaluate
the right-hand side no matter what and
of course as opposed to the end operator
which does one of the other and/or as
well not every comment is an operator
but you may have seen this before for
example in four loops when you've seen
this sort of syntax so in this case it
returns the value three because it
evaluates one value it's too and then
the returns three because the results of
the expression is three didn't don't
know what this does he returns three
which makes sense because just because I
threw in some practice and they're right
doesn't mean I fool you right does
anybody know what this does this of
course also returns three you're
starting to see the pattern here because
the the valiant expression is the
expression so does anyone know what this
does that's a syntax error that does
nothing can we give me a value for I
that makes this statement true what
value is equal to its own negative zero
i heard zero very well done do not not
every quirk is a trick and all these
languages zero works but is there a
value for I that's not zero that is also
true sorry was there a guess not a
number close min integer dot min value
that's a little weird why is that if you
remember their most languages that tree
integers as a 32-bit number the the
range is negative 2 31 to positive 2
31-0 so there's actually one more
positive negative number then there is
positive numbers so if you take for
example a negative number which is you
know eight with a bunch of eight sign
bit which a bunch of zeros and then you
negate that that's equivalent to saying
take the integer max value add one to it
and it turns out exact same value so I'm
sorry short integers don't mean value is
its own negation fancy check always be
careful we're especially when you're
dealing with rollover situations catch
every time is there any value that's
equal to
it's self plus one hey sorry any kisses
infinity that's a great guess and it
turns out it's right this is implemented
so any language influenced the 75 for
floating-point spec defines and infinity
value so of course infinity plus one is
just infinity make sense does anybody
know a value for I that is not equal to
itself is this even possible it is
possible someone says what value not a
number that's an excellent guess turns
out it's correct again 752 floating
points back there's a lot of detail in
there but the key is and there is no it
tsu'tey the spec defines not a number to
be equal to nothing not even itself no
matter what can anyone tell me what this
does so here's here here's a quick show
of hands has anybody seen the approaches
operator before in any language that's
because it doesn't exist of course so
the trick to this is most people are
probably thinking the first line you've
got it so it's it's equivalent to saying
5 minus negative negative negative
negative negative 6 which is course the
value 11 the I the approaches operators
actually equivalent to i minus a minus
is greater than 1 the trick here is that
and of course never do this is that the
it doesn't matter how you write and how
spacing works as long as it's possible
so as long as the compiler can parse
through what you're doing it treats it
as valid yeah oh there was one quick
thing I forgot to mention so if we back
up a few steps because I have time there
was one of these tricks that you notice
here there's javascript and PHP this
trick doesn't work does anybody know why
first of all anybody see that first time
around nobody called me on it that's
good the reason this is is because some
languages like JavaScript MHP treat all
numbers as floating point numbers no
matter what
and the floating-point spec says that
there is a negative zero and a positive
0 then the therefore the range of
numbers is even on both sides this trick
doesn't actually work in those languages
so quick digression there so as we head
to our last slide so what did this all
right what did this do so we said
basically says 11 as it approaches 1
this essentially prints ten nine eight
seven six five four three two one time
for the next presentation thank you very
much for listening
excellent thank you Brian Brian proving
that there is absolutely no limit in
talks you can create about the
intricacies and nuances of JavaScript
yes if I had to say this presentation is
immoral it's that even when you're
writing test automation or tests you can
fall into these traps as well so be very
aware of them so and I don't think we
have any questions on the list so if
anybody has a question in the room I
guess my only question would be is why
would anyone still use JavaScript it's
getting better so I hear any any
questions I think you've all stunt this
thank you very much for integers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
